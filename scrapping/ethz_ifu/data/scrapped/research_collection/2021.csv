Physical-chemical characterization includes mechanical characterization of different mixing ratios, oil contact angles, and equilibrium water contents, self-polishing properties and copper ion release of copper alginate and copper-calcium alginate compositions. The results prove highly composition dependent physical–chemical properties. This causes highly composition dependent antibiofouling properties against Chlorella vulgaris, which changes significantly over time due to copper ion release and self-polishing resulting into up to 100 times lower biofouling compared to glass slides.

Greater concentrations of polysaccharides and proteins were accumulated in the biofouling layer, when provided with initial biopolymers, and the biofilm structure was more heterogeneous with larger pore size and higher thickness. Thereby, the corresponding filtration system exhibited greater permeability and better removal performance of organics.

Under visible light, surface plasmons excited in the negatively-charged Ru nanoparticles decay into hot electrons, triggering spontaneous O2 dissociation to reactive atomic •O. Acceptor-like oxygen vacancies confined at the Ru-TiO2 interface free Ru from oxygen-poisoning by kinetically boosting the spillover of •O from Ru to TiO2. Evidenced by an exclusive isotopic O-transfer from 18O2 to oxygenated products, •O displays a synergistic action with native •O2– on TiO2 that oxidizes toluene and related alkyl aromatics to aromatic acids with extremely high selectivity. We believe the intelligent catalyst design for desirable O2 activation will contribute viable routes for synthesizing industrially important organic compounds.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000514602",,"2041-6520||2041-6539",,"10.1039/d1sc04632b","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/514602","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","O2 dissociation||Photocatalysis||C-H bond activation||Oxygen spillover||Selectivity","Plasmonic O2 Dissociation and Spillover Expedite Selective Oxidation of Primary C–H Bonds",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-10T07:12:57Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85120733287",,"000718853000001","Chem.

Nevertheless, studies on climate change impacts typically examine the changes in flow statistics only at the catchment outlet. In this study, we instead demonstrate the high variability of the hydrological response to climate change at the sub-catchment scale, investigating in detail the contribution of all components of the hydrological cycle in two mountainous catchments (Thur and Kleine Emme) in the Swiss Alps. The analysis was conducted with a two-dimensional weather generator model that simulated gridded climate variables at an hourly and 2-km resolution until the end of the 21st century for the RCP8.5 emission scenario. The climate ensemble was used as input into a distributed hydrological model to estimate the changes in hydrological processes at 100-m and hourly resolutions. Climate models show that precipitation intensifies during winter but weakens during summer in the order of ± 5–10% toward the end of the century. Temperature will rise by up to 4°C, leading to a 50% reduction in snowmelt, 10% increase in evapotranspiration, and shift in precipitation type from snowfall to rainfall. As a result, streamflow is projected to increase by 40% in winter but decrease by 20% to 40% during summer, with winter floods becoming more frequent. The changes to streamflow (mean and extreme low and high flows) at the sub-catchments show a strong dependency with elevation. In contrast to the small changes projected at the outlet of the catchments, streamflow shows a reduction at higher elevations (up to −20% change in mean streamflow for sub-catchments at elevations exceeding 1400 m) and an increase at lower elevations (up to +5% for Kleine Emme and +20% for the Thur at elevations below 600 m). These impacts are tied to the changes in precipitation, as well as changes in snowmelt (at high elevation) and evapotranspiration (at low elevation). The results reveal the causes and diversity of hydrological response to climate change, emphasizing the importance of investigating the distributed impacts of climate change in mountainous environments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504204",,"0022-1694||1879-2707",,"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126806","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504204","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Catchment modelling||Climate change impacts||Weather generator||Distributed hydrological modeling||Streamflow extremes||Hydrological response","Revealing the impacts of climate change on mountainous catchments through high-resolution modelling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-06T02:56:51Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113722975",,"000706313000010","J.

For example, utilizing data from sensors in sewer systems can improve their management, which in turn may result in better surface water quality. Whether such big data from sensors is utilized is, however, not only a technical issue, but also depends on different types of social and institutional conditions. Our article identifies individual, organizational, and institutional barriers at the level of sub-states that hinder the evaluation of data from sewer systems. We employ fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to compare 23 Swiss sub-states and find that two barriers at different levels can each hinder data evaluation on their own. More specifically, either a lack of vision at the individual level or a lack of resources at the organizational level hinder the evaluation of data. Findings suggest that taking into account different levels is crucial for understanding digital transformation in public organizations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515032",,"0032-2687||1573-0891",,"10.1007/s11077-021-09438-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515032","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Digital transformation||Data utilization||Infrastructure||Wastewater||Switzerland||QCA","Barriers to the digital transformation of infrastructure sectors",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-13T07:56:53Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85118474230",,"000714289500001","Policy Sci","4","Policy Sciences","54","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, the physiological events in the pathogens that follow their entry into the coral host environment remain unknown. Here, we present simultaneous measurements of the behavioral and transcriptional responses of V. coralliilyticus BAA-450 incubated in coral mucus. Video microscopy revealed a strong and rapid chemokinetic behavioral response by the pathogen, characterized by a two-fold increase in average swimming speed within 6 min of coral mucus exposure. RNA sequencing showed that this bacterial behavior was accompanied by an equally rapid differential expression of 53% of the genes in the V. coralliilyticus genome. Specifically, transcript abundance 10 min after mucus exposure showed upregulation of genes involved in quorum sensing, biofilm formation, and nutrient metabolism, and downregulation of flagella synthesis and chemotaxis genes. After 60 min, we observed upregulation of genes associated with virulence, including zinc metalloproteases responsible for causing coral tissue damage and algal symbiont photoinactivation, and secretion systems that may export toxins. Together, our results suggest that V. coralliilyticus employs a suite of behavioral and transcriptional responses to rapidly shift into a distinct infection mode within minutes of exposure to the coral microenvironment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493461",,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-021-01024-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493461","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bacterial pathogenesis||marine microbiology||microbial ecology","Coral mucus rapidly induces chemokinesis and genome-wide transcriptional shifts toward early pathogenesis in a bacterial coral pathogen",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-08T02:54:45Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85108614351",,"000665727600001","ISME J","12","The ISME Journal","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

To investigate the effects of rapid nutrient fluctuations on bacterial growth, we couple custom microfluidics with single-cell microscopy to quantify the growth rate of E. coli experiencing 30 s to 60 min nutrient fluctuations. Compared to steady environments of equal average concentration, fluctuating environments reduce growth rate by up to 50%. However, measured reductions in growth rate are only 38% of the growth loss predicted from single nutrient shifts. This enhancement derives from the distinct growth response of cells grown in environments that fluctuate rather than shift once. We report an unexpected physiology adapted for growth in nutrient fluctuations and implicate nutrient timescale as a critical environmental parameter beyond nutrient identity and concentration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000491293",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-021-23439-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491293","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A distinct growth physiology enhances bacterial growth under rapid nutrient fluctuations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-25T03:09:30Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The effect of high-frequency nutrient fluctuations on bacterial growth","176189","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85108178725",,"000664863000005","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Wastewater treatment is an important, yet likely underestimated, source of N2O emissions, as recent, long-term monitoring campaigns have demonstrated. However, the available data are insufficient to representatively estimate countrywide emission due to the brevity of most monitoring campaigns. This study showed that the emission estimates can be significantly improved using an advanced approach based on multiple continuous, long-term monitoring campaigns. In monitoring studies on 14 full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), we found a strong variability in the yearly emission factors (EFs) (0.1 to 8% of the incoming nitrogen load) which exhibited a good correlation with effluent nitrite. But countrywide data on nitrite effluent concentrations is very limited and unavailable for emission estimation in many countries. Hence, we propose a countrywide emission factor calculated from the weighted EFs of three WWTP categories (carbon removal, EF: 0.1–8%, nitrification only: 1.8%, and full nitrogen removal: 0.9%). However, EF of carbon removal WWTPs are still highly uncertain given the expected variability in performance.  The newly developed approach allows representative, country-specific estimations of the N2O emissions from WWTP. Applied to Switzerland, the estimations result in an average EF of 0.9 to 3.6% and total emissions of 410 to 1690 tN2O-N/year, which corresponds to 0.3–1.4% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in Switzerland. Our results demonstrate that better data availability and an improved understanding of long-term monitoring campaigns is crucial to improve current emission estimations. Finally, our results confirm several measures to mitigate N2O emissions from wastewater treatment; year-round denitrification, limiting nitrite accumulation, and stringent control of sludge age in carbon removal plants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519225",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2021.100122","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519225","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Estimation of countrywide N2O emissions from wastewater treatment in Switzerland using long-term monitoring data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-07T09:33:03Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85122806649",,"000709478700002",,,"Water Research X","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In this broad review, we present literature from more than a decade on biological, physical-chemical and electrochemical urine treatment processes. Like in the first review on urine treatment from 2006, we categorize the technologies according to the following objectives: stabilization, volume reduction, targeted N-recovery, targeted P-recovery, nutrient removal, sanitization, and handling of organic micropollutants. We add energy recovery as a new objective, because extensive work has been done on electrochemical energy harvesting, especially with bio-electrochemical systems. Our review reveals that biological processes are a good choice for urine stabilization. They have the advantage of little demand for chemicals and energy. Due to instabilities, however, they are not suited for bathroom applications and they cannot provide the desired volume reduction on their own. A number of physical-chemical treatment technologies are applicable at bathroom scale and can provide the necessary volume reduction, but only with a steady supply of chemicals and often with high demand for energy and maintenance. Electrochemical processes is a recent, but rapidly growing field, which could give rise to exciting technologies at bathroom scale, although energy production might only be interesting for niche applications. The review includes a qualitative assessment of all unit processes. A quantitative comparison of treatment performance was not the goal of the study and could anyway only be done for complete treatment trains. An important next step in urine technology research and development will be the combination of unit processes to set up and test robust treatment trains. We hope that the present review will help guide these efforts to accelerate the development towards a mature technology with pilot scale and eventually full-scale implementations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519224",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2021.100114","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519224","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nitrogen Recovery||Phosphorus recovery||Pharmaceutical Removal||Environmental Protection||Volume Reduction||Energy production","State of the art of urine treatment technologies: A critical review",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-07T09:33:03Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85121874443",,"000709478700001",,,"Water Research X","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Vor allem in Gebieten mit starker Hangneigung (Winkel: 15-30°) ist eine Zunahme von Steinschlägen, Felsstürzen, Murgänge oder Hangrutschungen zu erwarten. Seit einigen Jahren kommen zur flächenhaften Kartierung dieser Ereignisse sowie zur Dispositionswarnung zunehmend auch satellitengestützte Verfahren der SAR Interferometrie (InSAR) zum Einsatz. Einschränkungen in deren Anwendungsbereich ergeben sich hauptsächlich durch eine temporale Dekorrelation der SAR Aufnahmen - verursacht durch zeitliche Änderungen der Rückstreuungseigenschaften der Erdoberfläche sowie durch die spezielle Schrägsicht-Aufnahmegeometrie. Zudem wird in der interferometrischen Phase das Deformationssignal von atmosphärischen Phaseneffekten überlagert, insbesondere von räumlichen und zeitlichen Änderungen der Wasserdampfverteilung in der Troposphäre. Diese erschweren die Bestimmung der interferometrischen Phasenmehrdeutigkeiten (phase unwrapping) in starker Topographie und die Trennung des Deformationssignals im Allgemeinen. Für die Validierung der mittels InSAR bestimmten Bewegungsfelder durch unabhängige Verfahren sowie für die Weiterentwicklung von Ansätzen zur Detektion von kritischen Bodenbewegungen im alpinen Raum wurde im Sommer 2021 im Kanton Wallis/Schweiz ein alpines Messlabor eingerichtet. Das Untersuchungsgebiet im Mattertal (Breithorn/Längenschnee/Gugla) hat eine Ausdehnung von 1.5 km in Nord-Südrichtung und erstreckt sich über einen Höhenbereich von 2500 - 3200 m, mit einer durchschnittlichen Hangneigung von 30°. Oberflächenveränderungen im Gebiet werden zweimal jährlich mittels Terrestrischem Laserscanning von der gegenüberliegenden Talseite aus erfasst. Zusätzlich wurden im August 2021 die im Rahmen des XSense-Projekts errichteten GPS Stationen im Gebiet Breithorn/Längenschnee durch fünf weitere multi-GNSS-Stationen und drei Radar-Reflektoren ergänzt. Die speziell für die Anwendung im alpinen Gebiet entwickelten GNSS-Stationen besitzen nicht nur eine autonome Stromversorgung, sondern ermöglichen die Übertragung der GNSS-Beobachtungen für das Monitoring von Stationsbewegungen und des Zustands der Atmosphäre in Nahe-Echtzeit.

Dies umfasst die zum Einsatz kommenden Verfahren als auch eine erste Analyse der im Sommer/Herbst 2021 gewonnenen Messdaten.

As special locations where both antibiotics and ARGs are directly used, biology laboratories are poorly studied but potential important emission sources where not only the environmental stress is strong but also obtaining resistance is much easier comparing to other well studied hot spots including farms, hospitals, wastewater treatment plants and landfills where antibiotics but not ARGs are used or discharged. Therefore, in this study, 11 Swiss biology laboratories working on different fields and located in the city center, suburb and rural area were studied to reveal the abundance and diversity of airborne ARGs in them and their surrounding areas with Colony-forming units (CFU) cultivation and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). Most biology laboratories did not discharge significant amounts or varieties of ARGs and cultivable bacteria via air. No correlation was found between the number of CFUs and the abundance of 16S rRNA, but two clusters of correlated airborne ARGs, the animal husbandry related cluster, and city and hospital related cluster were identified in this study. Although most biology laboratories may not be the emission sources of a wide variety of airborne ARGs, the ARGs in the animal husbandry related cluster which are abundant in the animal laboratories and aadA1 which is abundant in the laboratories working on other eukaryocytes need to be furtherly studied to make sure if they are potential health risks for the researchers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000499567",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149147","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499567","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bioaerosol||Antibiotic resistance gene (ARG)||Biology lab","Abundance and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes possibly released to ambient air by experiments in biology laboratories",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-05T03:15:58Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Emission quantification, transport modelling and risk evaluation of airborne antibiotic resistance genes from key sources in Zürich and Beijing","189880","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Sino-Swiss Science and Technology Cooperation (SSSTC)",,,"85111048424",,"000704390200015","Sci.

However, access to handwashing facilities is limited in cities in the Global South, where rapid urbanisation, service backlogs, lack of infrastructure and capacity, and water scarcity impact on the ability of local governments to provide them. Community participation and the co-production of knowledge in the development of innovative technologies, which are aligned with Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) principles, can lead to more sustainable and socially-acceptable hand hygiene systems. This paper presents the outcomes of the testing of the Autarky handwashing station, a technology that provides onsite treatment and recycling of handwashing water, in an informal settlement in Durban, South Africa. The transdisciplinary research approach adopted enabled the participation of multiple stakeholders with different knowledge systems in the framing, testing and evaluation of the system. The process of co-producing knowledge, as well as the outcomes of the testing, namely high levels of functionality and social acceptability of the technology, supported the WASH principles. The evaluation revealed that the Autarky handwashing station is a niche intervention that improved access to safe and appealing handwashing facilities in an informal settlement. Its novel design, socially desirable features, reliability and ability to save water increased its acceptance in the community. The testing of the system in a real-world context revealed the value of including communities in knowledge production processes for technology innovation. Further work is required to ensure that real-time monitoring of system function is feasible before such systems can be implemented at larger scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000499568",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149024","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499568","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","community participation||Hand hygiene||WASH||Technology field test||Water recycling||Transdisciplinary research","Innovation for improved hand hygiene: Field testing the Autarky handwashing station in collaboration with informal settlement residents in Durban, South Africa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-05T03:15:58Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85110534316",,"000697054000010","Sci.

However, in municipal wastewater (MWW) anammox system are often unstable due to process control disturbance, influent variability, or unwanted nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB). This study examines the anammox system by focusing on anammox activity and its robustness in a mainstream environment. An 8 m3 pilot-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) receiving pretreated MWW (with external nitrite addition) was seeded with pre-colonized carriers. Within six months at 12–20 °C an anammox activity of 200 gN·m−3·d−1 was achieved. After the startup an anammox activity of 260 ± 83 gN·m−3·d−1 was maintained over 450 days. The robustness of the anammox activity was analyzed through three disturbance experiments. Anammox biofilm on carriers were exposed to dissolved oxygen (DO = 1.6 mg·L−1, intermittent aeration), organic loading rate (OLR, C/N increased from 2:1 to 5:1) and temperature disturbances (20 °C to 12 °C) in triplicate 12 L bench scale reactors. The anammox activity and microbial community was monitored during these disturbances. The DO and OLR disturbance experiments were replicated at pilot scale to investigate upscaling effects. Bench and pilot scale anammox activity were unaffected by the DO disturbance. Similarly, an increase in OLR did not deteriorate the bench and pilot scale anammox activity, if nitrate was available. When, at bench scale, the reactor temperature was reduced from 20 °C to 12 °C overnight, anammox activity decreased significantly, this was not the case for the slow seasonal temperature changes (12–25 °C) at pilot scale where no strong temperature dependency was detected in winter. Metagenomic analysis revealed a broad range of Brocadiaceae species with no single dominant anammox species. Anammox thrive under mainstream conditions and can withstand typical process disruptions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000498287",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148920","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/498287","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Mainstream anammox||Anammox activity||Robustness||Disturbance||Pilot","Robustness of mainstream anammox activity at bench and pilot scale",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-29T03:31:42Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85110463056",,"000698511000008","Sci.

We evaluated the dynamics of temporal rainfall attributes – the strength of seasonality, the date of onset, cessation, and duration of the rainy season – over RFA areas across Ethiopia for the period 1981-2010 and explored their impacts on cereal crop production (including maize, teff, sorghum, wheat, barley, millet, oats and rice) between 1995 and 2010. First, we quantified the rainfall seasonality using an entropy-based seasonality index, defined the onset and cessation dates of rainy seasons, computed the rainy season duration, and analyzed their interannual variability and trends. Second, we correlated de-trended total cereal production during the Meher (i.e., long rainy) season (April to September) with the anomalies of the temporal rainfall attributes, and we used a univariate linear regression model to estimate the influence of changes in these attributes on crop production. We show that RFA areas in northern Ethiopia are characterized by a highly seasonal and unimodal rainfall regime. The southern parts of the RFA areas are characterized by less seasonal rainfall of bimodal and erratic nature. Cereal crop production during the Meher season, especially in teff and maize-dominated regions, is found to be correlated to both the onset (median ρ=-0.32 and -0.37, respectively) and duration (ρ=0.34 and 0.19) of the rainy season in the unimodal rainfall regime, whereas it is correlated with the rainfall seasonality (ρ=0.21) in regions with a bimodal rainfall. We estimate that on average over RFA areas, a late-onset and shorter rainy season lead to ∼1.5% and 1.1% crop production losses per pentad (5-day period), respectively.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505416",,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108633","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505416","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Rainfall seasonality||Rainy season onset||Rainy season duration||Rainfed agriculture||Cereal crop production||Ethiopia","Rainfall seasonality and timing: implications for cereal crop production in Ethiopia",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-14T02:45:40Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85114501609",,"000698753900019","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","310","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This provided a natural experiment to investigate the response of air quality to such emission reductions. Here, we decoupled the influence of meteorological and non-meteorological factors on main air pollutants using generalized additive models (GAMs), driven by data from the China National Environmental Monitoring Center (CNEMC) network. During the lockdown period (Jan. 23 – Apr. 8, 2020), PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO concentrations decreased significantly by 45 %, 49 %, 56 %, 39 %, and 18 % compared with the corresponding period in 2015–2019, with contributions by S(meteos) of 15 %, 17 %, 13 %, 10 %, and 6 %. This indicates an emission reduction of NOx at least 43 %. However, O3 increased by 43 % with a contribution by S(meteos) of 6 %. In spite of the reduced volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions by 30 % during the strict lockdown period (Jan. 23 – Feb. 14, 2020), which likely reduced the production of O3, O3 concentrations increased due to a weakening of the titration effect of NO.

With the exception of the determination of total organic carbon by the expensive total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer, there is currently no easy-to-use method to quantify ARC. Here, we designed a method to detect the concentration of ARC by using the thermal-induced reduction and colorimetric behaviors of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), in which the humic substances (HS) was used as a standard model of ARC to calculate the HS-equivalent concentration of ARC. Distinguished from the conventional complex methods, e.g., TOC analysis, the proposed approach measured localized surface plasmon resonance absorption of AuNPs and the target ARC concentration can be either directly quantified by the absorption spectrometer or qualitatively evaluated by the naked eyes. By using the absorption spectrometer, a limit of detection of 0.005 ppm by our AuNP sensor was achieved. To validate this sensing technique, aerosol samples collected from Basel (suburban), Bern (urban), and Rigi mountain (rural and high-altitude) sites in Switzerland were further investigated through the TOC combustion method. The results thereby substantiated that our plasmonic absorption-based AuNP sensor upholds a great promise for fast, cost-efficient total ARC detection and air quality assessment.",,,,"1520-6882||0003-2700",,"10.1021/acs.analchem.1c03823","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/514603","en","American Chemical Society",,,,"Quantitative Determination of Airborne Redox-Active Compounds Based on Heating-Induced Reduction of Gold Nanoparticles",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-11-10T07:13:54Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85118706562",,"000718171600038","Anal.

Even though this assumption may appear intuitive, it is not necessarily the case for all products. Consider a product that causes significant impacts during its service life and loses performance through wear and degradation. Its extended use may cause higher impacts overall than replacing it before it reaches its end-of-life with an evolved alternative. In this paper, we propose a method for finding the replacement time when impacts become minimal, i.e. the optimal environmental lifetime (OEL), taking into account non-linear dynamics of technological efficiency improvements and efficiency degradation during usage. Different replacement options, including lifetime extension strategies such as re-manufacturing, are considered. Based on this, we define an indicator to measure the environmental performance of an achieved lifetime in comparison to the optimum. This lifespan indicator ϕ measures the relative achievement of the maximum possible impact savings, when replacing the initial product at OEL. It accounts for unsustainable throughput of materials and waste of resources when deviating from it. To illustrate the application of the method and lifespan indicator, the OEL of residential heating systems are calculated. It reveals that gas boilers shall be replaced in short intervals with evolved gas boilers or – more effectively – with a heat pump. This case study nullifies the common hypothesis that “durability is per se environmentally beneficial”, requiring to evaluate OEL on a case by case basis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000491984",,"0921-3449||1879-0658",,"10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105704","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491984","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Circular economy||Lifespan indicator||Lifespan optimization||Learning curve||Efficiency degradation||Residential heating","When to replace products with which (circular) strategy?

Automated anomaly detection is either performed using supervised machine learning models, which require a labelled dataset for their calibration, or unsupervised models, which do not require labels. While academic research has produced a vast array of tools and machine learning models for automated anomaly detection, the research community focused on environmental systems still lacks a comparative analysis that is simultaneously comprehensive, objective, and systematic. This knowledge gap is addressed for the first time in this study, where 15 different supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection models are evaluated on 5 different environmental datasets from engineered and natural aquatic systems. To this end, anomaly detection performance, labelling efforts, as well as the impact of model and algorithm tuning are taken into account. As a result, our analysis reveals the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches in an objective manner without bias for any particular paradigm in machine learning. Most importantly, our results show that expert-based data annotation is extremely valuable for anomaly detection based on machine learning.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000510225",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2021.117695","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510225","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Machine learning||Anomaly detection||Environmental systems||Labels","The value of human data annotation for machine learning based anomaly detection in environmental systems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-18T04:01:05Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85116532784",,"000713194100009","Water Res.",,"Water Research","206","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In this context, a key parameter is the firn line (FL), the lower boundary of the percolation zone, whose location is an indicator of time-integrated mass balance changes. Several approaches have been developed in the last decades to map the FL by means of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, mainly exploiting backscatter intensities and their seasonal variation. In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed, based on co-polarisation phase differences (CPDs). In particular, CPDs are interpreted as the result of propagation through anisotropic firn layers and are, therefore, proposed as an indicator of the presence of firn. A model is employed to demonstrate the link between CPDs and firn depth, indicating the potential of polarimetric SAR to improve firn characterization beyond spatial extent and FL detection. The proposed approach is demonstrated on L-band airborne data, acquired on 21 May 2015 by the F-SAR sensor of DLR in West Greenland during the ARCTIC15 campaign, and validated with in-situ information available from other studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515496",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs13214448","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515496","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Synthetic Aperture Radar||polarimetry||differential propagation||firn anisotropy||Greenland","Retrieval of Firn Thickness by Means of Polarisation Phase Differences in L-Band SAR Data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-17T04:00:56Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85118761626",,"000720453600001","Remote Sens.","21","Remote Sensing","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

To better assess environmental exposure and risks of melamine and related triazines (cyromazine, ammeline, and atrazine), a new passive sampling method based on the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique has been developed and validated in this study. The studied triazines were adsorbed quickly and strongly by the selected mixed cation exchange (MCX) binding gels. This MCX-DGT can linearly accumulate these chemicals over at least 5 days, with neither significant individual influence from pH (6–8), ionic strength (0.01–0.5 M) or dissolved organic matter (0–10 M), or interaction effects. Field applications in Southern China showed that DGT performed well in both sewage treatment plant (STP) and river samples. Melamine was found to be the dominant triazine with the concentrations at μg·L−1 in the STP and receiving river. Surprisingly, much higher concentration of melanine was found in the STP effluent than influent, and appeared to be some of the highest concentrations reported in STPs worldwide to date. Comparable melamine and atrazine concentraions in the STP effluent and receiving river suggested other sources to the river. The MCX-DGT sampler developed here was demonstrated to be reliable and robust for measuring the triazines in waters, and is promising as an in situ tool in understanding the occurrence, sources, and fate of the emerging PMT substances in aquatic environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2021.117752","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/512280","en","Elsevier",,,,"In situ measurement of an emerging persistent, mobile and toxic (PMT) substance - Melamine and related triazines in waters by diffusive gradient in thin-films",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-10-28T09:14:26Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85117729339",,"000713267500001","Water Res.",,"Water Research","206","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Increasing shares of sludge are incinerated and landfilled, especially in industrialized countries. It is debated whether certain types of NPs can outlive the incineration process and subsequently be released from sewage sludge ash (SSA) landfills. To investigate the release of different types of NPs from SSA, we spiked gold (Au), silver (Ag) and cerium dioxide (CeO2) NPs to a pilot WWTP increasing the Au, Ag and Ce concentrations to 30, 43 and 389 mg kg−1 (dry matter basis) in the digested sludge. The spiked sludge was incinerated in a pilot fluidized bed reactor resulting in SSA with Au, Ag and Ce concentrations of 61, 103 and 854 mg kg−1. In addition, two sludge samples from a full-scale WWTP with Au concentrations of 5 and 16 mg kg−1 were incinerated, resulting in SSA with 9 mg kg−1 and 30 mg kg−1 Au. The spiked Au-NPs remain largely unaltered during the wastewater treatment and incineration process, whereas Ag-NPs and CeO2-NPs undergo transformation. During simulated landfill leaching in columns flushed with 400 to 500 pore volumes of artificial rainwater, Ag and Ce were retained in the ash, whereas about 17% of the spiked Au was released, mainly in particulate form. Lower fractions of mostly particulate Au were released from the ashes (3 and 9%) of unspiked SSA. In conclusion, unaltered Au-NPs significantly leach from landfilled SSA, whereas the incorporation of Ag-NPs and CeO2-NPs as transformed species into the SSA matrix limits the leaching of (nano)particulate and dissolved Ag and Ce compounds.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000514919",,"2051-8153||2051-8161",,"10.1039/d1en00497b","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/514919","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Release of gold (Au), silver (Ag) and cerium dioxide (CeO2) nanoparticles from sewage sludge incineration ash",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-12T09:41:47Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85120060008",,"000705679700001","Environ.

Besides the high filtration efficiency for sub-micron particles, the SSSAF showed good responses to pressure drop in the range of 0 to 500 Pa via the electroactivity of PZT/PVDF membrane. In addition, the SSSAF achieved VOC sensing function via the swelling properties of PZT/PVDF membrane in organic vapors, demonstrated by its signal to 50 to 200 ppm ethanol vapors. The SSSAF was employed to harvest wind energy, which was further applied to inhibit bacterial growth without the need of additional power input. Our SSSAF was designed to take advantage of the energy carried by the filtration air flow, which is necessary in any filtration system thus brings a stable and innate energy source. The results provide new insight into development of all-in-one smart air filters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000485161",,"0300-9467||1385-8947||1873-3212||0923-0467",,"10.1016/j.cej.2021.130247","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/485161","en","Elsevier BV","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Self-supporting||Smart air filter||Sensors||Energy harvesting||Anti-bacteria","Self-supporting smart air filters based on PZT/PVDF electrospun nanofiber composite membrane",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-20T07:51:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85105725925",,"000687338100005","Chem.

However, due to the lack of appropriate sanitation planning practices, there have been little long-term gains made in urban sanitation beyond the ending of open defaecation. In this paper, we analyse the key barriers to sanitation planning, in India, in the context of the emerging paradigm of Citywide Inclusive Sanitation (CWIS). A mixed method approach of shit flow diagrams, social network analysis, policy analysis, interviews and workshops at the national, state (2) and city (4) levels was conducted. Eight factors were identified as important barriers for planning including inadequate planning capacities, lack of ownership of city sanitation plans among city governments, poor community involvement, absence of a uniform planning framework, unreliable political and financial support, overlapping jurisdictions, and scheme-based funding. The paper also proposes the CWIS Planning Framework which offers a perspective at overcoming these barriers with the recommendation of bridging top-down and bottom-up planning approaches. While there is increasingly more clarity on what CWIS means, there is little understanding on how to plan for it. Therefore, this framework provides the theoretical basis for planning with the CWIS approach.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519272",,"2043-9083",,"10.2166/washdev.2021.130","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519272","en","International Water Association","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Citywide Inclusive Sanitation||CWIS planning framework||India||sanitation planning||Swachh Bharat Mission","The clean plan: analysing sanitation planning in India using the CWIS planning framework",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-07T09:36:53Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85120822032",,"000704437400001",,"6","Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Herein, we discuss the key categories of risk associated with the main groups of materials commonly found in dry toilets. The study was part of the development of a German product standard for marketable and quality-assured recycling fertilizers from human excreta for use in horticulture. Particular attention is paid to ensuring that the fertilizer is epidemiologically and environmentally harmless and that the quality of the recycling fertilizer is adequate in terms of low pollution and nutrient availability. In sum, the risk of transmissible human pathogens lies within the human excreta, particularly feces; plant materials added during composting are of particular phytosanitary relevance; pharmaceutical residues in excrements and chemical additives are potential sources of pollutants; non-biodegradable contaminants can cause pollution and injury; and the horticultural risks involve mainly the ammonia emission potential and in some cases the salinity effects of urine. These risks can be reduced significantly (i) with education of users around proper operation of dry toilets and the consequences of adding inappropriate waste, (ii) with facilitation of proper use with general waste bins and clear instructions, and importantly (iii) by using modern sanitization and cleaning processes and testing for harmful substances under the guidance of local laws and regulations, ensuring safe and high-quality fertilizers. In conclusion, the benefits of using dry toilet contents to produce fertilizers for use in horticulture are unquestionable. Our analysis highlights the need to support recycling optimization and awareness for the purpose of a sustainable circular economy and to minimize the risk of harm to humans and the environment overall.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528420",,"2730-5988||2730-597X",,"10.1007/s43615-021-00068-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528420","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Human excreta||Compost||Urine||Sanitation||Pollutants||Pharmaceuticals||Nutrient cycling","Qualitative risk analysis for contents of dry toilets used to produce novel recycling fertilizers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-25T12:48:02Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Circular Economy and Sustainability","1","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

At the simplest level, accurate spatial patterning of microorganisms would enable reliable, long-term imaging of large numbers of individual cells and transform the ability to quantitatively study distance-dependent microbe-microbe interactions. More uniquely, coupling accurate spatial patterning and full control over environmental conditions, as offered by microfluidic technology, would provide a powerful and versatile platform for single-cell studies in microbial ecology. This paper presents a microfluidic platform to produce versatile and user-defined patterns of microorganisms within a microfluidic channel, allowing complete optical access for long-term, high-throughput monitoring. This new microfluidic technology is based on capillarity-assisted particle assembly and exploits the capillary forces arising from the controlled motion of an evaporating suspension inside a microfluidic channel to deposit individual microsized objects in an array of traps microfabricated onto a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. Sequential depositions generate the desired spatial layout of single or multiple types of micro-sized objects, dictated solely by the geometry of the traps and the filling sequence. The platform has been calibrated using colloidal particles of different dimensions and materials: it has proven to be a powerful tool to generate diverse colloidal patterns and perform surface functionalization of trapped particles. Furthermore, the platform was tested on microbial cells, using Escherichia coli cells as a model bacterium. Thousands of individual cells were patterned on the surface, and their growth was monitored over time. In this platform, the coupling of single-cell deposition and microfluidic technology allows both geometric patterning of microorganisms and precise control of environmental conditions. It thus opens a window into the physiology of single microbes and the ecology of microbe-microbe interactions, as shown by preliminary experiments.",,,,"1940-087X",,"10.3791/63131","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/521351","en","Journal of Visualized Experiments",,,,"Patterning of Microorganisms and Microparticles through Sequential Capillarity-assisted Assembly",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-12-18T05:25:04Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The role of ambient flow and physico-chemical microenvironment in determining the microstructure of the biofilm matrix||Sequential capillary assembly of microorganisms as a poweful new single-cell technology","179834||ETH-15 17-1||179834||ETH-15 17-1","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100003006||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100003006","SNF||ETHZ||SNF||ETHZ","PRIMA||ETH Grants||PRIMA||ETH Grants",,,"85121449479",,"000726748200025","J Vis Exp","177","Journal of Visualized Experiments.

Due to the combined advantages of microoptics and microfluidics, optofluidic RI sensors have attracted growing interest. Despite a variety of prototypes of optofluidic RI sensors, comprehensive improvement in sensitivity, detection range, fabrication procedures and cost can still bring substantial benefits to the field. In this work, we fabricated a 3D-cascade-microlens optofluidic chip (3DCMOC) for RI sensing. Two-photon stereolithography was employed to fabricate the chip mold, with which the 3DCMOC could be easily manufactured via mold replication. By virtue of integrating four detection channels configured with different numbers (1, 3, 5, and 7) of cascaded microlenses within the 3DCMOC, adjustable sensitivity for RI sensing has been demonstrated through measuring standard sucrose solutions. It was found that the seven-microlens configuration achieved an excellent sensitivity (mean: 21 ± 5 AU·RIU (refractive index unit)−1) and resolution (mean: 3.8 × 10−5 ± 0.9 × 10−5 RIU) at a cost of a narrow linear dynamic range (LDR, 1.3326–1.3548). In contrast, the single-microlens configuration led to an extended LDR (1.3326–1.5120 tested) despite the lower sensitivity (mean: 2.6 ± 0.2 AU·RIU−1) and resolution (mean: 1.5 × 10−4 ± 0.1 × 10−4 RIU). Furthermore, the use of the 3DCMOC was investigated via real-time salinity sensing and analysis of urine specific gravity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000501416",,"1473-0197||1473-0189",,"10.1039/d1lc00570g","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/501416","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"A 3D-cascade-microlens optofluidic chip for refractometry with adjustable sensitivity†",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-19T13:15:27Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85116569568",,"000686250900001","Lab chip","19","Lab on a Chip","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Experiments examined loading (injection of ink-water solution into a clear water-filled micromodel) and unloading (injection of clear water into an ink-water filled micromodel). Statistically homogeneous and fine-coarse porous micromodels patterns were used. It is shown that the transport time scale during unloading is larger than that under loading, even in a micromodel with a homogeneous structure, so that larger values of the dispersion coefficient were obtained for transport during unloading. The difference between the dispersion values for unloading and loading cases decreased with an increase in the flow rate. This implies that diffusion is the key factor controlling the degree of difference between loading and unloading transport time scales, in the cases considered here. Moreover, the patterned heterogeneity micromodel, containing distinct sections of fine and coarse porous media, increased the difference between the transport time scales during loading and unloading processes. These results raise the question of whether this discrepancy in transport time scales for the same hydrodynamic conditions is observable at larger length and time scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000520676",,"0169-3913||1573-1634",,"10.1007/s11242-021-01655-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/520676","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Solute transport||Dispersion||Advection||Diffusion||Heterogeneity","Process-Dependent Solute Transport in Porous Media",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-15T07:20:33Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Transp Porous Med","1","Transport in Porous Media","140","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, observations of atmospheric composition, especially vertical profile observations, remain sparse and rare on the TP, due to extremely high altitude, topographical heterogeneity and the grinding environment. Accordingly, the forcing and feedback of atmospheric composition from rapidly changing surrounding regions to regional environmental and climate change in the TP remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a high-time-resolution (∼15 min) vertical profile observational dataset of atmospheric composition (aerosols, NO2, HCHO and HONO) on the TP for more than 1 year (2017–2019) using a passive remote sensing technique. The diurnal pattern, vertical distribution and seasonal variations of these pollutants are documented here in detail. The sharing of this dataset would benefit the scientific community in exploring source–receptor relationships and the forcing and feedback of atmospheric composition on the TP to the regional and global climate. It also provides potential to improve satellite retrievals and to facilitate the development and improvement of models in cold regions.

However, available models are either too detailed or too coarse; fully coupled thermal-hydrodynamic modelling tools are lacking. To predict efficiently water-energy dynamics across an entire urban drainage network, we suggest the SWMM-HEAT model, which extends the EPA-StormWater Management Model with a heat-balance component. This enables conducting more advanced thermal-hydrodynamic simulation at full network scale than currently possible. We demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by predicting temperature dynamics in two independent real-world cases under dry weather conditions. We furthermore screen the sensitivity of the model parameters to guide the choice of suitable parameters in future studies. Comparison with measurements suggest that the model predicts temperature dynamics adequately, with RSR values ranging between 0.71 and 1.1. The results of our study show that modelled in-sewer wastewater temperatures are particularly sensitive to soil and headspace temperature, and headspace humidity. Simulation runs are generally fast; a five-day period simulation at high temporal resolution of a network with 415 nodes during dry weather was completed in a few minutes. Future work should assess the performance of the model for different applications and perform a more comprehensive sensitivity analysis under more scenarios. To facilitate the efficient estimation of available heat budgets in sewer networks and the integration into urban planning, the SWMM-HEAT code is made publicly available.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000506687",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2021.117649","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/506687","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Wastewater temperature||Sewer networks||Heat transfer||Distributed modelling||Thermal-hydraulic analysis||In-sewer measurements","A distributed heat transfer model for thermal-hydraulic analyses in sewer networks",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-24T04:37:46Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85115037877",,"000697775900005","Water Res.",,"Water Research","204","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Its implementation, though, requires a careful assessment of its impacts across the entire wastewater system as adverse effects on the water and resource recovery facility and competition among heat recovery strategies may arise.  A model-based assessment of heat recovery from wastewater therefore implies extending the modeling spatial scope, with the aim of enabling thermal-hydraulic simulations from the household tap along its entire flow path down to the wastewater resource recovery facility. With this aim in mind, we propose a new modeling framework interfacing thermal-hydraulic simulations of (i) households, (ii) private lateral connections, and (iii) the main public sewer network.  Applying this framework to analyze the fate of wastewater heat budgets in a Swiss catchment, we find that heat losses in lateral connections are large and cannot be overlooked in any thermal-hydraulic analysis, due to the high-temperature, low-flow wastewater characteristics maximizing heat losses to the environment. Further, we find that implementing shower drain heat recovery devices in 50% of the catchment's households lower the wastewater temperature at the recovery facility significantly less – only 0.3 K – than centralized in-sewer heat recovery, due to a significant thermal damping effect induced by lateral connections and secondary sewer lines. In-building technologies are thus less likely to adversely affect biological wastewater treatment processes.  The proposed open-source modeling framework can be applied to any other catchment. We thereby hope to enable more efficient heat recovery strategies, maximizing energy harvesting while minimising impacts on biological wastewater treatment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504428",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2021.117552","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504428","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Energy harvesting||Household wastewater||Private connection||Sewer networks||Thermal-hydraulic analysis||Wastewater temperature","In-building heat recovery mitigates adverse temperature effects on biological wastewater treatment: A network-scale analysis of thermal-hydraulics in sewers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-07T04:06:59Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113995617",,"000697750300009","Water Res.",,"Water Research","204","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We develop a methodology to build a 500+ food item, nutrient, and environmental impact database specific to a given country and month, which includes several life cycle stages of a food item and calculates impacts depending on from where the item is sourced. This database is then used to develop a detailed and personalized, healthful, low impact diet by using linear optimization. We applied this methodology to several case studies to compare what low impact diets would look like depending on country (Switzerland vs. Spain), season (August vs. February), sex, the inclusion of dietary supplements, and for different diet types and impact categories (climate change and biodiversity loss). Results indicate that, although optimized diets are similar, there are marked differences in the detailed composition depending on country, season, and impact considered, especially regarding legume choice. The lowest impact diet contained local and imported foods as well as fish. Vegan diets had the lowest impact only when incorporating a supplement to meet nutrient needs. We developed a tool to be used for personalized diet composition assessments for any global geographical location and season. We anticipate this work to be useful for developing country- and season-specific dietary guidelines and for consumers hoping to reduce their own personal impacts. © 2021 by Yale University",,,,"1088-1980||1530-9290",,"10.1111/jiec.13131","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494957","en","Wiley",,,"biodiversity loss||climate change||diet and health||environmental impact||industrial ecology||optimization","Methodology and optimization tool for a personalized low environmental impact and healthful diet specific to country and season",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-07-15T10:34:39Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85105656931",,"000646883900001","J. ind. ecol.","5","Journal of Industrial Ecology","25","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

All glaciers lost 80% or more of their surface snow cover during the studied ablation seasons. This bolsters the recently observed trend of local glacier thinning, even at higher altitudes. Snow ablation dynamics are highly dependent on the glaciers altitudes, their position relative to the prevailing wind direction and the exposure to insolation. The accumulation areas of the studied glaciers were delimited based on the overlap of the minimum extent of snow-covered areas in the four consecutive studied summer seasons. The high temporal and spatial resolutions of available images enabled a detailed description of the seasonal snow ablation dynamics. Moreover, an estimate of the average number of days with below threshold glacier snow cover was made. This study contributes to our understanding of recent processes and might further support the modelling of glacier melt and subsequent runoff.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000506492",,"0022-1430||1727-5652",,"10.1017/jog.2021.36","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/506492","en","Cambridge University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Glacier ablation phenomena||glacier mass balance||snow||wind-blown snow","Seasonal dynamics of snow ablation on selected glaciers in central Spitsbergen derived from Sentinel-2 satellite images",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-23T02:51:28Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85104242114",,"000695957300018","J Glaciol","265","Journal of Glaciology","67","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Yet, the mechanisms determining the magnitude of the pump remain poorly understood, limiting our ability to predict this carbon flux in future ocean scenarios. Current ocean models assume that the biological pump is governed by the competition between sinking speed and degradation rate, with the two processes independent from one another. Contrary to this paradigm, we show that sinking itself is a primary determinant of the rate at which bacteria degrade particles. Heterotrophic bacterial degradation rates were obtained from a laboratory study on model surface-colonized particles at atmospheric pressure under a range of flow speeds to mimic different sinking velocities. We find that even modest sinking speeds of 8 m day−1 enhance degradation rates more than 10-fold compared with degradation rates of non-sinking particles. We discovered that the molecular mechanism underlying this sinking-enhanced degradation is the flow-induced removal from the particles of the oligomeric breakdown products, which otherwise compete for enzymatic activity. This mechanism applies across several substrates and bacterial strains, suggesting its potentially broad occurrence under natural marine conditions. Integrating our findings into a mathematical model of particulate carbon flux, we propose that the coupling of sinking and degradation may contribute, in conjunction with other processes, to determining the magnitude of the vertical carbon flux in the ocean.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000508234",,"1752-0908||1752-0894",,"10.1038/s41561-021-00817-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/508234","en","Springer","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Sinking enhances the degradation of organic particles by marine bacteria",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-05T06:27:30Z","2022-03-22",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Microscale investigation of key bacterial phenotypes enhancing collection by rising bubbles and aerial dispersal","798411","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85115348072",,"000698572100001","Nat.

Rainfall spatial variability is likewise a major determinant affecting streamflow, erosion, and sediment transport, and is explored largely in the context of heavy rain triggering floods and fast morphological changes on hillslopes and in channels. In this study, we examine how the spatial structure of rainfall influences landscape evolution at the catchment scale over hundreds of years. To achieve this, multiple realizations of hourly rainfall fields, each differing only by their spatial distribution but identical in all other respects, were simulated using a weather generator. The impact of storm spatial-heterogeneity on the catchment morphology was then assessed with a landscape evolution model (CAESAR-Lisflood). A virtual “open-book” type catchment was used for this numerical experiment. The mean streamflow and low-flows remained the same while the magnitude of the annual peak streamflow increased by up to 12% in response to higher rainfall spatial heterogeneity. However, the erosion and deposition rates significantly increased (up to 50%) and the net erosion and deposition areas changed (increased by up to 9% and decreased by 13.5%, respectively) when the rain became less uniform in space. Furthermore, new gullies were found to be longer, deeper, and more branched in response to increased rainfall heterogeneity. The results suggest that heterogeneity in rainfall spatial patterns speeds up landscape development, even when rainfall volumes and temporal structures are the same. This implies that the spatial structure of rainfall may have more of an influence on catchment morphology at long time scales than previously thought.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000499562",,"0169-555x||1872-695X",,"10.1016/j.geomorph.2021.107863","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499562","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Rainfall spatial properties||Storm characteristics||Landscape evolution model||Gully erosion||Enhanced erosion rates||Catchment morphology","Rainfall spatial-heterogeneity accelerates landscape evolution processes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-05T03:15:39Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85111260565",,"000686605000004",,,"Geomorphology","390","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Previous studies have shown that their number and relative area can change considerably from year to year, but this variability has not been explored, in part because available cliff observations are irregular. Here, we systematically mapped and tracked ice cliffs across four debris-covered glaciers in High Mountain Asia for every late ablation season from 2009 to 2019 using high-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery. We then quantified the processes occurring at the feature scale to train a stochastic birth-death model to represent the cliff population dynamics. Our results show that while the cliff relative area can change by up to 20% from year to year, the natural long-term variability is constrained, thus defining a glacier-specific cliff carrying capacity. In a subsequent step, the inclusion of external drivers related to climate, glacier dynamics, and hydrology highlights the influence of these variables on the cliff population dynamics, which is usually not a direct one due to the complexity and interdependence of the processes taking place at the glacier surface. In some extreme cases (here, a glacier surge), these external drivers may lead to a reorganization of the cliffs at the glacier surface and a change in the natural variability. These results have implications for the melt of debris-covered glaciers, in addition to showing the high rate of changes at their surface and highlighting some of the links between cliff population and glacier state.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000513775",,"0148-0227||2169-9003||2169-9011",,"10.1029/2021JF006179","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/513775","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","debris-covered glaciers||supraglacial ice cliffs||supraglacial ponds||birth-death model||stochastic processes","Interannual Dynamics of Ice Cliff Populations on Debris-Covered Glaciers From Remote Sensing Observations and Stochastic Modeling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-05T08:15:12Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85118216454",,"000711971800005","J. geophys. res.

Therefore, treated wastewater is recognized as a major source of multiple stressors, including complex mixtures of micropollutants. These can potentially affect microbial communities in the receiving water bodies and the ecological functions they provide. In this study, we evaluated in flow-through channels the consequences of an exposure to a mixture of stream water and different percentages of urban WWTP effluent, ranging from 0% to 80%, on the microbial diversity and function of periphyton communities. Assuming that micropollutants exert a selective pressure for tolerant microorganisms within communities, we further examined the periphyton sensitivity to a micropollutant mixture extracted from passive samplers that were immersed in the wastewater effluent. As well, micropollutants in water and in periphyton were comprehensively quantified. Our results show that micropollutants detected in periphyton differed from those found in water, both in term of concentration and composition. Especially photosystem II inhibitors accumulated in periphyton more than other pesticides. Although effects of other substances cannot be excluded, this accumulation may have contributed to the observed higher tolerance of phototrophic communities to micropollutants upon exposure to 30% and 80% of wastewater. On the contrary, no difference in tolerance was observed for heterotrophic communities. Exposure to the gradient of wastewater led to structural differences in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities. For instance, the relative abundance of cyanobacteria was higher with increasing percentage of wastewater effluent, whereas the opposite was observed for diatoms. Such results could indicate that differences in community structure do not necessarily lead to higher tolerance. This highlights the need to consider other wastewater constituents such as nutrients and wastewater-derived microorganisms that can modulate community structure and tolerance. By using engineered flow-through channels that mimic to some extent the required field conditions for the development of tolerance in periphyton, our study constitutes a base to investigate the mechanisms underlying the increased tolerance, such as the potential role of microorganisms originating from wastewater effluents, and different treatment options to reduce the micropollutant load in effluents.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000501708",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2021.117486","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/501708","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Pollution-induced community tolerance||Aquatic biofilm||Passive sampler||Organic micropollutants||Microbial diversity||16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing","Impact of wastewater on the microbial diversity of periphyton and its tolerance to micropollutants in an engineered flow-through channel system",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-22T02:48:44Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85112545538",,"000697759000002","Water Res.",,"Water Research","203","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

CBS services replace unsafe sanitation practices in low- and middle-income regions and thus avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from uncontrolled degradation of excreta in the environment (Harroff et al., 2019). CBS provides waterless toilets with sealable containers that separate human excreta from human contact (= safely managed), regular collection and revalorization of excreta (CBSA, 2018). This service is less costly than conventional sewage systems, but there are recurring operational costs for which long-term revenue streams such as climate financing are needed (Coates & Gray, 2021; Russel et al., 2019; World Bank, 2019).  The objective of this study was to develop a methodology that allows CBS projects to systematically quantify and monitor their GHG savings vis-à-vis unsafe sanitation solutions. The two main goals were 1) to quantify the GHG emissions in sanitation as accurately as possible; and 2) to minimize monitoring efforts for CBS projects that apply the methodology.  A literature review on GHG emission pathways from sanitation systems was supplemented with key informant interviews with experts in sanitation and methodology development. A methodology was drafted, along with an Excel calculator. The methodology provides default values for the quantification of emissions from CBS projects as well as the sanitation systems they replace. An uncertainty analysis revealed that a significant uncertainty of emission savings is pertaining to the variability and categorization of the unsafe sanitation systems that are replaced by CBS.  The methodology was applied to the Mosan social enterprise at Lake Atitlán in rural Guatemala. It was found that about ¾ of the local population use on-site sanitation and ¼ are connected to a sewage system. However, 70% of the sewage system discharges directly to Lake Atitlán. Implementation of one Mosan CBS toilet can mitigate 370 kg CO2-equivalents per year. Further development and authorization of the draft methodology is needed to consolidate these findings and unlock climate financing for CBS projects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000508375",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/508375","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Greenhouse gas||Carbon credits||Sanitation||Low- and middle-income countries||Container-based sanitation||On-site sanitation systems||Carbon methodology","A Methodological Approach to the Assessment of the Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential of Container-Based Sanitation Systems",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,,"2021-10-06T06:39:18Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This complex, social mode of cellular organization is fundamental to the physiology of microbes and often exhibits surprising behavior. Bacterial biofilms are more than the sum of their parts: single-cell behavior has a complex relation to collective community behavior, in a manner perhaps cognate to the complex relation between atomic physics and condensed matter physics. Biofilm microbiology is a relatively young field by biology standards, but it has already attracted intense attention from physicists. Sometimes, this attention takes the form of seeing biofilms as inspiration for new physics. In this roadmap, we highlight the work of those who have taken the opposite strategy: we highlight the work of physicists and physical scientists who use physics to engage fundamental concepts in bacterial biofilm microbiology, including adhesion, sensing, motility, signaling, memory, energy flow, community formation and cooperativity. These contributions are juxtaposed with microbiologists who have made recent important discoveries on bacterial biofilms using state-of-the-art physical methods. The contributions to this roadmap exemplify how well physics and biology can be combined to achieve a new synthesis, rather than just a division of labor.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492816",,"1478-3975||1478-3967",,"10.1088/1478-3975/abdc0e","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492816","en","Institute of Physics Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","biofilms||physiology of microbes||cellular organisation||adhesion||motility","Roadmap on emerging concepts in the physical biology of bacterial biofilms: from surface sensing to community formation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-03T00:43:39Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85109115982",,"000664726100001",,"5","Physical Biology","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In the present study, the effects of alcohol vapors from alcohol-based sanitizers during hand disinfection on the in-use masks are studied. The results show that the negative effects are not significant for nonelectrostatic cotton masks or N95 respirators with multiple charged layers, but noticeable for surgical masks. After five rounds of hand disinfection, the filtration efficiencies of the filtering materials of the surgical masks decrease by more than 8% for 400 and 500 nm particles and by 3.7 ± 1.8% for 1 µm particles, the effective filtration efficiency of the surgical masks worn by the volunteers (with leakage considered) decreases by about 5% for ambient aerosol. In another process to imitate intensive disinfection procedures by healthcare workers, a 30 min surface cleaning process using alcohol-based sanitizer is performed, and the effective efficiency of the N95 respirators worn by the volunteers decreases by nearly 9%. The simple practice of avoiding vapor during hand disinfection could mitigate the effects of alcohol vapor, which is demonstrated on two brands of surgical masks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000491656",,"2056-6646",,"10.1002/gch2.202100015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491656","en","John Wiley & Sons","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","alcohol-based sanitizers||COVID-19||filtration efficiency||hand disinfection||masks","Filtration Performance Degradation of In‐Use Masks by Vapors from Alcohol‐Based Hand Sanitizers and the Mitigation Solutions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-28T08:19:57Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000666871600001",,"9","Global Challenges","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, it is unclear if cells can adopt growth behaviors that allow individuals to optimally respond to differences in nutrient complexity. Here, we directly control nutrient complexity and use quantitative single-cell analysis to study the growth dynamics of individuals within populations of the aquatic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. We show that cells form clonal microcolonies when growing on the polysaccharide xylan, which is abundant in nature and degraded using extracellular cell-linked enzymes; and disperse to solitary growth modes when the corresponding monosaccharide xylose becomes available or nutrients are exhausted. We find that the cellular density required to achieve maximal growth rates is four-fold higher on xylan than on xylose, indicating that aggregating is advantageous on polysaccharides. When collectives on xylan are transitioned to xylose, cells start dispersing, indicating that colony formation is no longer beneficial and solitary behaviors might serve to reduce intercellular competition. Our study demonstrates that cells can dynamically tune their behaviors when nutrient complexity fluctuates, elucidates the quantitative advantages of distinct growth behaviors for individual cells and indicates why collective growth modes are prevalent in microbial populations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000487397",,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-021-00953-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/487397","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biofilms||Microbial ecology||Water microbiology","Nutrient complexity triggers transitions between solitary and colonial growth in bacterial populations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-28T15:34:55Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"A microscale analysis of the causes and consequences of the spatial arrangement of biological functions in microbial consortia","169978","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,,"85102993992",,"000629883000001","ISME J","9","The ISME Journal","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Understanding of the negative effects wide-spread implementation of such alternative systems may have on existing systems is still limited, despite the importance of this inevitable transition. In this study, we present a novel approach to systematically identify these negative impacts. A comprehensive model integrating transport and transformation processes in sewer pipes was set up and simulated for various transition scenarios. A significant finding of this research is that reduced flows and increased chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations result in the accumulation of sediments and sulphides in sewer pipes. For the examined sewer system, when reducing the total daily flow by 50%, 30% of the pipes were found to accumulate sediments, and 30% of the pipes experienced effects due to the presence of sulphides in different states depending on the wastewater temperature. It was found that an optimal spatial distribution of these water-efficient solutions will most likely require compromises between sediment and sulphide accumulation. The product of two design parameters, diameter and bed slope, was found to be a suitable predictor of the potential of a pipe to accumulate sediments. This research provides novel approaches to assessing the feasibility of transition to solutions offering higher water efficiency. The results indicate where the most affected points in the systems are expected to occur and might help in preparing an experimental approach to assess such negative effects, increasing urban water management efficiency.",,,,"0043-1397||1944-7973",,"10.1029/2020WR027616","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507977","en","Wiley",,,"biochemical processes||decentralized wastewater systems||hydrogen sulphide||sedimentation||solids||water saving","Effects of Transition to Water-Efficient Solutions on Existing Centralized Sewer Systems—An Integrated Biophysical Modeling Approach",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-10-02T02:42:23Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85115793202",,"000703704400007","Water Resour.

A significant number of countries impose the use of facemasks in public spaces and encourage it in the private sphere. Even in countries where relatively high vaccination rates are achieved at present, breakthrough infections have been frequently reported and usage of facemasks in certain settings has been recommended again. Alternative solutions, including community masks fabricated using various materials, such as cotton or jersey, have emerged alongside facemasks following long-established standards (e.g., EN 149, EN 14683). In the present work, we present a computational model to calculate the ability of different types of facemasks to reduce the exposure to virus-laden respiratory particles, with a focus on the relative importance of the filtration properties and the fitting on the wearer’s face. The model considers the facemask and the associated leakage, the transport of respiratory particles and their accumulation around the emitter, as well as the fraction of the inhaled particles deposited in the respiratory system. Different levels of leakages are considered to represent the diversity of fittings likely to be found among a population of non-trained users. The leakage prevails over the filtration performance of a facemask in determining the exposure level, and the ability of a face protection to limit leakages needs to be taken into account to accurately estimate the provided protection. Filtering facepieces (FFP) provide a better protection efficiency than surgical and community masks due to their higher filtration efficiency and their ability to provide a better fit and thus reduce the leakages. However, an improperly-fitted FFP mask loses a critical fraction of its protection efficiency, which may drop below the protection level provided by properly-worn surgical and community masks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000509871",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-021-98895-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/509871","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Quantitative modeling of the impact of facemasks and associated leakage on the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-15T02:56:24Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85116380585",,"000702737500113","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Among these ecosystem services, improved microclimate conditions are particularly important for human thermal comfort and health. In this study, an urban scene in the tropical city of Singapore is numerically investigated with a fully-integrated, three-dimensional urban microclimate model implemented in OpenFOAM. Mass and heat transport in air and storage effect in the urban environment are coupled so that the daily turbulent transport in air using steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) can be solved iteratively with the unsteady heat and moisture transfer from urban surfaces. Vegetation is modeled as a porous medium for the flow of moist air and a leaf energy balance model is used to determine the heat fluxes and transpiration at leaf surfaces. The analysis shows the influence of an urban park upon air temperatures and thermal comfort. Cooling intensity of 1 °C is observed downwind of the park within a region of 27 m for an incoming wind speed of 2.3 m s−1, which reduces to 0.6 °C at a distance of 117 m from the park. The Universal Thermal Comfort Index (UTCI) shows a reduction in thermal stress in and around the park. The approach presented here can provide specific guidelines for urban planners and frame expectations on magnitude and spatial extent of local microclimate modifications generated by an urban park in a tropical city.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000500019",,"2212-0955",,"10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100939","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500019","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Detailed investigation of vegetation effects on microclimate by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in a tropical urban environment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-09T02:54:34Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Wind-driven rain impact of urban microclimate: wetting and drying processes in urban environment||Neighborhood-Resolved Climate model for local heat island mitigation","169323||ETH-08 16-2","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100003006","SNF||ETHZ","ETH Grants||Projekte MINT",,,"85111581536",,"000703601200006",,,"Urban Climate","39","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00003 - Schulleitung und Dienste::00022 - Bereich VP Forschung / Domain VP Research::08058 - Singapore-ETH Centre (SEC) / Singapore-ETH Centre (SEC)||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02130 - Dep.

Thus, it is useful to predict their seasonal timing and reveal their main drivers. The typical timing of low flows varies between regions, yet systematic overviews across Europe and the United States are rare. Here, we identify regional patterns of the seasonal timing of annual minimum flows, and the consistency of that timing, across 1860 European and US catchments. Catchments where low flows typically occur during late summer or winter tend to have more consistent low-flow timings. We compare the timing of annual low flows with that of potential climatic drivers. Low flows in 89% of the European and 86% of the US catchments exhibit a statistically significant (p < 0.05) overlap in timing with at least one potential climatic driver. In most catchments, low flows tend to occur during the warm season, reflecting a period of high potential evapotranspiration exceeding precipitation. In the higher elevation European Alps, Scandinavia, the Rocky Mountains, and the Upper Midwest and Plains states, low flows mostly occur during winter as a result of freezing temperatures which inhibit snowmelt. Binomial statistics also enabled us to statistically exclude individual climatic drivers for certain regions. The regional patterns of timings and drivers of low flows across Europe and the contiguous US can inform low-flow management, provide context for the evolution of low flows under climate change, and point to processes that require attention in future low-flow research.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507985",,"0043-1397||1944-7973",,"10.1029/2019WR026928","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507985","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","low flow||seasonality||climate||drought||precipitation||evapotranspiration","Seasonality and Drivers of Low Flows Across Europe and the United States",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-02T02:42:44Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85115666226",,"000703704400049","Water Resour.

Methods Numerical simulations based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were used to quantify urine flow behavior in stented ureters, in the presence of extrinsic ureteral obstruction (EUO) and stent occlusions. Two stented ureter configurations were considered, one with circumferential occlusion of the ureter and the second with pressure on one side of the ureter wall. The pressure within the renal unit for different degrees of ureter closure and stent lumen occlusion was determined systematically. Onset of stent failure and the distribution of urine flow between stent and ureter lumina were determined.  Results In the case of EUO completely encircling the ureter, causing 100% obstruction of the ureter lumen, pressure in the renal unit is essentially unaffected until the stent lumen reaches ~ 90% occlusion, and fails only with > 95% occlusion. Occlusions of 50% in stent side holes in the vicinity of the EUO only alter local flow patterns but have no significant influence on renal unit pressure. For EUO deforming and compressing the ureter from one side, with ~ 50% reduction in ureter lumen, urine drainage proceeds with negligible increase in renal pressure even with 100% occlusion in the stent lumen.  Conclusion CFD simulations show that stent failure under EUO tends to occur suddenly, only when both ureter and stent lumina become almost fully blocked.",,,,"1573-2584",,"10.1007/s11255-021-02810-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/520674","en","Springer",,,"Computational fluid dynamics||Numerical simulation||Stent incrustation||Stent failure||Renal unit pressure","Failure of ureteral stents subject to extrinsic ureteral obstruction and stent occlusions",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-12-15T07:17:32Z",,,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Int Urol Nephrol","8","International Urology and Nephrology","53","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Because sp-ICP-TOFMS analyses of environmental samples produce rich datasets composed of both single-metal nanoparticles (smNPs) and many types of multi-metal NPs (mmNPs), interpretation of these data is well suited to automated analysis schemes. Here, we present a data analysis approach that includes automatic particle detection and elemental mass determinations based on online microdroplet calibration, and unsupervised clustering analysis of mmNPs to identify unique classes of NPs based on their element compositions. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, we analyzed wastewater samples collected from the influent and effluent of five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Switzerland. We determined elemental masses in individual NPs, as well as PNCs, to estimate the NP removal efficiencies of the individual WWTPs. Through hierarchical clustering, we identified NP classes conserved across all WWTPs; the most abundant particle types were those rich in Ce-La, Fe-Al, Ti-Zr, and Zn-Cu. In addition, we found particle types that are unique to one or a few WWTPs, which could indicate point sources of anthropogenic NPs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000508475",,"0009-4293",,"10.2533/chimia.2021.642","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/508475","en","Schweizerische Chemische Gesellschaft","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Clustering||ICP-TOFMS||Microdroplet calibration||Nanoparticle||Wastewater","Quantification and Clustering of Inorganic Nanoparticles in Wastewater Treatment Plants across Switzerland#",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-06T13:37:50Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Toward High-Throughput Quantitative Analysis of Nanoparticle Pollution in Environmental Samples","174061","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,"85116247618",,"000697357700008","Chimia","7-8","Chimia","75","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02020 - Dep.

To assess this potential health and environmental risk, 231 cosmetic products purchased in the U.S. and Canada were screened for total fluorine using particle-induced gamma-ray emission spectroscopy. Of the eight categories tested, foundations, mascaras, and lip products had the highest proportion of products with high total fluorine ≥0.384 μg F/cm2. Twenty-nine products including 20 with high total fluorine concentrations were analyzed using targeted LC-MS/MS and GC-MS. PFAS concentrations ranged from 22–10,500 ng/g product weight, with an average and a median of 264 and 1050 ng/g product weights, respectively. Here, 6:2 and 8:2 fluorotelomer compounds, including alcohols, methacrylates, and phosphate esters, were most commonly detected. These compounds are precursors to PFCAs that are known to be harmful. The ingredient lists of most products tested did not disclose the presence of fluorinated compounds exposing a gap in U.S. and Canadian labeling laws. The manufacture, use, and disposal of cosmetics containing PFAS are all potential opportunities for health and ecosystem harm. Given their direct exposure routes into people, better regulation is needed to limit the widespread use of PFAS in cosmetics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000495857",,"2328-8930",,"10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00240","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495857","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Fluorinated Compounds in North American Cosmetics",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-19T09:33:01Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85110123101",,"000674277000009","Env Sci Tech Lett","7","Environmental Science & Technology Letters","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In total, we identify more than 10'000 relevant substances and categorize them based on substance types, use patterns, and hazard classifications wherever possible. Over 2'400 substances are identified as substances of potential concern as they meet one or more of the persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity criteria in the European Union. Many of these substances are hardly studied according to SciFinder (266 substances), are not adequately regulated in many parts of the world (1'327 substances), or are even approved for use in food-contact plastics in some jurisdictions (901 substances).

However, the fundamental dose-response relation is still missing for better evaluating and controlling the infection risk.  Methods We developed a simple framework to integrate the a priori dose-response relation for SARS-CoV based on mice experiments, the recent data on infection risk from a meta-analysis and the respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath, to shed light on the dose-response relation for human. The aerosol transmission infection risk was evaluated based on the dose-response model for typical indoor environment.  Results The developed dose-response relation is an exponential function with a constant k in the range of about 6.4×10 4 to 9.8×10 5 virus copies, which means that the infection risk caused by one virus copy in viral shedding is on the order of 10 -6 to 10 -5. The median infection risk via aerosol transmission with one-hour exposure (10 -6 to 10 -4) was significantly lower than the risk caused by close contact (10 -1) in a room of the area from 10 to 400 m 2 with one infected individual in it and with typical ventilation rate 1 ACH (Air Changes per Hour).  Conclusions The infection risk caused by aerosol transmission was significantly lower than the risk caused by close contact. It is still necessary to be precautious for the potential aerosol transmission risk in small rooms with prolonged exposure duration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000448972",,"1058-4838||1537-6591",,"10.1093/cid/ciaa1675","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448972","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Dose-response relation||COVID-19||SARS-CoV-2||Quantitative microbial risk assessment||Infection risk","Dose-response Relation Deduced for Coronaviruses from COVID-19, SARS and MERS Meta-analysis Results and its Application for Infection Risk Assessment of Aerosol Transmission",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-31T13:42:29Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85111129501",,"000699822100036","Clin Infect Dis","1","Clinical Infectious Diseases","73","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

These activities occur in chemical and physical landscapes that are highly dynamic and experienced by bacteria as fluctuations. In this review, we first discuss how bacteria can experience both spatial and temporal heterogeneity in their environments as temporal fluctuations of various timescale (seconds to seasons) and type (nutrient, sunlight, fluid flow, etc.). We then focus primarily on nutrient fluctuations to discuss how bacterial communities, populations and single cells respond to environmental fluctuations. Overall, we find that environmental fluctuations are ubiquitous, diverse, and strongly shape microbial behavior, ecology and evolution when compared to environments in which conditions remain constant over time. We hope this review may serve as a guide towards understanding the significance of environmental fluctuations in microbial life, such that their contributions and implications can be better assessed and exploited.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000459066",,"0168-6445||1574-6976",,"10.1093/femsre/fuaa068","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/459066","en","Oxford University Press","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Environmental fluctuations and their effects on microbial communities, populations, and individuals",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-04T12:57:06Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The effect of high-frequency nutrient fluctuations on bacterial growth","176189","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85105092777",,"000692528300007","FEMS microbiol. rev.","4","FEMS Microbiology Reviews","45","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Whereas the release of microplastics during washing of textiles is already well studied, much less is known about the release during abrasion processes. The abrasion of textiles may induce fibrillation of fibers and therefore result in the formation of much finer fiber fragments. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of abrasion of synthetic textiles on the formation of microplastic fibers and fibrils. Fleece and interlock textile swatches made of polyester were abraded using abrasion tests with a Martindale tester. The microplastic fibers and fibrils formed during abrasion were extracted from the textiles and characterized in terms of number, length, and diameter. The microplastic fibers demonstrated the same diameter than the fibers found in the textiles (fleece: 12.3 μm; interlock: 12.7 μm), while fibrils with a much smaller diameter (fleece: 2.4 μm; interlock: 4.9 μm) were also found. The number of fibrils formed during abrasion in both textiles was higher than the number of microplastic fibers. The majority of the extracted microplastic fibers had a length between 200 and 800 μm, while most fibrils were between 30 and 150 μm, forming two distinct fiber fragment morphologies. The number of microplastic fibers formed during abrasion was 5 to 30 times higher than the number of microplastic fibers that could be extracted from non-abraded samples. The number of fibrils increased after abrasion by more than a factor of 200 for both fabric types. The fibrils formed during abrasion have diameters that fall within the inhalable size for airborne particles. The potential release of fibrils into air during wear of textiles thus raises questions about the human exposure to these materials. Since the Martindale tester can simulate a daily application scenario of textiles over a prolonged period only in a limited way, future studies are needed to establish the correlation between the test results with a real-world scenario.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000491546",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.1c00650","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491546","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","microplastic||textiles||release||fibers||fibrils||fragmentation","Formation of Fiber Fragments during Abrasion of Polyester Textiles",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-27T03:33:06Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems||Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)","168105||186856","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Ambizione||Eccellenza",,,"85108303025",,"000663939900025","Environ.

However, little is known about the exact processes and drivers of microbial community assembly within the complex microbial biofilms that support anammox in engineered ecosystems. Here, we followed anammox biofilm development on fresh carriers in an established 8m3 mainstream anammox reactor that is exposed to seasonal temperature changes (~25-12°C) and varying NH4+ concentrations (5-25 mg/L). We use fluorescence in situ hybridization and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to show that three distinct stages of biofilm development emerge naturally from microbial community composition and biofilm structure. Neutral modelling and network analysis are employed to elucidate the relative importance of stochastic versus deterministic processes and synergistic and antagonistic interactions in the biofilms during their development. We find that the different phases are characterized by a dynamic succession and an interplay of both stochastic and deterministic processes. The observed growth stages (Colonization, Succession and Maturation) appear to be the prerequisite for the anticipated growth of anammox bacteria and for reaching a biofilm community structure that supports the desired metabolic and functional capacities observed for biofilm carriers already present in the system (~100gNH4-N m3 d−1). We discuss the relevance of this improved understanding of anammox-community ecology and biofilm development in the context of its practical application in the start-up, configuration, and optimization of anammox biofilm reactors.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528461",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528461","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","mainstream anammox||biofilm succession||FISH||amplicon sequencing||sequencing||batch reactor||biofilm structure","Distinct growth stages controlled by the interplay of deterministic and stochastic processes in functional anammox biofilms",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-25T14:09:17Z",,,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Water Res.",,"Water Research","200","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Therefore, we investigated the changes of the Ti-speciation during incineration of as-received sludge and of sludge spiked with anatase (d=20–50 nm) or rutile (d=200–400 nm) using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the as-received sludge, rutile and anatase were the dominant Ti bearing minerals and both remained unaffected by the anaerobic treatment. During incineration, Ti reacts with hematite to members of the hematite-ilmenite solid solution series (Hem-Ilm). Up to 80% of the Ti spiked as anatase transformed into Hem-Ilm, a distorted 6-fold coordinated Ti (Ti(IV)sulfate) and rutile during incineration. Up to 30% and 60% of rutile transformed into Hem-Ilm and Ti(IV)sulfate represented phases in fly and bottom ash, respectively. Fe and Ti were spatially correlated in ash derived from as-received and anatase spiked sludge, whereas only a thin layer of the spiked rutile reacted with Fe, in line with XAS data.

Greenhouse systems and biogas plants are interesting technologies for food–energy symbiosis, because both are usually based in rural areas and offer opportunities for the exchange of materials (e.g., biomass waste from the greenhouse as input to biogas plants) and energy (heat from biogas co‐generation for heating greenhouses). In this paper, the focus lies on manure resources for biogas in Switzerland, because manure amounts are high and currently largely underused. We provide a spatial analysis of the availability of manure as feedstock to biogas plants and heat source for greenhouses. In this feasibility study, we coupled the potential waste heat supply from manure‐based biogas and the greenhouse peak heat demand. We quantified the area‐based greenhouse heating demand for year‐around tomato production (from 0.98 to 2.67 MW ha−1 where the farms are located) and the available heat supply from manure‐based biogas (up to 3,200 GJ a−1 km−2). A total maximum greenhouse area of 104 ha could be sustained with manure‐based biogas heat, producing 20,800 tonnes a−1 tomatoes. This amounts to 11% of the total domestic tomato demand.

Here, we use an ultrasonic nebulizer (USN) to transfer NPs from aqueous suspensions into dried aerosols which are deposited on TEM grids in an electrostatic precipitator of an aerosol monitor. The deposition efficiency of the electrostatic precipitator was ≈2%, and the transport efficiency of the USN was ≈7%. Experiments using SiO2 NPs (50–200 nm) confirmed an even deposition of the nebulized particles in the center of the TEM grids. PNCs of the SiO2 NPs derived from TEM images underestimated the expected PNCs of the suspensions by a factor of up to three, most likely resulting from droplet coagulation and NP aggregation in the USN. Nevertheless, single particles still dominated the PNC.

To achieve this, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have successfully adopted various operational, technological, and air traffic management/infrastructural measures. However, they have also implemented market-based regulatory measures, including the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Additionally, regional measures, such as the European emission trading system (ETS), nationwide political measures, such as flight taxes, and compensation programs by airlines also exist. Therefore, this study surveyed the impact of such measures, primarily on business travelers and their behavior, with a focus on Switzerland. Additionally, not only the impact of the first-last mile (airport access) was discussed, but also intermodal aspects like high-speed rails were debated. Results indicated that flight tax programs were found to have a weak impact on demand. The impact of COVID-19 was addressed and decreased travel frequency from COVID-19 may impact global flight emissions in the long term.

The homogeneous particle decorated with plasmonic nanoparticles on the surface displays features of hot Brownian dynamics as well as photophoretic motion along z dimension in the optical trap. A dielectric particle was used as a reference particle because it acts as a cold particle with only the gradient force affecting it. In general, Janus particles orient in the trap with the dielectric part in the trap center. Plasmonic gold nanostructures absorb the light energy and produce heat; the photothermal forces significantly affect the optical trapping. These hot microspheres display temperature and Janus orientation dependent position distribution significantly different from cold (purely dielectric) microparticles. The developed method allows for the first time direct determination of the photophoretic (thermal force along light propagation direction) and thermophoretic force (light propagation direction independent force) acting on the respective particles, which opens new paths for analysis and control of micromachines. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,,,"0169-4332||1873-5584",,"10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.149319","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472131","en","Elsevier",,,"Micromotor||Photophoresis||Thermophoresis||Hot Brownian particle||Janus particle||Optical tweezers","Direct measurement of thermophoretic and photophoretic force acting on hot micromotors with optical tweezers",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-03-01T08:03:35Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101071506",,,"Appl. surf. sci.",,"Applied Surface Science","549","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Our retrospective analysis of the contested recent filling of Gibe III in the Omo-Turkana basin provides quantitative evidence of the benefits generated by adaptive filling strategies, attaining levels of hydropower production comparable with the historical ones while curtailing the negative impacts to downstream users. Our results can inform a more sustainable filling of the new megadam currently under construction downstream of Gibe III, and are generalizable to the almost 500 planned dams worldwide in regions influenced by climate feedbacks, thus representing a significant scope to reduce the societal and environmental impacts of a large number of new hydropower reservoirs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488396",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-021-23323-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488396","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Environmental impact||Hydrology","When timing matters—misdesigned dam filling impacts hydropower sustainability",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-05T02:30:39Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,"85106658671",,"000658769900008","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Adapting treatment process operations accordingly is challenging due to a lack of analytical capacity for characterization and monitoring at many treatment plants. Cost-efficient and simple field measurements such as photographs and probe readings could be proxies for process control parameters that normally require laboratory analysis. To investigate this, we evaluated questionnaire data, expert assessments, and simple analytical measurements for fecal sludge collected from 421 onsite containments. This data served as inputs to models of varying complexity. Random forest and linear regression models were able to predict physical-chemical characteristics including total solids (TS) and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations, and solid-liquid separation performance including settling efficiency and filtration time (R2 from 0.51-0.66) based on image analysis of photographs (sludge color, supernatant color, and texture) and probe readings (conductivity (EC) and pH). Supernatant color was the best predictor of settling efficiency and filtration time, EC was the best predictor of NH4+-N, and texture was the best predictor of TS. Predictive models have the potential to be applied for real-time monitoring and process control if a database of measurements is developed and models are validated in other cities. Simple decision tree models based on the single classifier of containment type can also be used to make predictions about citywide planning, where a lower degree of accuracy is required.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000475847",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2021.116997","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/475847","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Random forest||machine learning||image analysis||sanitation||WASH||fecal sludge","Predictive models using “cheap and easy” field measurements: Can they fill a gap in planning, monitoring, and implementing fecal sludge management solutions?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-23T03:59:49Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102649478",,"000638110500005","Water Res.",,"Water Research","196","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In order to address such issue, an integrated process consisting of granular activated carbon (GAC) layer and GDM was developed. The performance of virgin (fresh GAC) or preloaded GAC (saturated GAC) was compared. Flux stabilization was observed both in the fresh and saturated GAC/GDM process during long-term filtration and their stable fluxes were both improved by approximately 50% relative to the GDM control. Moreover, integrating GAC with GDM contributed to efficient removals for dissolved organic compounds (DOC), assimilable organic carbon (AOC) and low molecular weight substances both in fresh and saturated GAC/GDM filtration. Compared to GDM control, coupling GAC to GDM could significantly reduce the concentrations of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and total cell counts (TCC) within the biofouling layer, and engineer highly heterogeneous structures of biofouling layer on the membrane surface. In the fresh GAC/GDM process, the improved flux obtained was mainly related to less coverage of biofouling layer and lower EPS concentrations due to efficient removals of membrane foulants by GAC adsorption. The achieved higher stable flux can be maintained during long-term filtration (after GAC saturation) owing to the combined effects of EPS reduction and formation of highly heterogeneous structures of biofouling layer in the saturated GAC/GDM system. Overall, the integrated GAC/GDM process can hopefully facilitate improvements both in the stabilized flux and permeate quality, with practical relevance for GDM applications in decentralized drinking water supply. © 2020 Elsevier",,,,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144758","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468159","en","Elsevier",,,"Integrated GAC/GDM process||Flux stabilization||Biofouling layer||EPS||Physical structure","Integrating granular activated carbon (GAC) to gravity-driven membrane (GDM) to improve its flux stabilization: Respective roles of adsorption and biodegradation by GAC",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-02-06T03:52:01Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85100113681",,"000625384700097","Sci.

That said, conventional approaches to colorimetric analysis within microfluidic channels are hampered by short optical pathlengths and single-channel configurations, which lead to poor detection sensitivities and low analytical throughputs. Although the use of multiplexed light source/photodetector modules allows for multichannel analysis, such configurations significantly increase both instrument complexity and cost. To address these issues, we present a four-channel colorimetric measurement scheme within an optical-switch-enabled microfluidic chip (OSEMC) fabricated by two-photon stereolithography. The integration of optical switches enables sequential signal readout from each detection channel, and thus, only a single light source and a photodetector are required for operation. Optical switches can be controlled in a bespoke manner by changing the medium in the switch channel between a “light-transmitting” fluid and a “light-blocking” fluid using pneumatic microvalves. Such optical switches are characterized by fast response times (approximately 200 ms), tunable switching frequencies (between 0.1 and 1.0 Hz studied), and excellent stability. Operational performance demonstrates both good sensitivity and reproducibility through the colorimetric analysis of nitrite and ammonium samples using four detection channels. Furthermore, the use of OSEMC for parallel and real-time analysis of flowing samples is investigated via characterization of the adsorption kinetics of tartrazine on activated charcoal and the catalytic reaction kinetics of horseradish peroxidase (HRP).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000483251",,"1520-6882||0003-2700",,"10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00674","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/483251","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Optical-Switch-Enabled Microfluidics for Sensitive Multichannel Colorimetric Analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-10T07:17:06Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85106404401",,"000648505900028","Anal.

As chlorination is the most popular strategy for reducing bacterial concentrations in greywater, understanding chlorination in the context of disruptive and challenging operation is essential to designing robust treatment. In this study, we have examined how disruptions through overall increased loading, interrupted aeration and increased ammonia loading have impacted the chlorine demand of the water produced by a greywater recycling system. We also presented concentrations of significant chemicals that contributed to this chlorine demand. The results indicate that a 1 d period with 8 times (8x) the normal design loading produced a peak chlorine demand of 0.74 mg Cl2/L, which is approximately double the baseline value. While this chlorine demand can be overcome by adding more chlorine, tests involving disruptions in aeration or feeding additional ammonia into the bioreactor produced much greater increases (>30x). The risks of increased chlorine demand on microbial safety can be overcome by limiting ammonia inputs to the system, providing backup systems to ensure sufficient aeration, or through additional anti-bacterial measures that do not depend on maintaining residual chlorine.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000472096",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2020.100087","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472096","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Permeate quality||Hand washing water||Decentralized||Chlorination||Biologically activated membrane bioreactor (BAMBi)||Gravity-driven membrane (GDM) treatment","Disruptions in loading and aeration impact effluent chlorine demand during biological greywater recycling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-01T05:05:23Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101053923",,"000647799000003",,,"Water Research X","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, to date, the contribution of industrial sources to the loads of individual REEs in wastewater streams have not been quantified. Here, we determine the REE contents in sludge collected from 63 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Switzerland. To quantify the industrial fraction of individual REEs in the sewage sludge, we develop two complementary approaches, based on REE ratios and REE pattern fitting. Unspecific (background) inputs, with REE patterns similar to the averaged REE pattern of soils collected across Switzerland, dominate the REE budget of most WWTPs. A few WWTPs receive significant REE inputs from specific industrial sources. Based on population equivalents of Switzerland, we estimate a total annual load of 4200 kg Cerium (Ce, 0.5 g Ce year-1 capita-1), with an industrial contribution of 2000 kg year-1. The latter agrees with estimates of probabilistic mass flow models for engineered nanoscale CeO2 particles discharged to the sewer network. About 7 kg year-1 of Samarium (Sm,total for Switzerland: 184 kg year-1 or 0.02 g Sm year-1 capita-1) and 3 kg year-1 of Europium (Eu,total for Switzerland: 44 kg year-1 or 0.005 g Eu year-1 capita-1) are assigned to industrial inputs from single WWTPs. Gadolinium (Gd) is used in the form of a stable complex as contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging. Assuming 10% removal of Gd during wastewater treatment, we calculate an annual discharge of 90 kg of Gd from one individual WWTP to surface waters. WWTPs with exceptionally high industrial inputs of specific REEs warrant detailed investigations to identify the respective sources and to assess whether REE concentrations in effluents are elevated to the same degree.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474259",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2021.100092","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474259","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Sewage sludge||Rare earth elements||Industry||Wastewater||Soil","Quantification of individual Rare Earth Elements from industrial sources in sewage sludge",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-13T04:36:28Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101762120",,"000647799000012",,,"Water Research X","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Many of these technologies have now reached technology readiness levels that require for verification and validation testing in the field. Results from such field tests of decentralized water reuse systems have been published over the past few years, and observed performance is often compared to quality targets from water reuse frameworks (WRFs). An inspection of ten recent journal publications reveals that targets from WRFs are often misinterpreted, and the emphasis of these publications is too often on demonstrating successful aspects of the technologies rather than critically evaluating the quality of the produced water. We hypothesize that some of these misinterpretations are due to ambiguous definition of scopes of WRFs (e.g., “unrestricted urban reuse”) and unclear applicability for novel recycling systems that treat the water for applications that go beyond the reuse scopes defined in current WRFs. Additional challenges are linked to the verification of WRF quality targets in small-scale and decentralized systems under economic and organizational constraints. Current WRFs are not suitable for all possible reuse cases, and there is need for a critical discussion of quality targets and associated monitoring methods. As the scope of water reuse has expanded greatly over the past years, WRFs need to address new applications and advances in technology, including in monitoring capacities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000477226",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2021.100094","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477226","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","On-sitenon-potable water reuse||Decentralized||Regulatory and legal frameworks||Guidelines||Standards||Field test","Making Waves: Why water reuse frameworks need to co-evolve with emerging small-scale technologies",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-01T04:15:59Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103000230",,"000647799000011",,,"Water Research X","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

During biological nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), high N2O fluxes to the atmosphere can occur, typically exhibiting a seasonal emission pattern. Attempts to explain the peak emission phases in winter and spring using physico-chemical process data from WWTP were so far unsuccessful and new approaches are required. The complex and diverse microbial community of activated sludge used in biological treatment systems also exhibit substantial seasonal patterns. However, a potentially causal link between the seasonal patterns of microbial diversity and N2O emissions has not yet been investigated. Here we show that in a full-scale WWTP nitrification failure and N2O peak emissions, bad settleability of the activated sludge and a turbid effluent strongly correlate with a significant reduction in the microbial community diversity and shifts in community composition. During episodes of impaired performance, we observed a significant reduction in abundance for filamentous and nitrite oxidizing bacteria in all affected reactors. In some reactors that did not exhibit nitrification and settling failures, we observed a stable microbial community and no drastic loss of species. Standard engineering approaches to stabilize nitrification, such as increasing the aerobic sludge age and oxygen availability failed to improve the plant performance on this particular WWTP and replacing the activated sludge was the only measure applied by the operators to recover treatment performance in affected reactors. Our results demonstrate that disturbances of the sludge microbiome affect key structural and functional microbial groups, which lead to seasonal N2O emission patterns. To reduce N2O emissions from WWTP, it is therefore crucial to understand the drivers that lead to the microbial population dynamics in the activated sludge.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478377",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2021.100098","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478377","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nitrification||Denitrification||Activated sludge microbiome||Physico-chemical monitoring||Amplicon sequencing","Linking seasonal N2O emissions and nitrification failures to microbial dynamics in a SBR wastewater treatment plant",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-13T03:09:07Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103701800",,"000647799000002",,,"Water Research X","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, metals production inadvertently generates environmental burdens due to tailings. These are the waste from metallurgical processing to separate unwanted materials from metal ore deposits and are disposed of in storage facilities. Despite advancements in metallurgical processing, there are still a fraction of metals lost in the tailings and they pose long-term pollution risks.  Valorization of tailings are therefore having a twofold impact: First, metals leftover recovery can minimize the discharge of toxic metals into the environment. Second, after the purification process, the ground materials in the form of mineral matrices are another potential resource that could be exploited, thus reducing the need for primary production. However, the valorization technique requires processes causing environmental impacts and therefore we apply life cycle assessment (LCA) to account for tradeoffs. LCA enables evaluation of energy, materials, and waste along product life-cycle stages.  Based on state-of-the-art upscaling frameworks in the metallurgical processing domain, we perform a case of prospective LCA for the alkali-activated materials fabricated by mechanochemical activated mining wastes. In this study, we develop systematic procedures to leverage bench-scale experiments into industrially optimized facility by means of process simulation. As takeaways, a comparative analysis is presented for the case studies with maturity levels.

In the CFPC detection, endonuclease IV recognized the synthetic abasic site and cleaved the fluorescent probes in the hybridized duplex. The nanoscale thermoplasmonic heating dehybridized the shortened fluorescent probes and facilitated the cyclical binding–cleavage–dissociation (BCD) process, which could deliver a highly sensitive amplification-based response.

We present a numerical experiment with the physically based hydrological model ParFlow-CLM with which we quantify the effect of subgrid heterogeneities in headwater catchments within the cell size typically used for regional hydrological applications. We simulate homogeneous domains and domains with subgrid heterogeneities in topography or soil thickness for two climates and soil types. The presence of side slope is the main error source, leading to large underestimation of runoff, and marginally also of evapotranspiration. The spatial distribution of soil saturation in the presence of subgrid variability in topography also leads to underestimation of landslide risk. Soil thickness is the second influential subgrid property, affecting soil moisture distribution and surface runoff formation. Results are consistent for the climates and the soil types considered. The topographic wetness index approach is tested as a way to downscale soil moisture simulations within the domain. Although this method is successful in reproducing some spatial variability and patterns, it fails when the coarse grid mean soil saturation is inaccurate or subgrid topography does not represent subsurface flow paths accurately. We conclude that ignoring subgrid variability in topography and soil thickness in coarse-scale hydrological models may lead locally to underestimation of runoff and slope instability.

This, in turn, requires information which is generally not readily available. To bridge the gap between data need and availability, numerical models are often used to synthesize plausible scenarios not only from direct information but also from additional, indirect data. Unfortunately, the resulting system characterizations will rarely be unique. This poses a challenge for practical parameter inference: computational limitations often force modelers to resort to methods based on questionable assumptions of Gaussianity, which do not reproduce important facets of ambiguity such as Pareto fronts or multimodality. In search of a remedy, an alternative could be found in Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD), a recent development in the field of statistics. This ensemble-based method iteratively transforms a set of arbitrary particles into samples of a potentially non-Gaussian posterior, provided the latter is sufficiently smooth. A prerequisite for this method is knowledge of the Jacobian, which is usually exceptionally expensive to evaluate. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble-based, localized approximation of the Jacobian. We demonstrate the performance of the resulting algorithm in two cases: a simple, bimodal synthetic scenario, and a complex numerical model based on a real world, prealpine catchment. Promising results in both cases—even when the ensemble size is smaller than the number of parameters—suggest that SVGD can be a valuable addition to hydrogeological parameter inference.",,,,"0043-1397||1944-7973",,"10.1029/2020WR029339","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528299","en","Wiley",,,"Bayesian statistics||groundwater||hydrogeology||non-Gaussian||modeling||stein variational gradient descent","Non-Gaussian Parameter Inference for Hydrogeological Models Using Stein Variational Gradient Descent",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-01-25T10:12:43Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Water Resour.

Yet, modelling human activities and the associated impacts are often given a secondary importance in hydrological models with respect to the high-fidelity characterization of natural processes, especially at the catchment scale. While this has little or no influence on model accuracy when modelling pristine watersheds, it remarkably deteriorates the model performance in river basins with a considerable anthropogenic footprint. Operations of water infrastructures within a watershed, e.g., a dam or a diversion dam, are commonly modelled based on observational data, when available. This reproduces to some extent the historical decisions, but might be inadequate to simulate operations outside of historical climate or socio-economic conditions. In this paper, we compare a descriptive approach traditionally adopted in hydrological models, where reservoir operations are determined by tracking the historical average release, and a normative approach, where the operations are dynamically conditioned upon the reservoir storage and can adapt to the climate and socio-economic conditions influencing the reservoir operations. We contrast these two approaches by assessing the reservoir dynamics and the impacts on the downstream river system across time scales, from daily to seasonal. We first discuss the accuracy of the two approaches in reproducing historical observations. Then, we explore their potential in anticipating the impacts of future reservoir operations when considering climate and socio-economic change scenarios, thus testing the approaches in decision making contexts increasingly altered with respect to the historical one. We critically present the advantages and disadvantages of either approach, thus contributing to clarify the importance of adopting an appropriate approach to model reservoir operations when reconstructing past dynamics or anticipating future dynamics of catchments impacted by human activities. © 2021 Elsevier",,,,"0022-1694||1879-2707",,"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.125996","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474250","en","Elsevier",,,"Hydrological modeling||Human impacts||Decision making||Reservoir operations||Climate change||Scenario-based analysis","Descriptive or normative: How does reservoir operations modeling influence hydrological simulations under climate change?",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-03-13T04:35:21Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101848531",,"000641592600047","J.

It identifies six human actions that compromise accessibility: emitting, landfilling, tailing, downcycling, hoarding and abandoning. It analyses the degree of the generated inaccessibility and proposes estimated duration of inaccessibility as a proxy. It further explores how current sustainability management tools like material flow analysis and life cycle analysis could be further developed to address resource (in)accessibility. Finally, the paper presents a case study on cobalt in the EU, where five compromising actions make 70% of the extracted cobalt inaccessible due to tailings (21.3%), landfilling (31.2%), downcycling (11.6%), dissipation (1.4%) and hoarding (4.3%); only 30% is used to expand the functional stock. © 2021 The Authors","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000466519",,"0921-3449||1879-0658",,"10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105403","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/466519","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Metals||Accessibility||Sustainable resource management||Material flow analysis||Life cycle analysis||Cobalt","Towards sustainable resource management: identification and quantification of human actions that compromise the accessibility of metal resources",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-28T21:39:51Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099628367",,"000652020200053","Resour.

Despite these benefits, in Switzerland the use of manure as an energy source is still very limited. The engagement of farmers in biogas production is low and the barriers to their participation are not well known. This study investigates the behavior of Swiss farmers towards anaerobic digestion and the potential impact of changing incentives. Based on a comprehensive survey, including a choice experiment, their willingness to participate in manure-based biogas production is investigated at different levels. An Agent-Based Model (ABM) is designed and used to simulate the development of biogas facilities under different framework conditions. The agent's' properties are derived from the farmers’ survey. Simulation results show that revenue for produced energy is the main driver. An increase of 0.10 CHF/kWh energy revenues (compared to 0.45 CHF/kWh today) would enable the establishment of 10 additional biogas facilities (10% more than today) enabling the manure of an additional 4285 livestock units to be mobilized for biogas, (<1% of the total available manure). The influence of the availability of additional material (co-substrate) for digestion is visible but with even less impact, while a one-time remuneration grant has barely any influence. In this context, the mobilization of the full resources potential involves substantial changes at the technological, organizational, institutional, political, economic, and socio-cultural levels. © 2021","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000466520",,"0921-3449||1879-0658",,"10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105400","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/466520","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Agricultural biogas facilities||Farmers’ behavior||Manure||Agent-based modeling||Anaerobic digestion","Farmer's willingness to adopt private and collective biogas facilities: An agent-based modeling approach",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-28T21:39:51Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099608838",,"000652020200050","Resour.

Chemical compositions, aerosols number emission factors (nefs) and concentrations of the signature elements of the NMs of the combustion-generated aerosols were investigated. In addition, the residual ash was analyzed. The outcomes of this study shed light on how NM and matrix types influenced the properties of the released aerosols. Based on our results it was established that the combustion-generated aerosols were composed of transformed NMs with modified physical-chemical characteristics compared to the pristine NMs. In addition to aerosols with transformed NMs, there were also particles due to incomplete combustion of the matrix.  Types of the pristine NMs and matrices affected the characteristics of the released aerosols. Since the effect of the aerosols is related to the inhaled aerosol number concentration, the nef is an important parameter. Our results showed that the nefs in the size range of 5.6 to 560 nm depended strongly on the type of combusted NEP, which indicated that the NEPs could be categorized according to their potential to release aerosols in this size range when they were burnt. The generated release data facilitate the assessment of human and environmental exposure and the associated risk assessment of combustion-generated aerosols from NEPs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474346",,"2452-0748",,"10.1016/j.impact.2021.100307","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474346","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nanomaterial||Release of nanomaterials||Combustion||Categorization of nano-enabled products","Importance of the number emission factor of combustion-generated aerosols from nano-enabled products",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-14T19:17:31Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Grouping, Read-Across, CharacterIsation and classificatiOn framework for regUlatory risk assessment of manufactured nanomaterials and Safer design of nano-enabled products","760840","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85103086055",,"000656874800009",,,"NanoImpact","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Water balance differences between forested and non-forested landscapes are often attributed to characteristics related to trees’ ability to take up and transpire water, as well as their ability to intercept precipitation. However, another potentially important characteristic of forests that has been largely overlooked in hydrologic studies is the retention and accumulation of debris, litter and deadwood on the forest floor. Here we leverage ongoing measurements at the new hillslope laboratory “Waldlabor” in Zurich, Switzerland, where water retention in forest litter, deadwood and the top soil layer has been investigated using frequent field campaigns and innovative new sensing techniques.  Several approaches were used to determine the maximum storage capacity as well as the storage dynamics of different types and layers of litter. In-lab saturation experiments revealed the maximum storage capacity of various litter types (i.e., leaf and needle litter). Those values were also supported with field pre- and post- rainfall sampling campaigns to determine in-situ litter storage dynamics, as well as to understand the interplay between litter interception and soil-water recharge. Importantly, recharge was often substantially smaller at plots with litter, compared to those without litter. The storage and water retention capacity of deadwood samples was measured in the field by logging the diurnal differences in deadwood weight over a six month period. Dew and fog deposition during the night led to larger water availability for evaporation during the day. We measured increased humidity at sensors in the forest at 1 and 3m heights respectively, compared to the humidity outside the forest. Daily weight measurements over eight weeks of 40 deadwood pieces at our forest site revealed differences in the storage capacity depended on the degree of decomposition. Additionally, we found that water stored in forest floor spruce cones (daily measurements of 20 pieces) actively contributed to evaporation fluxes.  The combination of continuous sensor measurements (soil moisture, deadwood water content), field measurements (litter and deadwood grab samples) as well as laboratory work (saturation experiments) revealed the water storage and retention capacity of litter and deadwood in a typical temperate mixed forest and their contribution to evaporation. These measurements are one component of the new ETH Zürich “Waldlabor” research infrastructure, which also includes measurements of precipitation, xylem water, soil water, groundwater, and discharge amounts, isotope ratios, and other chemical characteristics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526141",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-15217","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526141","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Litter and deadwood water retention processes in a temperate mixed forest",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2022-01-17T09:52:22Z",,,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19-30, 2021","Online",,,,,,,,,,"89939141",,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Consequently, MNMs also reach the aquatic environment, where they can interact with different organisms. Previous studies have already shown that filter-feeding bivalves can ingest nanomaterials from the surrounding water leading to higher concentration of the material. Furthermore, they have been shown to be vectors for environmental chemicals and pathogens to other organisms, as their feces/pseudofeces (F/pF) play a crucial role as a food source for other species. We exposed bivalves (Corbicula sp.) to MNMs and performed experiments to investigate the possible transport of MNMs by their feces to the benthic amphipod Hyalella azteca. Silver (Ag) and gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) as well as fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles were used in this study. They allowed the investigation of the metal content of the bivalves’ feces and the amphipods feeding on it, as well as the localization of the fluorescent particles in the body of the animals.  Results Examination of the feces by fluorescence microscope and determination of the total metal content by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) showed a high accumulation of the exposed MNMs in the F/pF. The examination of fecal matter, using transmission electron microscopy confirmed the nanoparticulate character of the metals in the examined fecal matter. After exposure of amphipods to the MNMs containing fecal matter, the fluorescent MNMs were localized in the animals gut. The chronic exposure of juvenile amphipods over 21 days to feces enriched with Au MNMs caused significant effects on the growth of the amphipods. The transfer of both metals (Ag and Au) from the fecal matter to the amphipods was confirmed after total metal measurements.  Conclusion Probably, for the first time, it has been shown that when exposed to MNMs bivalves can transfer these particles to other benthic species. Transfer is via released F/pF upon which the benthic species feed and thus could ingest the particles. The high concentrations of MNMs in the fecal matter raises concerns about the potential accumulation and transfer of the materials and associated ecotoxicological effects in invertebrates such as benthic amphipods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528454",,"2190-4715||2190-4707",,"10.1186/s12302-021-00473-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528454","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bioaccumulation||Nanomaterials||Invertebrates||Hyalella azteca||Corbicula fluminea","Ingestion of bivalve droppings by benthic invertebrates may lead to the transfer of nanomaterials in the aquatic food chain",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-25T13:57:06Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103205006",,"000630860500001","Environ Sci Eur",,"Environmental Sciences Europe","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Thus, detailed inventories are developed that link the specific technologies in use at more than 125 000 industrial sites, information about their operational practices, and measured emissions. This inventory covers a majority of anthropogenic stationary carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Further air pollutants covered by this thesis include methane (CH4), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3) and mercury (Hg), which represent main drivers of human health impacts from pollution.  For power plants, air emissions have been modeled comprehensively including electricity and heat outputs, efficiencies depending on the thermodynamic cycles at each site, and the specific emission abatement technologies in use. Global coal supply chains including mining, preparation and transport are added as these contribute to human health impacts both directly with their emissions and through the properties of the supplied coal at each coal power plant. For steel mills, refineries and cement plants, the emission models focus on all main on-site air emission sources such as coke ovens, sinter plants, fluid catalytic crackers, sulphur recovery units, flares, furnaces, boilers, or kilns, and also take into account the site-specific flue gas treatment technologies as identified from satellite imagery. Modeled emissions for all sites are merged with emission measurements from a large number of databases to benefit from the level of detail of the emission models as well as the accuracy of emission measurements at the same time.  Life cycle assessment (LCA) is then applied to quantify current human health impacts. Thus, the global air emission inventory is coupled with current life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods, while the technological information for each site is then used to identify realistic improvement potentials. A new, more detailed atmospheric fate, exposure and health effect model is developed on a regionalized level for primary and secondary PM2.5 since the current LCIA methodologies are found to have key weaknesses. Thus, the emission heights, a consistent coverage of different precursor substances, non-linear atmospheric chemistry, temporal and spatial weather patterns throughout the year, the effects of background pollution concentrations, and the quantification of non-linear human health responses to exposure changes can be covered. This model is then used to generate LCIA characterization factors (CFs) that can be flexibly adjusted to regionalized and temporalized LCA studies.  The direct coupling of the health impact model with the detailed inventory for industrial sites, however, allows to avoid several of the simplifications of conventional LCA studies, as these multiply emissions with pre-calculated site-generic or site-dependent CFs based on simplified emission models or estimates from unrepresentative sets of data points. The overall model displays unprecedented detail and global coverage along the whole cause-effect chain of human health impacts caused by industrial emission sources. It improves the assessments of human health impacts per emission source by reducing spatiotemporal uncertainties by several orders of magnitude and enables new comparisons of health impacts based on key characteristics such as location and time of emission at such a high resolution.  The results demonstrate the central role that the continuing deployment of post-combustion flue gas treatment has for the mitigation of human health impacts, for example in Northern and North-Eastern India, where a low sulfur content in coal still leads to major health impacts from SO2 due to missing flue gas treatment, high population densities and low wind speeds. Health impacts are also observed to be high in other parts of the world (for example in Eastern China, the US and Europe) with high variability between the mainly contributing pollutants, but many opportunities for emission reductions from post-combustion flue gas treatment - at least related to particulate matter from industrial emission sources - have already been exploited in these regions. In such cases, the present thesis can highlight remaining reduction potentials, and also help to prioritize facilities in case of larger systemic changes in the local economies. Key industrial drivers for human health impacts from greenhouse gas emissions, for example, are identified all over the world with the largest shares of emissions originating from China, the US, Europe, India and Japan. Thus, the present thesis allows for the ranking of measures in the context of the Paris Agreement.  Local political frameworks are found to regulate air pollutants ineffectively, as several key gaps such as missing emission limits for individual substances or particularly lenient regulation for inefficient units are identified. Thus, a range of cases are observed where a change in regulation leads to the phase-out of the least harmful and most efficient facilities, while regulatory exemptions favor the operation of outdated equipment with high human health burdens.  Future work should prioritize the collection of emission data in least developed and developing countries, and broaden the coverage in terms of air pollutants and their speciation. Additionally, research towards quantifying health impact differences between PM compositions (based on elemental and organic carbon, sulfates, nitrates, etc.) is needed to improve PM emission CFs, as these are identified as key gaps for the present thesis.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/479529","en",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Engineering||Chemical engineering||Environmental engineering||Mechanical engineering||Electrical engineering||Power plants||Steel mills||Petroleum refineries||Cement plants||Air pollution||Climate change||Global warming||Human health||Life cycle assessment (LCA)||Life cycle inventory (LCI)||Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA)||Heavy metals||Sulphur dioxide (SO2)||Nitrogen oxides (NOx)||Methane (CH4)||Mercury (Hg)||Particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5)||Multi-regional input output analysis (MRIO)||Mining||Transport||Ecoinvent","Environmental assessment of global site-specific industrial air pollution",,"Doctoral Thesis",,,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::620 - Engineering & allied operations",,"2021-04-20T08:57:39Z",,,,,,"Yes","yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27459",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, currently available techniques require specialized equipment, which limits their applicability. Here, we present a microfluidic platform to produce versatile colloidal patterns within a microchannel, based on sequential capillarity-assisted particle assembly (sCAPA). This new microfluidic technology exploits the capillary forces resulting from the controlled motion of an evaporating droplet inside a microfluidic channel to deposit individual particles in an array of traps microfabricated onto a substrate. Sequential depositions allow the generation of a desired spatial layout of colloidal particles of single or multiple types, dictated solely by the geometry of the traps and the filling sequence. We show that the platform can be used to create a variety of patterns and that the microfluidic channel easily allows surface functionalization of trapped particles. By enabling colloidal patterning to be carried out in a controlled environment, exploiting equipment routinely used in microfluidics, we demonstrate an easy-to-build platform that can be implemented in microfluidics labs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000463203",,"1473-0197||1473-0189",,"10.1039/d0lc00962h","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/463203","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Sequential capillarity-assisted particle assembly in a microfluidic channel",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-18T09:44:42Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The role of ambient flow and physico-chemical microenvironment in determining the microstructure of the biofilm matrix","179834","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","PRIMA",,,"85102270894",,"000626710700004","Lab chip","5","Lab on a Chip","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In aquatic and terrestrial systems, Hg can be reduced to elemental Hg (Hg0) and escape to the atmosphere or converted to methylmercury (MeHg), a potent neurotoxin that accumulates in food webs. FeII-bearing minerals such as magnetite, green rusts, siderite, and mackinawite are recognized HgII reducers. Another potentially Hg-reducing mineral, which commonly occurs in Fe- and organic/P-rich sediments and soils, is the ferrous iron phosphate mineral vivianite (FeII3(PO4)2·8H2O), but its reaction with HgII has not been studied to date. Here, nanoparticulate vivianite (particle size ∼ 50 nm; FeII content > 98%) was chemically synthesized and characterized by a combination of chemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic analyses. Its ability to reduce HgII was investigated at circumneutral pH under anoxic conditions over a range of FeII/HgII ratios (0.1–1000). For FeII/HgII ratios ≥1, which are representative of natural environments, HgII was very quickly and efficiently reduced to Hg0. The ability of vivianite to reduce HgII was found to be similar to those of carbonate green rust and siderite, two of the most effective Hg-reducing minerals. Our results suggest that vivianite may be involved in abiotic HgII reduction in Fe and organic/P-rich soils and sediments, potentially contributing to Hg evasion while also limiting MeHg formation in these ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000481834",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.0c05203","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/481834","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Mercury Reduction by Nanoparticulate Vivianite",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-01T05:18:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Iron mineral dynamics in redox-affected soils and sediments: Pushing the frontier toward in-situ studies","788009","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85101580159",,"000626270400070","Environ.

Our objective was to study whether urine storage and aerobic biological treatment, i.e. nitrification, was sufficient to remove pharmaceuticals or an additional treatment with activated carbon was necessary to produce a fertilizer from urine. We investigated the abatement of twelve pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics and antivirals, in laboratory experiments representing the treatment steps of anaerobic storage of source-separated human urine, stabilization using partial and full nitrification under acclimatized and non-acclimatized conditions, and treatment of nitrified urine using powdered activated carbon (PAC). Two-month-long-term storage of urine was insufficient to substantially degrade the pharmaceuticals, except for hydrochlorothiazide (>90%). In the partial and full nitrification fed-batch reactors, atazanavir, ritonavir, and clarithromycin were rapidly removed, with biotransformation rate constants greater than 10 L gSS−1d−1. Darunavir, emtricitabine, trimethoprim, N4-acetylsulfamethoxazole, sulfamethoxazole, atenolol, diclofenac, and hydrochlorothiazide were degraded slowly, with biotransformation rate constants of < 1 L gSS−1d−1. With 200 mg PAC L−1, at least 90% of each investigated pharmaceutical was removed. Yeast estrogen screen tests and bioluminescence inhibition tests revealed efficient removal of estrogenicity (99%) and toxicity (56%) using nitrification, and a reduction of 89% and 64%, respectively, using 200 mg PAC L−1. With our study, we provide biotransformation rate constants of compounds never previously investigated. We also show that a combination of nitrification and PAC adsorption enables the production of a safe fertilizer with sufficiently low pharmaceutical concentrations and no removal of beneficial nutrients.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460374",,"0921-3449||1879-0658",,"10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105341","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460374","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biotransformation||Ecotoxicity assessment||Moving bed biofilm reactor||Nitrification||Powdered activated carbon||Source separation","Removal of pharmaceuticals from human urine during storage, aerobic biological treatment, and activated carbon adsorption to produce a safe fertilizer",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-07T20:19:03Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85098491058",,"000608645900015","Resour.

We also used an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) considering end-point CSO, land use, imperviousness, slope and elevation criteria to identify priority areas for SuDS deployment. Results showed that CSO volume attenuation ranged a maximum of 50–99% for the catchment, depending on the deployment strategy and underlying mechanisms of each technology. We also found that deployment of SuDS in AHP-selected sub-catchments improved CSO reduction only for rain barrels and green roofs, but not for bioretention cells and permeable pavements. SuDS were also a cost-effective retrofit option: for a 40% volume reduction, the SuDS cost, at most, 25% of the equivalent cost required for a large CSO tank.

Because sp-ICP-TOFMS analyses of environmental samples produce rich datasets composed of both single-metal nanoparticles (smNPs) and many types of multi-metal NPs (mmNPs), interpretation of these data is well suited to automated analysis schemes. Here, we present a new data analysis approach that includes: 1. automatic particle detection and elemental mass determinations based on online microdroplet calibration, 2. correction of false (randomly occurring) multi-metal associations caused by measurement of coincident but distinct NPs, and 3. unsupervised clustering analysis of mmNPs to identify unique classes of NPs based on their element compositions. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, we analyzed water samples collected from the influent and effluent of five wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Switzerland. We determined elemental masses in individual NPs, as well as PNCs, to estimate the NP removal efficiencies of the individual WWTPs. From WWTP samples collected at two points in time, we found an average of 90% and 94% removal efficiencies of single-metal and multi-metal NPs, respectively. Between 5% to 27% of detected NPs were multi-metal; the most abundant particle types were those rich in Ce–La, Fe–Al, Ti–Zr, and Zn–Cu. Through hierarchical clustering, we identified NP classes conserved across all WWTPs, as well as particle types that are unique to one or a few WWTPs. These uniquely occurring particle types may represent point sources of anthropogenic NPs. We describe the utility of clustering analysis of mmNPs for identifying natural, geogenic NPs, and also for the discovery of new, potentially anthropogenic, NP targets.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000477454",,"2051-8153||2051-8161",,"10.1039/d0en01066a","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477454","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Emerging investigator series: automated single-nanoparticle quantification and classification: a holistic study of particles into and out of wastewater treatment plants in Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-06T06:08:36Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Toward High-Throughput Quantitative Analysis of Nanoparticle Pollution in Environmental Samples","174061","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,"85106631929",,"000634892900001","Environ.

This type of two-wheeler is a popular means of transport in many Asian cities. A volatility-based numerical model was employed to predict SOA formation from a fleet of motorcycles in Tehran, capital of Iran. The fleet was a combination of four-stroke, gasoline-powered motorcycles with different engine displacement volumes. Total hydrocarbon (THC) emission factors of all motorcycles were previously measured in a chassis dynamometer laboratory according to cold start Euro-3 emissions certification test procedures. Due to incomplete combustion and lack of control on exhaust emissions, unburned fuel was assumed to be a good surrogate for the exhaust of carburetor motorcycles, regarding SOA formation. 150 cc engine and 200 cc engine motorcycles had the highest SOA formation potential, under atmospheric oxidant concentration, while 125 cc engine motorcycles had the highest SOA emission factor (travel- and fuel-based). It was found out that SOA emission factor of 125 cc engine motorcycles could increase up to 20%, three to five years after production. Average SOA formation from carburetor motorcycles in the present study was 4 times higher than Euro-4 passenger cars and 20 times higher than direct emission of particles from Euro-2 motorcycles and on (according to EMEP/EEA levels for PM2.5 emission factors). Carburetor motorcycles with 180 cc engine volume in the present study, had the lowest SOA formation potential. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,,,"2212-0955",,"10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100778","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/466492","en","Elsevier",,,"Carburetor motorcycles||Emission factor||SOA||Unburned fuel","Secondary organic aerosol formation from untreated exhaust of gasoline four-stroke motorcycles",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-28T20:21:25Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099807896",,"000632743700001",,,"Urban Climate","36","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, trees also modify wind flow and urban aerodynamic roughness, which can potentially limit heat dissipation. Existing studies show a varying cooling potential of urban trees in different climates and times of the day. These differences are so far not systematically explained as partitioning the individual tree effects is challenging and impossible through observations alone. Here, we conduct numerical experiments removing and adding radiation, evapotranspiration, and aerodynamic roughness effects caused by urban trees using a mechanistic urban ecohydrological model. Simulations are presented for four cities in different climates (Phoenix, Singapore, Melbourne, Zurich) considering the seasonal and diurnal cycles of air and surface temperatures.  Results show that evapotranspiration of well-watered trees alone can decrease local 2 m air temperature at maximum by 3.1 – 5.8 °C in the four climates during summer. Further cooling is prevented by stomatal closure at peak temperatures as high vapour pressure deficits limit transpiration. While shading reduces surface temperatures, the interaction of a non-transpiring tree with radiation can increase 2 m air temperature by up to 1.6 – 2.1 °C in certain hours of the day at local scale, thus partially counteracting the evapotranspirative cooling effect. Furthermore, in the analysed scenarios, which do not account for tree wind blockage effects, trees lead to a decrease in urban roughness, which inhibits turbulent energy exchange and increases air temperature during daytime. At night, single tree effects are variable likely due to differences in atmospheric stability within the urban canyon. These results explain reported diurnal, seasonal and climatic differences in the cooling effects of urban trees, and can guide future field campaigns, planning strategies, and species selection aimed at improving local microclimate using urban greenery.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000412418",,"1618-8667",,"10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126970","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/412418","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Urban climate||Ecohydrology||Evapotranspirative cooling||Land-atmosphere interactions||Urban greenery||Nature based solutions","Tree effects on urban microclimate: diurnal, seasonal, and climatic temperature differences explained by separating radiation, evapotranspiration, and roughness effects",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-04-30T01:01:10Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099794982",,"000620651500004",,,"Urban Forestry & Urban Greening","58","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This is especially true in Alpine gravel‐bed rivers with wide floodplains, geomorphically active floods, and a strong river‐aquifer exchange. The role of short‐term groundwater fluctuations is not always clear in these ecosystems, as it is assumed that phreatophytic vegetation close to rivers is adapted to such conditions. Here we provide data evidence of riparian plant response to short‐term groundwater table fluctuations in a braided gravel‐bed river (Maggia). We used indirect physiological variables for photosynthesis and transpiration – stomatal conductance gs and daily variation in stem diameter ΔDd – which we measured at six mature riparian trees of the Salicaceae family at two sites with different mean depths to groundwater during two growing seasons. The data demonstrate that (a) short‐term variation of the groundwater table affects riparian vegetation – at the site with deeper groundwater, the water table depth was the best predictor of gs variability, while at the site with shallower groundwater, temperature and vapor pressure deficit were the best predictors of ΔDd variability; (b) instantaneous stomatal conductance is related to vapor pressure deficit (V PD), but conditioned by groundwater levels, with higher stomatal conductance for the same radiative input and V PD when the water table was higher for all trees; (c) local micro‐climate measured at tree locations had a stronger predictive power for gs than valley scale climate, suggesting local climate controls on vegetated stands on gravel bars.

The quantification of resource recovery remains a challenge because existing substance flow models require large amounts of input data and can therefore only be applied for a few options at a time for which implementation examples exist. This paper aims to answer two questions: How can we predict resource recovery and losses of sanitation systems ex-ante at the pre-planning phase? And how can we do this efficiently to consider the entire sanitation system option space? The approach builds on an existing model to create all valid sanitation systems from a set of conventional and emerging technologies and to evaluate their appropriateness for a given application case. It complements the previous model with a Substance Flow Model (SFM) and with transfer coefficients from a technology library to quantify nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), total solids (as an indicator for energy and organics), and water flows in sanitation systems ex ante. The transfer coefficients are based on literature data and expert judgement. Uncertainties resulting from the variability of literature data or ignorance of experts are explicitly considered, allowing to assess the robustness of the model output. Any (future) technologies or additional products can easily be added to the library. The model is illustrated with a small didactic example showing how 12 valid system configurations are generated from a few technologies, and how substance flows, recovery ratios, and losses to soil, air, and water are quantified considering uncertainties. The recovery ratios vary between 0 and 28% for phosphorus, 0–10% for nitrogen, 0–26% for total solids, and 0–12% for water. The uncertainties reflect the high variability of the literature data but are comparable to those obtained in studies using a conventional post-ante material flow analysis (generally about 30% variability at the scale of a an urban area). Because the model is fully automated and based on literature data, it can be applied ex-ante to a large and diverse set of possible sanitation systems as shown with a real application case. From the 41 technologies available in the library, 101,548 systems are generated and substance flows are modelled. The resulting recovery ratios range from nothing to almost 100%. The two examples also show that recovery depend on technology interactions and has therefore to be assessed for all possible system configurations and not at the single technology level only. The examples also show that there exist trade-offs among different types of reuse (e.g. energy versus nutrients) or different sustainability indicators (e.g. local appropriateness versus resource recovery). These results show that there is a need for such an automated and generic approach that provides recovery data for all system configurations already at the pre-planning phase. The approach presented enables to integrate transparently the best available knowledge for a growing number of sanitation technologies into a planning process. The resulting resource recovery and loss ratios can be used to prioritise resource efficient systems in sanitation planning, either for the pre-selection or the detailed evaluation of options using e.g. MCDA. The results can also be used to guide future development of technology and system innovations. As resource recovery becomes more relevant and novel sanitation technologies and system options emerge, the approach presents itself as a useful tool for strategic sanitation planning in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000461864",,"0301-4797||1095-8630",,"10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111785","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461864","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Sustainable sanitation||Substance flow modelling||Resource recovery||Structured decision making||Multi-criteria decision analysis","Ex-ante quantification of nutrient, total solids, and water flows in sanitation systems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-13T06:15:02Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097895175",,"000613568100003","J. environ. manag.",,"Journal of Environmental Management","280","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Besides the high-resolution model where the details of the fibrous structures were fully resolved, another low-resolution model with approximated unresolved structures was also established. Filtration simulations utilizing these models were conducted considering the drag force, Brownian diffusion and aerodynamic slip. The simulated filtration efficiencies agreed well with the experiments for particles of 70–400 nm, including the most penetrating particle size (MPPS, 100–200 nm).

While centralized sewer-based sanitation systems remain the dominant approach to providing sanitation, the benefits of non-sewered onsite sanitation systems are increasingly being recognised. This paper presents the outcomes of the testing of the Blue Diversion Autarky Toilet (BDAT), a sanitation system providing hygiene and dignity without relying on water and wastewater infrastructure, in a peri-urban household in Durban, South Africa. The BDAT was used by a single household as their only form of sanitation during three months of technical and social testing. An analysis based on technical data in combination with interpretive, qualitative research methods revealed that the BDAT functioned well and achieved high levels of social acceptance in the test household. The flushing, cleanliness and odour-free nature of the sanitation technology, its functionality, the household's previous sanitation experience, and their experience with and understanding of water scarcity, were the main factors underpinning their positive response to this innovation in sanitation. The testing process resulted in broader developmental benefits for the household, including improved basic services due to the upgrading of the electrical and existing sanitation system, social learning, and improved relationships between household members and the local state. A transdisciplinary research process, which emerged through the assessment, enabled the integration of different forms of knowledge from multiple actors to address the complexity of problems related to the development of socially just sanitation. The benefit of engaging with societal actors in sanitation innovation and assessing its outcomes using both the technical and social sciences is evident in this paper.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000458513",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143284","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458513","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Field test||Water reuse||Source separation||Service delivery||Social acceptance||Transdisciplinary research","Socio-technical analysis of a sanitation innovation in a peri-urban household in Durban, South Africa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-24T03:44:14Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85095813791",,"000600786700095","Sci.

Environmentally-extended multi-regional input-output (MRIO) analysis plays a key role in providing this information, but current databases are limited in their spatial (e.g. EXIOBASE3) or sectoral resolution (e.g. Eora26 and GTAP) as well as their indicator coverage. Here, we present an automated, transparent, and comparably time-efficient approach to improve the resolution, quality, and indicator coverage of an existing MRIO database. Applied on EXIOBASE3, we disaggregate and improve the limited spatial resolution by weighting each element with country and sector specific shares derived from Eora26, FAOSTAT, and previous studies. The resolved database covers 189 countries, 163 sectors, and a cutting-edge set of environmental and socio-economic indicators from the years 1995 to 2015. The importance of our improvements is highlighted by the EU-27 results, which reveal a significant increase in the EU's water stress and biodiversity loss footprint as a result of the spatial disaggregation and regionalized assessment. In 2015, a third of the EU's water stress and half of its biodiversity loss footprint was caused in the countries aggregated as rest of the world in EXIOBASE3. This was mainly attributed to the EU's food imports, which induce comparably high water stress and biodiversity loss in Egypt and Madagascar, respectively. In a second example, we use our database to add carbon, water stress and biodiversity loss footprints to the Green Economy Progress (GEP) Measurement Framework. Most countries have not achieved their environmental target and many countries, facing strong future population growth, show increasing footprints. Our results demonstrate that far more action is needed to move towards a greener economy globally, especially through supply chain management. The attached database provides detailed information on the environmental impacts of global value chains to plan efficient strategies for a greener economy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000448439",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142587","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448439","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Environmental footprints||Supply chain analysis||Multi-regional input-output (MRIO) analysis||Carbon footprint||Water stress footprint||Biodiversity loss","A highly resolved MRIO database for analyzing environmental footprints and Green Economy Progress",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-28T15:36:03Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85093919815",,"000600537400018","Sci.

Conventional, anti-biofouling in marine environments is done by coating a technical surface with highly poisonous tin-organic, which have already been banned for environmental protection. Therefore, the developing of biologically benign coatings becomes a long-term pursue for the industry. Here, we study the Chlorella vulgaris settlement on self-disinfecting titanium dioxide surfaces with three different micro-structures: a flat surface, a light harvesting surface with nano-structure and a hierarchical surface structure, spanning over 5 orders of magnitude (from 0.1 nm to 10 μm). These titanium dioxide surfaces were prepared by Ostwald ripening. This sample manufacturing process gains new catalytic properties as a self-cleaning effect, especially for the light harvesting surface with nano-structure (bulk metallic glass). Chlorella vulgaris dispersions were growing in glass flasks together with the different surface samples over the full time of the experiments. Therefore, this study was made as part of a laboratory scale test. It was found, that bulk metallic glass structures made by Ostwald ripening are showing the highest catalytic and at the same time the best self-cleaning effects. Additionally, the Chlorella vulgaris settlement probability was found to depend on the Wenzel roughness. The surfaces with a high Wenzel roughness were the ones with the lowest Chlorella vulgaris settlement.

Turbulence affects phytoplankton migration both by transporting cells and by triggering switches in migratory behavior, whereby vertically migrating cells can actively invert their direction of migration upon exposure to turbulent cues. However, a mechanistic link between single-cell physiology and vertical migration of phytoplankton in turbulence is currently missing. Here, by combining physiological and behavioral experiments with a mathematical model of stress accumulation and dissipation, we show that the mechanism responsible for the switch in the direction of migration in the marine raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo is the integration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling generated by turbulent cues. Within timescales as short as tens of seconds, the emergent downward-migrating subpopulation exhibited a twofold increase in ROS, an indicator of stress, 15% lower photosynthetic efficiency, and 35% lower growth rate over multiple generations compared to the upward-migrating subpopulation. The origin of the behavioral split as a result of a bistable oxidative stress response is corroborated by the observation that exposure of cells to exogenous stressors (H2O2, UV-A radiation, or high irradiance), in lieu of turbulence, caused comparable ROS accumulation and an equivalent split into the two subpopulations. By providing a mechanistic link between the single-cell mechanics of swimming and physiology on the one side and the emergent population-scale migratory response and impact on fitness on the other, the ROS-mediated early warning response we discovered contributes to our understanding of phytoplankton community composition in future ocean conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000467919",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2005944118","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/467919","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","ROS||motility||photophysiology||harmful-algal-bloom||intermittency","Bistability in oxidative stress response determines the migration behavior of phytoplankton in turbulence",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-05T04:21:49Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The effect of high-frequency nutrient fluctuations on bacterial growth","176189","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85100007451",,"000615345200005","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","5","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","118","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

These datasets are often derived using operator-biased and time-consuming manual delineation approaches, despite the recent emergence of semi-automatic mapping methods. These methods have used elevation or multispectral data, but the varying slope and mixed spectral signal of these dynamic features makes the transferability of these approaches particularly challenging. We develop three semi-automated and objective new approaches, based on the Spectral Curvature and Linear Spectral Unmixing of multispectral images, to map these features at a glacier to regional scale. The transferability of each method is assessed by applying it to three sites in the Himalaya, where debris-covered glaciers are widespread, with varying lithologic, glaciological and climatic settings, and encompassing different periods of the melt season. We develop the new methods keeping in mind the wide range of remote sensing platforms currently in use, and focus in particular on two products: we apply the three approaches at each site to near-contemporaneous atmospherically-corrected Pléiades (2 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution) images and assess the effects of spatial and spectral resolution on the results. We find that the Spectral Curvature method works best for the high spatial resolution, four band Pléaides images, while a modification of the Linear Spectral Unmixing using the scaling factor of the unmixing is best for the coarser spatial resolution, but additional spectral information of Sentinel-2 products. In both cases ice cliffs are mapped with a Dice coefficient higher than 0.48. Comparison of the Pléiades results with other existing methods shows that the Spectral Curvature approach performs better and is more robust than any other existing automated or semi-automated approaches. Both methods outline a high number of small, sometimes shallow-sloping and thinly debris-covered ice patches that differ from our traditional understanding of cliffs but may have non-negligible impact on the mass balance of debris-covered glaciers. Overall these results pave the way for large scale efforts of ice cliff mapping that can enable inclusion of these features in debris-covered glacier melt models, as well as allow the generation of multiple datasets to study processes of cliff formation, evolution and decline.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000453983",,"0034-4257",,"10.1016/j.rse.2020.112201","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453983","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Debris-covered glaciers||Supraglacial ice cliffs||Linear spectral unmixing||Sentinel-2||Pléiades||Automated delineation||Ice cliff inventory","Mapping ice cliffs on debris-covered glaciers using multispectral satellite images",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-01T13:43:16Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097089079",,"000604326500004","Remote Sens.

This sorting of cells and their downstream DNA analysis, such as by mini-metagenomics or single-cell genomics, or cultivation permits a direct link to be made between the metabolic roles and the genomes of microbial cells within complex microbial communities, as well as targeted isolation of novel microbes with a specific physiology of interest. We describe a protocol from sample preparation through Raman-activated live cell sorting. Subsequent cultivation of sorted cells is described, whereas downstream DNA analysis involves well-established approaches with abundant methods available in the literature. Compared with manual sorting, this technique provides a substantially higher throughput (up to 500 cells per h). Furthermore, the platform has very high sorting accuracy (98.3 ± 1.7%) and is fully automated, thus avoiding user biases that might accompany manual sorting. We anticipate that this protocol will empower in particular environmental and host-associated microbiome research with a versatile tool to elucidate the metabolic contributions of microbial taxa within their complex communities.

Greenhouse energy demand and yield production models are coupled with a cost model to investigate the interaction between energy consumption costs and yield production benefits. The coupled model is defined as an optimisation problem to determine the optimal values of decision variables (e.g. cover material, heating and cooling technology, inside temperature and relative humidity set points, plant density, etc.), which result in minimum production cost as the objective function. The results show that the integrated energy demand-crop yield production model outperforms the “classical approach” of a separate energy consumption model where yield is not explicitly modelled but only considered by constraints warranting good growing conditions. In the case of a tomato greenhouse in Iran, the financial cost and environmental impact of producing a 1 kg yield based on integrated energy demand-yield production model were 49% and 29% lower than the energy-consumption model alone. Moreover, the impact of fuel prices on the optimisation results is investigated by use of the proposed framework. Considering real fuel prices instead of current subsidised fuel prices in the Iranian case study, 70% of energy consumption and 19% of climate change impacts could be eliminated while increasing the production cost by 17%. Selling the saved fuel at real prices to other customers would provide the government with more than enough money to compensate the farmers for the increased yield cost.

These hydrological and geomorphological impacts are difficult to predict in temperature‐sensitive Alpine environments. In this study, we combined a stochastic weather generator model with the most current climate change projections to feed a hillslope‐channel sediment cascade model for a major debris‐flow system in the Swiss Alps (the Illgraben). This allowed us to quantify climate change impacts and their uncertainties on sediment yield and the number of debris flows at hourly temporal resolution. We show that projected changes in precipitation and air temperature lead to a reduction in both sediment yield (−48%) and debris‐flow occurrence (−23%). This change is caused by a decrease in sediment supply from hillslopes, which is driven by frost‐weathering. Additionally, we conduct model experiments that show the sensitivity of projected changes in sediment yield and debris‐flow hazard to basin elevation, with important implications for assessing natural hazards and risks in mountain environments. Future changes in hydrological and sediment fluxes are characterized by high uncertainty, mainly due to irreducible internal climate variability. Therefore, this stochastic uncertainty needs to be considered in climate change impact assessments for geomorphic systems. © 2020 American Geophysical Union",,,,"0148-0227||2169-9003||2169-9011",,"10.1029/2020JF005739","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/467211","en","Wiley",,,,"Climate Change Impacts on Sediment Yield and Debris‐Flow Activity in an Alpine Catchment",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-02-02T08:12:23Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099816924",,"000613705000003","J. geophys. res.

Urban mining aims to convert waste materials into raw materials for industrial production, and as a result, address both problems simultaneously. This study explores the potential of urban mining for asphalt pavement surface courses. In the first part, as each country/region has its unique challenge with waste materials, a screening method taking the EU and Switzerland as case studies is employed to select waste materials that potentially qualify for asphalt surface course. The second part presents a review of laboratory studies regarding the performance of asphalt mixtures with selected waste materials. Based on the industrial experience, the third part discusses the technology, specifications and cost considerations of asphalt surface course with waste materials. Furthermore, the technical maturities for using waste materials are estimated in terms of technology readiness level (TRL). Overall, the paper demonstrates that various categories of waste materials can be potentially used in asphalt surface course, revealing urban mining opportunities. The selected waste materials may improve the performance of asphalt mixtures with optimization of several factors, such as the fraction size and amounts of waste materials for addition or replacement. The TRL results showed that using crumb rubber (wet process) and steel slag are currently more mature than using other waste materials in asphalt surface course.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450679",,"0959-6526",,"10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124916","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450679","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","asphalt mixtures||urban mining||waste materials||performance||TRL","Urban Mining for Asphalt Pavements: A Review",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-10T18:34:01Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85096372113",,"000605181700013","J Cleaner Prod.",,"Journal of Cleaner Production","280","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In this work, an alternative full-face mask is adapted from a modified snorkel mask to be used as PPE with two medical-grade filters and a 3D-printed adapter. Since the mask covers the eyes, mouth, and nose, it acts as a full-face shield, providing additional protection to healthcare workers. The SARS-CoV-2 has a size between 60 nm and 140 nm, and airborne viral particles can be carried by larger droplets with sizes up to several millimeters. The minimum filtration efficiency of mechanical and electrostatic filters is usually reached between 30 nm and 300 nm. The filtration efficiency of different medical filters is measured for particles below 300 nm to cover the size of the SARS-CoV-2 and small virus-laden droplets, and determine the minimum efficiency. The filtration performance of the adapted full-face mask is characterized using NaCl particles below 500 nm and different fitting scenarios to determine the minimum protection efficiency. The mask is compared to a commercial respirator and characterized according to the EN 149 standard, demonstrating that the protection fulfills the requirements for the FFP2 level (filtering face-piece 2, stopping at least 94% of airborne particles). The device shows a good resistance to several cycles of decontamination (autoclaving and ethanol immersion), is easy to be produced locally at low cost, and helps to address the shortage in FFP2 masks and face shields by providing adequate protection to healthcare workers against particles <500 nm in size. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,,"0893-228X||1520-5010",,"10.1021/acs.chemrestox.0c00371","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/459459","en","American Chemical Society",,,,"Protection Level and Reusability of a Modified Full-Face Snorkel Mask as Alternative Personal Protective Equipment for Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-05T11:31:35Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099087801",,"000643617000013","Chem.

However, full-scale deployment under mainstream conditions remains challenging for practitioners due to the high stress susceptibility of anammox bacteria towards fluctuations in dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature. Here, we investigated the response of microbial biofilms with verified anammox activity to DO shocks under 20 °C and 14 °C. While pulse disturbances of 0.3 mg L−1 DO prompted only moderate declines in the NH4+ removal rates, 1.0 mg L−1 DO led to complete but reversible inhibition of the NH4+ removal activity in all reactors. Genome-centric metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were used to investigate the stress response on various biological levels. We show that temperature regime and strength of DO perturbations induced divergent responses from the process level down to the transcriptional profile of individual taxa. Community-wide gene expression differed significantly depending on the temperature regime in all reactors, and we found a noticeable impact of DO disturbances on genes involved in transcription, translation, replication and posttranslational modification at 20 °C but not 14 °C. Genome-centric analysis revealed that different anammox species and other key biofilm taxa differed in their transcriptional responses to distinct temperature regimes and DO disturbances.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528462",,"2399-3642",,"10.1038/s42003-020-01534-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528462","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Applied microbiology||Microbial ecology","Temperature modulates stress response in mainstream anammox reactors",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-25T14:12:06Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85098657358",,"000606858400016","Commun Biol",,"Communications Biology","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Most of them rely on empirical or statistical approaches for the interpretation of backscatter intensity measurements and their seasonal variations related to the melting regime of the different glacier zones. This article focuses on the potential of polarimetric SAR measurements to characterize the scattering in the different glacier zones in order to distinguish between them. For this, a general two-component scattering model is proposed, accounting for surface and subsurface contributions in the different glacier zones. The (anisotropic) propagation through snow, firn, and ice layers is also accounted for as it plays an important role in the interpretation of the polarimetric signatures. A set of five polarimetric descriptors is proposed to describe the projection of the model on the SAR measurements. The ability of the model to characterize the scattering in the different glacier zones is validated and discussed at different frequencies (X-, C-, and L-band). For this, a multifrequency airborne SAR dataset acquired by the DLR's F-SAR sensor in West Greenland during the ARCTIC 2015 campaign is used. The achieved results indicate that L-band polarimetric measurements allow to differentiate the different glacier zones based on the subsurface (e.g., volume) scattering characteristics. In contrast, the increased (back-) scattering complexity and the reduced penetration capability limit the potential of X- and C-band polarimetric measurements.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000518625",,"1939-1404||2151-1535",,"10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3126069","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518625","en","IEEE","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Firn line||glacier zones||Greenland||polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR)||polarization phase difference","Model-Based Interpretation of PolSAR Data for the Characterization of Glacier Zones in Greenland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-04T04:52:22Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000722001900007","IEEE j. sel. top. appl. earth obs. remote sens.",,"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The first formation flying radar system was built by extending the TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mission by a second, TerraSAR-X-like satellite TanDEM-X. The resulting large single-pass SAR interferometer features flexible baseline selection, enabling the acquisition of highly accurate cross-track interferograms not impacted by temporal decorrelation and atmospheric disturbances. The primary objective of the mission was the generation of a global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with unprecedented accuracy (12-m horizontal resolution and 2-m relative height accuracy). The main mission phase for DEM data acquisition has been finished in 2014; the processing of the global TanDEM-X DEM was concluded in September 2016. The final DEM product is well within specifications and features an extremely low percentage of void areas. It is of fundamental importance for a wide range of commercial and scientific applications. But the scientific exploitation of TanDEM-X is not limited to the DEM. TanDEM-X has unique capabilities, including along-track interferometry, and new bistatic and multistatic SAR techniques, that support numerous secondary mission objectives. Indeed, some of these experiments were directly performed during the DEM acquisition phase, when suitable satellite formation geometries were available. Moreover, regular acquisitions over selected super test sites enabled multitemporal analyses. A dedicated science phase after the DEM acquisitions included up to 4 km cross-track baselines, operation in the so-called Dual-Receive Antenna mode, as well as a period in pursuit monostatic flight formation. Comparisons of the TanDEM-X DEM with that of SRTM, or among multitemporal TanDEM-X data, revealed dramatic, ongoing, changes in Earth's topography, especially over ice and forests.

However, the penetration of microwaves into snow-covered thick ice and the achievable height sensitivity for tens-of-centimeters thin ice are two major issues, which limit the accuracy of InSAR-derived sea ice topography. Polarimetry provides scattering information concerning the sea ice properties and has the potential, in combination with interferometry, to achieve an accurate reconstruction of a sea ice digital elevation model (DEM). This article studies the relation between polarimetric signatures and sea ice topography, and explores the possibility to compensate the penetration bias by merging copolar coherence into InSAR processing. The newly generated topographic map has a root-mean-square error under 0.3 m. For thin ice below 1 m, a positive relation between copolar phase phi(coPol) and surface height is observed, suggesting that fcoPol can effectively characterize thin sea ice topography. For thick ice with ridges, the maximum polarimetric phase difference Delta phi(maxPol) reveals a particular shape of the coherence region, which can be interpreted as oriented volume scattering. It suggests that the model-based approach using polarimetric SAR interferometry assuming an oriented volume scattering model is promising in measuring the scattering centers in thick and deformed sea ice. The study of polarimetric behavior for the InSAR DEM is, therefore, a step forward toward accurate modeling of sea ice topography from polarimetric single-pass InSAR data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000466496",,"1939-1404||2151-1535","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/451773||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/466496","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3036395","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/471002","en","IEEE","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Polarimetry||sea ice topography||single-pass interferometry||TanDEM-X","Polarimetric Behavior for the Derivation of Sea Ice Topographic Height From TanDEM-X Interferometric SAR Data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-18T01:18:53Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000607413900035","IEEE j. sel. top. appl. earth obs. remote sens.",,"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This allows the simultaneous exploitation of both missions for building larger time series and improving the revisit time of 11 days for each mission up to 4 or 7 days while combining both. The geometric accuracy and the interferometric performance when combining both sensors are investigated, considering different acquisition parameters and land cover types. For this article several images are acquired over German and Spanish calibration test sites. The results obtained when combining acquisitions from satellites of the TSX/TDX and PAZ missions show no loss of performance with respect to image pairs of the same satellite, indicating that both missions might be exploited synergistically in order to improve current monitoring applications or maybe to allow newer application with tighter requirements in terms of revisit time or temporal coverage. In order to explore all these possibilities, a call for scientific proposals will be jointly opened by the coordinators of the scientific activities of both missions in order to explore the simultaneous exploitation of TSX/TDX and PAZ data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000495652",,"1939-1404||2151-1535",,"10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3084401","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495652","en","IEEE","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR)||constellation||digital elevation model (DEM)||PAZ||SAR interferometry||TerraSAR/TanDEM-X (TSX/TDX)","Joint PAZ & TanDEM-X Mission Interferometric Experiments: Interoperability and Products",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-19T02:29:00Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000668882800005","IEEE j. sel. top. appl. earth obs. remote sens.",,"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Here the authors show that flow disorder enhances the effect of chemical gradients in micropockets in a porous medium, which then aid the transport of bacteria. Natural soils are host to a high density(1)and diversity(2)of microorganisms, and even deep-earth porous rocks provide a habitat for active microbial communities(3). In these environments, microbial transport by disordered flows is relevant for a broad range of natural and engineered processes, from biochemical cycling to remineralization and bioremediation(4-7). Yet, how bacteria are transported and distributed in the subsurface as a result of the disordered flow and the associated chemical gradients characteristic of porous media has remained poorly understood, in part because studies have so far focused on steady, macroscale chemical gradients(8-10). Here, we use a microfluidic model system that captures flow disorder and chemical gradients at the pore scale to quantify the transport and dispersion of the soil-dwelling bacteriumBacillus subtilisin porous media. We observe that chemotaxis strongly modulates the persistence of bacteria in low-flow regions of the pore space, resulting in a 100% increase in their dispersion coefficient. This effect stems directly from the strong pore-scale gradients created by flow disorder and demonstrates that the microscale interplay between bacterial behaviour and pore-scale disorder can impact the macroscale dynamics of biota in the subsurface.",,,,"1745-2473||1745-2481",,"10.1038/s41567-020-1002-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/443805","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Chemotaxis under flow disorder shapes microbial dispersion in porous media",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-10-01T07:16:05Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The effect of high-frequency nutrient fluctuations on bacterial growth","176189","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85090978298",,"000569852700003","Nat.

High-speed OH chemiluminescence was employed to visualize the lean-premixed first stage swirled flame and the second stage autoignition flame, and piezo-sensors were used to record the acoustic pressure around the first-stage blow-off condition. The study identified two dominant frequencies in the pressure signals: one at 144Hz when flames in both stages existed in the combustor and the other at 84Hz after the blow-off of the first stage flame. A calculation of the acoustic modes of the sequential combustor, using a Helmholtz solver, revealed that these two frequencies both corresponded to the second eigenmode of the combustion chamber. The sequence of thermoacoustic events associated with the first stage flame blow-off was unraveled for this generic setup, and this analysis could support interpreting the corresponding complex spectral signature in case such an event would occur in a practical system.",,,,"1540-7489||1873-2704",,"10.1016/j.proci.2020.06.238","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454482","en","Elsevier",,,"Sequential combustion||High speed chemilumilesence||Thermoacoustics||Lean blow-off||Autoignition","Investigation of thermoacoustic instability in sequential combustor during first stage lean blow-off",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-12-03T13:56:26Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Tomorrow's Sequential Combustion Technologies for Low Emissions and High Fuel Flexibility","160579","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Assistant Professor (AP) Energy Grants",,,"85091448815",,"000640371900013","Proc.

Therefore, it has been selected as a super-testsite for the TanDEM-X satellite mission. Dense time series with a repeat interval down to 11 d were acquired between 2011 and 2019 using two polarizations (HH and VV) and across-track baselines of 0–1 km. To evaluate the use of interferometric single-pass synthetic aperture radar mission for glaciological applications, we implemented a processing pipeline in interactive data language (IDL) and computed 130 digital elevation models (DEMs) from bistatic radar interferograms. We present a method to circumvent a common pitfall during orthorectification of radar DEM differences. Regression analysis of DEM time series shows a height loss of up to 8 m a −1 on the tongue and 1.5 m a −1 when averaged over the whole glacier area. In spring 2013, we observed X-band penetration depths of 4 ± 2 m in the accumulation area. For strongly crevassed areas, the coherence drops already to 0.5 for across-track baselines B⊥> 200 m. With patch-based incoherent offset tracking, we obtained an almost complete 200 m resolution velocity map. Velocities reach up to 0.8 m d −1 , show a seasonal variability of ± 0.05 m d −1 , and agree within 0.04 m d −1 (root mean square error) with field measurements. Copolar phase differences suggest an approximation of snow accumulation. We demonstrate orthorectification of the backscatter intensity using simultaneously acquired TanDEM-X interferograms, which allows for the decoupling of horizontal velocity estimates from phase-center height changes due to penetration and ice melt.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000483720",,"1939-1404||2151-1535","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494761||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/483720","10.1109/jstars.2021.3078084","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502463","en","IEEE","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Common-band filter||Copolar phase difference (CPD)||Digital elevation model (DEM)||DEM differencing||Geocoding||Great Aletsch Glacier||Offset tracking||Orthorectification||Single pass radar interferometry||TanDEM-X||Velocity||Wave number shift","TanDEM-X: Deriving InSAR Height Changes and Velocity Dynamics of Great Aletsch Glacier",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-11T11:48:36Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000658340100001","IEEE j. sel. top. appl. earth obs. remote sens.",,"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Displacements are determined by the offset where two image templates match best. The match can be evaluated with normalized cross correlation (NCC), in which the height and location of the NCC peak represent the matching quality and the corresponding offset. Attaining robust degrees Met estimations requires an unambiguous tracking of the peak in the NCC noise floor. To improve offset estimations, we propose a cross-correlation stacking method that can significantly suppress the noise floor of NCC. Instead of deriving offsets from each pairwise NCC, we stack a series of consecutive pairwise NCCs and determine the offset after averaging the NCC stack. Thereby, tracking benefits from the redundant information in multiple NCCs and is more robust to noise. We assessed the method by measuring the flow velocity of the Great Aletsch Glacier in Switzerland using image time series collected by the synthetic aperture radar satellites TanDEM-X and Sentinel-1 A. Using relatively small templates of 48 x 48 pixels combined with a stack of seven pairwise NCCs of TanDEM-X images, we obtain velocity fields whose spatial coverage are almost equivalent to the coverage of velocity fields obtained with templates of 96 x 96 pixels applied on a single image pair. Similar improvements in spatial coverage are observed for Sentinel-1 A. The results demonstrate that the stacking method can greatly enhance both the spatial resolution and the coverage of the obtained velocity fields.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494789",,"1939-1404||2151-1535",,"10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3072240","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494789","en","IEEE","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cross correlation||Glacier velocity||Offset tracking||Stacking||Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Cross-Correlation Stacking for Robust Offset Tracking Using SAR Image Time-Series",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T10:21:55Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85104198143",,"000655843100004","IEEE j. sel. top. appl. earth obs. remote sens.",,"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Such an increase in urbanization combined with the effects of climate change alters energy and hydrological fluxes, likely exacerbating urban heat islands (UHI), decreasing outdoor thermal comfort (OTC) in the hot regions of the world, increasing surface runoff, and modifying the availability of water resources. These changes in the urban hydro-climate exposes many people to heat and water related risks, decreases their well-being, and potentially causes feedback loops on energy consumption.   Nature based solutions, such as the increase in urban green cover, are an often proposed mitigation strategy to address these problems of urbanization. However, the quantification of vegetation effects on urban climate and hydrology is lacking, and many urban climate models did not include or simplified vegetation and hydrological processes. The research presented in this thesis addresses this knowledge gap through (1) the development of a mechanistic urban ecohydrological model that accounts for the detailed biophysical and ecophysiological characteristics of urban vegetation and their effects on urban climate and hydrology. Subsequently, the newly developed model is applied to (2) quantify and analyse important mechanisms that govern the effects of tree cover on urban temperatures, and to (3) answer the question to which extent a change in urban vegetation cover and plant traits can provide an improvement of OTC in a tropical city.   The newly developed urban ecohydrological model, Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&C), combines principles of urban canopy with ecohydrological modelling (Chapter 2). UT&C is able to account for the biophysical and ecophysiological characteristics of ground vegetation, urban trees, and green roofs, and their interaction with the urban energy and water budget, including soil moisture at different depths and underneath varying surface types. UT&C calculates transpiration as a function of plant photosynthesis, which is controlled by vegetation physiology and environmental conditions. The model further accounts for interception on plant canopies, ponding on soil and impervious surfaces, urban irrigation, heat transfer into and out of buildings, and anthropogenic heat release. The performance of UT&C is assessed through a comparison of simulated and measured energy fluxes in neighbourhoods in Singapore, Phoenix, and Melbourne, three cities with a distinctively different climate.   Subsequently, the daily and seasonal cycle of urban temperature alterations due to street trees are explained through the separate analysis of the tree-radiation interactions, tree evapotranspiration, and urban aerodynamic roughness alterations caused by trees (Chapter 3). The different tree effects are quantified through a numerical experiment conducted with UT&C. The analysis identifies that a non-transpiring tree canopy could potentially increase urban air temperatures due to a large release of sensible heat, even though it provides shade to the underlying surfaces. This is an important mechanism to consider as high vapour pressure deficits in cities during times of heat can lead to plant stomatal closure and therefore, limit transpiration as shown in the simulations. On the other hand, tree evapotranspiration leads to air temperature cooling. These results highlight the importance of ample soil moisture to sustain cooling benefits of urban vegetation, which might require irrigation at times of water scarcity. Last, a large increase in street tree cover can alter the urban aerodynamic roughness, which influences the convection efficiency of the turbulent transport of heat, and thus urban temperatures.   UT&C is further applied to quantify the effects of urban vegetation fraction, type, and properties on OTC in a tropical city (Chapter 4), which is not straightforward to predict due to the increase in humidity caused by vegetation. A variance based sensitivity analysis of UT&C’s vegetation parameters shows that vegetation fraction has the highest influence on OTC. An increase in tree cover fraction can partially mitigate low OTC during daytime, while increasing vegetated ground fraction improves OTC at night. However, when analysing air temperature during midday, tree physiology can be as important as tree cover fraction. Furthermore, all vegetation parameters combined can alter OTC as much as the vegetation cover fraction in dense midrise areas. Overall, the average OTC improvement caused by urban vegetation in a tropical city is modest due to the increase in humidity, when considering all weather conditions. However, an increase in vegetation cover does not deter OTC in most cases.   Lastly, an outlook on future model developments is provided, such as the inclusion of additional vegetation processes into UT&C and integrating it into larger scale models, which allows to simulate and address further areas of the urban eco-hydro-climatic environment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000499871",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499871","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Urban climate||Urban ecohydrology||Mechanistic modeling||Ecosystem services","Urban Ecohydrological Modelling to Quantify Vegetation Effects on Urban Climate and Hydrology",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2021-08-06T09:44:14Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27259",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Debris-flow (and landslide) early warning systems often rely on rainfall intensity–duration (ID) thresholds. Multiple competing methods exist for the determination of such ID thresholds but have not been objectively and thoroughly compared at multiple scales, and a validation and uncertainty assessment is often missing in their formulation. As a consequence, updating, interpreting, generalizing and comparing rainfall thresholds is challenging. Using a 17-year record of rainfall and 67 debris flows in a Swiss Alpine catchment (Illgraben), we determined ID thresholds and associated uncertainties as a function of record duration. Furthermore, we compared two methods for rainfall definition based on linear regression and/or true-skill-statistic maximization. The main difference between these approaches and the well-known frequentist method is that non-triggering rainfall events were also considered for obtaining ID-threshold parameters. Depending on the method applied, the ID-threshold parameters and their uncertainties differed significantly. We found that 25 debris flows are sufficient to constrain uncertainties in ID-threshold parameters to ±30 % for our study site. We further demonstrated the change in predictive performance of the two methods if a regional landslide data set with a regional rainfall product was used instead of a local one with local rainfall measurements. Hence, an important finding is that the ideal method for ID-threshold determination depends on the available landslide and rainfall data sets. Furthermore, for the local data set we tested if the ID-threshold performance can be increased by considering other rainfall properties (e.g. antecedent rainfall, maximum intensity) in a multivariate statistical learning algorithm based on decision trees (random forest). The highest predictive power was reached when the peak 30 min rainfall intensity was added to the ID variables, while no improvement was achieved by considering antecedent rainfall for debris-flow predictions in Illgraben. Although the increase in predictive performance with the random forest model over the classical ID threshold was small, such a framework could be valuable for future studies if more predictors are available from measured or modelled data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505960",,"1561-8633||1684-9981",,"10.5194/nhess-21-2773-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505960","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Evaluating methods for debris-flow prediction based on rainfall in an Alpine catchment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-19T02:57:31Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Forecast and warning concept for landslides in Switzerland based on rainfall triggering thresholds and multiscale hydrological modelling","165979","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85114790261",,"000695657500001","Nat. hazards earth syst. sci.","9","Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The unpredictability of rainfall timing affects the selection of an optimal growing season, and hence crop production in regions where rainfed agriculture (RFA) is practiced. In this study, we (a) map rainfall timing, and its interannual variability and changes over RFA areas across Ethiopia for the period 1981-2010, and (b) explore the impact of variability in rainfall timing on cereal crop production in the period 1995-2010.  For the mapping of rainfall timing, we used the quasi-global CHIRPS precipitation dataset over Ethiopia. We use information entropy on monthly rainfall to define the rainfall seasonality metrics, i.e. the relative entropy and dimensionless seasonality index, and map them in space. For rainfall timing attributes, we determine the onset, cessation, and length of the wet season from LOESS-smoothed cumulative pentad rainfall anomalies for each hydrological year. Changes in seasonality metrics and rainfall timing attributes are analyzed using non-parametric methods. We show that high seasonality (unimodal rainfall regime) is located in the northern part of the Ethiopian RFA area where high annual rainfall and high relative entropy are coincident, and where the onset of the rainfall season varies between mid-April to late-June and cessation occurs between mid-September to late-October. Low seasonality in the southern part of the Ethiopian RFA area shows low relative entropy regardless of the annual rainfall total. We observed a considerable interannual variability both in seasonality and rainfall timing over the study period, especially in the onset and length of the wet season. The length of the wet season and magnitude of seasonal rainfall are predominantly controlled by the timing of rainfall onset.  For the impacts of rainfall timing on crop production, we used cereal crop production data from the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia for the period 1995-2010 in 45 administrative zones. We carried out a parametric correlation analysis between rainfall timing and rescaled and de-trended crop production anomalies. We observe that anomalies in seasonal cereal crop production in RFA areas are significantly correlated with anomalies in rainfall onset (negatively) and the length of the wet season (positively), with a regional average production loss of 3% per pentad of late rainfall onset, and 2.7% per pentad of shorter length of the wet season. Seasonal rainfall is less strongly correlated with cereal crop production anomalies compared to the rainfall onset. These results show that the interannual variability in rainfall timing (start of the rainy season) even under present climate has strong impacts on crop yields in RFA areas in Ethiopia, and this may be exacerbated in a future climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000520699",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-9279","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/520699","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Regularity of rainfall timing across Ethiopia: implications for crop production",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2021-12-15T09:36:20Z",,,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19–30, 2021","online",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In the Arctic, vegetation is one of these factors, whichever influenced by climate change is undergoing a transformation through an increase in height and extent of shrubs on the tundra. In turn, changes in vegetation also alter the thermal properties of the snow cover in winter due to processes like snow trapping; potentially further warming permafrost. However, permafrost models have been limited in the combined representation of small-scale spatial variability of snow and vegetation. By combining the CryoGrid permafrost model with observed characteristics of local snow cover, vegetation, and soil stratigraphies, the present work investigates the spatial heterogeneity of permafrost active layer dynamics in Siksik Creek, NW Canada. The modelling efforts indicate that vegetation-induced increased insulation capacity of snow cover in winter, has the potential to directly influence the maximum active layer thickness in autumn, albeit to a limited extent. Two main factors, soil moisture content and soil stratigraphy, were found to strongly mediate the strength of this inter-seasonal feedback, which under certain conditions is voided or even reversed. As such, taller shrubs are potentially a stabilizing factor for active layer development due to the insulating effect of drier top soils  as a result of higher evapotranspiration rates. Finally, most of the observed active layer thickness variability in Siksik Creek could be explained due to the combined effects of soil stratigraphies and soil moisture contents.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000518127",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518127","en","ETH Zurich, Chair of Hydrology and Water Resources Management","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Permafrost||Active layer||CryoGrid||shrubification||snow-vegetation processes","Modelling the significance of snow-vegetation interactions for active layer dynamics in an Arctic permafrost region subjected to tundra shrubification",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-12-02T08:25:22Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Due to the reinforcement, flame retardancy and electrical conductivity properties, GRMs have been explored as nanofillers in polymer composites. An increasing production volume of the GRMs and the GRM-containing composites in the market has brought attentions to their potential risks to humans and the environment. The exposure of GRMs or particles released from GRM-containing composites is possible during the production, the use phase, or the end-of-life of the GRMs and the GRM-containing composites. However, there are still a number of polymer systems that have not been investigated. Moreover, there are limited data about the toxicity of the aerosols released from GRMs-containing composites. Therefore, this thesis focused on three main goals. First, to manufacture the GRM-containing epoxy composites and characterize their mechanical reinforcement and the flame retardancy properties. Second, to analyze the physical and chemical properties, the released fraction of GRMs from the composites, and the in vitro toxicity of the released particles from the GRM-containing epoxy composites induced by an abrasion process, which resembled one of the release scenarios by mechanical force during the use phase of the composites. Finally, to investigate the released aerosols from the combustion, which was one of the scenarios that can take place at the end-of-life of the materials, of the GNP-reinforced epoxy composite (EP- GNP) as compared to pure epoxy (EP) in terms of the physicochemical properties and the potential adverse effects. The mechanical reinforcement, flame retardancy, and electrical properties of the epoxy nanocomposites filled with GNP and phosphorous flame retardant, 9,10- dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO) as fillers in epoxy composites (diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A and polyetheramine system) were investigated (Chapter 2). The homogeneous dispersion of GNP (0.1 – 5 wt %) was achieved by using high speed mixer followed by the three-roll milling process, while DOPO (3 – 30 wt %) was incorporated into the epoxy resin by heated stirring. The three-point bending test was carried out to evaluate the flexural modulus and flexural strength of the fabricated epoxy composites. The flame retardancy properties were tested using a cone calorimeter. The electrical properties were assessed based on corona discharge test and electrical resistance. Increasing the loading of GNP until 1 wt % and DOPO until 10 % could improve the mechanical properties of the epoxy composites, whereas higher loadings could reduce the flexural strengths of the composites. The combination of GNP and DOPO could enhance the flame retardancy, based on flame retardancy index (FRI), of the epoxy composites compared to using GNP or DOPO alone. The formulation leading to an improvement in both mechanical properties and flame retardant efficiency of the nanocomposite was 0.5 wt % GNP and 10 wt % DOPO, which did not alter the insulating property of the epoxy resin since the percolation threshold was at 1.6 wt % GNP. The structure–property relationship of the additive-filled epoxy composites obtained from this study can be used as a property constraining guidance to manufacture the composites. The characterization and the in vitro toxicity of the pristine GRMs and the released particles from abrasion of their epoxy composites were determined (Chapter 3). GRMs used in this study included GNP, GO and rGO. The lateral dimension, C/O ratio, thickness, and surface functionality of each GRM were thoroughly characterized. The particle size distributions of the released particles by abrasion measured by a scanning mobility particle sizer and an aerodynamic particle sizer revealed that the abraded particles were in a respirable size range. Since the GRMs that were embedded in the epoxy composite may be released by abrasion and may cause negative health impacts, the released fractions of GRMs were quantified using a lead-labelling method combined with an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. The re- leased fractions of GRMs ranged from 52 % to 92%, depending on the type and size of the GRMs. Raman mapping spectroscopy revealed the defects on the graphitic layers on the GRMs in the abraded particle suggesting that GRMs may be transformed during the fabrication and abrasion process. For in vitro toxicity analysis, human macrophages exposed to the suspensions (5 to 40 μg/mL) of GRMs and particles released from abrasion of GRM-epoxy composites were assessed for several toxicity endpoints including the change in cell morphology, cell viability, oxidative stress, and (pro-) inflammatory responses after 24 h and 48 h. The pristine GRMs could cause dose-dependent oxidative responses, while only large GNP could cause cell death. None of the abraded particles induced negative impacts on cells. A combustion platform has been established to characterize the fire behavior, emissions from combustion and their potential hazards of the EP-GNP compared to EP (Chapter 4). The particle size distributions of the emissions were measured on-line using an aerodynamic particle sizer and a fast mobility analyzer. The emitted particles were collected for further characterization. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis of both airborne fraction and char residue demonstrated that GNP was only present in the char residues, not in the airborne fraction. The airborne particulate emissions from EP-GNP revealed higher polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations, analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, as compared to those from EP. The human alveolar epithelium cells were directly exposed to the emissions at air- liquid interface conditions and the biological effects were evaluated at 24 h and 96 h after exposure. The toxicity endpoints included the change in cell morphology, cell viability, (pro-) inflammatory responses, and the expression of oxidative stress genes (SOD2 and HMOX1) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) gene (CYP1A1), which is responsible for the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism. The emissions from EP combustion induced the pro- inflammatory response (MCP-1 and GM-CSF) and the activation of AhR, but did not cause any effects on cell morphology, cell viability nor oxidative stress genes. Despite a transient decrease in mitochondrial activity at 24 h caused by EP-GNP, but not EP, the emissions from EP-GNP did not induce any additional adverse cell effects in comparison to those from EP. In conclusions, the results from these studies improve the understanding about the role of GRMs to enhance the mechanical strength and the flame retardancy properties of epoxy composites and the physicochemical characteristics and potential hazards of aerosols released from the abrasion and combustion of the GRM-reinforced epoxy composites. These results revealed that the GRMs can be used as nanofillers in epoxy composites mainly due to their beneficial effects, and the limited in vitro toxicity is auxiliary.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000511697",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/511697","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Epoxy Composites Enabled by Graphene-Related Materials: Properties and Hazard Assessment of the Aerosols Released by Abrasion and Combustion",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::540 - Chemistry||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::620 - Engineering & allied operations",,"2021-10-25T14:02:30Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27886",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Regionalised models that can deliver on these aims are emerging, but are currently limited in resolution or have other restrictions. An advanced model can be achieved by exploiting the advantages and overcoming the limitations of top-down and bottom-up approaches. In this article, we describe a highly detailed, spatially-resolved modelling framework that quantifies local activities and simultaneously analyses system-wide environmental and economic effects of planned interventions. We combined an existing, highly detailed bottom-up model for Switzerland (focusing on individual households) with a macro-economic top-down approach by developing a new Swiss sub-national, multi-region input-output model. We conducted two case studies to demonstrate its abilities and to highlight its usefulness. First, production-based greenhouse gas emissions and consumption-based carbon footprints were computed for all Swiss cantons and regional differences, interdependencies as well as embodied carbon flows among regions were investigated. We find that rural cantons have higher production-based emissions per gross domestic product than more urban cantons because of different economic structures. In contrast, certain 'city-cantons' entail highest consumption carbon footprints per inhabitant due to high per-capita gross capital formation. Furthermore, this case study discusses the importance of providing regionalised information on effects of measures along the economic value chains. Second, a detailed scenario assuming a realistic lifestyle change for an actual household and a thorough physical retrofit of its home was set up. Regionalised environmental and economic consequences along the supply chains were evaluated. This case study exemplifies how the modelling framework can be used to inform policymakers about expected benefits and downsides of detailed scenarios and emphasises the importance of considering rebound effects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000464569",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/abcdd5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/464569","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Quantifying carbon flows in Switzerland: top-down meets bottom-up modelling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-22T03:49:36Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099397876",,"000606030200001","Environ.

Precise prediction of human respiratory system deposition of airborne GNPs, especially in alveolar region, is very important for inhalation exposure assessment. In this study, the pulmonary deposition of airborne GNPs was predicted by the multiple-path particle dosimetry (MPPD) model with consideration of GNPs plate-like shape and folded structure effect. Different equivalent diameters of GNPs were derived and utilized to describe different deposition mechanisms in the MPPD model. Both of small GNPs (geometric lateral size dg < 0.1 μm) and large GNPs (dg > 10 μm) had high deposition fractions in human respiratory system. The total deposition fractions for 0.1 and 30 μm GNPs were 41.6% and 75.6%, respectively. Most of the small GNPs deposited in the alveolar region, while the large GNPs deposited in the head airways. The aerodynamic diameter of GNPs was much smaller than the geometric lateral dimension due to the nanoscale thickness. For GNPs with geometric lateral size of 30 μm, the aerodynamic diameter was 2.98 μm. The small aerodynamic diameter of plate-like GNPs enabled deposition in the alveolar region, and folded GNPs had higher alveolar deposition than planar GNPs.

Therefore, it is of paramount importance to be able to identify the sources and to make predictions of suspended sediment load in river basins. However, this understanding is hindered by the very strong spatial and temporal variability of the mechanisms of sediment production and transport. In this thesis, I developed a new hydrology-sediment model for soil erosion and sediment transport in pre-Alpine basins and carried out a numerical investigation of the sources of such variability.  In the first part of the thesis, I investigated the impact of spatially variable climatic and landscape controls for diffuse hillslope erosion and suspended sediment transport. To this aim, I compared simulations on a pre-Alpine basin with uniform and spatially variable precipitation and erodibility. I found that spatial variability of such drivers affects the suspended sediment dynamics, because it determines the location, productivity, and connectivity to the basin outlet of the sediment sources. In particular, our results highlighted the key role of clusters of high soil moisture produced by spatially variable precipitation, and the effect of specific landscape elements acting as obstacles to the sediment flux by a variable surface erodibility.  In the second part of the thesis, the role of localized sources of sediment on the dynamics and provenance of sediment is investigated. In this step, the modelling of hillslope erosion, landslides and incised areas was combined with geomorphic mapping, terrain analysis and sediment tracing with 10Be. The results highlighted that hotspots of soil erosion may dominate the sediment budget of pre-Alpine basins, and the control exerted by their morphological properties on the hillslope-channel connectivity and the sourcing of sediment.  In the third part of the thesis, I explored how the presence of sediment available for transport on the hillslopes and in the channels of a river basin affects the variability and temporal dynamics of suspended sediment. To do so, I simulated conditions of transport and supply limitation, and compared them with observations in several Alpine and pre-Alpine basins. Both simulations and observations indicated that supply limitation reduces the variability of the suspended sediment concentration at the outlet, while the alternation between low and high sediment availability favours it. The observed seasonality of sediment load in the case study is also compatible with the seasonality of the sediment reservoir predicted by the model.   To conclude, in this thesis we present a new model for diffuse and localized soil erosion on the hillslopes and in the channels, and for the routing of such eroded sediment to the basin outlet. The model is used to gain insights into the suspended sediment dynamics of pre-Alpine basins.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000475471",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/475471","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Suspended sediment transport||Numerical modelling||sediment dynamics||pre-alpine river basins","Numerical modelling of suspended sediment transport in pre-alpine river basins",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2021-03-19T09:43:35Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27373",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

But despite countless studies and full-scale applications of AGS, the effect of particulate organic substrate (XB) - the major constituent of organic substrate in municipal WW - on AGS start-up, performance, stability and microbial community is not well understood. Therefore this PhD thesis evaluated physical retention and microbial turnover pathways of XB during AGS sequencing batch reactor (SBR) operation, as well as the influence of XB on formation, process stability, settling performance, nutrient removal and microbial community composition of AGS systems.  Physical retention of XB during AGS-SBR operation was identified as a 2-step process. Firstly, XB sedimented and accumulated in the bottom of the settled sludge bed and was retained through surface filtration by the emerging filter-cake. Thus, attachment to biomass was quite limited. Secondly, XB then was preferentially attaching to the flocs during fully-mixed conditions. Results from mathematical modelling of XB hydrolysis, conversion and turnover resembled and expanded those prior findings. Flocs played a major role in aerobic XB utilisation via aerobic oxidation by ordinary heterotrophic organisms (OHO). Synergies between flocs and granules were observed, where flocs diverted aerobic XB oxidation from the granules and thus supported anaerobic-feast  aerobic-famine conditions for the granules, despite the minor mass fraction of flocs. Long-term operation of AGS systems fed with different WW additionally reinforced the results from physical XB retention experiments and mathematical modelling. Complex WW composed of low volatile fatty acids (VFA) and high XB fractions led to the formation of small granules and 10-40$\%$ ($\%$ of total suspended solids) of flocs as well as to increased start-up time, decreased nutrient removal and settling performance. The microbial community of AGS treating WW composed of XB was characterised by a high abundance of fermenting bacteria, like fermentative glycogen and phosphorus accumulating organisms (fGAO, fPAO, respectively). Simultaneous nitrification-denitrification (SND) was quite limited when AGS was fed with municipal WW containing XB. The main factors influencing SND in those AGS systems were identified to be the dynamic of anoxic formation and decay inside the granule and the availability of organic substrate in the anoxic granule layers. In addition, the PhD thesis could significantly contribute towards practical understanding of AGS for the treatment of municipal WW. Most importantly, AGS was distinguished as hybrid biofilm system, whereby biofilm (granules) and suspended growth (flocs) coexisted in synergy. Optimised aeration strategies such as intermittent aeration were identified to increase SND and total nitrogen removal by AGS systems fed with municipal WW significantly. Overall, AGS proved to be a simple, efficient and stable process for the treatment of municipal WW. However, expectations towards settleability, start-up duration and nutrient removal performance must be lowered if AGS is applied for the treatment of low-strength municipal WW containing XB.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474564",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474564","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Aerobic granular sludge (AGS)||WASTEWATER + WASTEWATER TREATMENT||Particulate substrate||Sequencing batch reactor||Flocs||Hydrolysis||Influent composition||Low-strength municipal wastewater||Microbial community||Simultaneous nitrification denitrification||Total nitrogen removal||Aeration strategy","The effect of particulate organic substrate on the formation, composition and performance of aerobic granular sludge",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::600 - Technology (applied sciences)",,"2021-03-15T10:43:59Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27048",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

One contributing factor is the emission of ultrafine particles from combustion processes. The second contributing factor is the release of aerosolized engineered nanoforms (NFs) from nano-enabled products (NEPs) that are used in daily life, such as cosmetics, sports products, cement or other construction materials and polymeric composites by processes such as abrasion, weathering or incineration. In the year 2010, the world health organization (WHO) classified the soot particles from combustion processes as carcinogenic. Similarly, pristine NFs and released aerosols from NEPs that contain NFs can induce adverse health effects. Size and chemical composition have been found to be determining factors for the toxicity of pristine NFs and aerosols containing NF fragments. Consequently, detailed knowledge of the morphology and chemical composition of the released particles is very important. A comprehensive risk assessment of released particles requires considering NF release and exposure through the entire life cycle of a NEP or a NF, starting from manufacturing, over use to end-of-life treatment, but also the accurate and complete characterization of a sufficient number of aerosols and NFs. An efficient risk assessment of multiple NFs and NEPs can be done via grouping and read-across of NFs or NEPs with similar hazard profiles; the approach of the European project GRACIOUS, to which this thesis contributed a small part by exploring the release and the exposure for various NFs and aerosols. There are data on the physico-chemical properties of generated aerosols and released NFs and the exposure to these particles, but they are in most cases not quantitative. Consequently, this thesis aimed at a quantitative evaluation of aerosol release, the development of precise and fast approaches for the quantification of the released NFs in the generated aerosols and an accurate assessment of the inhalation exposure to aerosols in the nano size range. Important factors for the adverse effects of an aerosol were studied. The investigated factors were the concentration of generated aerosols, the released NF fraction (fraction of freestanding and protruding NFs in an aerosol), the morphology (shape and size) of the aerosol particles, the chemical composition of the aerosols, the lung deposited aerosol concentration, the lung deposited aerosol fraction, the influence of considered concentration metric (number, surface area or mass) on the lung deposition and the fact whether such a concentration metric (i.e. the lung deposited surface area) can be accurately determined. Novel quantitative and qualitative data on aerosol and NF release and exposure were generated, which facilitate together with literature data and novel results from other project partners the grouping and read-across approach. Abrasion and combustion experiments were conducted to simulate aerosol and NF release from NEPs during use and end-of-life treatment. In addition, lung deposition of combustion-generated particles and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was simulated for exposure evaluation and filtration of MWCNTs was assessed. 4 In chapter 2, abrasion-induced release of graphene-related materials (GRMs) from epoxy-composites was evaluated using qualitative (scanning electron microscopy coupled to an energy-dispersive X-ray, SEM-EDX), semi-quantitative (Raman) and quantitative (inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy, ICP-OES) methods. The released GRM fraction was linked to the physical-chemical properties of the GRM, the interaction with the matrix material, the interlayer bonding strength in-between the GRM layers and the characteristics of the composite. 18 to 92 % of the embedded pristine GRMs were released depending on the size and the chemical composition of the GRM particles. Bigger size of the GRM and higher oxygen content on the GRM`s surface led to higher released GRM fractions. Aerosol release from the combustion of polymeric composites with CuPhthalocyanine NFs, applied paint on wood and paper, with Fe2O3 and/or silica SiO2 NFs was studied (chapter 3). The released aerosol concentration was evaluated via FMPS (fast mobility particle sizer) and APS (aerodynamic particle sizer) and aerosol number emission factors (nefs) were calculated. The chemical composition of the aerosols was investigated via SEM-EDX. The concentrations of the Cu, Fe and Si signature elements of the embedded NFs in the aerosol were investigated via inductively coupled plasma-mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS). The generated aerosols showed modified size compared to the pristine NFs and gained their chemical composition mainly from the matrix and only to a minor fraction from the pristine NF. Since the nefs in the FMPS size range were specific for each type of NEP, we conclude that NEPs could be categorized according to their potential to release aerosols when they are burnt. Exposure to aerosols from the most widely spread combustion processes and in ambient air was studied via calculating their lung deposition by using the Multiple Path Particle Dosimetry (MPPD) model. The relationship between the deposited particle fraction and size distribution was established in chapter 4. The results revealed that the lung deposition fraction depended on the diameter of the mode of a aerosol size distribution. It was higher for human beings than for animals. The lung deposition fractions that were calculated based on number were slightly higher than those that were calculated based on surface area or mass. Nevertheless, the dependence on the considered metric (number, surface area or mass) was not strong. Inhalation exposure of single standing airborne multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and CNT agglomerates was evaluated, by assessing their filtration and deposition in the deep lung using calculation models (appendix, section A4.). Previous models were revised and models for realistic CNT mixtures in the air were developed using mixing states of CNT agglomerates and single standing CNTs. The results revealed that filtration, inhalation and deposition were influenced by the agglomeration of the CNTs. The calculated lung deposition for the realistic CNT mixtures and CNT agglomerates showed much higher deposition rates than that for single standing CNTs under a variety of flow conditions. 5 In chapter 5, the effective particle dose in the lung was calculated based on the lung deposited surface area (LDSA), which was determined by combining the lung deposition curves of the MPPD model and the geometric surface area of the particles. It was verified if the application range of nanoparticle surface area monitor (NSAM), which was developed based on the ICRP-model, could be extended to the MPPD model. Deposited concentrations in the alveolar and trachea-bronchial regions were calculated and model-specific calibration factors on the LDSA were developed. It turned out that despite small errors the application range of NSAM could be extended to other lung deposition models. The generated data serve to enhance the understanding of release and exposure mechanisms, explain the influences of the most important factors for the adverse effects of the generated aerosols with NF contents and allow the assessment of the effects of these aerosols on environmental health and safety (EHS). The generated quantification data support the hypotheses for grouping and read-across of NFs of the European GRACIOUS project and were added to the release library of the GRACIOUS project.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474462",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474462","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Experimental release and exposure studies for quantitative and qualitative risk assessment of nanoforms",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-03-15T08:16:16Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27444",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

A study of the sensitivity analysis of bistatic scattering coefficients from bare soil at the Ku-band is presented, with the aim of deepening our understanding of the bistatic scattering features and exploring its potential in soil moisture retrieval. First, a well-established advanced integral method was adopted for simulating the bistatic scattering response of bare soil. Secondly, a sensitivity index and a normalized weight quality index were proposed to evaluate the effect of soil moisture on the bistatic scattering coefficient in terms of polarization and angular diversity, and the combinations thereof. The results of single-polarized VV data show that the regions with the maximum sensitivity and high quality index, simultaneously, to soil moisture are in the forward off-specular direction. However, due to the effect of surface roughness and surface autocorrelation function (ACF), the single-polarized data have some limitations for soil moisture inversion. By contrast, the results of two different polarization combinations, as well as a dual-angular simulation of one transmitter and two receivers, show significant estimation benefits. It can be seen that they all provide better ACF suppression capabilities, larger high-sensitivity area, and higher quality indices compared to single-polarized estimation. In addition, dual polarization or dual angular combined measurement provides the possibility of retrieving soil moisture in backward regions. These results are expected to contribute to the design of future bistatic observation systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000464015",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs13020188","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/464015","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","bistatic scattering coefficient||sensitivity analysis||soil moisture retrieval","Sensitivity analysis of bistatic scattering for soil moisture retrieval",,"Other Journal Item","Open access",,,,"2021-01-20T12:23:20Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099230082",,"000611557200001","Remote Sens.","2","Remote Sensing","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Around 20% of all floods worldwide occur in Africa. The impact of floods can be mitigated with Flood Early Warning Systems (FEWS). Effective FEWSs need early warning dissemination and sound forecasting modeling. Researchers found that media, and recently also social media, are key stakeholders in warning dissemination. Furthermore, researchers investigated the potential of social media in assessing the accuracy or improving early warning dissemination in FEWS. However, little research on these two aspects has been conducted in West Africa. In this study, we aim to address the current warning dissemination in media and social media in West Africa. Furthermore, we investigate if social media can be used to assess the performance of FANFAR, a FEWS in West Africa predicting streamflow. We queried archives of newspapers, radio, and TV and tweets based on the flood event disaster database EMDAT and identified if early flood warnings are issued and whether they differ between events of different magnitude and between countries. Furthermore, we compared the daily number of tweets to the daily forecasted flood risk by FANFAR on a country scale. We employed a flood event detection algorithm developed by de Bruijn et al., 2019, which uses machine learning to identify flood-related tweets. Results show that radio and TV archives that can be systematically queried are, to the best of our knowledge, not available. However, the assessed newspapers often disseminate the warning that has been issued by a governmental meteorological agency. We found, that in Nigeria, more early warnings are issued in newspapers and tweets with an increase in people affected during a flood. We did not observe this trend in Ghana and could not find any early warnings issued in the Ivory Coast or Burkina Faso. Nevertheless, we found that tweets contain links with potential information about flood warning dissemination. Results also show that tweets indicate flooding reliably. However, we found that the assessment of FANFAR based on only flood-related tweets is not adequate. Additional factors, such as rainfall, or systematic lags between tweets and forecasts, could play a role. These factors should be determined on a regional scale. Mostly the influence of rainfall on tweets limits their usage in FEWSs that predict streamflow, such as FANFAR. Nonetheless, in combination with an authoritative dataset, such as streamflow, tweets could provide additional information. Our findings imply that media and social media can be used as a tool for warning dissemination, a source for warning dissemination research, and as additional data to support the assessment of FEWSs. Especially the projected increase of social media in the future will facilitate the improvement of early warning research and FEWSs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000468483",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468483","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Flood||Early Warning||West Africa||Social media","Review of Early Warning Dissemination in Media and Assessment of Flood Early Warning Systems in Media",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,,"2021-02-09T08:11:41Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The big challenge in practical applications is how to describe model uncertainties correctly to avoid the occurrence of spurious covariance during data assimilation. In this study, the ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) is used to estimate parameters and states of a groundwater model in Guantao, China, which updates ensemble means and perturbations separately and avoids the need to perturb observations. The uncertainty in parameters and states decreased with time while assimilating observations. However, incorrect updates of parameters and states were obtained, which could not be corrected by assimilating further observations improving the representation of the hydrological system. To compensate for this effect and reduce other sampling errors introduced during assimilation, localization and two covariance-tuning methods (inflation factor and damping factor) are explored in the study. The results show that alternative scenarios with proper localization length or a large inflation factor or a small damping factor produce better model estimates and improve the filter performance. The scenario with a damping factor of 0.05 shows a distinct gain in model predictive capability. The damping factor method is superior to the inflation factor method and preferable in real field applications. The scenario combining the damping factor with localization further improved the filter performance. The performance of the EnSRF with respect to different amounts of measurement error is also analysed. Even though the increase of observation error can increase the error covariance, a corresponding filter improvement is not observed as in that case, observations are less informative.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000453714",,"0309-1708||1872-9657",,"10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103813","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453714","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Data assimilation||Ensemble square root filter||Groundwater model||Localization||Inflation factor||Damping factor","Improving parameter and state estimation of a hydrological model with the ensemble square root filter",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-30T11:01:21Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85096870290",,"000606419900006","Adv.

The better the reclaimed water quality, the more flexible the possible water reuse and the higher is the fresh water saving potential. Biological activated carbon (BAC) filters can be used as a post-treatment step to improve the quality of the reclaimed greywater. Building-scale greywater treatment and reuse must be able to cope with highly variable nutrient concentrations and flows, which together with irregular reuse patterns lead to periods of water stagnation in the treatment system. In this thesis, we investigated the influence of intermittent flow on: i) biodegradation and adsorption capacity in the BAC filter, ii) the overall total organic carbon (TOC) removal in the BAC filter, and iii) fluctuations in the quality of the produced water. Further, this thesis aims at improving the understanding of the relative importance of sorption and biodegradation for long-term TOC removal in BAC filters and how these processes complement each other, for example to buffer high influent TOC concentrations. In the chapters two to four, the main results from this thesis are presented. In the second chapter, we studied the influence of intermittent flow on TOC removal in lab-scale BAC filters. There was no significant difference in the performance of BAC filters receiving constant or intermittent flow in terms of removal of overall TOC, TOC weight fractions, and bacterial growth potential. Furthermore, no significant differences between the biological activity and the sorption capacity of BAC filters with constant and intermittent flow were observed. Peaks in influent TOC concentrations were attenuated by a combination of biodegradation and sorption as a temporary sink. In chapter three, we monitored short-term fluctuations in the effluent of a building-scale BAC filter with automated online flow cytometry and with a turbidity sensor. Temporarily increased cell concentrations and turbidity in the effluent water after periods of stagnation can be well explained with continuous biofilm detachment in the BAC filter. The observed increase in cell concentrations was neither related to a deterioration of TOC concentration nor to hygiene-relevant parameters such as the concentration of the opportunistic pathogens L. pneumophila and P. aeruginosa. A strong correlation between turbidity and cell concentrations showed that a turbidity sensor is a valuable tool to monitor fluctuations in the water quality after the BAC filter. In chapter four, we studied the long-term TOC removal over more than 900 days of operation of the building-scale BAC filter used as greywater post-treatment after a membrane bioreactor. The TOC removal performance depended on the operational time of the BAC filter, the influent TOC concentration, and for the upper part of the ii BAC filter also on the empty bed contact time. A carbon mass balance over the entire period showed similar importance of biodegradation and sorption on the overall TOC removal. Biodegradation was the main removal mechanism in the upper part of the BAC filter, while remaining sorption buffered high influent TOC concentrations in the lower part. The BAC filter required minimum maintenance in the form of backwashing after more than 800 days of operation for long-term stable TOC removal. Overall, we did not observe negative effects of intermittent flow on the operation and the effluent hygiene-relevant water quality parameters of the BAC filter. Therefore, we do not see a need to buffer intermittent flow. A generous filter design with low average filtration rates and long average empty bed contact times is important to provide low effluent TOC values despite highly variable flow and influent TOC concentrations. Long-term stable TOC removal performance with minimum maintenance is possible due to both biodegradation and sorption in the BAC filter. In conclusion, the BAC filter as post-treatment for greywater after a membrane bioreactor is a low-cost treatment step, which is simple to operate and improves the quality of the reclaimed water.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515085",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515085","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Biological activated carbon filter for greywater post-treatment",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::600 - Technology (applied sciences)",,"2021-11-14T17:40:33Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27652",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This thesis shows that most of these impacts are caused by the extraction and processing of materials, food, and fuels, summarized as “materials” here. With the demand for materials expected to double by 2050, improved sustainability policies are critical. As many materials are produced in another country than ultimately consumed, such policies require detailed information on global value chains and their environmental impacts. Multi-regional input-output (MRIO) analysis plays a key role in providing this information, but several research gaps exist. One gap is the lack of an accurate method for assessing scope 3 impacts of materials, industries, and nations, including cumulative upstream and direct impacts (for any impact category). Also, no method exists for analyzing downstream impacts, which is a particular issue for greenhouse gas (GHG) and particulate matter (PM) emissions of fuels, such as coal. Another gap is the limited spatial and sectoral resolution and the incomplete coverage of sustainability indicators in current MRIO databases. This includes the lack of regionalized assessment of water and land use impacts. Due to these gaps, an accurate and extensive environmental assessment of materials is missing both globally and nationally.  The objective of this thesis was to provide an improved MRIO method and database for creating transparency in global value chains and their impacts, to support sustainable policy-making. For this purpose, a method was developed that allows assessing the scope 3 impacts of any sector and region of an MRIO database (Chapter 2), tracking them along the global value chain (for GHG emissions and any other impact category), and analyzing downstream impacts (for GHG and PM emissions of fuels, Chapter 4 and 5). Furthermore, an automated, transparent, and time-efficient approach was developed to improve the resolution and quality of an existing MRIO database (Chapter 3). It was applied to merge the global MRIO databases EXIOBASE3 and Eora26 and add data from FAOSTAT and previous studies to create an MRIO database with high spatial (189 countries), sectoral (163 sectors), and temporal resolution (year 1995–2015). Finally, a set of sustainability indicators was implemented into the database: Climate change from GHG emissions, health impacts from PM emissions (primary and secondary particles), water stress and land-use-related biodiversity loss (both regionalized), value added, and number of workers (Chapter 2–5).   The importance, versatility, and broad applicability of the improved method and database was illustrated by several application examples. These include a case study on material production globally (Chapter 2) and for the G20 (Chapter 4). An in-depth analysis of the role of coal combustion is provided in Chapter 4 for the production of metals and construction materials, and in Chapter 5 for global plastics production. A detailed analysis of the food supply chain and the related water and land footprint is shown in Chapter 3 for the European Union (EU).  The case study on global material production (Chapter 2) showed that previous MRIO methods either underestimated or overestimated the environmental impacts of material production by 20–60%. The improved method found that material production causes half of global GHG emissions, one-third of global PM health impacts, and, because of biomass production, more than 90% of global water stress and land-use related biodiversity loss. Since 1995, global material-related impacts have increased by 52% (GHG emissions), 56% (PM health impacts), and 22% (water stress). While high-income regions mainly use materials for private consumption, emerging economies use a large share of materials for infrastructure build-up. Although the latter was the main driver of the rising material-related GHG emissions, material-related carbon footprints of high-income regions are still several times higher than those of emerging economies on a per-capita level (year 2015). This underscores the need to decouple environmental impacts from economic growth and to promote sufficiency measures.  Material production for building infrastructure in emerging economies, mainly China, has also driven the increase in the G20's overall carbon footprint (Chapter 4). Since 1995, China’s carbon footprint of metals and construction materials has quadrupled, causing more than 10% of global GHG emissions in 2015. Similarly, the case study on plastics (Chapter 5) showed that plastics-related carbon footprints of China’s transportation, Indonesia’s electronics industry, and India’s construction sector have increased more than 50-fold. Thus, measures to reduce, reuse, recycle, and substitute high-impact materials are critical to mitigate the environmental impacts of the expected economic growth in developing countries.  Reliance on coal to produce materials has been another key driver of the G20’s rising carbon footprint (Chapter 4). In 2015, half of global coal was used for the G20’s production of metals and construction materials, the majority in China and India. Thus, 85% of India’s total domestic coal was used for the production of these materials in 2015. This points to the need for a rapid phase-out of coal and a shift to renewables in the G20’s material production chain. Similarly, it was found that due to the growth in plastics production in coal-based economies, the carbon and PM health footprint of plastics has doubled since 1995 (Chapter 5). In 2015, 6% of global coal electricity was used for plastics production. Moreover, plastics accounted for 4.5% of global GHG emissions. This is higher than expected, as previous studies did not account for the increased reliance on coal energy in the plastics sector. It was also assumed that equal amounts of oil were used as fuel and feedstock in plastics production, while this thesis shows that twice as much fossil carbon is combusted as fuel than contained as feedstock. Even in a worst-case scenario where all plastics were incinerated, the production stage would still contribute most to plastics-related GHG and PM emissions. This means that previous studies have underestimated the relative significance of the production versus the disposal phase, and thus the enormous potential to reduce the carbon and PM health footprint of plastics by renewable energy investments.  High-income regions have significantly contributed to the rising environmental impacts by outsourcing the extraction of resources and processing into materials to lower-income regions with less stringent environmental policies, more water stress, and high biodiversity (Chapter 2–5). Due to increasing imports of plastics from coal-based economies, the share of the plastic-related carbon footprint generated abroad increased to 67% in the EU, 79% in the USA, 90% in Canada, and 95% in Australia in 2015 (Chapter 5). Similarly, the case study on the EU’s water-stress and land-use related biodiversity loss footprint found that most of the associated impacts are caused abroad (Chapter 3). This is mainly attributed to food imports from emerging and developing countries where water is scarce (e.g. Egypt) and biodiversity is high (e.g. Madagascar). The improved spatial resolution (189 countries instead of 49 regions) and regionalized impact assessment led to a significant increase in the EU’s water and land impact footprint induced abroad. These results highlight the need for expanding environmental policy initiatives (e.g., the Paris Agreement and the EU’s Green Deal) from production-based to consumption-based accounting to foster improved supply chain management. This includes the investment in clean energy production throughout the supply chain and the use of regional comparative advantage for reducing water stress and biodiversity loss.  In addition to environmental impacts, the value added and workforce associated with material production are also unequally distributed around the world. Trade in materials reinforces this imbalance (Chapter 2–5). It was shown that although high-income regions strongly rely on low-paid work abroad due to material imports (mainly food), they generate most of the associated value added inland (e.g., due to food processing). The extent of this imbalance was highlighted, e.g., in the G20 case study: Since 2011, the number of workers employed globally to meet Australia’s material demand is greater than the number of workers employed in the entire Australian economy (Chapter 4). Similarly, the plastics case study found that although 70% of the workforce required for plastics consumption in the EU was employed abroad, 80% of the associated value added was generated domestically (year 2015), as only the low-paid steps in the plastics value chain have been outsourced (Chapter 5).  The method and database of this thesis are open access and can be applied by researchers, industries, and policy makers for a more accurate impact assessment of various materials, commodities, industries, and nations. The method is available as a software tool that can be used to track the scope 3 impacts of industries and nations for a range of sustainability indicators along the global value chain (Chapter 2). Future work can apply the approach of Chapter 3 to improve the spatial, sectoral, and temporal resolution and quality of the database by integrating further MRIO databases and data sources. Also, future work is needed to incorporate detailed bottom-up inventories and use remote sensing data to improve the resolution and coverage of life-cycle inventories.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000532983","978-3-907234-92-1",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/532983","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Multi-regional input-output analysis||Environmental footprint||global supply chains||Climate change impacts||Water stress footprint||biodiversity loss||health impacts||material resources||international trade||food supply chains||material production||scope 3 impacts||supply chain impacts||coal combustion||plastics||outsourcing||sustainable consumption||Sustainable development goals (SDG)","Creating transparency in global value chains and their environmental impacts to support sustainability policies",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2022-02-17T08:53:21Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27907",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We measured the stable N-isotope composition of ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate in wastewater cultivations of anammox bacteria. We find that the N isotope enrichment factor 15ε for the reduction of nitrite to N2 is consistent across all experimental conditions (13.5‰ ± 3.7‰), suggesting it reflects the composition of the anammox bacteria community. Values of 15ε for the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate (inverse isotope effect, − 16 to − 43‰) and for the reduction of ammonium to N2 (normal isotope effect, 19–32‰) are more variable, and likely controlled by experimental conditions. We argue that the variations in the isotope effects can be tied to the metabolism and physiology of anammox bacteria, and that the broad range of isotope effects observed for anammox introduces complications for analyzing N-isotope mass balances in natural systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528460",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-021-87184-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528460","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biogeochemistry||Element cycles||Microbial ecology||Pollution remediation||Stable isotope analysis","Nitrogen isotope effects can be used to diagnose N transformations in wastewater anammox systems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-25T14:03:57Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Here we consider heterotrophs that rely on organic carbon as an energy source and present a molecular-level model of cell metabolism that explains the dichotomy between copiotrophs—which dominate in carbon-rich environments—and oligotrophs—which dominate in carbon-poor environments—as the consequence of trade-offs between nutrient transport systems. While prototypical copiotrophs, like Vibrios, possess numerous phosphotransferase systems (PTS), prototypical oligotrophs, such as SAR11, lack PTS and rely on ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which use binding proteins. We develop models of both transport systems and use them in proteome allocation problems to predict the optimal nutrient uptake and metabolic strategy as a function of carbon availability. We derive a Michaelis–Menten approximation of ABC transport, analytically demonstrating how the half-saturation concentration is a function of binding protein abundance. We predict that oligotrophs can attain nanomolar half-saturation concentrations using binding proteins with only micromolar dissociation constants and while closely matching transport and metabolic capacities. However, our model predicts that this requires large periplasms and that the slow diffusion of the binding proteins limits uptake. Thus, binding proteins are critical for oligotrophic survival yet severely constrain growth rates. We propose that this trade-off fundamentally shaped the divergent evolution of oligotrophs and copiotrophs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488371",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009023","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488371","en","Public Library of Science","CC0 1.0 Universal","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/",,"Mechanistic model of nutrient uptake explains dichotomy between marine oligotrophic and copiotrophic bacteria",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-05T02:28:12Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85106371268",,"000664309400001","PLOS comput. biol.","5","PLoS Computational Biology","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Despite the rapid growth of the field, students' exposure to microfluidic technologies is still limited and often insufficient to appreciate the advantages over other commonly used technologies. To this end, we designed a five-day course, ""Microfluidics for microbial ecology,""in which students with very different backgrounds learn the basics of microfluidic technologies and sample a range of applications in microbial ecology. The course was created for Master and Ph.D. students interested in applying microfluidics to their research and, therefore, followed an application-oriented approach. The presentation of critical aspects of fluid flow phenomena at the microscale and an outline of the advantages and constraints of the technology provide students with the background to design and perform microfluidics-based experiments. In order to improve the effectiveness of learning in a class with diverse interests and backgrounds, two active learning exercises were implemented. The first comprised the design of an individualized microfluidics experiment in parallel with the lectures: students were guided to apply each module to their personalized application and discuss it in groups. The second was a group experimental activity, in which students jointly set up, performed, analyzed, and presented a microfluidics-based experiment. Given the multidisciplinary teaching context, the course was able to foster common conceptual ground and promote discussion among students. This application-oriented approach built upon experimental activities and in-class discussion is well suited to promote learning in a technology-related subject such as microfluidics. © 2021 Author(s).",,,,"1932-1058",,"10.1063/5.0038389","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/467413","en","American Institute of Physics",,,,"An interdisciplinary and application-oriented approach to teach microfluidics",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-02-03T03:50:09Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The role of ambient flow and physico-chemical microenvironment in determining the microstructure of the biofilm matrix||The effect of high-frequency nutrient fluctuations on bacterial growth","179834||176189","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","PRIMA||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85099883144",,"000629914700001",,"1","Biomicrofluidics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Intensive fertilization is common to enhance their yields, thus creating negative externalities on water quality that are difficult to evaluate without reliable estimates of nutrient fluxes. We apply a mechanistic ecosystem model, seamlessly integrating land-surface energy balance, soil hydrology, vegetation dynamics, and soil biogeochemistry, aiming at assessing the grassland response to fertilization. We simulate the major water, carbon, nutrient, and energy fluxes of nine grassland plots across the broad European Alpine region. We provide an interdisciplinary model evaluation by confirming its performance against observed variables from different datasets. Subsequently, we apply the model to test the influence of fertilization practices on grassland yields and nitrate (NO−3  ) losses through leaching under both current and modified climate scenarios.  Despite the generally low NO−3 concentration in groundwater recharge, the variability across sites is remarkable, which is mostly (but not exclusively) dictated by elevation. In high-Alpine sites, short growing seasons lead to less efficient nitrogen (N) uptake for biomass production. This combined with lower evapotranspiration rates results in higher amounts of drainage and NO−3  leaching to groundwater. Scenarios with increased temperature lead to a longer growing season characterized by higher biomass production and, consequently, to a reduction of water leakage and N leaching. While the intersite variability is maintained, climate change impacts are stronger on sites at higher elevations.  The local soil hydrology has a crucial role in driving the NO−3 use efficiency. The commonly applied fixed threshold limit on fertilizer N input is suboptimal. We suggest that major hydrological and soil property differences across sites should be considered in the delineation of best practices or regulations for management. Using distributed maps informed with key soil and climatic attributes or systematically implementing integrated ecosystem models as shown here can contribute to achieving more sustainable practices.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000477217",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-18-1917-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477217","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Impacts of fertilization on grassland productivity and water quality across the European Alps under current and warming climate: insights from a mechanistic model",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-01T04:14:32Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103025888",,"000631340900001",,"6","Biogeosciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Here we compare two methods (physically based and probabilistic) for the prediction of shallow rainfall-induced landslides in an application to Switzerland, with a specific focus on the value of antecedent soil wetness. First, we show that landslide susceptibility predicted by the factor of safety in the infinite slope model is strongly dependent on soil data inputs, limiting the hydrologically active range where landslides can occur to only ∼20 % of the country with typical soil parameters and soil depth models, not accounting for uncertainty. Second, we find the soil saturation estimate provided by a conceptual hydrological model (PREVAH) to be more informative for landslide prediction than that estimated by the physically based coarse-resolution model (TerrSysMP), which we attribute to the lack of temporal variability and coarse spatial resolution in the latter. Nevertheless, combining the soil water state estimates in TerrSysMP with the infinite slope approach improves the separation between landslide triggering and non-triggering rainfall events. Third, we demonstrate the added value of antecedent soil saturation in combination with rainfall thresholds. We propose a sequential threshold approach, where events are first split into dry and wet antecedent conditions by an N d (day) antecedent soil saturation threshold, and then two different total rainfall–duration threshold curves are estimated. This, among all different approaches explored, is found to be the most successful for landslide prediction.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000517637",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-25-5937-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517637","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Rainfall-induced shallow landslides and soil wetness: comparison of physically based and probabilistic predictions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-30T03:49:29Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Forecast and warning concept for landslides in Switzerland based on rainfall triggering thresholds and multiscale hydrological modelling","165979","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85119595858",,"000720144600001","Hydrol.

We examined the suitability of the benthic freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca for the examination of the bioaccumulation potential of nanomaterials. A flow-through test system that allows the generation of bioconcentration and biomagnification factors was applied. The feasibility of the system was confirmed in a 2-lab comparison study. By carrying out bioconcentration and biomagnification studies with gold, titanium dioxide and silver nanoparticles as well as dissolved silver (AgNO3) we were able to assess the bioaccumulation potential of different types of nanomaterials and their exposure pathways. For this, the animals were examined for their total metal body burden using inductively coupled mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and for the presence of nanoparticulate burdens using single-particle ICP-MS. The role of released ions was highlighted as being very important for the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of metals from nanoparticles for both examined uptake paths examined (bioconcentration and biomagnification). In 2018 a tiered testing strategy for engineered nanomaterials was proposed by Handy et al. that may allow a waiver of bioaccumulation fish studies using inter alia invertebrates. Data gained in studies carried out with invertebrates like the developed Hyalella azteca test may be included in this proposed tiered testing strategy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528456",,"0045-6535||1879-1298",,"10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127961","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528456","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bioaccumulation||Nanomaterials||Nanoparticles||Hyalella azteca||Risk assessment","Testing the bioaccumulation potential of manufactured nanomaterials in the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-25T14:00:03Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85089470323",,"000595802200101","Chemosphere",,"Chemosphere","263","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In this study, we present oxidation and copper impregnation treatment procedures of activated carbon fibers (ACFs) that resulted in porous structure and surface chemistry modifications.

Based on new mass-flow data, we perform a life cycle assessment that includes the recovery of iron, stainless steel, aluminium, copper, lead, silver and gold. Fraction-specific modelling allows for investigating the effect of the metal fraction quality on the subsequent secondary metal production as well as examining further metal recycling potentials in the residual IBA. In addition, the implications on the landfill emissions of IBA residues to water were quantified. The impact assessment considered climate change, eco- and human toxicity and abiotic resource depletion as indicators.  Results indicate large environmental savings for every impact category, due to primary metal substitution and reduction of long-term emissions from landfills. Metal product substitution contributes between 75% and >99% to these savings in a base scenario (1′000-year time horizon), depending on the impact category. Reductions in landfill emissions become important only when a much longer time horizon was adopted. The metal-based analysis further illustrates that recovering heavy non-ferrous metals – especially copper and gold – leads to large environmental benefits. Compared to the total net savings of energy recovery (215 kg CO2-eq per tonne of treated waste, average Swiss plant), enhanced metal recovery may save up to 140 kg CO2-eq per tonne of treated waste.",,"10.3929/ethz-b-000449383",,"0956-053X||1879-2456",,"10.1016/j.wasman.2020.09.001","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/449383","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Bottom ash treatment||Metal recycling||Thermo-recycling||Life cycle assessment||Landfill emissions||Waste management||Resource quality","The environmental performance of enhanced metal recovery from dry municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-03T03:59:53Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"European Training Network for the remediation and reprocessing of sulfidic mining waste sites","812580","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85094171734",,"000599766200032","Waste Manag",,"Waste Management","119","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

High resolution global gridded reanalyses products present an important tool to understand the already observed changes, and thereby improve future scenarios as the climate evolves. A historical 100-year long district rainfall dataset and a unique set of highly detailed rainfall data from the highveld of South Africa spanning a 10-year period provides an opportunity to independently evaluate the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting ERA5 reanalysis product. Evaluation is challenged by the episodic nature of significant rainfall events of southern Africa as well as differences in spatial and temporal resolution between model output and surface precipitation data. Here we present a convergent methodology spanning annual to event timescales and regional to gauge-level spatial scales in order to identify the characteristics of systematic biases in variability and amount of rain as well as timing of events. We find that ERA5 is consistently wetter than observed in ways that affect the timing of individual events, while performing well on metrics associated with large scale trends and seasonal variability.

In addition to this well-known chemotactic behaviour, several soil and marine bacterial species perform chemokinesis: they adjust their swimming speed according to the local concentration of chemoattractant, with higher speed at higher concentration. A field of attractant then induces a spatially varying swimming speed, which results in a drift towards lower attractant concentrations - contrary to the drift created by chemotaxis. Here, to explore the biological benefits of chemokinesis and investigate its impact on the chemotactic response, we extend a Keller-Segel-type model to include chemokinesis. We apply the model to predict the dynamics of bacterial populations capable of chemokinesis and chemotaxis in chemoattractant fields inspired by microfluidic and agar plate migration assays. We find that chemokinesis combined with chemotaxis not only enhances the population response with respect to pure chemotaxis, but also modifies it qualitatively. We conclude presenting predictions for bacteria around dynamic finite-size nutrient sources, simulating, e.g., a marine particle or a root. We show that chemokinesis can reduce the measuring bias that is created by a decaying attractant gradient.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474651",,"1292-8941||1292-895X",,"10.1140/epje/s10189-021-00009-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474651","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Migration and accumulation of bacteria with chemotaxis and chemokinesis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-15T14:50:57Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Microscale investigation of key bacterial phenotypes enhancing collection by rising bubbles and aerial dispersal","798411||798411||798411","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC||EC","H2020||H2020||H2020",,,"85102562555",,"000629505800003","Eur.

In the proposed approach, all motionless coherent pixels closest to the moving area are defined as seeds surrounding the moving area at the integration step of the CPT. This arrangement consequently minimizes the integration path and the APS effect in the final velocity result. It is designed for terrestrial radar interferometry (TRI) applications. A piecewise processing chain is further introduced as a continuous operational mode processing framework to derive arbitrary temporal displacement patterns in this work. Three-day datasets measured by Ku-band TRI over a mountainous region in the canton of Valais, Switzerland, were used for validation. Through this validation, a comparative study of five algorithms was carried out. This evaluation showed the efficiency of the proposed approach. The proposed approach does not require phase unwrapping, kriging interpolation, and spatio-temporal covariance inference for APS mitigation, which is appropriate for continuous TRI operation.",,,,"1939-1404||2151-1535",,"10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3099873","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502419","en","IEEE",,,"Atmospheric phase screen (APS)||glacier||ground-based radar interferometry||radar interferometry||terrestrial radar interferometry","Efficient Approach for Atmospheric Phase Screen Mitigation in Time Series of Terrestrial Radar Interferometry Data Applied to Measure Glacier Velocity",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-08-27T02:50:09Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85112634972",,"000685889600004","IEEE j. sel. top. appl. earth obs. remote sens.",,"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The WBSCAT instrument is based on a vector network analyzer to cover the 1–40 GHz frequency range, including L-Band. Using ground-based data collected in the near-field to model data collected by satellites is challenging when there is volume scattering from a thick layer such as snowpack. WBSCAT has been constructed to use near-field aperture synthesis to permit focusing of backscatter data. Focusing mitigates the effects of near-field operation by synthesizing a narrow antenna beam that illuminates a smaller volume of the snowpack.

Template edge lengths of 64-12 pixels are common. Furthermore, velocity maps are often incomplete because weakly visible features are obscured by uncorrelated speckle. To improve SAR offset tracking, we propose a new robust method which can significantly enhance both the spatial completeness and the resolution of velocity products by assuming a stationary velocity field. The method minimizes the motion blur of moving features which occurs when SAR backscatter time se- ries are multilooked in time. Our velocity-adaptive temporal multilooking strongly reduces speckle without losing spatial resolution which makes the cross-correlation much more ro- bust even for template sizes as small as 30 x 30 pixels. We demonstrate the method by generating a high resolution velocity map of Great Aletsch Glacier in Switzerland.",,,"978-1-6654-0369-6||978-1-6654-0368-9||978-1-6654-4762-1",,,"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554999","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/496062","en","IEEE",,,"SAR Offset tracking||Glacier velocity||Time series||Temporal multilooking||Motion blur||Autofocus","Measuring Glacier Velocity by Autofocusing Temporally Multilooked SAR Time Series",,"Conference Paper","Metadata only","2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS",,,"2021-07-19T15:21:26Z",,,,,,,"yes","41st Annual International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2021)","July 12-16, 2021","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Specifically, changes in the order of a fraction of the electromagnetic wavelength occurring in the imaged areas can be measured via repeat-pass differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR), in which temporally separated SAR acquisitions of the same area are coherently combined.   In this context, spaceborne SAR systems are an invaluable asset thanks to their capability to provide global coverage over extended periods of time.  However, due to the fixed satellite revisit time, the temporal resolution of spaceborne SAR systems can be insufficient to monitor fast surface changes. Furthermore, the monitoring of areas characterised by steep slopes  with respect to the radar look angle, such as in mountainous regions, is challenged by geometric distortions occurring in the SAR imagery  due to the acquisition geometry, such as layover and shadowing.  On the other hand, airborne SAR systems can offer a larger flexibility in terms of revisit time and, potentially, more favourable acquisition geometries for the observation of steep slopes, but their extended and regular use is limited by the high acquisitions cost.  In light of the above, ground-based (or terrestrial) radar systems offer valuable and complementary monitoring capabilities. In fact, despite the lower coverage area compared to airborne and spaceborne systems, ground-based radar systems can easily achieve high temporal resolutions, on the order of minutes or even seconds, necessary to sample fast and potentially non-linear deformation phenomena at low acquisitions cost. Furthermore, they offer an optimal acquisition geometry for steep surface slopes, which makes them ideal for monitoring local-scale surface changes such as rockfall and landslides.   Nevertheless, given the limited length of their (real or synthetic) antenna, ground-based radar systems are constrained to use high frequency bands, typically X- or Ku-band, to achieve good azimuth resolutions. However, the temporal decorrelation behavior of high frequency bands is such that the monitoring capabilities of ground-based systems are limited to short time spans or to surfaces free of vegetation cover due to the high temporal decorrelation of the high frequency bands.  With the objective to monitor deformation phenomena over relatively long time spans also in natural areas potentially covered by vegetation, the use of radar systems operating in lower frequency bands, such as L-band, is desirable to achieve better decorrelation properties over time (lower temporal decorrelation).  To this aim, it is necessary to remove the physical constraint on the maximum achievable length of the synthetic antenna.  In this research work a car-borne SAR system aimed at DInSAR applications in natural areas is presented. A car-borne SAR allows to employ a radar transmitter operating at L-band while still achieving a good azimuth resolution thanks to the possibility to form long synthetic apertures through the movement of the car along a (potentially curvilinear) road. Furthermore, given the availability of a sufficiently long road with unobstructed line of sight to the target area, the car-borne system can theoretically achieve the full SAR azimuth resolution equal to half the length of the real antenna. Nevertheless, compared to rail-based or stationary radars, a car-borne SAR system requires accurate position and attitude measurements of the antenna phase centre during the acquisitions in order to minimize focusing errors. Inertial navigation systems integrated with global navigation satellite systems (INS/GNSS) are typically employed for such purpose.  The first investigation presented in this dissertation reports the analysis of the positioning accuracy of a high-performance INS/GNSS system achieved both within the SAR integration time and between different passes of the radar platform, relevant for repeat-pass DInSAR applications. A controlled (rail-based) setup was employed to achieve an almost perfect repeatability of the radar platform over multiple passes while performing positioning and radar measurements. The positioning accuracy was assessed in function of the distance of the platform from different GNSS reference stations employed for differential GNSS processing. The impact of the positioning errors on the repeat-pass interferometric performance was then evaluated by analysing the differential interferometric phase obtained with SAR data focused with each of the different INS/GNSS trajectories and by comparing it with the interferometric phase of SAR data focused with the nominal trajectory. Additionally, a non-standard interferometric combination of the SAR imagery, entailing the use of SAR acquisition pairs focused from the same raw data but using the nominal trajectory and the measured one, respectively, allowed to isolate the positioning-related phase errors from the interferometric phase owed to surface deformations and to tropospheric phase gradients.  The results showed the interferometric phase error trends caused by the limited positioning accuracy achieved by using remote reference stations of the national network of permanent GNSS receivers as a consequence of the large influence of the post-processed GNSS data on the final positioning solution.  On the other hand, a large reduction of interferometric phase errors can be accomplished by using a GNSS receiver located in the vicinity of the SAR platform during the SAR acquisitions, indicating that such approach is critical for DInSAR applications.   The second investigation is focused on the repeat-pass interferometric performance achievable with the L-band car-borne SAR system when employed for the observation of a natural terrains characterised by the presence of vegetation. In particular, the objective was to evaluate the level of interferometric coherence and phase stability achievable in different classes of land cover over short and medium time spans (on the order of minutes, hours, and days) and with increasing temporal baselines. Additionally,  an analysis of the interferometric fluctuations in relation to the environmental state of the imaged areas subject to time-varying weather conditions was conducted. The results showed an overall high coherence level with temporal baselines up to about two weeks also in vegetated areas, denoting the limited temporal decorrelation in such time span thanks to the robustness of the L-band electromagnetic signals towards small changes in the imaged area and the potential to perform deformation monitoring in natural terrains.  The strong influence of the environmental changes on the interferometric coherence and phase was also observed, in particular due to wind and changes in the moisture level due, for example, to rainfalls, with marked differences depending on the land cover type.  In conclusion, a car-borne SAR is a valuable remote sensing system that can complement the existing spaceborne and airborne SAR systems for the retrieval of geophysical information of interest in a flexible and cost-effective fashion.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529302",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529302","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Radar||Radar remote sensing||Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)||Car-borne SAR||Terrestrial radar interferometry (TRI)||Interferometry||SAR interferometry (InSAR)||InSAR time series||Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR)||GNSS","A car-borne SAR system for deformation monitoring: positioning and interferometric performance analysis",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::600 - Technology (applied sciences)",,"2022-01-27T16:16:12Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27940",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.
