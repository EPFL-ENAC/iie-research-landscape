A cornerstone among all human activities is food consumption, which is responsible for roughly one third of all environmental impacts of consumption. The food supply chain is inefficient, as present studies estimate roughly one third of the edible food to be wasted globally. There are numerable political commitments to dramatically reduce FW, notably the UN’s recently released Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) calling to halve per-capita retail and consumer food waste (FW) by 2030. In order to identify promising interventions for FW reduction and to involve the key stakeholders able to successfully implement such interventions, detailed quantitative information on the amount, origin, and environmental impact of FW is needed. There has been an increasing body of literature related to FW in the past years. Nevertheless, due to data inconsistency and a narrow temporal, geographical, and food supply chain coverage in present literature, FW quantification is still associated with large uncertainties and based on many assumptions. Due to insufficient data about the composition and the treatment methods of FW, existing environmental assessments are rough estimations. Thus, the present state of knowledge is insufficient to under-stand the current situation and to quantify the future reduction potential.  The goal of this dissertation was to provide methods and data to identify FW hotspots in terms of amounts and environment and assess reduction measures. We therefore developed a new approach that can be applied to food systems of any region or country and that would provide a solid information base to support the identification, prioritization, and implementation of effective strategies for FW reduction.  To reach this goal, we defined three subgoals: 1) The creation of a simplified model of the food value chain in form of a mass flow analysis (MFA) in order to understand the system and to quantify FW by origin and type of food. 2) The extension of the model with life cycle assessment (LCA) in order to quantify environmental impacts of FW and to identify hotspots of environmental relevance. 3) For a selection of hotspots identified in subgoal 2, the assessment of case studies, in which measures for FW reduction are exemplarily implemented and their effect measured in terms of mass and environmental impacts.  The thesis starts with a bottom-up quantification of FW across the entire food system related to Swiss food consumption. We chose this life-cycle consumption based perspective, which includes domestic production and net imports, in order to capture the FW-related resource use and emissions induced by Swiss consumers. The result is an MFA of the entire food value chain including the stages ‘agricultural production’, ‘trade’, ‘processing’, ‘retail’, ‘food services’, and ‘households’ and encompassing relevant methods of FW treatment (‘animal feeding’, ‘anaerobic digestion’, ‘composting’, ‘incineration’, ‘disposal in the sewer’). We thereby differentiated 33 food categories as well as edible and inedible parts of food (avoidable and unavoidable FW). Since the unit “wet weight” of FW, which was used in the MFA, is not an appropriate indicator for the nutritional value of food, we converted the MFA into an energy flow analysis (EFA) based on the nutritional value of food and FW. The results identify wasted ‘fresh vegetables’ and ‘cereals’ to be the main quantitative hotspots in terms of mass and ‘cereals’ and ‘oils and fats’ in terms of nutritional energy. The stage of the food value chain contributing most to total FW amounts were ‘households’ (40% in terms of energy). However, these results do not necessarily reflect the environmental relevance of FW. In the next step we therefore coupled the MFA with life cycle inventory data. We adopted and extended the system boundary of the MFA in order to take the entire life cycle of all inputs into account (agricultural production, transport, cooling, processing, cooking, and partly packaging). In addition, we modelled the environmental impacts of FW treatment. In order to consider useful outputs from FW treatment (e.g. energy and fertilizer from anaerobic digestion), we adopted the method of ‘system expansion’ and substituted heat from natural gas, electricity from the Swiss grid, nutrients by inorganic fertilizer, and organic matter by peat. Since the nutritional values of the products within some of the 33 modelled food categories varied considerably, we allocated environmental impacts to consumed and wasted food based on their nutritional value. This is important since allocation by mass would imply that, for instance, 1kg of whey can substitute 1kg of cheese, which is unrealistic. The life cycle impact assessment was carried out for the impact categories ‘climate change’, ‘biodiversity loss due to land and water use’, and the aggregated method ‘ReCiPe’. The results showed that the total climate change impacts of food consumption could be reduced by 25% if all edible FW was avoided. Furthermore ‘fresh vegetables’, ‘whey’, and ‘beef’ were identified as hotspots for climate change and ‘cocoa’, ‘beef’, and ‘wheat’ as hotspots for ‘global biodiversity loss’. The impact assessment confirmed the results of the MFA that ‘Households’ are key actors for FW, contributing 51% to the climate change impacts and 41% to biodiversity loss caused by total FW.  Since it is unrealistic to avoid all FW, in a next step we analyzed the effect of measures for FW reduction in real case studies. We therefore selected the food service sector, since the rate of FW has been identified to be largest in households and food services and since the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment chose the food service sector as a starting point to develop its strategy to reduce FW. We analyzed 13 case studies, in which food services implemented measures for FW reduction and measured their FW before and after implementation. We then extrapolated the achieved reduction to the entire food service sector, by weighing the subsectors ‘restaurants’, ‘school and university canteens’, ‘hospitals and care centers’, ‘business canteens’, and ‘hotels’ proportionally to the number of meals consumed in each subsector. In order to increase the reliability of the status quo FW amounts in individual subsectors, we included additional publications from Germany, Austria, Finland, and the UK and thus based our results on 1’042 measurements of status quo FW amounts. Considering the FW composition in the status quo and the reduction scenario, we calculated the environmental benefits of potential future FW reduction. In addition to this base scenario, which assumes that all food services achieve the same reduction as our case studies in the corresponding subsector on average, we calculated an extended scenario, in which food services additionally buy 50% of their vegetables from non-marketable origin and thus prevent them from being wasted in the supply chain. The results show that in-house FW is reduced by 38% and related climate impacts by 41% in the base scenario. In the extended scenario an additional 32% of FW and 17% of climate impacts can be saved by using products which otherwise would have been wasted in the supply chain. Thus, the SDG of halving per-capita FW was not reached in the food service sector by the base scenario, but by the extended scenario it was. This shows the importance of considering all stages of the food value chain in order to develop effective reduction strategies. Additionally, we quantified FW per meal in the entire supply chain of a progressive restaurant specialized on FW minimization. With 26 g/meal FW over the entire food value chain, this restaurant only causes 10% of the 252 g/meal estimated for average food services, suggesting that FW reduction on the long-term is larger than the achievements in our case studies, if innovative approaches are implemented. Another way of reducing FW is to improve supply chains logistically, e.g. due to improved cooling systems or packaging for enhanced food preservation. In addition to the environmental benefits from reducing FW, in such cases also the additional environmental impacts of the improved cooling or packaging system need to be considered. We therefore coupled the LCA with a quality evolution model based on the thermophysical cooling history of the product. With the new methodology we exemplarily analyzed different supply chain options for oranges imported from South Africa and Spain to Switzerland, differentiating 3 cold chains (‘forced-air precooling’, ‘cold storage’, ‘ambient loading’) and three types of packaging (‘standard box’, ‘supervent box’, ‘opentop box’). The results identify a trade-off between direct environmental impacts of the cold chain and indirect environmental impacts from potential FW reduction due to better quality, which can only be evaluated by coupling the product’s quality evolution empirically to the FW amounts. While this was not yet done in the current study, in some cases the optimal solution could be identified without further analyses, e.g. in the case of precooling with solar energy, which saves environmental impacts compared to diesel-driven cooling in the container and provides better quality of the products. We conclude that the method applied in the thesis of coupling MFA and EFA with LCA turned out to be an appropriate methodology to calculate environmental impacts of FW. The methodology represents a solid basis for further development and extensions into a model to evaluate scenarios and to support stakeholders in the food industry and policymakers to develop successful strategies to reduce FW and related environmental effects. By combining LCA with quality evolution modelling (and its implications on FW), such a model could be used to logistically improve supply chains. Digitalization and monitoring of parameters influencing the products’ quality (such as temperature, quality, degrees brix, etc.) can give new insights about the products’ storage life and help to improve food management. A further breakdown of food categories and the integration of a dynamic transport and seasonality model, which calculate environmental impacts depending on the season and the origin of the food, would further improve the quality of the results.","application/pdf||application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","10.3929/ethz-b-000347342","978-3-906916-64-4",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/347342","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","food waste||food waste prevention||MFA||LCA","Environmental Assessment of Food Losses and Reduction Potential in Food Value Chains",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::660 - Chemical engineering||DDC::5 - Science","2019-06-13T13:08:19Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"25648",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In this context, an impact assessment methodology is indispensable for the identification and assessment of the potential consequences of freshwater consumption in relation to agricultural water scarcity. This paper reports on the consistent development of midpoint and endpoint characterisation factors (CFs) for assessing these impacts.  Methods Midpoint characterisation factors focus specifically on shortages in food production resulting from agricultural water scarcity. These were calculated by incorporating country-specific compensation factors for physical availability of water resources and socio-economic capacity in relation to the irrigation water demand for agriculture. At the endpoint, to reflect the more complex impact pathways from food production losses to malnutrition damage from agricultural water scarcity, international food trade relationships and economic adaptation capacity were integrated in the modelling with measures of nutritional vulnerability for each country.  Results and discussion The inter-country variances of CFs at the midpoint revealed by this study were larger than those derived using previously developed methods, which did not integrate compensation processes by food stocks. At the endpoint level, both national and trade-induced damage through international trade were quantified and visualised. Distribution of malnutrition damage was also determined by production and trade balances for commodity groups in water-consuming countries, as well as dependency on import ratios for importer countries and economic adaptation capacity in each country. By incorporating the complex relationships between these factors, estimated malnutrition damage due to freshwater consumption at the country scale showed good correlation with total reported nutritional deficiency damage.  Conclusions The model allows the establishment of consistent CFs at the midpoint and endpoint for agricultural water scarcity resulting from freshwater consumption. The complex relationships between food production supply and nutrition damage can be described by considering the physical and socio-economic parameters used in this study. Developed CFs contribute to a better assessment of the potential impacts associated with freshwater consumption in global supply chains and to life cycle assessment and water footprint assessments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000091969",,"0948-3349||1614-7502","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/310538||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/91969","10.1007/s11367-014-0811-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/311178","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Agricultural water scarcity||Economic adaptation||Food stock compensation||Freshwater consumption||International trade||Undernourishment||Water footprint","Consistent characterisation factors at midpoint and endpoint relevant to agricultural water scarcity arising from freshwater consumption",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T13:34:13Z",,,,"pub:144821","yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936527ec9fc779922","001546331",,,"000451039500002","Int J Life Cycle Assess","12","The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We contribute a modeling framework to assess the impacts of different climate change and energy policies on the operations of hydropower reservoir systems in the Alps. Our approach is characterized by the following: (i) the use of a physically explicit hydrological model to assess future water availability; (ii) the consideration of electricity price scenarios obtained from an electricity market model accounting for the future projected European energy strategies; and (iii) the use of optimization techniques to design hydropower system operations in response to the projected changes. Through the application to the Mattmark system, a snow‐ and ice‐dominated hydropower system in Switzerland, we demonstrate how the framework is effective in exploring the sensitivity of Alpine hydropower to changes in water availability and electricity price, in quantifying the uncertainties associated to these projections and in identifying the value of reoperation strategies. Results show that energy policies may have more significant impacts on hydropower operations than climate change and, as such, are worth considering in impact assessments studies. The reduction of water availability due to climate change is expected to induce a loss in electricity production down to −27% by 2050. Changes in electricity price, instead, may have up to 6 times stronger impact than climate change, leading to an increase in hydropower revenue up to about +181%.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000322390",,"0043-1397||1944-7973","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/313286||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/221105","10.1029/2017WR022289","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322390","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","water resoures management||large hydropower operations||Climate change scenarios||electricity price scenarios||water and energy||energy policy","A comparative assessment of the impact of climate change and energy policies on Alpine hydropower",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-12-14T13:51:47Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85056844355",,"000453369400033","Water Resour.

In order to optimize their performance, it is necessary to reduce the amount of energy per unit of crop produced. This requires a combined assessment of greenhouse energy balance and crop growth, as well as their interaction. In this work, more than 30 existing greenhouse models are reviewed and different algorithms are combined to propose an integrated energy-yield model. The physical model of greenhouse energy demand is based on the dynamic energy and mass balance while yield production is based on a physiological crop model. The integrated model is validated with observed energy demand and crop yield datasets during one full tomato growing period. There was good agreement between modeled results and measured data. The key ad- vantage of the integrated model is that it can analyze drivers for greenhouse energy losses and quantify the influence of measures on both energy demand and crop yield. Due to the model's dynamic and high temporal resolution, it is possible to study the use of renewable energy sources in greenhouse operation, as illustrated for thermal storage by means of phase change materials. A sensitivity analysis by changing day/night temperature, CO2 indoor concentration and artificial lighting is performed. The results illustrate how the model can be used for optimizing the performance of greenhouses in terms of specific energy demand (energy per crop produced). Therefore, the integrated model can be a tool for determining the optimum design and control parameters, which is particularly relevant for growers and sustainable agriculture systems in general. This study presents a para- metric decision support tool that assists planers with optimizing energy performance of greenhouses while analyzing the trade-off between energy demand and crop yield.",,,,"1364-0321",,"10.1016/j.rser.2018.06.046","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/285431","en","Elsevier",,,,"A novel integrated framework to evaluate greenhouse energy demand and crop yield production",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2018-08-29T13:29:43Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85052451513",,"000446310700036","Renew. sustain. energy rev.",,"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","96","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Current models are phenomenological and specific to nutrient‐rich, exponentially growing cells, thus cannot predict the first division under limiting nutrient availability. To assess this regime, we supplied starving Escherichia coli with glucose pulses at increasing frequencies. Real‐time metabolomics and microfluidic single‐cell microscopy revealed unexpected, rapid protein, and nucleic acid synthesis already from minuscule glucose pulses in non‐dividing cells. Additionally, the lag time to first division shortened as pulsing frequency increased. We pinpointed division timing and dependence on nutrient frequency to the changing abundance of the division protein FtsZ. A dynamic, mechanistic model quantitatively relates lag time to FtsZ synthesis from nutrient pulses and FtsZ protease‐dependent degradation. Lag time changed in model‐congruent manners, when we experimentally modulated the synthesis or degradation of FtsZ. Thus, limiting abundance of FtsZ can quantitatively predict timing of the first cell division.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000301720",,"1744-4292",,"10.15252/msb.20188623","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/301720","en","EMBO Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","division||Escherichia coli||FtsZ||protein degradation||starvation","Synthesis and degradation of FtsZ quantitatively predict the first cell division in starved bacteria",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-11-07T14:31:07Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85056260109",,"000451579500002","Mol Syst Biol","11","Molecular Systems Biology","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This study first presents a detailed characterization of the individual inputs to hand washing water. We demonstrate (i) that soap is likely the most significant input in hand washing water, representing ∼90% of mass loading, and (ii) that inputs to hand washing water have low concentrations of biologically-essential macro- and micro-nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, copper, zinc, molybdenum and cobalt) with respect to carbon, which may impair biological carbon removal. This study next formulates a recipe that recreates a representative composition of hand washing water and develops a procedure to identify and supplement nutrients in which this recipe is estimated to be deficient. Batch testing of the nutrient-supplemented hand washing water with an inoculum of planktonic bacteria demonstrated improved assimilable organic carbon removal (99% vs. 86% removal) and produced lower final dissolved organic carbon concentrations (1.7 mgC/L vs. 3.5 mgC/L) compared to realistic (nutrient-deficient) washing water. Supplementing nutrients did promote cell growth (50x higher final total cell count). Full-scale testing in a biologically activated membrane bioreactor (BAMBi) system treating 75 L/day of nutrient-supplemented hand washing water showed that long-term operation (100 days) can deliver effective carbon removal (95%) without detrimental fouling or other disruptions caused by cell growth. This work demonstrates that biological treatment in a BAMBi system, operated with appropriate nutrient-balancing offers an effective solution for decentralized treatment of light greywater.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000286446",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2018.07.005","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/286446","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Soap||Nitrogen||Micro-nutrients||Biologically activated membrane bioreactor (BAMBi)||Gravity-driven membrane (GDM)||Handwashing","Chemical composition, nutrient-balancing and biological treatment of hand washing greywater",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-09-03T07:40:18Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85052282639",,"000447569300072","Water Res.",,"Water Research","144","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Here, we profiled relative abundances (as a fraction, normalized by 16S rRNA gene) of 30 ARG subtypes resistant to seven common classes of antibiotics, which are quinolones, β-lactams, macrolides, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, and vancomycins, in ambient total particulate matter (PM) using a novel protocol across 19 world cities. In addition, their longitudinal changes in PM2.5 samples in Xi’an, China as an example were also studied. Geographically, the ARGs were detected to vary by nearly 100-fold in their abundances, for example, from 0.07 (Bandung, Indonesia) to 5.6 (San Francisco, USA). The β-lactam resistance gene blaTEM was found to be most abundant, seconded by quinolone resistance gene qepA; and their corresponding relative abundances have increased by 178% and 26%, respectively, from 2004 to 2014 in Xi’an. Independent of cities, gene network analysis indicates that airborne ARGs were differentially contributed by bacterial taxa. Results here reveal that urban air is being polluted by ARGs, and different cities are challenged with varying health risks associated with airborne ARG exposure. This work highlights the threat of urban airborne transmission of ARGs and the need of redefining our current air quality standards in terms with public health.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000283454",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.8b02204","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/283454","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Global Survey of Antibiotic Resistance Genes in Air",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-08-20T14:19:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85054068141",,"000446542100010","Environ.

Previous research revealed that the transpiration-to-evapotranspiration ratio (T/ET) is well constrained across ecosystems and is nearly independent of vegetation characteristics and climate. Here we investigated the reasons for such a global constancy in present-day T/ET by jointly analysing observations and process-based model simulations. Using this framework, we also quantified how the ratio T/ET could be influenced by changing climate. For present conditions, we found that the various components of land surface evaporation (bare soil evaporation, below canopy soil evaporation, evaporation from interception), and their respective ratios to plant transpiration, depend largely on local climate and equilibrium vegetation properties. The systematic covariation between local vegetation characteristics and climate, resulted in a globally constrained value of T/ET = ~70 ± 9% for undisturbed ecosystems, nearly independent of specific climate and vegetation attributes. Moreover, changes in precipitation amounts and patterns, increasing air temperatures, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and specific leaf area (the ratio of leaf area per leaf mass) was found to affect T/ET in various manners. However, even extreme changes in the aforementioned factors did not significantly modify T/ET.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302302",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aae267","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302302","en","IOP","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","T/ET||evapotranspiration partitioning||ecohydrology||modelling||climate change","Covariation of vegetation and climate constrains present and future T/ET variability",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-11-09T05:11:56Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85055816082",,"000446692100003","Environ.

This requires to estimate and correct small residual motion errors (RMEs) within the accuracy limits of the sensor navigation subsystem, e.g., using residual motion compensation (MoCo) algorithms. Because of their data-driven nature, the performance of these algorithms severely degrades for heavily decorrelated interferograms. This letter proposes a generic RME estimation and compensation strategy optimally estimating RME in a stack of SAR acquisitions, where some interferometric pairs are strongly affected by decorrelation. The algorithm works even if the whole scene decorrelates, as long as the coherence magnitude is reasonably high over short temporal and spatial baselines. The approach entails correcting the navigation data of each slave image of a one-to-many interferometric network with a cumulative correction. The summation is over the results of a precursory application of a general data-driven residual MoCo algorithm (e.g., multisquint) to interferometric pairs for which the impact of interferometric decorrelation is marginal (i.e., small temporal and/or spatial baselines). Compared to other RME correction strategies, the main appeal of the proposed approach lies in the simplicity of its implementation. The overall methodology is tested on a zero-baseline time series acquired at L-band by the German Aerospace Center's airborne system F-SAR.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000278793",,"1545-598X||1558-0571","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/275281||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/278643","10.1109/lgrs.2018.2848596","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/278793","en","IEEE","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Remote sensing||Interferometry||Motion compensation (MoCo)||Processing||Repeat-pass||Residual motion errors (RMEs) estimation||Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","A Motion Compensation Strategy for Airborne Repeat-Pass SAR Data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-07-12T05:52:12Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85049469405",,"000446334500022","IEEE geosci. remote sens. lett.","10","IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Many contain supraglacial pond networks that enhance melt rates locally, but no large‐scale assessment of their impact on melt rates exists. Here we use surface energy balance modeling forced using locally measured meteorological data and monthly satellite‐derived pond distributions to estimate the total melt enhancement for the four main glaciers within the 400‐km2 Langtang catchment, Nepal, for a 6‐month period in 2014. Ponds account for 0.20 ± 0.03 m/year of surface melt, representing a local melt enhancement of a factor of 14 ± 3 compared with the debris‐covered area, and equivalent to 12.5 ± 2.0% of total catchment ice loss. Given the prevalence of supraglacial ponds across the region, our results suggest that effective incorporation of melt enhancement by ponds is essential for accurate predictions of future mass balance change in the region.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000316055",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2018gl079678","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316055","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Surface Pond Energy Absorption Across Four Himalayan Glaciers Accounts for 1/8 of Total Catchment Ice Loss",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-15T15:38:48Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Geophys.

Yet, on-site wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) suffer from bad reputation due to their high failure rate. However, the poor performance is by a great deal caused by the insuffcient monitoring and maintenance system and not by lack of appropriate technologies. A possibility to improve the monitoring proceeding is to remotely monitor a whole system of on-site WWTPs with the aid of low-maintenance sensors, installed at each unit, which deliver real-time information about the treatment performance. Methods are needed, that translate those sensor signals into performance parameters such as efluent concentration of certain substances. A method exists that predicts the ammonium efluent concentration based on the pH signal in the case of a pilot scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR). In this thesis, this method is tested on its applicability at an on-site SBR in operation. Moreover, the potential of an additional low-maintenance sensor, which measures the CO2 in the off-gas of a plant, was tested regarding remote monitoring of the bacterial activity. The results show, that the existing method based on the pH sensor can be applied at plants in operation, when they meet certain requirements regarding aeration pattern and inflow characteristics (ratio of alkalinity:ammonium > 2:1). In this thesis it is further illustrated, which possibilities exist to enlarge the application range of the method. Moreover, it could be demonstrated that the CO2 sensor represents a promising alternative for monitoring the biological activity. Yet, this method needs to be optimized in order to increase the information content of the model output.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000333560",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/333560","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Online monitoring||Onsite wastewater treatment||Sequencing batch reactor","Remote Monitoring of On-Site Wastewater Treatment Plants by Means of Low-Maintenance Sensors",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,"2019-03-25T13:56:35Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, ET and yield patterns have never been investigated under highly heterogeneous conditions. We applied SEBAL in a salt-affected and water-stressed maize field located at the margin of the Venice Lagoon, Italy, using Landsat images. SEBAL results were compared with estimates of evapotranspiration by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) method (ETc) and three-dimensional soil-plant simulations. The biomass production routine in SEBAL was then tested using spatially distributed crop yield measurements and the outcomes of a soil-plant numerical model. The results show good agreement between SEBAL evapotranspiration and ETc. Instantaneous ET simulated by SEBAL is also consistent with the soil-plant model results (R2 = 0.7047 for 2011 and R2 = 0.6689 for 2012). Conversely, yield predictions (6.4 t/ha in 2011 and 3.47 t/ha in 2012) are in good agreement with observations (8.64 t/ha and 3.86 t/ha, respectively) only in 2012 and the comparison with soil-plant simulations (8.69 t/ha and 5.49 t/ha) is poor. In general, SEBAL underestimates land productivity in contrast to the soil-plant model that overestimates yield in dry years. SEBAL provides accurate predictions under stress conditions due to the fact that it does not require knowledge of the soil/root characteristics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000295663",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs10091452","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/295663","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL)||Evapotranspiration||Yield||Remote seinsing||Heterogeneous conditions","Mapping maize evapotranspiration at field scale using SEBAL",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-10-13T09:05:47Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85053595364",,"000449993800132","Remote Sens.","9","Remote Sensing","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Given that purchase decisions are made on household levels and are highly behavior-driven, the derivation of targeted environmental measures requires an understanding of household behavior patterns and the resulting environmental impacts. To provide an appropriate basis in support of effective environmental policymaking, we propose a new approach to capture the variability of lifestyle-induced environmental impacts. Lifestyle-archetypes representing prevailing consumption patterns are derived in a two-tiered clustering that applies a Ward-clustering on top of a preconditioning self-organizing map. The environmental impacts associated with specific archetypical behavior are then assessed in a hybrid life cycle assessment framework. The application of this approach to the Swiss Household Budget Survey reveals a global picture of consumption that is in line with previous studies, but also demonstrates that different archetypes can be found within similar socio-economic household types. The appearance of archetypes diverging from general macro-trends indicates that the proposed approach might be useful for an enhanced understanding of consumption patterns and for the future support of policymakers in devising effective environmental measures targeting specific consumer groups.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000284256",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.8b01452","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/284256","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Using Data Mining To Assess Environmental Impacts of Household Consumption Behaviors",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-08-24T04:45:13Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85049246090",,"000441477600046","Environ.

This data article present up-to-date life cycle inventories of several collection, sorting and recycling processes of municipal solid waste fractions for life cycle assessments of waste management systems. In total, 190 life cycle inventories for processes within municipal solid waste management were either newly developed or adapted from existing datasets. The data for 51 recycling processes has been collected to update existing processes or create new process models. Two modules for biogenic processes were taken from literature and 10 processes were modeled based on the existing ecoinvent processes with minor adjustments [1]. The substitution of 36 materials from recycling processes was modeled. In addition, the thermal treatment of 12 waste fractions was modeled within 84 life cycle inventories compromising the thermal waste treatment and the recovery and recycling of recovered fractions from fly and bottom ash. The assumptions and the modelling of the waste treatment processes are described. All life cycle inventory datasets which were newly created, updated or modified compared to the original dataset are described and provided as Excel table.

Because of their extraordinary persistence, human and environmental exposure to PFASs will be a long-termsource of concern. Some PFASs such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) have been investigated extensivelyand thus regulated, but for many other PFASs, knowledge about their current uses and hazards is still very limited or missing entirely. To addressthis problem and prepare an action plan for the assessment and management of PFASs in the coming years, a group of more than 50 internationalscientists and regulators held a two-day workshop in November, 2017. The group identified both the respective needs of and common goals sharedby the scientific and the policy communities, made recommendations for cooperative actions, and outlined how the science–policy interfaceregarding PFASs can be strengthened using new approaches for assessing and managing highly persistent chemicals such as PFASs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000295561",,"1552-9924||0091-6765",,"10.1289/EHP4158","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/295561","en","National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Zürich Statement on Future Actions on Per - and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs)",,"Other Journal Item","Open access",,,"2018-10-12T16:58:35Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85055423819",,"000444417500009","Environ Health Perspect","8","Environmental Health Perspectives","126","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02020 - Dep.

Methods Animal welfare is assessed during farm life and during slaughter. The indicators differ in how they value premature death. All three consider (1) the life quality of an animal such as space allowance, (2) the slaughter age either as life duration or life fraction, and (3) the number of animals affected for providing a product unit, e.g. 1 Mcal. One of the indicators additionally takes into account a moral value denoting their intelligence and self-awareness. The framework allows for comparisons across studies and products and for applications at large spatial scales. To illustrate the framework, eight products were analysed and compared: beef, pork, poultry, milk, eggs, salmon, shrimps, and, as a novel protein source, insects.  Results and discussion Insects are granted to live longer fractions of their normal life spans, and their life quality is less compromised due to a lower assumed sentience. Still, they perform worst according to all three indicators, as their small body sizes only yield low product quantities. Therefore, we discourage from eating insects. In contrast, milk is the product that reduces animal welfare the least according to two of the three indicators and it performs relatively better than other animal products in most categories. The difference in animal welfare is mostly larger for different animal products than for different production systems of the same product. This implies that, besides less consumption of animal-based products, a shift to other animal products can significantly improve animal welfare.  Conclusions While the animal welfare assessment is simplified, it allows for a direct integration into life cycle sustainability assessment. There is a trade-off between applicability and indicator complexity, but even a simple estimate of animal welfare is much better than ignoring the issue, as is the common practice in life cycle sustainability assessments. Future research should be directed towards elaborating the life quality criterion and extending the product coverage.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000217045",,"0948-3349||1614-7502",,"10.1007/s11367-017-1420-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/217045","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Animal products||Animal welfare loss||Diet||Food||Indicator framework||LCA","Framework for integrating animal welfare into life cycle sustainability assessment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-12-05T05:39:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85034572401",,"000435980400011","Int J Life Cycle Assess","7","The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

As such, it rejects layovers wherein multiple scatterers are interfering in the same range-azimuth resolution cell. Differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography can improve deformation sampling as it has the ability to resolve layovers by separating the interfering scatterers. In this way, both PSI and tomography inevitably require a means to detect coherent scatterers, i.e., to perform hypothesis testing to decide whether a given candidate scatterer is coherent. This paper reports the application of a detection strategy in the context of “tomography as an add-on to PSI”. As the performance of a detector is typically linked to the statistical description of the underlying mathematical model, we investigate how the statistics of the phase instabilities in the PSI analysis are carried forward to the subsequent tomographic analysis. While phase instabilities in PSI are generally modeled as an additive noise term in the interferometric phase model, their impact in SAR tomography manifests as a multiplicative disturbance. The detection strategy proposed in this paper allows extending the same quality considerations as used in the prior PSI processing (in terms of the dispersion of the residual phase) to the subsequent tomographic analysis. In particular, the hypothesis testing for the detection of coherent scatterers is implemented such that the expected probability of false alarm is consistent between PSI and tomography. The investigation is supported with empirical analyses on an interferometric data stack comprising 50 TerraSAR-X acquisitions in stripmap mode, over the city of Barcelona, Spain, from 2007–2012.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000280017",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs10071014","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/280017","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)||SAR tomography||Deformation monitoring||Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI)||urban deformation monitoring||Radar interferometry||displacement mapping||Spaceborne SAR||Differential interferometry||differential tomography","SAR tomography as an add-On to PSI: Detection of coherent scatterers in the presence of phase instabilities",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-08-02T07:44:47Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85050493688",,"000440332500037","Remote Sens.","7","Remote Sensing","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We account for the potential impact of hydropower by intercepting sediment fluxes originated in areas diverted to hydropower reservoirs, and by considering the contribution of hydropower releases to SSC. We obtain the hydroclimatic variables from daily gridded datasets of precipitation and temperature, implementing a degree-day model to simulate spatially distributed snow accumulation and snow–ice melt. We estimate hydropower releases by a conceptual approach with a unique virtual reservoir regulated on the basis of a target-volume function, representing normal reservoir operating conditions throughout a hydrological year. An Iterative Input Selection algorithm is used to identify the variables with the highest predictive power for SSC, their explained variance, and characteristic time lags. On this basis, we develop a hydroclimatic multivariate rating curve (HMRC) which accounts for the contributions of the most relevant hydroclimatic input variables mentioned above. We calibrate the HMRC with a gradient-based nonlinear optimization method and we compare its performance with a traditional discharge-based rating curve. We apply the approach in the upper Rhône Basin, a large Swiss Alpine catchment heavily regulated by hydropower. Our results show that the three hydroclimatic processes – erosive rainfall, ice melt, and snowmelt – are significant predictors of mean daily SSC, while hydropower release does not have a significant explanatory power for SSC. The characteristic time lags of the hydroclimatic variables correspond to the typical flow concentration times of the basin. Despite not including discharge, the HMRC performs better than the traditional rating curve in reproducing SSC seasonality, especially during validation at the daily scale. While erosive rainfall determines the daily variability of SSC and extremes, ice melt generates the highest SSC per unit of runoff and represents the largest contribution to total suspended sediment yield. Finally, we show that the HMRC is capable of simulating climate-driven changes in fine sediment dynamics in Alpine catchments. In fact, HMRC can reproduce the changes in SSC in the past 40 years in the Rhône Basin connected to air temperature rise, even though the simulated changes are more gradual than those observed. The approach presented in this paper, based on the analysis of the hydroclimatic control of suspended sediment concentration, allows the exploration of climate-driven changes in fine sediment dynamics in Alpine catchments. The approach can be applied to any Alpine catchment with a pluvio-glacio-nival hydrological regime and adequate hydroclimatic datasets.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000274291",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-22-3421-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/274291","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Hydroclimatic control on suspended sediment dynamics of a regulated Alpine catchment: a conceptual approach",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-07-06T12:57:23Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85049168170",,"000435951800001","Hydrol.

However, while OP-induced carbon emissions and biodiversity losses have received significant attention, OP water requirements have been marginalized and little is known on the ecohydrological changes (water and surface energy fluxes) occurring from forest clearing to plantation maturity. Numerical simulations supported by field observations from seven sites in Southeast Asia (five OP plantations and two tropical forests) are used here to illustrate the temporal evolution of OP actual evapotranspiration (ET), infiltration/runoff, gross primary productivity (GPP) and surface temperature as well as their changes relative to tropical forests. Model results from large-scale commercial plantations show that young OP plantations decrease ecosystem ET, causing hotter and drier climatic conditions, but mature plantations (age > 8−9 yr) have higher GPP and transpire more water (up to +7.7%) than the forests they have replaced. This is the result of physiological constraints on water use efficiency and the extremely high yield of OP (six to ten times higher than other oil crops). Hence, the land use efficiency of mature OP, i.e. the high productivity per unit of land area, comes at the expense of water consumption in a trade of water for carbon that may jeopardize local water resources. Sequential replanting and herbaceous ground cover can reduce the severity of such ecohydrological changes and support local water/climate regulation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000273156",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aac54e","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/273156","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","oil palm plantations||tropical forests||carbon/water fluxes||biophysical modeling","Ecohydrological changes after tropical forest conversion to oil palm",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-06-30T03:31:23Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Oil Palm Adaptive Landscapes (OPAL)","152019","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","r4d - Ecosystems: Gesuch",,,,"85049784761",,"000435633600002","Environ.

Under normal range of precipitation variability, wet years typically result in ANPP gains being larger than ANPP declines in dry years (positive asymmetry), whereas increases in ANPP are lower in magnitude in extreme wet years compared to reductions during extreme drought (negative asymmetry). Whether the current generation of ecosystem models with a coupled carbon–water system in grasslands are capable of simulating these asymmetric ANPP responses is an unresolved question. In this study, we evaluated the simulated responses of temperate grassland primary productivity to scenarios of altered precipitation with 14 ecosystem models at three sites: Shortgrass steppe (SGS), Konza Prairie (KNZ) and Stubai Valley meadow (STU), spanning a rainfall gradient from dry to moist. We found that (1) the spatial slopes derived from modeled primary productivity and precipitation across sites were steeper than the temporal slopes obtained from inter-annual variations, which was consistent with empirical data; (2) the asymmetry of the responses of modeled primary productivity under normal inter-annual precipitation variability differed among models, and the mean of the model ensemble suggested a negative asymmetry across the three sites, which was contrary to empirical evidence based on filed observations; (3) the mean sensitivity of modeled productivity to rainfall suggested greater negative response with reduced precipitation than positive response to an increased precipitation under extreme conditions at the three sites; and (4) gross primary productivity (GPP), net primary productivity (NPP), aboveground NPP (ANPP) and belowground NPP (BNPP) all showed concave-down nonlinear responses to altered precipitation in all the models, but with different curvatures and mean values. Our results indicated that most models overestimate the negative drought effects and/or underestimate the positive effects of increased precipitation on primary productivity under normal climate conditions, highlighting the need for improving eco-hydrological processes in those models in the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000271710",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-15-3421-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/271710","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Asymmetric responses of primary productivity to altered precipitation simulated by ecosystem models across three long-term grassland sites",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-06-22T13:52:11Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85048321816",,"000434869800002",,"11","Biogeosciences","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Solute variability is generally smaller than discharge variability. The majority of solutes shows dilution with increasing discharge, especially geogenic species, while sediment-related solutes (e.g. Total Phosphorous and Organic Carbon species) show higher concentrations with increasing discharge. Both natural and anthropogenic factors impact the biogeochemical response of streams and, while the majority of solutes show identifiable behaviors in individual catchments, only a minority of behaviors can be generalized across catchments that exhibit different natural, climatic and anthropogenic features.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000316109",,"1812-2116||1812-2108",,"10.5194/hess-2018-245","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316109","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Water quality||Catchment biogeochemistry||Stream chemistry||Concentration-discharge relations","Anthropogenic and catchment characteristic signatures in the water quality of Swiss rivers: a quantitative assessment",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2019-01-15T16:19:04Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary...||Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268-2||690268||690268-2||690268||690268-2||690268","10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100007352","SBFI||SBFI||SBFI||SBFI||SBFI||SBFI","H2020||H2020||H2020||H2020||H2020||H2020",,,,,,,"Hydrol. earth syst. sci.",,"Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Therefore, assessing environmental footprints of households is an important basis to identify environmental policies. This study aimed to develop a comprehensive regionalized bottom-up model for Switzerland that is able to assess the environmental impacts induced by individual households. The purpose of this model is to provide a virtual platform for detailed scenario analysis which shall support effective political decision making on different scales. Three existing bottom-up models were merged: a building stock energy model, an agent-based transport simulation and a household consumption model. All of them were tested and evaluated beforehand. The physically-based building energy model establishes simplified energy balances for each residential building based on spatially and temporally resolved climate data, building characteristics and 3D-geometries. It provides estimates of space heating, hot water and electricity demand for each Swiss household. The mobility sub-model builds upon the results of an agent-based traffic simulation framework which was applied to Switzerland and reproduces mobility patterns of Swiss inhabitants in space and time. The third sub-model pursues a data-driven approach and enables the quantification of consumption of food, consumables, and other goods and services for each Swiss household by means of data mining techniques. Linking these sub-models with environmental background data allowed for computing an environmental profile for each household in Switzerland. The application of this model to the current situation of Switzerland reveals interesting differences between individual households, different regions and different consumption areas. By covering the variability of household behavior and quantifying the demands and environmental footprints of households within a certain area, the model delivers important insights for local policymakers to derive targeted environmental strategies tailored to the specific problems and household types in a region. Furthermore, the high resolution of all three sub-models permits testing of policies and in-depth analyses of scenarios, ranging from detailed building refurbishment programs to future mobility solutions such as autonomous vehicle systems.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/291071","en","Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry Europe (SETAC)",,,,"Assessing environmental impacts of individual households: A large-scale bottom-up LCA-model for Switzerland",,"Conference Paper","Metadata only","Abstract Book",,"2018-09-21T12:38:49Z",,,,,"yes","SETAC Europe 28th Annual Meeting","May 13-17,2018","Rome, Italy",,,,,,,,,,,,,"147",,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In this work, we present a fully automatic framework for localizing sewer inlets from image clouds captured from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The framework exploits the high image overlap of UAV imaging surveys with a multiview approach to improve detection performance. The framework uses a Viola–Jones classifier trained to detect sewer inlets in aerial images with a ground sampling distance of 3–3.5 cm/pixel. The detections are then projected into three-dimensional space where they are clustered and reclassified to discard false positives. The method is evaluated by cross-validating results from an image cloud of 252 UAV images captured over a 0.57-km2 study area with 228 sewer inlets. Compared to an equivalent single-view detector, the multiview approach improves both recall and precision, increasing average precision from 0.65 to 0.73.

Especially from a consumption-based accounting perspective, household consumption can be regarded as ultimately responsible for all resources consumption and emission releases that occur over the whole life cycle of products and services. However, given that purchase decisions are highly behavior-driven, devising effective and targeted environmental measures presupposes the knowledge and understanding of prevailing consumption patterns and associated environmental impacts. This study aims at providing an appropriate basis to support the identification of strategies to abate negative impacts on the environment induced by household consumption. In order to capture the variability of lifestyle-induced environmental impacts, data mining techniques were employed to the Swiss Household Budget Survey. The goal was to recognize consumption pattern and to derive archetypes based on behavior and household characteristics. For this purpose, a two-tiered clustering was applied to detailed data about the expenditures of almost 10,000 households. First, the dataset was pre-conditioned with a self-organizing map which belongs to the class of unsupervised neural networks. Subsequently, a Ward-clustering found 28 archetypes on top of this self-organizing map. The environmental impacts of these archetypical behaviors were then estimated in the scope of a hybrid life cycle assessment framework by coupling the archetypes’ demands with environmental back-ground data. Similar to previous studies, this archetype-approach allows for identifying macro-trends, environmental hotspots or groups of households that should be focused on. But in addition to this, it also enables for a better understanding of individual archetypical behaviors. This is of special importance given that household clusters were found that deviate from general tendencies and different archetypes emerged within similar socio-economic household types. The quantification of typical consumption pattern profiles in this study supports policymakers in devising environmental measures tailored to specific consumer groups. Thereby, this approach also represents a predestined basis for considering insights from psychology or behavioral economics for the development of effective environmental policies. Currently, an uncertainty framework for the archetype-approach is developed and in upcoming research, drivers of environmental impacts will by identified and investigated. Furthermore, the archetypes will be assigned to real households based on the national census in order to form a regionalized bottom-up household consumption model.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000291095",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/291095","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Exploiting household consumption data: environmental impacts of archetypical behaviors",,"Conference Poster","Open access",,,"2018-09-21T13:25:25Z",,,,,"yes","Gordon Research Conference on Industrial Ecology","May 19-25, 2018","Les Diablerets, Switzerland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Modeling methodologies capable of handling changing land use conditions are therefore becoming ever more important and are receiving increasing attention from hydrologists. A recently developed data-assimilation-based framework that allows model parameters to vary through time in response to signals of change in observations is considered for a medium-sized catchment (2880 km2) in northern Vietnam experiencing substantial but gradual land cover change. We investigate the efficacy of the method as well as the importance of the chosen model structure in ensuring the success of a time-varying parameter method. The method was used with two lumped daily conceptual models (HBV and HyMOD) that gave good-quality streamflow predictions during pre-change conditions. Although both time-varying parameter models gave improved streamflow predictions under changed conditions compared to the time-invariant parameter model, persistent biases for low flows were apparent in the HyMOD case. It was found that HyMOD was not suited to representing the modified baseflow conditions, resulting in extreme and unrealistic time-varying parameter estimates. This work shows that the chosen model can be critical for ensuring the time-varying parameter framework successfully models streamflow under changing land cover conditions. It can also be used to determine whether land cover changes (and not just meteorological factors) contribute to the observed hydrologic changes in retrospective studies where the lack of a paired control catchment precludes such an assessment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000266433",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-22-2903-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/266433","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Time-varying parameter models for catchments with land use change: the importance of model structure",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-05-30T04:56:40Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85047461056",,"000432362700002","Hydrol.

Measurements were conducted at an engine test cell. Organic gases (OGs) and particle emissions pre- and post-PAM were measured. A suite of instruments, including a proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) for OGs, a multigas analyzer for CO, CO2, NOx, and an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) for nonrefractory particulate matter (NR-PM1) were used. Total aerosol mass was dominated by secondary aerosol formation, which was approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than the primary aerosol. The chemical composition of both gaseous and particle emissions were also monitored at different engine loads and were thrust-dependent. At idling load (thrust 2.5–7 %), more than 90 % of the secondary particle mass was organic and could mostly be explained by the oxidation of gaseous aromatic species, e.g., benzene; toluene; xylenes; tri-, tetra-, and pentamethyl-benzene; and naphthalene. The oxygenated-aromatics, e.g., phenol, furans, were also included in this aromatic fraction and their oxidation could alone explain up to 25 % of the secondary organic particle mass at idling loads. The organic fraction decreased with thrust level, while the inorganic fraction increased. At an approximated cruise load sulfates comprised 85 % of the total secondary particle mass.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000267995",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-7379-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/267995","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Identification of secondary aerosol precursors emitted by an aircraft turbofan",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-06-07T07:52:20Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85048072068",,"000433196500002","Atmos. chem. phys.","10","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In these environments, they play a central role in services ranging from degradation of pollutants to water purification. Biofilms dynamically change the pore structure of the medium through selective clogging of pores, a process known as bioclogging. This affects how solutes are transported and spread through the porous matrix, but the temporal changes to transport behavior during bioclogging are not well understood. To address this uncertainty, we experimentally study the hydrodynamic changes of a transparent 3‐D porous medium as it experiences progressive bioclogging. Statistical analyses of the system's hydrodynamics at four time points of bioclogging (0, 24, 36, and 48 h in the exponential growth phase) reveal exponential increases in both average and variance of the flow velocity, as well as its correlation length. Measurements for spreading, as mean‐squared displacements, are found to be non‐Fickian and more intensely superdiffusive with progressive bioclogging, indicating the formation of preferential flow pathways and stagnation zones. A gamma distribution describes well the Lagrangian velocity distributions and provides parameters that quantify changes to the flow, which evolves from a parallel pore arrangement under unclogged conditions, toward a more serial arrangement with increasing clogging. Exponentially evolving hydrodynamic metrics agree with an exponential bacterial growth phase and are used to parameterize a correlated continuous time random walk model with a stochastic velocity relaxation. The model accurately reproduces transport observations and can be used to resolve transport behavior at intermediate time points within the exponential growth phase considered.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000260990",,"0043-1397||1944-7973",,"10.1002/2017WR021726","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/260990","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Pore-Scale Hydrodynamics in a Progressively Bioclogged Three-Dimensional Porous Medium: 3-D Particle Tracking Experiments and Stochastic Transport Modeling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-04-27T05:11:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Turbulence and Particles in Environmental Fluid Dynamics (TIPFluiD)||Turbulence and Particles in Environmental Fluid Dynamics (TENACEOUS)","144645||172916","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,,"85044185687",,"000430364900042","Water Resour.

Growing population in cities, changing climatic conditions and uncertain availability of water resources necessitate forward-looking water policy strategies. In this paper, we introduce a new water balance model to evaluate urban water strategies at a city scale. The aim is to evaluate decentralised water management measures within a large-scale investigation and to reduce external potable water demand. The upscaling process of local information (water demand, areal data) to a conceptual model approach is described. The modelling approach requires simplification of detailed processes to enable the execution with limited computing capacity. The model was applied to Greater Metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, a highly sprawled city with nearly four million inhabitants. Scenario analysis demonstrated the impact of using different water resources of different quality classes, the extensive implementation of water saving appliances and decentralised water storage strategies on the city’s water balance. Results indicate a potential reduction of potable water demand of up to 25% with a conservative rainwater reuse and, even 60% with widespread implementation of rain- and greywater recycling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even small systems implemented at a local level can have noticeable effects when operated as clustered schemes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000250023",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su10030716","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/250023","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","alternative water resources||water quality||decentralised storages||water recycling and reuse||upscaling local information||potable water demand reduction","Conceptual urban water balance model for water policy testing: An approach for large scale investigation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-03-15T03:58:08Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85043292839",,"000428567100143",,"3","Sustainability","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Appropriate indicators are needed to help policy makers set accurate targets for the carbon balance of their foreign trade and monitor the development of trade in a meaningful way. This paper proposes a new displacement indicator – the technology adjusted balance of emissions embodied in trade – that improves on existing ideas by separating out the effects of scale and composition of trade from the effects of different technologies and energy systems. The new indicator is calculated for Swedish and UK trade from 1995 to 2009, a period when both countries have reported decreasing territorial emissions together with sustained economic growth. One key finding is that, for both countries, outsourcing of emissions is less serious than what conventional analysis of emissions embodied in trade suggests. For Sweden, the technology adjusted balance of emissions embodied in trade is positive throughout the studied period, implying that its exports reduce emissions abroad more than what is generated by its imports. However, we also find that both countries have changed the composition of their imports and exports during this period: imports have become more carbon intensive and, exports less so, compared to the world economy at large.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000472854",,"0959-3780||1872-9495",,"10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2017.12.006","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472854","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Carbon accounting||Carbon footprints||Carbon leakage||Decoupling||Emissions displacement||Emissions embodied in trade||Global climate policy||Input-output analysis||Structural decomposition","Decoupling or delusion?

To date, no consensus-based approach exists for applying this standard and results are not always comparable when different scarcity or stress indicators are used for characterization of impacts. This paper presents the outcome of a 2-year consensus building process by the Water Use in Life Cycle Assessment (WULCA), a working group of the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative, on a water scarcity midpoint method for use in LCA and for water scarcity footprint assessments.  Methods  In the previous work, the question to be answered was identified and different expert workshops around the world led to three different proposals. After eliminating one proposal showing low relevance for the question to be answered, the remaining two were evaluated against four criteria: stakeholder acceptance, robustness with closed basins, main normative choice, and physical meaning.  Results and discussion  The recommended method, AWARE, is based on the quantification of the relative available water remaining per area once the demand of humans and aquatic ecosystems has been met, answering the question “What is the potential to deprive another user (human or ecosystem) when consuming water in this area?” The resulting characterization factor (CF) ranges between 0.1 and 100 and can be used to calculate water scarcity footprints as defined in the ISO standard.  Conclusions  After 8 years of development on water use impact assessment methods, and 2 years of consensus building, this method represents the state of the art of the current knowledge on how to assess potential impacts from water use in LCA, assessing both human and ecosystem users’ potential deprivation, at the midpoint level, and provides a consensus-based methodology for the calculation of a water scarcity footprint as per ISO 14046.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000192186",,"0948-3349||1614-7502",,"10.1007/s11367-017-1333-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/192186","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Impact assessment||LCIA||Life cycle assessment||UNEP-SETAC life cycle initiative||Water consumption||Water footprint||Water stress||Water use||WULCA","The WULCA consensus characterization model for water scarcity footprints: assessing impacts of water consumption based on available water remaining (AWARE)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T04:41:42Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85013372939",,"000419945000014","Int J Life Cycle Assess","2","The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In this contribution, we present two updated bedrock topographies and ice thickness distributions for Gries- and Findelengletscher, Switzerland. The results are based on ground-penetrating radar (GPR) measurements collected in spring 2015 and already-existing data. The GPR data are analysed using ReflexW software and interpolated by using the ice thickness estimation method (ITEM). ITEM calculates the thickness distribution by using principles of ice flow dynamics and characteristics of the glacier surface. We show that using such a technique has a significance advantage compared to a direct interpolation of the measurements, especially for glacier areas that are sparsely covered by GPR data. The uncertainties deriving from both the interpretation of the GPR signal and the spatial interpolation through ITEM are quantified separately, showing that, in our case, GPR signal interpretation is a major source of uncertainty. The results show a total glacier volume of 0.28 ± 0.06 and 1.00 ± 0.34 km3 for Gries- and Findelengletscher, respectively, with corresponding average ice thicknesses of 56.8 ± 12.7 and 56.3 ± 19.6 m.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000226673",,"0016-7312",,"10.5194/gh-73-1-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/226673","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The bedrock topography of Gries- and Findelengletscher",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-09T07:46:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Geogr.

At the same time, the movement of water within catchments along with solute transport still requires an adequate modelling approach at large scale, that would have a high value to tackle water quality problems. Water and solutes move in catchments following different paths and can take from minutes to centuries to reach the catchment outlet. This spectrum of paths and time scales, along with their dependency on climatic forcing, catchment heterogeneity, and numerous other factors, represent the main challenge towards inferring their magnitude and dependencies, and ultimately determining the processes that drive streamflow generation and catchment-scale dispersion. Water transit time distributions are a crucial metric for capturing these processes and they can be ultimately used to address the environmental challenges related to water quality. With the aim of better understanding and estimating them and their controlling factors, a novel model and framework are here developed. Hydrological and conservative transport simulations are coupled to follow multiple water parcels in space and time through the catchment. The model is firstly tested and benchmarked on a catchment in UK with extensive datasets of discharge and chloride, a conservative environmental tracer. The dynamic transit time distributions (TTDs) both forward and backward in time are satisfactory reproduced by the model. Results show that TTDs conditional on a given rainfall time are mostly correlated to the season in which the rain event occurs, whereas TTDs conditional on a given exit time are mostly affected by catchment wetness. To further explore this, in a second step the model is applied to five catchments in different climatic regions and scenarios are developed to infer the influences of climatic and geomorphological characteristic on transit and residence time. Results reveal that for wet climates we can define a curve describing water transit as a function of cumulative discharge that only depends on topographic properties. On the contrary, in dry climates the variability of transit time and young water fraction is much larger in all the representations, thus a summary of climatic effects on transit times is not straightforward. Overall, the study achieved an improved understanding of catchment transport processes in different climates and topographies, and further research directions are identified aiming at an unifying catchment transport representation and a quantification of natural and anthropogenic impacts on water resources.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000305927",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/305927","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Hydrology||Transit Time Distribution||Hydrological modelling||Young water","Hydrological modelling and water flux tracking to quantify controls on water transit and residence time",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2018-11-25T14:31:31Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"25329",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

On sub-seasonal timescales, sparse measurements indicate that mass wasting at active slumps is often limited by the energy available for melting ground ice, but other factors such as rainfall or the formation of an insulating veneer may also be relevant. To study the sub-seasonal drivers, we derive topographic changes from single-pass radar interferometric data acquired by the TanDEM-X satellites. The estimated elevation changes at 12 m resolution complement the commonly observed planimetric retreat rates by providing information on volume losses. Their high vertical precision (around 30 cm), frequent observations (11 days) and large coverage (5000 km2) allow us to track mass wasting as drivers such as the available energy change during the summer of 2015 in two study regions. We find that thaw slumps in the Tuktoyaktuk coastlands, Canada, are not energy limited in June, as they undergo limited mass wasting (height loss of around 0 cm day−1) despite the ample available energy, suggesting the widespread presence of early season insulating snow or debris veneer. Later in summer, height losses generally increase (around 3 cm day−1), but they do so in distinct ways. For many slumps, mass wasting tracks the available energy, a temporal pattern that is also observed at coastal yedoma cliffs on the Bykovsky Peninsula, Russia. However, the other two common temporal trajectories are asynchronous with the available energy, as they track strong precipitation events or show a sudden speed-up in late August respectively. The observed temporal patterns are poorly related to slump characteristics like the headwall height. The contrasting temporal behaviour of nearby thaw slumps highlights the importance of complex local and temporally varying controls on mass wasting.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000244496",,"1994-0416||1994-0424",,"10.5194/tc-12-549-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/244496","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Sub-seasonal thaw slump mass wasting is not consistently energy limited at the landscape scale",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-02-27T03:39:08Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85042096358",,"000425092800001",,"2","The Cryosphere","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

To date, efforts to uncover and understand this diversity have not been matched by equivalent efforts to identify unifying frameworks that can provide a degree of generality and thus serve as a stepping stone to scale up microscale dynamics to predict their ecosystem-level consequences. In particular, evaluating the ecological consequences of different resource landscapes and of different microbial adaptations has remained a major challenge in aquatic microbial ecology. Here, inspired by Ramon Margalef’s mandala for phytoplankton, we propose a foraging mandala for microorganisms in aquatic environments, which accounts for both the local environment and individual adaptations. This biophysical framework distills resource acquisition into two fundamental parameters: the search time for a new resource and the growth return obtained from encounter with a resource. We illustrate the foraging mandala by considering a broad range of microbial adaptations and environmental characteristics. The broad applicability of the foraging mandala suggests that it could be a useful framework to compare disparate microbial strategies in aquatic environments and to reduce the vast complexity of microbe-environment interactions into a minimal number of fundamental parameters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000306852",,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-018-0309-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/306852","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A Foraging Mandala for Aquatic Microorganisms",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-11-28T13:08:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85056756276",,"000459053600001","ISME J",,"The ISME Journal","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The masses transformed into ice avalanches with volumes of 68 and 83×106m3 and ran out up to 7km in horizontal distance, killing nine people. The only similar event currently documented is the 130×106m3 Kolka Glacier rock and ice avalanche of 2002 (Caucasus Mountains). Using climatic reanalysis, remote sensing, and three-dimensional thermo-mechanical modelling, we reconstructed the Aru glaciers' thermal regimes, thicknesses, velocities, basal shear stresses, and ice damage prior to the collapse in detail. Thereby, we highlight the potential of using emergence velocities to constrain basal friction in mountain glacier models. We show that the frictional change leading to the Aru collapses occurred in the temperate areas of the polythermal glaciers and is not related to a rapid thawing of cold-based ice. The two glaciers experienced a similar stress transfer from predominant basal drag towards predominant lateral shearing in the detachment areas and during the 5–6 years before the collapses. A high-friction patch is found under the Aru-2 glacier tongue, but not under the Aru-1 glacier. This difference led to disparate behaviour of both glaciers, making the development of the instability more visible for the Aru-1 glacier through enhanced crevassing and terminus advance over a longer period. In comparison, these signs were observable only over a few days to weeks (crevasses) or were absent (advance) for the Aru-2 glacier. Field investigations reveal that those two glaciers were underlain by soft, highly erodible, and fine-grained sedimentary lithologies. We propose that the specific bedrock lithology played a key role in the two Tibet and the Caucasus Mountains giant glacier collapses documented to date by producing low bed roughness and large amounts of till, rich in clay and silt with a low friction angle. The twin 2016 Aru collapses would thus have been driven by a failing basal substrate linked to increasing pore water pressure in the subglacial drainage system in response to increases in surface melting and rain during the 5–6 years preceding the collapse dates.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000290567",,"1994-0416||1994-0424",,"10.5194/tc-12-2883-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/290567","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Mechanisms leading to the 2016 giant twin glacier collapses, Aru Range, Tibet",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-09-19T16:02:26Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85053236086",,"000444101700001",,"9","The Cryosphere","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

With the goal of optimizing the use of resources and energy, waste management increasingly aims for conserving resources through material and energy recovery, besides the more traditional goals of safe disposal and emission abatement. In view of the numerous possible utilization strategies and pathways, the political targets, and the technical feasibilities, indicators for steering and evaluating the systems performance are of great importance. While current targets focus mostly on collection and recycling rates, there is a need to also assess the environmental sustainability of waste utilization strategies. Several assessment tools, such as material flow analysis (MFA) and life cycle assessment (LCA), are used to evaluate waste management’s environmental performance. Generally, they are, however, applied in isolation. But only the combined implementation of MFA and LCA allows for the simultaneous consideration of resource availability and quality, capacity and market restrictions, as well as the environmental impacts of the system.  This dissertation aims at enhancing the understanding of the environmental assessment of national municipal solid waste management systems. All methodologies developed are tested on the Swiss waste management system, and provide support for political decisions. Five main tasks were addressed i) the assessment of the material availability in Switzerland using MFA and considering resource quality aspects; ii) the calculation and comparison of various resource efficiency measures, including an analysis of the measures meaning when targeting a circular economy and their ability to account for material quality; iii) the analysis of the effects of the separate collection on the quality of source separated material and the influence of material input-quality on the recycling process; iv) the development of a methodology to create future scenarios based on trends in Swiss waste management and consumption and in correspondence to energy scenarios; and v) the development of a modular LCA approach that takes material qualities into account. This thesis starts with the application of a top-down perspective, and results in a comprehensive map of all waste and resource flows that breaks down the national waste stream into several material fractions and follows their treatment pathways. The resulting material flows were used to compare collection and recycling rates on a national level. Through assessment of the treatment pathways, including the secondary material production, differentiation between closed- and open-loop recycling could be achieved, providing novel insights with regard to the circularity of the Swiss waste management system. The results highlight the shortcomings of collection rates, namely the sole consideration of the collection behavior of consumers and collection logistics while neglecting the material purity and the recovery efficiencies in proceeding recycling processes. Comprehensive recycling rates, defined as the amount of secondary material produced after recycling divided by the amount of material consumed, are, therefore, recommended to be used as mass-based indicators. Complementing the MFA with an analysis of trends in waste occurrence and under the consideration of existing energy scenarios, a methodology to set up umbrella scenarios was developed. The participatory approach ensures a high level of assumption transparency for involved stakeholders, which has the potential to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations based on LCA results. Additionally, two bottom-up case studies on resource quality and its influence on recycling processes, and vice versa, were carried out for ferrous scrap and PET bottles. Both studies highlighted that the quality of recycled material is not only determined by the use-phase, but also the collection and treatment schemes. Based on a decrease in quality of source-segregated PET bottles with increasing collection rates, a decreasing marginal environmental benefit from recycling with increasing collection rate was identified. The effect is expected to be even more prominent for materials where the benefits of secondary production are less pronounced. In addition, statistical analyses of a large industrial dataset have revealed an influence of the ferrous scrap quality on the recycling process. In particular, low-quality scrap was found to substantially increase the electricity demand of the recycling process. Finally, the information from the comprehensive MFA and the case studies was combined and complemented with up-to-date life cycle inventories within a modular LCA approach. The flexibility of a modular approach allows for assimilating the acquired knowledge on the resource quality, on different recycling pathways and on material-quality dependent environmental impacts. The modularity allows for further integration of any newly occurring waste stream, for different quality classes of the same material or for innovative waste treatment processes in the future, as it can be extended as needed for the system under study. Also, modelling the LCA based on the detailed material flow distribution and the respective process models allows for ensuring the mass balance of the system. The assessment of the current Swiss municipal solid waste management system highlighted substantial environmental benefits; the integrated waste management, i.e. the recovery of material and energy from waste and the related substitutions, compensated for 1% of the total climate change impacts and 4% of the cumulative energy demand of the Swiss consumption. As Swiss waste management is already rather advanced with high collection and recycling rates, a further increase of these rates has only a limited improvement potential. Therefore, the focus of political measures should be laid on (i) the utilization of secondary materials in applications where they replace high-impact primary production, and (ii) an increased recovery of energy in waste-to-energy plants.  By coupling MFA and LCA, a model was created to analyze large scale waste management systems. The modular LCA model enables for the consideration of actual mass flows, allows for evaluating different mass flow distributions, facilitates the integration of new modules, and allows for inclusion of material quality. This dissertation, therefore, provides a solid basis for developing new indicators for waste management systems. The modular LCA approach can further be used to analyze environmental consequences of Circular Economy strategies. Areas for further model development include the use of the modular LCA approach in mathematical optimization.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000273916","978-3-906916-18-7",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/273916","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Environmental Assessment of Resource and Energy Recovery in Waste Management Systems",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::624 - Civil engineering","2018-07-04T14:55:37Z","2020-07-05",,,,"yes",,,,"Sustainable waste and resource management to support the energy turnaround (wastEturn)","154053","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 70: Gesuch","24883",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Since Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements are sensitive to dielectric and geometric properties of the observed scattering scenario, they provide key observables for monitoring the temporal variation of biophysical parameters. However, the scattering mechanisms occurring in agricultural vegetation in dependency of biophysical parameters are highly complex and simultaneous dynamics of the soil and the vegetation are difficult to differentiate.   By utilizing several horizontally separated SAR acquisitions, SAR Tomography, as demonstrated for forest volumes, is a powerful tool able to estimate vertical profiles of the backscattered power and to resolve and interpret scattering mechanisms along height. The fact that tomographic SAR techniques are, in principle, independent of scattering models makes their application very promising towards a better understanding of the highly dimensional scattering scenarios of agricultural vegetation. Challenges are however the high vertical resolution required in order to be sensitive to the low plant heights, and the possibly present anisotropic propagation effects of the vegetation volume limiting the application of state-of-the art tomographic ground and volume separation algorithms.   The Crop Experiment (CROPEX) campaign in 2014, which plays a key role in this PhD thesis, fills the gap in the availability of fully polarimetric multi-frequency and tomographic SAR data over agricultural crops providing high vertical resolution capability and covering different dates of the phenological cycle. The main objective of the campaign is to foster the physical understanding of the influence that changes in soil and plant parameters have on the ground and volume scattering component as a function of crop type, polarization and frequency.   The interpretation of changes on the ground and in the volume from vertical backscatter profiles is limited and can only be quantified by separating the ground and volume scattering components. Without posing model assumptions to the vegetation volume, this separation becomes ill-posed. In the thesis, this is addressed by applying a separation algorithm which overcomes this ambiguity by integrating the a priori knowledge of the ground height as a given parameter and is able to provide robust estimates of the multi-baseline volume coherences and the ground and volume powers. The biggest novelty of this work is the quantitative analysis of the distinct ground and volume powers for agricultural scattering scenarios, particularly taking into account their temporal variation as a function of varying soil and plant parameters. The temporal variation of the estimated powers provides an unambiguous quantification of scattering changes on the ground and in the vegetation. Since the center of mass of the vertical backscatter profiles correspond - at least at the first order - to the interferometric phase center that can be estimated by means of only two acquired tracks, its analysis gives an understanding of the potential of a reduced observation scenario. In conjunction with in-situ measured soil and plant parameters, the sensitivity of the tomographic parameters across different frequencies, X-, C- and L-band, to dielectric (e.g. dynamics of the water content) and geometric (e.g. alignments of plant components) changes is demonstrated.   The experimental results in this thesis underline the importance of the three-dimensional information. With the separation in height, the conclusions drawn on the changes of the incoherent scattering signature provide a basis for future research including the coherent ground and volume signatures. Scattering models based on the coherent polarimetric signature might provide promising opportunities towards the inversion of biophysical parameters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000259515",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/259515","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Remote sensing + Fernmessung + Fernerkundung (Geodäsie)||Synthetic aperture radar, SAR + high resolution radar (Radar engineering)||Radarsignarverarbeitung (Radartechnik)||Radar signal processing (Radar engineering)||Thomography (Investigation method, physics)||Agricultural ecology","Multi-Frequency Polarimetric SAR Tomography for the 3-D Characterization and Monitoring of Agricultural Crops",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture","2018-04-20T12:40:37Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24817",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Comparisons of environmental impacts and dietary quality were evaluated across country, gender groups, and dietary patterns. While there was clear variability within the different subsets, there were large differences observed in both dietary quality and environmental impacts between cultures, genders, and dietary patterns. Individuals abstaining from red meat consistently had lower impacts in combination with lower consumption of harmful nutrients (saturated fats, sodium, and sugars) while maintaining average intake of beneficial nutrients. A ‘best practice’ diet with low impacts, adequate nutrient intake, and low saturated fats, sodium, and sugars, was constructed from the sample and used as a benchmark. Recorded eating patterns were compared to this recommended diet. On average, intakes of sweets, meats, and drinks should be decreased and intakes of vegetables and cereals increased, at varying rates depending on country and gender. However, the study shows a large spread of eating patterns and recommendations for lowering environmental impacts and increasing nutritional quality vary greatly among individuals.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000242157",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-018-20391-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/242157","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Environmental impact||Diseases","Comparison of Environmental Impact and Nutritional Quality among a European Sample Population - findings from the Food4Me study",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-02-20T02:45:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85041682972",,"000424087700002","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Policymakers can assume a key role and aim at creating an environment that enables producers and consumers to move towards more sustainable behavioral patterns. However, in order to successfully implement policy interventions and to efficiently invest time and money in the most promising fields of action, policymakers are in need of a highly detailed level of quantitative information on prevailing consumption patterns and production systems. The goal of this dissertation was to investigate and develop new approaches that would be able to provide a thorough information base to support the design, prioritization and implementation of effective environmental policies. Thereby, a special focus was laid on the exploitation of Big Data and the application of data mining and machine learning techniques to extract new information tailored to the respective policymakers’ areas of influence. In order to achieve this goal, a two-track approach was pursued. Initially, building upon in-depth surveys and data collection, a database providing accurate data of local actors and activities was established for the municipality of Zernez, a Swiss mountain village, in the scope of a transdisciplinary research project. Subsequently, a comprehensive spatially resolved modeling framework was developed to estimate similarly detailed data for data-scarce regions. The in-depth analysis of the current carbon footprint in Zernez provided an effective planning basis for the research team to develop a concrete action plan. Yielding a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential of 80%, the building stock was identified as a reasonable first step to devise GHG mitigation strategies in Zernez. The proposed actions could then lead to a reduction of 13% and 17% of the municipality’s total carbon footprint from a consumption and production perspective, respectively. The experiences gained in this project demonstrated the importance of understanding and quantifying the variability of local actors (producers and consumers) to develop and prioritize targeted GHG reduction measures. In order to provide other municipalities with similarly comprehensive information without laborious data collection, an extensive modeling framework was established in a second stage. The models elaborated in this dissertation follow three principles. First, they are built from the bottom-up, which allows for reproducing a realistic picture of the variability of local actors and for aggregating simulation results on any desired regional scale. Second, the models source data from publicly accessible databases and third, they adopt a life cycle consumption-based perspective, which means that they assess resource uses and emissions induced by the consumer demand in a certain area. The overall modeling framework takes thus individual households as central modeling elements and aims at deriving a realistic environmental profile for each household within a certain region. This resolution is important because purchase decisions are made on the level of households. The overall modeling framework encompasses three sub-models: a physically-based building energy model, a data-driven consumption model and a mobility model building upon the results of an agent-based simulation. The overall model was applied to the whole of Switzerland in order to demonstrate its practical feasibility. Still, the concepts of the sub-models are generic enough to be applicable to other countries with comparable data. A global sensitivity analysis was applied to study the building energy model’s internal structure, and the database of Zernez allowed for an in-depth evaluation with primary data. Based on these insights, the model was then improved by integrating comprehensive large-scale geographic data, including the use of nationwide laser-scanning data to derive 3D-building geometries. The final model is able to provide estimates of energy demand for each residential building in Switzerland. A thorough evaluation of the model results with reported data concluded that this model can approximate a realistic picture of the overall characteristics of a certain building stock’s energy demand. The consumption model embarked on a novel approach to assess the variability of lifestyle-induced environmental impacts. Based on an extensive use of data mining techniques, prevailing consumption patterns were studied and 28 consumption-based archetypes derived. These archetypes were further investigated and revealed different behavior patterns within similar socio-economic groups. Furthermore, archetypical behavior deviating from macro-trends, such as increased environmental impacts with higher income, could be detected. The proposed archetype-approach can thus be regarded as a promising basis to foster the understanding of current consumption patterns and to contemplate effective policy measures to reduce consumption-induced environmental impacts. Moreover, these archetypes can serve as building blocks to model the demand of food, services, consumables and other goods of households within a specified region. For this, the archetypes were assigned to real Swiss households by means of a newly developed probability-based classification framework which simultaneously interlinks with both the building energy model and the mobility sub-model. The latter estimates the households’ transport demands based on the results of an agent-based simulation framework that reproduces typical mobility behavior of the Swiss population. The overall model predicts the demands in about 400 different consumption areas for all approximately four million real Swiss households by taking into account the given circumstances of a specific household. A hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) framework then assesses and subdivides the environmental impacts associated with these demands into more than 200 different categories. The applied LCA allows for computing different environmental indicators, and found that the estimated average consumption-based carbon footprint of Switzerland amounts to 9.5 tons CO2-equivalents per person per year. Besides interesting differences among household consumption archetypes, the large-scale application of the overall model also reveals regional distinctions. For instance, mobility demands in rural areas tend to induce higher GHG emissions than their urban peers. Such differences should be further investigated to identify potential drivers of environmental impacts. The high resolution of the overall model and its ability to quantify the variabilities in both household- and region-specific behavior renders it a powerful information tool to understand locally occurring consumption patterns. It may thus help to find hotspots, identify areas of action, and allow for the designing of impactful environmental measures tailored to specific household groups to reduce their impacts. The model can further be used as a platform to evaluate policy scenarios in upcoming research. The physically- and component-based approach of the building energy model as well as the link to an agent-based mobility model in particular will allow for the analysis of future scenarios in the context of total household consumption. This dissertation demonstrated how Big Data and its analysis techniques can be employed to create a comprehensive knowledge base to inform environmental policymaking at different regional scales. The developed model is a starting point for more detailed investigations and it is open for further developments, improvements and extensions in future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000282689","978-3-906916-28-6",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/282689","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Data Mining Meets Life Cycle Assessment: Towards Understanding and Quantifying Environmental Impacts of Individual Households",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment","2018-08-15T13:18:33Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"25083",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The structure of the equation contains these terms in a single convolution with a memory function M (t), which includes the source of non-Fickian (anomalous) behavior, within the framework of a continuous time random walk (CTRW). The interaction is non-linear and second-order, relevant for a bimolecular reaction A + B → C. The interaction term ΓP A  (s, t) P B  (s, t) is symmetric in the concentrations of A and B (i.e. P A and P B ); thus the source terms in the equations for A, B and C are similar, but with a change in sign for that of C. Here, the chemical rate coefficient, Γ, is constant. The fully coupled equations are solved numerically using a finite element method (FEM) with a judicious representation of M (t) that eschews the need for the entire time history, instead using only values at the former time step. To begin to validate the equations, the FEM solution is compared, in lieu of experimental data, to a particle tracking method (CTRW-PT); the results from the two approaches, particularly for the C profiles, are in agreement. The FEM solution, for a range of initial and boundary conditions, can provide a good model for reactive transport in disordered media.",,,,"1434-6028||1434-6036",,"10.1140/epjb/e2017-80417-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/520672","en","Springer",,,,"A continuous time random walk (CTRW) integro-differential equation with chemical interaction",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-12-15T07:15:37Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Eur.

As a conceptual derivative of differential interferometry, it strives to extract the interferometric phase variation induced by the line-of-sight component of the deformation. PSI limits the interferometric analysis to the so-called {persistent} (or synonymously {coherent}) scatterers (PS). These are single dominant scatterers exhibiting point-like, quasi-deterministic behavior. On the one hand, it implies reduced susceptibility to temporal and geometric decorrelation, but on the other hand, it incurs the limitation that range-azimuth resolution cells containing multiple scatterers are rejected in the PSI processing, even if they are individually coherent. Side-looking geometry of SAR sensors results in frequent layovers, whereby multiple scatterers situated at different elevations fall in the same resolution cell. Consequently, deformation coverage with PSI processing may remain limited in layover-affected areas.   SAR tomography is a means to alleviate the aforementioned limitation. It allows 3-D reconstruction of the scene reflectivity -- a feature that offers the potential to resolve the layover problem. The coherent scatterers that are interfering in the same  cell can be separated along the elevation.  Additionally, differential SAR tomographic methods  allow a joint spatio-temporal inversion of the coherent scatterers in layover, i.e., the position along the elevation axis as well as the deformation velocity of the interfering scatterers are simultaneously estimated. Therefore, differential SAR tomography can be used as an add-on to PSI techniques to improve deformation coverage in layover-affected areas.   This dissertation provides a comprehensive assessment of the utility offered by SAR tomography as an add-on to PSI. Several aspects of a tomographic processing framework, such as different phase models for tomography, phase calibration of the interferometric stack, statistical detection of coherent scatterers, etc., need to be investigated. To this end, three core investigations have been performed. In each case, a prior PSI solution has been used as a starting point. It serves not only as a reference to compare with, but is also shown to be a natural precursor to tomographic processing.   An interferometric data stack comprising 50 TerraSAR-X stripmap-mode acquisitions over an urban zone in the city of Barcelona, Spain, has been used in the first investigation. The phase models for classical SAR tomography (3-D SAR), differential tomography with the assumption of linear deformation over time, and the one further extended to simultaneously model thermal expansion, are compared against each other with respect to their suitability in resolving layovers. The results confirm that modeling thermal expansion of the scatterers, in addition to linear deformation and elevation, is indeed critical for effective layover separations, especially in the case of high-rise buildings. The quality of the scatterers obtained with tomography has been evaluated in terms of the dispersion of the residual phase and compared against the quality of the PS identified in the prior PSI processing. The results show a trade-off between the quantity and the quality of the scatterers.    The second investigation focuses on the problem of phase calibration for a potential application of SAR tomography in mountainous regions. It is a case study that assesses a regression-kriging approach to functionally model height-dependent atmospheric phase variations and lateral phase trends, and consider the turbulent mixing effects in a stochastic sense. The study has been performed on a stack comprising 32 Cosmo-SkyMed acquisitions over Matter Valley in the Swiss Alps. Phase corrections with the kriging approach extend the deformation coverage to parts of a mountainside (in layover) where no PS were identified in the prior PSI processing. However, a very few double scatterers are detected on the whole.    The third investigation explores how to perform scatterer detection for tomography extending the same quality considerations as used in the prior PSI processing. The outcome of this work is a detection strategy whereby quality parameters (in terms of the statistics of the phase residue or ensemble coherence) are used to determine the thresholds for hypothesis testing. The detection strategy is tested on the same data stack as for the first investigation to detect single and double scatterers in an urban area. An empirical analysis of the probability of false alarm is also provided.    As a whole, this dissertation covers several aspects that collectively highlight how the synergistic use of PSI and tomography can lead to improved deformation coverage.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000299241",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/299241","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","deformation analysis in urban and alpine areas||persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI)||atmospheric phase corrections||radar interferometry||differential SAR tomography||SAR interferometry (InSAR)||SAR||SAR tomography||Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)||deformation||SAR signal processing||Radar signal processing (Radar engineering)","SAR tomography as an add-on to persistent scatterer interferometry for improved deformation coverage",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2018-10-27T17:55:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"25231",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.
