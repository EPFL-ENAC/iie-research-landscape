Here, a condensation (hygroscopic growth)-assisted bioaerosol collection and plasmonic photothermal sensing (CAPS) system for on-site quantitative risk analysis of SARS-CoV-2 virus-laden aerosols is presented. The CAPS system provided rapid thermoplasmonic biosensing results after an aerosol-to-hydrosol sampling process in COVID-19-related environments including a hospital and a nursing home. The detection limit reached 0.25 copies/µL in the complex aerosol background without further purification. More importantly, the CAPS system enabled direct measurement of the SARS-CoV-2 virus exposures with high spatiotemporal resolution. Measurement and feedback of the results to healthcare workers and patients via a QR-code are completed within two hours. Based on a dose-responseµ model, it is used the plasmonic biosensing signal to calculate probabilities of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and estimate maximum exposure durations to an acceptable risk threshold in different environmental settings.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000579277",,"2198-3844",,"10.1002/advs.202204774","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/579277","en","Wiley-VCH","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","airborne transmission||bioaerosols||biosensors||coronavirus||COVID-19||plasmonics||risk assessment","On-Site Quantification and Infection Risk Assessment of Airborne SARS-CoV-2 Virus Via a Nanoplasmonic Bioaerosol Sensing System in Healthcare Settings",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-11-03T14:20:04Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Development of a real-time biosensing system of SARS-CoV-2 to improve healthcare workers safety during COVID 19 pandemics","198258","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Special Call on Coronaviruses",,,"85141146130",,,"Adv.

Combining modern photogrammetric processing with autonomous unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) flights at sub-weekly intervals allows mapping of sediment dynamics in a debris flow catchment. This provides important information for sediment disposition that pre-conditions the catchment for debris flow occurrence. At the Illgraben debris flow catchment in Switzerland, our autonomous UAV launched nearly 50 times in the snow-free periods in 2019-2021 with typical flight intervals of 2-4 d, producing 350-400 images every flight. The observed terrain changes resulting from debris flows exhibit preferred locations of erosion and deposition, including memory effects as previously deposited material is preferentially removed during subsequent debris flows. Such data are critical for the validation of geomorphological process models. Given the remote terrain, the mapped short-term erosion and deposition structures are difficult to obtain with conventional measurements. The proposed method thus fills an observational gap, which ground-based monitoring and satellite-based remote sensing cannot fill as a result of limited access, reaction time, spatial resolution, or involved costs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591857",,"1561-8633||1684-9981",,"10.5194/nhess-22-4011-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591857","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Brief communication: An autonomous UAV for catchment-wide monitoring of a debris flow torrent",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-01-12T08:11:13Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85145575720",,"000899014300001","Nat. hazards earth syst. sci.","12","Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, they can also be problematic because chemical nitrite oxidation occurs at low pH, leading to the release of harmful nitrogen oxide gases. In this publication, the role of acid-tolerant AOB in urine treatment was explored. On the one hand, the technical feasibility of ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions for source-separated urine with total nitrogen concentrations up to 3.5 g-N L−1 was investigated. On the other hand, the abundance and growth of acid-tolerant AOB at more neutral pH was explored. Under acidic conditions (pH of 5), ammonia oxidation rates of 500 mg-N L−1 d−1 and 10 g-N g-VSS-1 d-1 were observed, despite high concentrations of 15 mg-N L−1 of the AOB-inhibiting compound nitrous acid and low concentration of 0.04 mg-N L−1 of the substrate ammonia. However, ammonia oxidation under acidic conditions was very sensitive to process disturbances. Even short periods of less than 12 h without oxygen or without influent resulted in a complete cessation of ammonia oxidation with a recovery time of up to two months, which is a problem for low maintenance applications such as decentralized treatment. Furthermore, undesirable nitrogen losses of about 10% were observed. Under acidic conditions, a novel AOB strain was enriched with a relative abundance of up to 80%, for which the name “Candidatus (Ca.) Nitrosacidococcus urinae” is proposed. While Nitrosacidococcus members were present only to a small extent (0.004%) in urine nitrification reactors operated at pH values between 5.8 and 7, acid-tolerant AOB were always enriched during long periods without influent, resulting in an uncontrolled drop in pH to as low as 2.5. Long-term experiments at different pH values showed that the activity of “Ca. Nitrosacidococcus urinae” decreased strongly at a pH of 7, where they were also outcompeted by the acid-sensitive AOB Nitrosomonas halophila. The experiment results showed that the decreased activity of “Ca. Nitrosacidococcus urinae” correlated with the limited availability of dissolved iron at neutral pH.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000578210",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2022.100157","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/578210","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nitrification||Acidophilic AOB||Source separation||Chemical nitrite oxidation||Human urine||Life support system","Ammonia oxidation by novel “Candidatus Nitrosacidococcus urinae” is sensitive to process disturbances at low pH and to iron limitation at neutral pH",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-10-28T03:21:19Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85140013370",,"000877925500001",,,"Water Research X","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We then identify how the current situation fits into the circular economy concept and develop quantitative scenarios for the future of industrial AD. The nutrient transfer coefficients through AD are >74 %. In the future, this could replace up to 14,000 t/a of chemical fertilizers, saving up to 40,000 t/a of CO2-eq.

It has been used to model life cycle inventories of three existing and two upcoming brine operations in Argentina, Chile, and China, and is combined with regionalized life cycle impact assessment. Impacts on climate change, particulate matter human health impacts, and water scarcity from lithium carbonate production differ substantially among sites.

In this study, we reviewed the advancements in the atmospheric transport of CBR pollutants, including the urban atmospheric boundary layer, unique concepts, and models for CBR pollutants. We underlined the development of innovative methodologies (e.g., inverse estimation and data assimilation methods) for the atmospheric transport of accidentally released CBR pollutants to reduce uncertainties in emissions and accumulated errors during dispersion by combining numerical models with monitoring data. Finally, we introduced progress in quantitative risk assessment, including exposure assessment and dose-response relationships for CBR hazardous pollutants. A framework, source, assimilation, fundamentals, exposure, and risk (SAFER), has been proposed to integrate the key components in the risk assessment of airborne CBR hazardous pollutants. These methods and models can contribute to effective risk preparedness, prevention, evidence-based policymaking, and emergency response to airborne CBR pollutants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576032",,,,"10.1016/j.jnlssr.2022.09.001","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576032","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Atmospheric dispersion||Bioaerosols||Toxic and flammable chemicals||Radiation||Nuclear accident||Industrial accident||Data assimilation||Dose-response relations||Exposure||Quantitative risk assessment||Probabilistic risk assessment","Atmospheric dispersion of chemical, biological, and radiological hazardous pollutants: Informing risk assessment for public safety",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-10-14T13:55:52Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85139217021",,,,"4","Journal of Safety Science and Resilience","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Monitoring of suspended sediment in rivers with current sensors is challenging and expensive and most monitoring setups are restricted to few single site measurements. To better understand the spatial heterogeneity of fine sediment sources and transport in river networks there is a need for new smart water turbidity sensing that is multi-site, accurate and affordable. In this work, we have created such a sensor, which detects scattered light from an LED source using two detectors in a control volume, and can be placed in a river. We compare several replicates of our sensor to different commercial turbidity probes in a mixing tank experiment using two sediment types over a wide range of typical concentrations observed in rivers. Our results show that we can achieve precise and reproducible turbidity measurements in the 0–4000 NTU or 0–16g/L range. Our sensor can also be used directly as a suspended sediment sensor and bypass an unnecessary calibration to Formazin. The developed turbidity sensor is much cheaper than existing options of comparable quality and is especially intended for distributed sensing across river networks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557177",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-022-14228-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557177","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Engineering||Environmental sciences||Hydrology","Open-source, low-cost, in-situ turbidity sensor for river network monitoring",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-10T03:31:49Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Smart Water Turbidity Sensing in Rivers for Environmental Applications","ETH-13 19-1","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,"85132141173",,"000838090200047","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The stereoscopic monitoring of regional PM2.5 and O3 and their precursors is crucial to achieve coordinated control. However, current monitoring networks are currently inadequate for monitoring the vertical profiles of both PM2.5 and O3 simultaneously and support air quality control. The University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) has established a nationwide ground-based hyperspectral stereoscopic remote sensing network based on multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) since 2015. This monitoring network provides a significant opportunity for the regional coordinated control of PM2.5 and O3 in China. One-year vertical profiles of aerosol, NO2 and HCHO monitored from four MAX-DOAS stations installed in four megacities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Chongqing) were used to characterize their vertical distribution differences in four key regions, Jing–Jin–Ji (JJJ), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Pearl River Delta (PRD), and Sichuan Basin (SB), respectively. The normalized and yearly averaged aerosol vertical profiles below 400 m in JJJ and PRD exhibit a box shape and a Gaussian shape, respectively, and both show exponential shapes in YRD and SB. The NO2 vertical profiles in four regions all exhibit exponential shapes because of vehicle emissions. The shape of the HCHO vertical profile in JJJ and PRD was Gaussian, whereas an exponential shape was shown in YRD and SB. Moreover, a regional transport event occurred at an altitude of 600–1000 m was monitored in the southwest–northeast pathway of the North China Plain (NCP) by five MAX-DOAS stations (Shijiazhuang (SJZ), Wangdu (WD), Nancheng (NC), Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS), and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)) belonging to the above network. The aerosol optical depths (AOD) in these five stations decreased in the order of SJZ > WD > NC > CAMS > UCAS. The short-distance regional transport of NO2 in the 700–900 m layer was monitored between WD and NC. As an important precursor of secondary aerosol, the peak of NO2 air mass in WD and NC all occurred 1 h earlier than that of aerosol. This was also observed for the short-distance regional transport of HCHO in the 700–900 m layer between NC and CAMS, which potentially affected the O3 concentration in Beijing. Finally, CAMS was selected as a typical site to determine the O3–NOx–volatile organic compounds (VOCs) sensitivities in vertical space. We found the production of O3 changed from predominantly VOCs-limited conditions to mainly mixed VOCs–NOx-limited condition from the 0–100 m layer to the 200–300 m layer. In addition, the downward transport of O3 could contribute to the increase of ground surface O3 concentration. This ground-based hyperspectral stereoscopic remote sensing network provide a promising strategy to support management of PM2.5 and O3 and their precursors and conduct attribution of sources.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000524047",,"2095-8099",,"10.1016/j.eng.2021.02.019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524047","en","Engineering Sciences Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","MAX-DOAS||Stereoscopic monitoring||Regional transport||Ozone production||Control strategy","Ground-based Hyperspectral Stereoscopic Remote Sensing Network: A Promising Strategy to Learn Coordinated Control of O3 and PM2.5 over China",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-01-08T15:45:00Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Engineering","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The formation of LFIs usually requires the manipulation of multiple streams within a microchannel using a complex hydrodynamic pumping system. Herein, we present a new type of LFI that is generated by fluid switching within a three-dimensional (3D) microlens-incorporating microfluidic chip (3D-MIMC). Since Poiseuille flows exhibit a parabolic velocity profile, the LFI is cone-like in shape and acts as a transient refractive interface (TRI), which is sensitive to the refractive index (RI) and the Péclet number (Pe) of the switching fluids. In response to the TRI, the intensity of the transmitted light can be intensified or attenuated depending on the sequence of fluid switching operations. By incorporating three-dimensional (3D) microlenses and increasing the Pe values, the profile and amplitude of the intensity peak are both significantly improved. The limit of detection (LoD) for a sodium chloride (NaCl) solution at Pe = 1363 is as low as 0.001% (w/w), representing an improvement of 1–2 orders of magnitude when compared to existing optofluidic concentration sensors based on intensity modulation. Fluid switching of a variety of inorganic and organic sample fluids confirms that the specific optical response (Kor) correlates positively with both Pe and the specific RI (Knc), obeying a linear relationship. This model is further verified through cross-validations and used to estimate the molecular diffusion coefficient (D) of a range of species. Furthermore, by virtue of the TRI, we achieve a sensitive measurement of optical-equivalent total dissolved solids (OE-TDS) for environmental samples.",,,,"2379-3694",,"10.1021/acssensors.2c01901","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580635","en","American Chemical Society",,,"Laminar flow interface||Microfluid switching||Refractive index||Diffusion coefficient||Poiseuille flow","Microfluid Switching-Induced Transient Refractive Interface",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-11-14T11:16:14Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85142002516",,"000893270400001","ACS Sens","11","ACS Sensors","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This study uses an enhanced multiregional input–output database (REX, Resolved EXIOBASE) and supply chain impact mapping (SCIM) method to assess global biodiversity loss associated with mining-related land use. We identify hotspots in the supply chain of mining products, compare the impact of fossil and renewable electricity, and estimate the share of mining in total global impacts. We found that half of the global mining-related biodiversity loss occurs in Indonesia, Australia, and New Caledonia. Major international trade flows of embodied biodiversity loss involve Indonesia’s coal exports to China and India, New Caledonia’s nickel exports to Japan and Australia, and Australia’s iron and bauxite exports to China. Key end-consumers include China’s growing infrastructure and the EU’s and USA’s household consumption. Electricity generation accounted for 10% of global mining-related biodiversity loss in 2014. The impact of coal-fired electricity was 10 times higher than that of renewables per unit of electricity generated. Globally, mining contributes to less than 1% of the total land use-related biodiversity loss, which is dominated by agriculture. Our results provide transparency in sourcing more sustainable mining products and underline synergies in fostering renewables to meet local biodiversity and global climate targets.",,,,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.2c04003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/579167","en","American Chemical Society",,,"multiregional input−output (MRIO) analysis||metals||coal||biodiversity loss footprint||land use||regionalized impact assessment||sustainable mining||supply chain mapping","Hotspots of Mining-Related Biodiversity Loss in Global Supply Chains and the Potential for Reduction through Renewable Electricity",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-11-03T06:51:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85141092398",,,"Environ.

With the exception of relying on the common total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer and dithiothreitol (DTT) assay, there is currently no easy-to-use method for quantitative assessment. Herein, a compatible and easy-to-use colorimetric sensing strategy was developed for on-site ARC quantification. This approach integrated a plasmonic sensing system, where the ARC-induced gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) reduction, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), and the light-mediated photochemistry collaborated to achieve a limit of detection (LOD) at 0.026 μg∙mm-2 on the filters. Distinguished from the abovementioned methods, the ARC content can be directly determined by in-situ monitoring the colorimetric reaction on the sampling quartz filters (QF) without additional sample pre-treatment. Apart from utilizing the standard benchtop photodetector (e.g., UV-VIS spectrophotometer), the colorimetric images of AuNP@QF samples could also be imaged by a smartphone camera in a sealed box and analyzed through a smartphone-based application to read the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values for ARC quantification. The good correlation between the results using the spectrophotometer and smartphone validate the applicability of the AuNP sensor. The smartphone-based method was then deployed to test real-world aerosols collected from Zurich, Bern and Rigi and the results of ARC exhibited a positive correlation with that of PM10. With the advantages of low-cost, easy-operation and no need for pre-treatment, this smartphone-based plasmonic system holds great potential for rapid and portable ARC detection and corresponding air quality assessment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000563360",,"0925-4005",,"10.1016/j.snb.2022.132505","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563360","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Airborne redox-active compounds||Gold nanoparticles||Light-mediated photochemistry reaction||Smartphone||Real-world aerosols","A portable and smartphone-based plasmonic system for on-site measurement of airborne redox-active compounds by light-initiated redox reaction",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-12T06:40:29Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85135887066",,"000843520800002",,,"Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical","371","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Three types of SDA mixtures with virgin materials, waste PE, and EAFSS were prepared and water sensitivity tests were conducted to determine the mechanical performance. The LCA defined three scenarios using system expansion, namely (1) the reference scenario using virgin materials in SDA and disposal of waste PE and EAFSS by municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) and landfill, respectively; (2) the test scenario using waste PE and straight run binder in SDA, with landfilling of EAFSS; (3) the test scenario using EAFSS in SDA, with the disposal of waste PE by MSWI. The data from the experiments, Swiss industries, official reports, and standard databases were used for the inventory analysis. The results show that compared to the reference, the scenarios using waste PE and EAFSS in SDA would reduce 15 % and 36 % of greenhouse gases emissions, respectively. The reason for the improved environmental performance when waste PE is used in asphalt can be attributed to the use of straight run binder to replace polymer-modified binder and the avoided MSWI.

The primary intention is to minimize mine tailings disposal problems through volume reduction while recovering secondary resources for industrial materials. However, the environmental benefits and tradeoffs behind these objectives remain unclear. This study conducts a processbased life cycle assessment (LCA) study to investigate multiple reprocessing pathways of copper tailings to coproduce secondary metals and building materials. Four design options representing different value-recovery routes are constructed to assess the environmental burdens of reprocessing chains and the associated benefits from displaced virgin products. This study assesses emerging technologies in a prospective LCA, with projections of bottom-up foreground process modeling and background data like energy supply scenarios. Our analysis reveals that the assessed technologies can only be beneficial when all co-products are utilized. Results indicate that reprocessing may save from 25 up to 930 kg CO2-eq per tonne of treated copper tailings. Potential environmental benefits depend on the reprocessing routes, technology upscaling parameters, and quality of secondary products. We propose recommendations to enhance the environmental performances of mine tailings reprocessing strategies, such as switching to low-impact chemical alternatives and optimizing energy use.

This near-field manipulation opens opportunities for next-generation biosensing with the capability of large-area trapping and in situ detection. In this article, we used the finite element method (FEM) to analyze the motion mechanism of nano-objects (50–500 nm) in the near-field optics, especially localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The size-dependent optical forces and hydrodynamic forces of subwavelength nanoparticles (<500 nm) in different hydrodynamic velocity fields were calculated. When the strength of the local electric field was increased, LSPR with two-dimensional gold nanoislands (AuNIs) showed improved capability for manipulating nano-objects near the vicinity of the AuNI interface. Through the experiments of in situ interferometric testing 50–500 nm nano-objects with constant number concentration or volume fraction, it was confirmed that the local plasmonic near-field was able to trap the dielectric polystyrene beads smaller than 200 nm. The plasmofluidic system was further verified by testing biological nanovesicles such as exosomes (40–200 nm) and high- and low-density lipoproteins (10–200 nm).

While this enzymatic reaction can be prevented by alkalizing the urine, recent studies suggest that chemical urea hydrolysis can result in substantial nitrogen losses when drying alkalinized urine at high temperatures. Furthermore, it was previously suggested that CO2 dissolution from the air used to evaporate water from alkalinized urine could result in a pH decrease to values which allows for biological urea hydrolysis and subsequent ammonia losses. This study aimed to determine the kinetics of chemical urea hydrolysis in alkalinized human urine and confirm the effect of CO2 dissolution with controlled laboratory experiments. We measured the change in urea concentration at different temperatures and pH values for real human urine and determined the corresponding rate constants for chemical urea hydrolysis. We showed that the rate constant increases as a function of temperature and that pH has a negligible effect on the rate of chemical urea hydrolysis in the high pH range of alkalized urine (>11). The rate constants for chemical urea hydrolysis in a saturated calcium hydroxide solution were found to be 0.00147 d−1, 0.00595 d−1, 0.0204 d−1 and 0.0848 d−1 for temperatures of 25°C, 40°C, 55°C and 70°C, respectively. The effect of CO2 dissolution on urea hydrolysis was determined by aerating human urine alkalinized with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2). In order to represent biological urea hydrolysis, urease was added to the solution. The computer simulations of the experimental results showed that CO2 dissolution and the subsequent dissociation of carbonic acid to carbonate ions, bicarbonate ions and protons is the main cause of the pH decrease, but CaCO3 precipitation, and NH3 volatilization foster the pH decrease. However, biological urea hydrolysis prevents the pH from decreasing below 9. Residual undissolved Ca(OH)2 was shown to substantially delay the pH decrease. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of urea hydrolysis in alkalinized urine during dehydration, which can be used to design more efficient decentralized sanitation systems and minimize nitrogen losses.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000581241",,"2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2022.998743","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/581241","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","calcium phosphate||fertilizer||sanitation||source separation||urea hydrolysis","High temperatures and CO2 dissolution can cause nitrogen losses from urine stabilized with base",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-11-17T05:26:15Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85141414505",,"000880296000001","Front.

These require sound assessment to prevent burden-shifting. One assessment approach for that is the Planetary Boundary framework which acts as a guidance system for maintaining the stability of the Earth. This framework is still under development and has so far only been applied in a few several sectors, not including the metal sector. The environmental challenges of the metal sectors are unique, the adaptation potentials of existing work have not been investigated and the specific data and methodology gaps are unclear. Hence, this paper reviews the current knowledge as well as the open research gaps of the critical planetary boundaries (including for example climate change, biodiversity integrity, freshwater use) related to the metals required for low-carbon technologies. To complement that perspective, life cycle assessments stress the relevance of fine particulate matter formation as well as toxicity impacts, with the related planetary boundaries (atmospheric aerosol loading and introduction of novel entities) being the least developed ones. The interplay of different scales of planetary boundaries like on regional or global level will need further assessment. Finally, we consolidate our findings to formulate the research objectives that will complete the mapping of the metal sector onto the Planetary Boundary framework.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000571726",,"0959-6526",,"10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133620","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/571726","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Low-carbon technologies||LCA||Planetary boundaries||Metals||Climate change||Environmental impacts","Metals for low-carbon technologies: Environmental impacts and relation to planetary boundaries",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2022-09-20T14:04:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85138162980",,"000876532900001","J Cleaner Prod.",,"Journal of Cleaner Production","372","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In this work, a complete and efficient process for the recovery and reuse of meta-aramid filter bag was proposed, which mainly included three stages, i.e., pretreatment, dissolution recovery and reuse. Firstly, the feasibility of recycling the pretreated used meta-aramid filter media was demonstrated by FT-IR, XRD and SEM characterization. Then the optimum dissolution method was selected for the recovery of used filter materials. The effects of dissolving temperature, type and concentration of solubilizer on dissolution time, solubility and dissolution products were systematically investigated. 110 °C, 4 wt% LiCl as solubilizer and DMAc as solvent were selected as the preferred conditions. The method was successfully used to achieve 100% dissolution recovery of used meta-aramid material with a concentration of 25 wt%, and the whole recovery process was environmentally friendly. Moreover, the recovered meta-aramid solution was used to prepare meta-aramid films by phase inversion method. The performance tests and characterization confirmed that the obtained films had good thermal stability, mechanical properties, flame retardancy and insulation properties.

Using the WaterHub modeling framework, we simulated the technologies alone and in combination and compared the energetic performance of fifteen scenarios with a validated reference domestic hot water system. Low-flow appliances as standalone technologies performed best with 30% less energy required for the boiler tank, but combining low-flow appliances with a membrane bioreactor heat exchanger performed best overall (50% reduction).

From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, using a facemask in different locations was recommended to slow down the spread of the virus. To evaluate facemasks' performance, masks' filtration efficiency is tested for a range of particle sizes. Although such tests quantify the blockage of the mask for a range of particle sizes, the test does not quantify the cumulative amount of virus-laden particles inhaled or exhaled by its wearer. In this study, we quantify the accumulated viruses that the healthy person inhales as a function of time, activity level, type of mask, and room condition using a physics-based model. We considered different types of masks, such as surgical masks and filtering facepieces (FFPs), and different characteristics of public places such as office rooms, buses, trains, and airplanes. To do such quantification, we implemented a physics-based model of the mask. Our results confirm the importance of both people wearing a mask compared to when only one wears the mask. The protection time for light activity in an office room decreases from 7.8 to 1.4 h with surgical mask IIR. The protection time is further reduced by 85 and 99% if the infected person starts to cough or increases the activity level, respectively. Results show the leakage of the mask can considerably affect the performance of the mask. For the surgical mask, the apparent filtration efficiency reduces by 75% with such a leakage, which cannot provide sufficient protection despite the high filtration efficiency of the mask. The facemask model presented provides key input in order to evaluate the protection of masks for different conditions in public places.

The ability of biofilms to clog pores, the so-called bioclogging, can have a tremendous effect on the local permeability of the porous medium, creating a pressure buildup in the system, and impacting the mass flow through it. To understand the interplay between biofilm growth and fluid flow under different physical conditions (e.g., at different flow velocities and pore sizes), in the present study, a microfluidic platform is developed to visualize biofilm development using a microscope under externally-imposed, controlled physical conditions. The biofilm-induced pressure buildup in the porous medium can be measured simultaneously using pressure sensors and, later, correlated with the surface coverage of the biofilm.

This article performs a comprehensive LCA for SMA and SDA including noise considerations. State-of-the-art sound emission and acoustical ageing models were used to determine the road traffic noise. The latest Swiss dose-response curves and current noise exposure data were used to evaluate health impacts due to noise. Additionally, traditional LCA is also included for assessing the greenhouse gas emissions, non-renewable cumulative energy demand and health impacts of non-noise processes. The results show that SDA causes around 70 % higher greenhouse gases and energy demand than SMA, primarily due to its shorter service life. However, the noise impacts in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) are higher by two to three orders of magnitude than non-noise processes, and the use of SDA can reduce 40 % of the total DALYs. It is shown that road traffic noise plays a significant role in the LCA of pavements. The trade-off between greenhouse gas and energy related impacts, on the one hand, and health effects, on the other hand, requires critical consideration by decision makers when promoting low-noise pavements.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557175",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156846","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557175","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Environmental trade-offs for using low-noise pavements: Life cycle assessment with noise considerations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-10T03:31:39Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85132529192",,,"Sci.

Efficient, accurate, and trustworthy methods for urban flood management have become increasingly important due to higher rainfall intensity caused by climate change, the expansion of cities, and changes in land use. While physically based flood models can provide reliable forecasts for water depth at every location of a catchment, their high computational burden is hindering their application to large urban areas at high spatial resolution. While deep learning models have been used to address this issue, a disadvantage is that they are often perceived as ""black-box"" models and are overconfident about their predictions, therefore decreasing their reliability. Our deep learning model learns the underlying phenomena a priori from simulated hydrodynamic data, obviating the need for manual parameter setting for every new rainfall event at test time. The only inputs needed at the test time are a rainfall forecast and parameters of the terrain such as a digital elevation model to predict the maximum water depth with uncertainty estimates for complete rainfall events. We validate the accuracy and generalisation capabilities of our approach through experiments on a dataset consisting of catchments within Switzerland and Portugal and 18 rainfall patterns. Our method produces flood hazard maps at 1 m resolution and achieves mean absolute errors as low as 21 cm for extreme flood cases with water above 1 m. Most importantly, we demonstrate that our approach is able to provide an uncertainty estimate for every water depth within the predicted hazard map, thus increasing the model's trustworthiness during flooding events.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000577317",,"2073-4441",,"10.3390/w14192980","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/577317","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","flood prediction||deep learning||uncertainty estimation","Flood Uncertainty Estimation Using Deep Ensembles",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-10-23T03:33:02Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85139843619",,"000867389400001",,"19","Water","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Therefore, innovative strategies to improve the environmental performances of this sector are needed, and the use of recycled materials (e.g., plastic) has been recently pursued to achieve this goal. The present work aims to (i) assess the environmental benefits deriving from the use of recycled hard plastics in combination with graphene to generate a new bitumen modifier and related asphalt mixture (AM) formulations (ii) to compare the performance of the bitumen modified using this new modifier with the bitumen modified using a traditional polymer (Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene, SBS) and the non-modified bitumen. A detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study was performed according to a cradle-to-cradle approach. Different scenarios were compared, including the variability of the pavement's layers thickness and the amount of reclaimed asphalt pavement during the road maintenance cycles. The results demonstrated that the addition of the innovative modifier enhanced the structural performance of AMs, which turns into pavement extended durability, reduced maintenance cycles as well as into reduction in raw material use. The innovative asphalt modifier also creates a synergistic effect by offering a valuable alternative to hard plastic incineration by using it as a secondary raw material. This analysis allowed us to indicate the new-modified AM as the solution with the least environmental burden in all impact categories, suggesting its significant role in implementing new strategies to improve the environmental sustainability of road pavements.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000580565",,"2227-9717",,"10.3390/pr10102151","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580565","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","LCA||sustainability||end-of-life plastics||hard plastics||environmental performance||circular economy||road pavement","Environmental Performance of Road Asphalts Modified with End-of-Life Hard Plastics and Graphene: Strategies for Improving Sustainability",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-11-10T13:51:32Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85140959989",,"000873585200001",,"10","Processes","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, faceseal leakage is a major contributor to the number of potentially infectious airborne droplets entering the respiratory system of a susceptible individual. The identification of leaking spots and the quantification of leaking flows are crucial to estimate the protection provided by facemasks. This study presents a critical review on the measurement and calculation of facemask leakages and a quantitative analysis of their role in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It shows that the pairing between the mask dimensions and the wearer's face is essential to improve protection efficiency, especially for FFP2 masks, and summarizes the most common leaking spots at the interface between the mask and the wearer's face. Leakage is a crucial factor in the calculation of the protection provided by facemasks and outweighs the filtration performances. The fit factors measured among mask users were summarized for different types of face protection. The reviewed data were integrated into a computational model to compare the mitigation impact of facemasks with vaccination with consideration of new variants of SARS-CoV-2. Combining a high adoption rate of facemasks and a high vaccination rate is crucial to efficiently control the spread of highly infectious variants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576031",,"0905-6947||1600-0668",,"10.1111/ina.13127","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576031","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Facemask||Filtration efficiency||Fit factor||Infection risk||Leakage||SARS-CoV-2","A critical review on the role of leakages in the facemask protection against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with consideration of vaccination and virus variants",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2022-10-14T13:54:34Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85140861713",,"000870227400001",,"10","Indoor Air","32","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Part of the uncertainty is owed to the intrinsic randomness of climate phenomena, which is considered irreducible. Additionally, modelling the response of hydrological processes to the changing climate requires the use of a chain of numerical models, each of which contributes some degree of uncertainty to the final outputs. As a result, hydrological projections, despite the progressive increase in the accuracy of the models along the chain, still display high levels of uncertainty, especially at small temporal and spatial scales. In this work, we present a framework to quantify and partition the uncertainty of hydrological processes emerging from climate models and internal variability, across a broad range of scales. Using the example of two mountainous catchments in Switzerland, we produced high-resolution ensembles of climate and hydrological data using a two-dimensional weather generator (AWE-GEN- 2d) and a distributed hydrological model (TOPKAPI-ETH). We quantified the uncertainty in hydrological projections towards the end of the century through the estimation of the values of signal-to-noise ratios (STNR). We found small STNR absolute values (<1) in the projection of annual streamflow for most sub-catchments in both study sites that are dominated by the large natural variability of precipitation (explains ~70% of total uncertainty). Furthermore, we investigated in detail specific hydrological components that are critical in the model chain. For example, snowmelt and liquid precipitation exhibit robust change signals, which translates into high STNR values for streamflow during warm seasons and at higher elevations, together with a larger contribution of climate model uncertainty. In contrast, projections of extreme high flows show low STNR values due to large internal climate variability across all elevations, which limits the potential for narrowing their estimation uncertainty.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000577286",,"0885-6087||1099-1085",,"10.1002/hyp.14695","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/577286","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","climate change||hydrological modelling||hydrological uncertainty||uncertainty partition||weather generator","Uncertainty in high-resolution hydrological projections: Partitioning the influence of climate models and natural climate variability",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-10-22T03:04:44Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85141190015",,"000864054800001","Hydrol.

The increasing pressure on the primary raw materials sector and external market dependence can ultimately lead to scarcity of natural resources. To minimise this pressure, alternative materials need to be mapped, characterised, and valorised. Construction and demolition waste and mining waste are currently the biggest waste streams in the EU27 and can lead to environmental, health, and social hazards. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sustainable use of (clean) sulphidic mining waste materials in facing bricks. After materials’ characterisation, a company-specific blend for facing bricks has been modified on a lab scale, by partly replacing primary raw materials with mining waste materials (Plombières tailings and Neves Corvo waste rocks). The production processes, product quality, and environmental performance of waste-derived bricks were assessed and compared to standards and regulatory limits. A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to evaluate the environmental profiles of the best performing waste-derived bricks compared with standard bricks. Results show the suitability of using the untreated Plombières tailings material in facing brick blends, giving satisfactory technical and aesthetical properties, and complying with environmental regulations for service, 2nd life, and end-of-life stages. According to the LCA, facing bricks made with 40 wt% Plombières tailings demonstrated better environmental performances than standard bricks. The pre-treated Neves Corvo waste rock materials were unsuitable for facing bricks due to the high sulphur and metal(loid)s content that caused aesthetical and chemical-environmental problems.",,,,"0959-6526",,"10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.133118","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566904","en","Elsevier",,,"Building ceramics||Circular economy||Facing bricks||LCA||Mining waste||Valorisation","Mine waste as a sustainable resource for facing bricks",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-08-27T03:03:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85134230914",,"000931805200001","J Cleaner Prod.",,"Journal of Cleaner Production","368","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The performance of low noise semi dense asphalt (SDA) mixtures with waste polyethylene (PE) plastic is investigated. The cyclic compression test (CCT) and semi-circular bending (SCB) test was used for characterization of high and low temperature performance. The CCT results revealed that the PmB mixture had shown significantly higher resistance compared to the PE mixture. However, the PE modification showed some improvements in terms of CCT loading when compared with mixtures using the same base binder without PE. The SCB test results found that on average using higher content of PE mixtures had slightly improved fracture energy and lower fracture toughness compared to asphalt mixtures using polymer modified binder (PmB). The electron microscopy images showed that the PE does not completely melt during the mixing process and exists as elastic bodies within the mixture. The findings showed that at low temperatures, both PE and binder behave elastically, whereas at higher temperatures, PE remains elastic, and binder's viscoelasticity becomes dominant. These results highlight the importance of selecting proper base binder for such modifications with waste plastic.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000563078",,"0950-0618",,"10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.128633","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563078","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Asphalt||Polyethylene||Waste recycling||Semicircular bending||Cyclic compression test","High and low temperature performance of polyethylene waste plastic modified low noise asphalt mixtures",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-11T03:58:42Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85135355893",,"000879548000001","Constr. build. mater.",,"Construction and Building Materials","348","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Globally, these services are undergoing major transformative processes such as digitalization, decentralization, or integrated management. Such processes not only depend on technical changes in infrastructure systems but also include important social and socio-technical dimensions. In this article, we propose a socio-technical network perspective to study the ensemble of social actors and technical elements involved in an infrastructure system, and their complex relations. We conceptualize structurally explicit socio-technical networks of networked infrastructure systems based on methodological considerations from network analysis and draw on concepts from socio-technical system theories and social-ecological network studies. Based on these considerations, we suggest analytical methods to study basic network concepts such as density, reciprocity, and centrality in a socio-technical network. We illustrate socio-technical motifs, i.e., meaningful sub-structures in socio-technical networks of infrastructure management. Drawing on these, we describe how infrastructure systems can be analyzed in terms of digitalization, decentralization, and integrated management from a socio-technical network perspective. Using the example of urban wastewater systems, we illustrate an empirical application of our approach. The results of an empirical case study in Switzerland demonstrate the potential of socio-technical networks to promote a deeper understanding of complex socio-technical relations in networked infrastructure systems. We contend that such a deeper understanding could improve management practices of infrastructure systems and is becoming even more important for enabling future data-driven, decentralized, and more integrated infrastructure management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000558601",,"0301-4797||1095-8630",,"10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115596","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/558601","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Socio-technical networks||Multi-level networks||Socio-technical relations||Infrastructure management||Urban wastewater management","Socio-technical networks of infrastructure management: Network concepts and motifs for studying digitalization, decentralization, and integrated management",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-19T03:46:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85133706732",,"000828702400001","J. environ. manag.",,"Journal of Environmental Management","318","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This is a difficult task, because the relationship between water and energy in domestic systems is intricate and complex. In general, the intrinsic uncertainty and variability of water demand makes the planning and assessment of new technologies challenging, but also risks related for instance to water pathogens like Legionella pneumophila impose trade-offs that diminish the performance of energy-saving measures. In this short communication, we argue that truly sustainable solutions will only be found if a multi-scale, multi-disciplinary mindset is adopted by the community. We show how the collaboration and knowledge integration between experts of various fields, notably urban water specialists and building engineers, is a prerequisite to resolve some of the most pressing issues on the way to optimizing domestic hot water systems.

To evaluate the environmental sustainability of a technology, the operational carbon footprint and therefore nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions should be known, but N2O emissions from urine nitrification have not been assessed yet. Therefore, N2O emissions of a decentralized urine nitrification reactor were monitored for 1 month. During nitrification, 0.4-1.2% of the total nitrogen load was emitted as N2O-N with an average N2O emission factor (EFN2O) of 0.7%. Additional N2O was produced during anoxic storage between nitrification and GAC filtration with an estimated EFN2O of 0.8%, resulting in an EFN2O of 1.5% for the treatment chain. N2O emissions during nitrification can be mitigated by 60% by avoiding low dissolved oxygen or anoxic conditions and nitrite concentrations above 5 mg-N L-1. Minimizing the hydraulic retention time between nitrification and GAC filtration can reduce N2O formation during intermediate storage by 100%. Overall, the N2O emissions accounted for 45% of the operational carbon footprint of 14 kg-CO2,equiv kg-N-1 for urine fertilizer production. Using electricity from renewable sources and applying the proposed N2O mitigation strategies could potentially lower the carbon footprint by 85%.",,,,"2690-0645",,"10.1021/acsestengg.2c00082","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/578744","en","American Chemical Society",,,"Anatomy||Anions||Distillation||Filtration||Nitrogen","Nitrous Oxide Emissions and Carbon Footprint of Decentralized Urine Fertilizer Production by Nitrification and Distillation",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-11-01T04:23:07Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85140004131",,,"ACS EST Engg.","9","ACS ES&T Engineering","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Results for PM2.5 collected from Bern (urban area), Basel (suburban area), Zürich (urban area), Sion (airport highway area), and Rigi (rural and high-altitude area) in Switzerland were obtained, in favorable agreement with gel electrophoresis analysis.

Despite large efforts to monitor micropollutants in the last decade, the gained information is still limited and scattered. In a metastudy we performed a data-driven analysis of measurements collected at 77 sites (683 events, 297 detected micropollutants) over the last decade to investigate which micropollutants are most relevant in terms of 1) occurrence and 2) potential risk for the aquatic environment, 3) estimate the minimum number of data to be collected in monitoring studies to reliably obtain concentration estimates, and 4) provide recommendations for future monitoring campaigns. We highlight micropollutants to be prioritized due to their high occurrence and critical concentration levels compared to environmental quality standards. These top-listed micropollutants include contaminants from all chemical classes (pesticides, heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and industrial and household chemicals). Analysis of over 30,000 event mean concentrations shows a large fraction of measurements (> 50%) were below the limit of quantification, stressing the need for reliable, standard monitoring procedures. High variability was observed among events and sites, with differences between micropollutant classes. The number of events required for a reliable estimate of site mean concentrations (error bandwidth of 1 around the “true"" value) depends on the individual micropollutant. The median minimum number of events is 7 for CSO (2 to 31, 80%-interquantile) and 6 for SWO (1 to 25 events, 80%-interquantile). Our analysis indicates the minimum number of sites needed to assess global pollution levels and our data collection and analysis can be used to estimate the required number of sites for an urban catchment. Our data-driven analysis demonstrates how future wet-weather monitoring programs will be more effective if the consequences of high variability inherent in urban wet-weather discharges are considered.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000567783",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2022.118968","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/567783","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Trace contaminants||Stormwater outlets||Combined sewer overflow||Sampling||Data-driven analysis||Metastudy||Heavy metals","A decade of monitoring micropollutants in urban wet-weather flows: What did we learn?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-31T03:13:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85136131615",,"000864165600001","Water Res.",,"Water Research","223","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Typically, this has been done by assessing water consumption in a country/city or sector against the assigned share of the global limit. Such an approach enables evaluating whether a sub-global unit operates within the safe global limits. However, it ignores spatial water availability and thus may provide an incomplete image of water-related environmental impacts and thus local boundaries. This study demonstrates how the water planetary boundary concept can be integrated within the Environmentally Extended Multi-Region Input-Output (EEMRIO) framework to assess global and local (watershed level) boundaries. Our results demonstrate that even though most countries operate within globally safe limits, for several countries, a large share of water comes from watersheds that have reached unsafe water consumption levels. This highlights the importance of combining local and global level assessments to design more accurate and tailored policy responses targeting specific watersheds that are most at risk.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000570467",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ac84f2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/570467","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","planetary boundaries||water||input output analysis||safe operating space||environmental assessment","A planetary boundary-based method to assess freshwater use at the global and local scales",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-09-14T03:20:52Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85138046824",,"000850686100001","Environ.

The Global Life Cycle Impact Assessment Method (GLAM) project of the Life Cycle Initiative hosted by the UN Environment Programme aims at making recommendations for new impact assessment models (such as for land use, water consumption and eutrophication) and improving the consistency and comparability across impact categories. An important aspect to ensure the comparability of these categories across geographic regions is to identify and quantify the scale of impacts, i.e., distinguish if an impact to an area results in local species losses or global species extinctions. This distinction is of high relevance because a species lost at a local level may still exist in other regions of the world and could potentially reestablish in that area, whereas global extinctions are irreversible. A consistent approach to scale impacts from local to global scales is currently not implemented within the LCIA framework, but is crucial to appropriately consider potential biodiversity impacts across impact categories. Here we present an updated approach for calculating a scaling factor, called the Global Extinction Probability (GEP), and calculate it for more than 98 000 species in 20 species groups across marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. We also provide the GEPs for different spatial scales, such as grid cells, ecoregions or watersheds and country averages. We found that GEP varies over orders of magnitude across the world, emphasizing the relevance of considering the spatial dimension of such extinction probabilities. We recommend quantifying global extinctions based on local species loss by multiplying local species loss within a certain spatial unit with the GEP corresponding to the same spatial unit. GEPs harmonize the quantification of biodiversity impacts across impact categories, improving information to support environmental decision-making.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000562270",,"1470-160X||1872-7034",,"10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109204","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/562270","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Life Cycle Impact Assessment||Ecosystem quality||Species richness||Biodiversity loss||Species extinctions||Global extinction probability","Global extinction probabilities of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species groups for use in Life Cycle Assessment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-06T03:28:13Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85135120283",,"000859332200001",,,"Ecological Indicators","142","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This work proposes novel simplified models based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) that enable rapid but accurate estimates of the environmental impacts of geothermal power. The proposed approach not only reduces the variability of LCA estimates due to methodological choices, but also substantially facilitates data collection by identifying the most important input parameters. These parameters are selected using Sobol’ total order indices from Global Sensitivity Analysis to a general parametric model. The models are applicable to both conventional and enhanced geothermal technologies, and cover numerous environmental impact categories. We determine the level of correlation between the simplified models and the general model. Our analysis shows that the simplified models correlate well with the general model, with correlation coefficients above 0.75 for both types of geothermal technologies and for all environmental categories. We also evaluate the performance of the simplified models by comparison with literature data. The results are positive, especially for conventional technologies where the relative difference with literature data on climate change impacts averages 14%. Finally, we identify the most appropriate model for each technology archetype and environmental category.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000592802",,"2666-7894",,"10.1016/j.cesys.2022.100086","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/592802","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Renewable energy||Enhanced geothermal systems||Carbon footprint||Meta models||Model validation","Simplified models for predicting the environmental impacts of geothermal power generation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-01-16T19:46:54Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Science 4 Clean Energy","764810","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,,,"Cleaner Environmental Systems","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Research to fill this gap is only emerging and dewatering is a key challenge for developing sustainable treatment solutions. This study evaluated the effect of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on dewaterability of FS, and how EPS and dewaterability change during anaerobic storage (as a proxy for time in onsite containment). EPS was extracted from FS and activated sludge using Na2CO3 and sonication and added to sludge samples to determine the effect on dewaterability. The results confirmed that an increase in EPS had a direct impact of decreasing FS dewaterability (as capillary suction time). In this context, we evaluated FS degradation during anaerobic storage, the effect of anaerobic storage time on EPS, EPS fractions and particle size distribution, and the effect of variations in these factors on FS dewaterability. Variations in EPS, EPS fraction and particle size distribution during anaerobic storage were less than expected and average VS reduction of 20% was recorded over 7 weeks. Although anaerobic digestion was verified (biogas production), the results indicate that kinetics of degradation of FS is different from wastewater sludges. Comparatively, EPS fractions in FS were 70 – 75% lower and with higher fractions of humic-like substances than wastewater sludges. Although EPS significantly affects FS dewaterability, anaerobic storage time is not a predictor of dewaterability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000563580",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2022.118915","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563580","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Blackwater||Sludge filtration||Biomethane potential test||Microbial community analysis||Particle size distribution","Elucidating the role of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in dewaterability of fecal sludge from onsite sanitation systems, and changes during anaerobic storage.",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-14T03:20:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85135501571",,"000879233100002","Water Res.",,"Water Research","222","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The uncontrolled pace of building activity and the erosion of blue (i.e., aquatic) and green (i.e., terrestrial) landscape elements threaten existing habitat ranges and movability of wildlife. Local scale measures, such as nature-inspired engineered Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) are emerging mitigation solutions. Originally planned to promote sustainable stormwater management, adaptation to climate change and improved human livability in cities, such instruments offer interesting synergies for biodiversity in support of existing ecological infrastructure. BGI are especially appealing for globally declining amphibians, a rich and diverse vertebrate assemblage sensitive to urbanization. We integrated biological and highly resolved urban-rural land-cover data, ensemble models of habitat suitability, and connectivity models based on circuit theory to improve multi-scale and multi-species protection of core habitats and ecological corridors in the Swiss lowlands. Considering a broad spectrum of amphibian biodiversity, we identified distributions of amphibian biodiversity hotspots and four landscape elements essential to amphibian movability at the regional scale, namely i) forest edges, ii) wet-forest habitats, iii) soils with variable moisture and iv) riparian zones. Our work shows that cities can make a substantial contribution (e.g., up to 15% of urban space in the study area) to wider landscape habitat connectivity. We highlight the importance of planning BGI locally in strategic locations across urban and peri-urban areas to promote the permeability and availability of ‘stepping stone’ habitats in densely populated landscapes, essential to the maintenance of regional habitat connectivity and thereby enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000548456",,"0301-4797||1095-8630",,"10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115254","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/548456","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biodiversity||Circuit theory||Ecological corridors||Human dominated landscapes||Integrated modelling||Urban spatial planning","Reconciling cities with nature: Identifying local Blue-Green Infrastructure interventions for regional biodiversity enhancement",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-05-22T04:26:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85129942426",,"000805787400002","J. environ. manag.",,"Journal of Environmental Management","316","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Among these protozoa, Acanthamoeba are ubiquitous in the soil and aqueous environments inhabited by Listeria monocytogenes. Observations of predator-prey interactions between these two microorganisms revealed a predation strategy in which Acanthamoeba castellanii assemble L. monocytogenes in aggregates, termed backpacks, on their posterior. The rapid formation and specific location of backpacks led to the assumption that A. castellanii may recruit L. monocytogenes by releasing an attractant. However, this hypothesis has not been validated, and the mechanisms driving this process remained unknown. Here, we combined video microscopy, microfluidics, single-cell image analyses, and theoretical modeling to characterize predator-prey interactions of A. castellanii and L. monocytogenes and determined whether bacterial chemotaxis contributes to the backpack formation. Our results indicate that L. monocytogenes captures are not driven by chemotaxis. Instead, random encounters of bacteria with amoebae initialize bacterial capture and aggregation. This is supported by the strong correlation between experimentally derived capture rates and theoretical encounter models at the single-cell level. Observations of the spatial rearrangement of L. monocytogenes trapped by A. castellanii revealed that bacterial aggregation into backpacks is mainly driven by amoeboid locomotion. Overall, we show that two nonspecific, independent mechanisms, namely random encounters enhanced by bacterial motility and predator surface-bound locomotion, drive backpack formation, resulting in a bacterial aggregate on the amoeba ready for phagocytosis. Due to the prevalence of these two processes in the environment, we expect this strategy to be widespread among amoebae, contributing to their effectiveness as predators.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000563075",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2122659119","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563075","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Predation||Random encounter||Capture dynamics||Acanthamoeba||Listeria","Random encounters and amoeba locomotion drive the predation of Listeria monocytogenes by Acanthamoeba castellanii",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-11T03:58:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Microscale investigation of key bacterial phenotypes enhancing collection by rising bubbles and aerial dispersal","798411","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85135311348",,"000926104800014","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","32","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","119","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Yet, they have important ecological functions and societies are reliant on their surface waters for their lives and livelihoods. It is essential to monitor and understand the dynamics of these lakes to assess past, present, and future water resource changes. In this paper, we present an innovative approach to unravel the sediment and water balance of Lac Wégnia, a small ungauged lake in Mali near the capital of Bamako. The approach uses optical remote sensing data to identify the shoreline positions over a period of 22 years (2000–2021) and then attributes water surface heights (WSHs) to each observation using the lake bathymetry. We then present a novel methodology to identify and quantitatively analyze deposition and erosion patterns at lakeshores and in lake beds. The method therefore represents a significant advancement over previous attempts to remotely monitor lakes in the West African drylands, since it considers not only changes in water depth to explain recent declining trends in lake areas, but also changes in the storage capacity. At Lac Wégnia, we recognize silting at the tributaries to the lake, but overall, erosion processes are dominant and threaten the persistence of the lake because of progressive erosion through the natural levee at the lake outlet. This factor contributes 66 %±18 % to the decreasing WSH trend, while 34 %±18 % of the dry-season lake level changes are explained by increasing evaporation from the lake and by possibly falling groundwater tables. Due to the decreasing reservoir capacity of the lake, WSHs are declining even in the wet season in spite of positive rainfall patterns.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000563054",,"2196-632X||2196-6311",,"10.5194/esurf-10-797-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563054","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Unraveling the hydrology and sediment balance of an ungauged lake in the Sudano-Sahelian region of West Africa using remote sensing",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-11T03:43:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85135394606",,"000834836900001","Earth Surf.

Traditionally, chemotaxis has been understood as a foraging strategy by which bacteria enhance their uptake of nutrients and energy, yet it has remained puzzling why certain less nutritious compounds are strong chemoattractants and vice versa. Recently, we have gained increased understanding of alternative ecological roles of chemotaxis, such as navigational guidance in colony expansion, localization of hosts or symbiotic partners and contribution to microbial diversity by the generation of spatial segregation in bacterial communities. Although bacterial chemotaxis has been observed in a wide range of environmental settings, insights into the phenomenon are mostly based on laboratory studies of model organisms. In this Review, we highlight how observing individual and collective migratory behaviour of bacteria in different settings informs the quantification of trade-offs, including between chemotaxis and growth. We argue that systematically mapping when and where bacteria are motile, in particular by transgenerational bacterial tracking in dynamic environments and in situ approaches from guts to oceans, will open the door to understanding the rich interplay between metabolism and growth and the contribution of chemotaxis to microbial life.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539651",,"1740-1526||1740-1534",,"10.1038/s41579-022-00709-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539651","en","Nature","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"The ecological roles of bacterial chemotaxis",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2022-03-29T03:25:50Z","2022-09-14",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85126334920",,"000769261900001","Nat Rev Microbiol","8","Nature Reviews Microbiology","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We therefore developed a new AGS model that includes key features of full-scale AGS systems: fill-draw operation, selective sludge removal, distinct settling models for flocs/granules. We then compared predictions of our model to those of a fully mixed AGS model. Our results demonstrate that hydraulic selection can be predicted with an assembly of four continuous stirred tank reactors in series together with a correction code for plug-flow. Concentration gradients over the reactor height during settling/plug-flow feeding strongly impact the predictions of aerobic granular sludge models in terms of microbial selection, microbial activities and ultimately effluent quality.

To simulate extreme rainfall events under climate change, design storms can be modified to match a different return frequency of extreme rainfall events as well as a modified temporal distribution of rainfall intensities. However, the same magnitude of change to the rainfall intensities is often applied in space. Several hydrological applications are limited by this. Climate change impacts on urban pluvial floods, for example, require the use of 2D design storms (rainfall fields) at sub-kilometer and sub-hourly scales. Recent kilometer scale climate models, also known as convection-permitting climate models (CPM), provide rainfall outputs at a high spatial resolution, although rainfall simulations are still restricted to a limited number of climate scenarios and time periods. We nevertheless explored the potential use of rainfall data obtained from these models for hydrological flood impact studies by introducing a method of spatial quantile mapping (SQM). To demonstrate the new methodology, we extracted high-resolution rainfall simulations from a CPM for four domains representing different urban areas in Switzerland. Extreme storms that are plausible under the present climate conditions were simulated with a 2D stochastic rainfall model. Based on the CPM-informed stochastically generated rainfall fields, we modified the design storms to fit the future climate scenario using three different methods: the SQM, a uniform quantile mapping, and a uniform adjustment based on a rainfall–temperature relationship. Throughout all storms, the temporal distribution of rainfall was the same. Using a flood model, we assessed the impact of different rainfall adjustment methods on urban flooding. Significant differences were found in the flood water depths and areas between the three methods. In general, the SQM method results in a higher flood impact than the storms that were modified otherwise. The results suggest that spatial storm profiles may need to be re-adjusted when assessing flood impacts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557727",,"0309-1708||1872-9657",,"10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.104258","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557727","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Spatial quantile mapping||Extreme rainfall||Urban flood||High-resolution rainfall||Climate change","Mapping storm spatial profiles for flood impact assessments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-13T03:06:23Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85133421763",,"000822999000004","Adv.

Yet to date, only a few pilot-scale systems and even fewer full-scale implementations of this technology have been described. Process instability continues to restrict the broad application of PNA. Especially problematic are insufficient anammox biomass retention, the growth of undesired aerobic nitrite-oxidizers, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. In this study, a two-stage mainstream pilot-scale PNA system, consisting of three reactors (carbon pre-treatment, nitritation, anammox - 8 m3 each), was operated over a year, treating municipal wastewater. The aim was to test whether both, robust autotrophic N removal and high effluent quality, can be achieved throughout the year. A second aim was to better understand rate limiting processes, potentially affecting the overall performance of PNA systems. In this pilot study, excellent effluent quality, in terms of inorganic nitrogen, was accomplished (average effluent concentrations: 0.4 mgNH4-N/L, 0.1 mgNO2-N/L, 0.9 mgNO3-N/L) even at wastewater temperatures previously considered problematic (as low as 8 °C). N removal was limited by nitritation rates (84 ± 43 mgNH4-N/L/d), while surplus anammox activity was observed at all times (178 ± 43 mgN/L/d). Throughout the study, nitrite-oxidation was maintained at a low level (<2.5% of ammonium consumption rate). Unfortunately, high N2O emissions from the nitritation stage (1.2% of total nitrogen in the influent) were observed, and, based on natural isotope abundance measurements, could be attributed to heterotrophic denitrification. In situ batch experiments were conducted to identify the role of dissolved oxygen (DO) and organic substrate availability in N2O emission-mitigation. The addition of organic substrate, to promote complete denitrification, was not successful in decreasing N2O emission, but increasing the DO from 0.3 to 2.9 mgO2/L decreased N2O emissions by a factor of 3.4.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557213",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2022.100145","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557213","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Two-stage||Pilot-scale||PNA||Isotopes||Municipal wastewater","Successful year-round mainstream partial nitritation anammox: Assessment of effluent quality, performance and N2O emissions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-11T03:07:27Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85132920075",,"000823110200003",,,"Water Research X","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

So far, this effect has not been investigated in terrestrial snow in the microwave spectrum. It has also received little attention in scattering models. We present the first characterization of the CBOE in dry snow using ground-based and spaceborne bistatic radar systems. For a seasonal snowpack in the Ku-band (17.2 GHz), we found backscatter enhancement of 50 %-60 % (+1.8-2.0 dB) at a zero bistatic angle and a peak half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) of 0.25 degrees. In the Xband (9.65 GHz), we found backscatter enhancement of at least 35 % (+1.3 dB) and an estimated HWHM of 0.12 degrees in the accumulation areas of glaciers in the Jungfrau-Aletsch region, Switzerland. Sampling of the peak shape at different bistatic angles allows estimating the scattering and absorption mean free paths, Lambda(T) and Lambda(A). In the VV polarization, we obtained Lambda(T) = 0.4 +/- 0.1 m and Lambda(A) = 19 +/- 12 m at the Ku-band and Lambda(T) = 2.1 +/- 0.4 m and Lambda(A) = 21.8 +/- 2.7 m at the X-band, assuming an optically thick medium. The HH polarization yielded similar results. The observed backscatter enhancement is thus significant enough to require consideration in backscatter models describing monostatic and bistatic radar experiments. Enhanced backscattering beyond the Earth, on the surface of solar system bodies, has been interpreted as being caused by the presence of water ice. In agreement with this interpretation, our results confirm the presence of the CBOE at X- and Ku-band frequencies in terrestrial snow.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000559680",,"1994-0416||1994-0424",,"10.5194/tc-16-2859-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/559680","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Coherent backscatter enhancement in bistatic Ku- and X-band radar observations of dry snow",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-24T03:01:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85134596345",,"000826905000001",,"7","The Cryosphere","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The total volumetric change per year increased from about 0.17 x 10(6) to 7.4 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1), a 43-fold increase. The observed surge in RTS activity is mainly driven by the initiation of new RTS, indicated by the 17-fold increase in active RTS numbers from 82 to 1404 and the relatively low average volumetric change rate per RTS increase of 2.3. In annual Sentinel-2 imagery, the number of detected RTSs in a subregion increased 10-fold in 2020. This coincides with a severe heatwave that occurred in northern Siberia in 2020. The area-to-volume scaling of the RTSs varied only slightly over time, despite the 2020 heatwave, indicating a robustness of the relationship to such an event. To estimate the slump-mobilized organic carbon, we intersected the elevation changes with a soil organic carbon (SOC) map, with contrasting assumptions about the deep carbon pool and massive-ice content. We estimated that the SOC mobilization rate increases 28-fold. The normalization of the SOC mobilization rate to our study region yields values of 11 gC yr(-1) m(-2) with a confidence interval of 5 to 38 gC yr(-1) m(-2). A comparison to an independent estimate of the net ecosystem exchange of 4.1 +/- 13.0 gC yr(-1)m(-2) illustrates the importance of RTS activity to the carbon cycle. These results underscore that mass wasting is an important but commonly neglected component of the Arctic carbon cycle and particularly sensitive to extreme events.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000559681",,"1994-0416||1994-0424",,"10.5194/tc-16-2819-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/559681","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Accelerated mobilization of organic carbon from retrogressive thaw slumps on the northern Taymyr Peninsula",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-24T03:01:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85134395579",,"000825312600001",,"7","The Cryosphere","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The uptake coefficients (γ) of PAN increased non-linearly from (1.5 ± 0.7) × 10–5 at 0% relative humidity (RH) to (9.3 ± 2.0) × 10–5 at 80% RH. The γ decrease with increasing initial PAN concentration is consistent with the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism. Organic components of aerosols may promote heterogeneous loss of PAN through redox reactions. Higher γ occurs with higher water content, lower pH, and lower ionic strength in the aqueous phase of aerosols. The present study suggests that heterogeneous reaction of PAN on ambient aerosols plays a non-negligible role in the atmospheric PAN budget and provides new insights into the role of PAN in promoting atmospheric oxidation capacity during hazy periods with cold and wet weather conditions.",,,,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.2c03050","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/554685","en","American Chemical Society",,,"fine particulate matter||heterogeneous reactions||peroxyacetyl nitrate||relative humidity||uptake coefficient||urban air pollution","Heterogeneous Reaction of Peroxyacetyl Nitrate on Real-World PM₂.₅ Aerosols: Kinetics, Influencing Factors, and Atmospheric Implications",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-06-26T17:12:06Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85134084022",,"000820432500001","Environ.

Spatial software and planning support systems (PSS), can inform such decision-making. We seek to understand the efficacy of utilising PSS for advancing NBS practices within Indonesian urban settings. Through workshops and in-depth interviews with urban planning practitioners, we examined (i) the current NBS planning context, (ii) tacit experiences with contemporary PSS, and (iii) potential utility of PSS to address identified challenges with NBS planning. While strategic planning processes were perceived as improving over past decades, significant challenges remain including inadequate collaboration between actors, insufficient capacity and resources of local governments and limited access to high-quality spatial data. Although strategic planners employ contemporary PSS, further embedding those into decision-making processes requires rethinking the socio-institutional and political context within which they operate. Results revealed keen interest to adopt innovative PSS. However, without access to high-quality spatial information, strategic planning will continue to be compromised, potentially leading to illsited NBS interventions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000551650",,"0264-2751",,"10.1016/j.cities.2022.103693","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551650","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nature-based solutions||Planning support systems||Urban planning||Strategic planning||Global south||Blue-green infrastructure||Transferability||Indonesia||Sustainable urban water management||SSANTO","Planning support systems for strategic implementation of nature-based solutions in the global south: Current role and future potential in Indonesia",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-06-10T03:01:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85133899779",,"000802989900002",,,"Cities","126","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

For DALYs estimation, the indoor PM2.5 concentration and power consumption were first calculated and compared. These were then multiplied by the respective health damage factors. Air cleaners were compared under several indoor particle size distributions scenarios. A methodology was developed to evaluate the influence of the aging of air cleaners on the selected comparison criteria. The results suggest that the averted DALYs from indoor PM2.5 concentration reduction far supersedes the indirect DALYs associated with the operational power consumption of the air cleaners. Hence, the DALY-based ranking of the air cleaners considered was the same as that of their effectiveness to reduce indoor PM2.5 concentrations. However, the result should be taken with care as only the use-phase of air cleaners was considered. For future study, a complete life-cycle assessment is recommended.

However, quantification of sediment availability and its variability in time is challenging, because sediment supply is often strongly stochastic and dominated by mass wasting. In this paper, we introduce a variable landslide sediment supply as a function of topography, hydrology, and hillslope activity in the hydrology-sediment model TOPKAPI-ETH. We use the model to analyze the dynamics of sediment storage in a mesoscale pre-Alpine basin. We simulate a range of transport- and supply-limited conditions to quantify the variability of suspended sediment concentrations and load, and the seasonal dynamics of sediment storage. We show that supply limitation dampens the natural variability of the hydrological and sediment transport processes, and therefore reduces the scatter of the suspended sediment rating curve. By comparing the model results with observations, we demonstrate that alternation of low and high sediment availability favors sediment load variability at the outlet. The temporal dynamics of sediment storage depends on the hillslope activity, and the balance between sediment supply by landslides and evacuation by runoff. When the export flux is comparable or greater than the recharge flux, the storage shows seasonal fluctuations with a maximum in late winter or spring, and sediment starvation in summer. By representing the dynamics of both inputs and outputs of the sediment storage, the proposed model provides a physically based tool to isolate the effect of transport- and supply-limited conditions in basin sediment response.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000561092",,"0043-1397||1944-7973",,"10.1029/2020WR029408","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/561092","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","hydrology-sediment modelling||sediment availability||supply limitation||dynamics of the sediment storage||landslide sediment supply","Sediment Supply Effects in Hydrology-Sediment Modeling of an Alpine Basin",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-02T03:16:51Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,"85134883950",,,"Water Resour.

Therefore, we studied the influence of GNP as a nanofiller on the emitted particles and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and cytotoxicity of the emissions from the combustion of pure epoxy (EP) and GNP-reinforced epoxy (EP-GNP). GNP was not detected in the airborne emissions. PAHs were found in airborne particles of both emissions from EP and EP-GNP, with some differences in their concentrations. A first hazard assessment was performed on human alveolar epithelial cells exposed to the airborne emissions at air-liquid interface conditions. At 24 h and 96 h after the exposure, similar responses were observed between EP and EP-GNP except an acute transient decrease in mitochondrial activity after exposure to the emissions from EP-GNP. Both emissions from EP and EP-GNP had no acute effects on membrane integrity, cell morphology or expression of anti-oxidative stress markers (HMOX1 and SOD2 genes). Meanwhile, both emissions induced the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (CYP1A1 gene) and a transient (pro-) inflammatory response (MCP-1), but the effects between EP and EP-GNP were not significantly different.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000563361",,"2452-0748",,"10.1016/j.impact.2022.100414","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563361","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Graphene nanoplatelets||Nanofiller||Polymer combustion||Air-liquid interface||In vitro hazard assessment||Alveolar epithelium","Airborne emissions from combustion of graphene nanoplatelet/epoxy composites and their cytotoxicity on lung cells via air-liquid interface cell exposure in vitro",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-12T06:42:12Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Graphene Flagship Core Project 2||Graphene Flagship Core Project 3","785219||881603","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC","H2020||H2020",,,"85135881835",,"000843492800002",,,"NanoImpact","27","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In these systems, polymer solutions are often exposed to fluid flow, and their complex rheology can affect the transport of chemical compounds and microorganisms. Recent studies have focused on the effect of polymer solutions on the motility of bacteria in the absence of fluid flow. However, flow can be a game-changer on bacterial transport, as demonstrated by the depletion of motile bacteria from the low-shear regions and trapping in the high-shear regions in simple fluids, even for flows as simple as the Poiseuille one. Despite the relevance of polymer solutions in many bacterial habitats, the effect of their complex rheology on shear-induced trapping and bacterial transport in flow has remained unexplored. Using microfluidic experiments and numerical modeling, we studied how the shear rate and the rheological behavior of Newtonian and non-Newtonian polymer solutions affect the transport of motile, wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a Poiseuille flow. Our results show that, in Newtonian solutions, an increase in viscosity reduces bacterial depletion in the low-shear regions at the microchannel center, due to a reduction in the bacterial swimming velocity. Conversely, in the non-Newtonian solution, we observed a depletion comparable to the buffer case, despite its zero-shear viscosity being two orders of magnitude higher. In both cases, bacterial swimming and polymer fluid rheology control the magnitude of bacterial depletion and its shear-rate dependence. Our observations underscore the importance of the rheological behavior of the carrier fluid in controlling bacterial transport, in particular, close to surfaces giving rise to velocity gradients, with potential consequences on surface colonization and biofilm formation in many naturally relevant microbial habitats.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000559676",,"2296-424X",,"10.3389/fphy.2022.910882","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/559676","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","bacterial motility||poiseuille flow||polymer solution||microfluidics||rheology||Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Transport of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Polymer Solutions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-24T03:01:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"The role of ambient flow and physico-chemical microenvironment in determining the microstructure of the biofilm matrix","179834","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","PRIMA",,,"85134173840",,"000826715200001",,,"Frontiers in Physics","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Many mining products are extracted in the Global South and exported to the global North for further processing and final consumption, where a link to the devastating environmental effects is often missing. Based on an enhanced multi-regional input-output database, this study assesses global biodiversity loss associated with land use of mining (mining-related) to identify hotspots, key processing industries, and final consumers of mining products. Our study reveals that half of global mining-related biodiversity loss occur in Indonesia, Australia, and New Caledonia. Major international trade flows of embodied biodiversity loss involve Indonesia’s coal exports to China and India, New Caledonia’s nickel exports to Japan and Australia, and Australia’s iron and aluminum exports to China. Key consumers include China’s growing infrastructure and households in the EU and USA. Electricity generation accounted for 10% of global mining-related biodiversity loss in 2014. The impact of coal-fired electricity is far higher compared to renewables, both overall and per electricity generated. Our results underline synergies in fostering renewables while reducing global biodiversity loss, and provide transparency for industry and policy to source more sustainable mining products.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000554154",,,,"10.31223/X5T064","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/554154","en","University of California","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","multi-regional input-output (MRIO) analysis||metals||coal||biodiversity loss footprint||land use||regionalized impact assessment||sustainable mining||international trade","Hotspots of mining-related biodiversity loss in global supply chains and the potential for reduction by renewable electricity",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2022-06-22T16:57:22Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We systematically analysed through modelling the microbial conversion pathways of XB in AGS systems operated as sequencing batch reactors and treating municipal wastewater. Based on our current understanding of AGS systems, we developed an AGS model in Sumo® to better understand (1) during which phases of the SBR cycle (anaerobic plug-flow feeding or aerobic fully-mixed conditions), (2) by what biomass fraction (granules or flocs) and (3) via which microbial processes XB is converted into soluble organic substrate (SB) and volatile fatty acids (SVFA) and further utilised. The validity of all our results was evaluated by assessing the sensitivity of findings on the biomass distribution (floc fraction) (SCENARIO #1), SBR cycle (SCENARIO #2), and biofilm properties (SCENARIO #3). Our results indicate that only 20% of influent XB was hydrolysed and 11% of influent XB was then used for internal carbon-storage during 90 min anaerobic plug-flow feeding. The major fraction of influent XB (80%) leaked into the aerobic SBR phase, where XB was then hydrolysed and oxidised aerobically by ordinary heterotrophic organisms (OHOs). Under aerobic fully-mixed conditions, the flocs successfully competed for XB with the granules. Aerobic XB hydrolysis and its further utilisation by OHOs occurred mainly in flocs despite their minor biomass fraction (13% of total suspended solids), preventing excessive OHO growth on granules and demonstrating that flocs are beneficial for AGS systems treating MWW. Also, the model allowed us to better understand that the SBR sequence can be optimised to make better use of XB under anaerobic conditions and to reduce the leakage of XB to aerobic conditions. The introduction of a 60 min anaerobic idle phase after a 60 min plug-flow feeding phase almost doubled the anaerobic XB hydrolysis and internal carbon-storage by phosphorus and glycogen accumulating organisms (PAOs and GAOs), respectively, compared to 90 min plug-flow feeding. Nonetheless, most influent XB was still utilised by OHOs during the aerobic SBR phase.",,,,"2053-1400||2053-1419",,"10.1039/d1ew00841b","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/544487","en","Royal Society of Chemistry",,,,"Microbial conversion pathways of particulate organic substrate conversion in aerobic granular sludge systems: limited anaerobic conversion and the essential role of flocs",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-04-30T02:54:18Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85129857925",,"000784884400001","Environ.

Therefore, in this study, we collected airborne particulate matter (PM) samples from November 2019 to April 2020 in Bern, Lugano, and Zurich. Among 14 detected viruses, influenza A, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-229E were abundant in air. SARS-CoV-2 and enterovirus were moderately common, while the remaining viruses occurred only in low concentrations. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in PM10 (PM below 10 µm) samples of Bern and Zurich, and PM2.5 (PM below 2.5 µm) samples of Bern which exhibited a concentration positively correlated with the local COVID-19 case number. The concentration was also correlated with the concentration of enterovirus which raised the concern of coinfection. The estimated COVID-19 infection risks of an hour exposure at these two sites were generally low but still cannot be neglected.

A few studies have explored the application of these models to develop new, and fast, applications for fluvial and pluvial flood prediction, extent mapping, and flood susceptibility assessment. However, most studies have focused on model development for specific catchment areas, drainage networks or gauge stations. Hence, their results cannot be directly reused to other contexts unless extra data are available and the models are further trained. This study explores the generalizability potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as flood prediction models. The study proposes a CNN-based model that can be reused in different catchment areas with different topography once the model is trained. The study investigates two options, patch- and resizing-based options, to process catchment areas of different sizes and different shapes. The results showed that the CNN-based model predicts accurately on “unseen” catchment areas with significantly less computational time when compared to physically-based models. The obtained results also suggest that the patch-based option is more effective than the resizing-based option in terms of prediction accuracy. In addition, all experiments have shown that the prediction of flow velocity is more accurate than water depth, suggesting that the water accumulation is more sensitive to global elevation information than flow velocity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539235",,"0022-1694||1879-2707",,"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127726","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539235","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Pluvial flood prediction||Data-driven modeling||Surrogate flood modeling","Data-driven rapid flood prediction mapping with catchment generalizability",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-03-25T06:20:20Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85126545901",,"000790530300001","J.

This is particularly crucial in the event of natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods), where large parts of cities may become disconnected from a secure water supply for prolonged time periods. We demonstrate how optimum location, density and storage size can be determined using UrbanBEATS, a spatial planning-support system for planning and design of sustainable Blue-Green Infrastructure strategies. We investigate the Otakaro/Avon River catchment, Christchurch, New Zealand for the time periods 2011-2020, 2041-2050 and 2091-2100 (for the RCP 8.5 climate change scenario). For targets of 30% of potable water substitution and 70% storage volumetric reliability, we found that stormwater harvesting systems in all climate scenarios required a larger capacity compared to the baseline. Most storages achieved their set targets and were larger than the municipality's recommended 9 m(3) for flood inundation, indicating that the identified storages would also reduce minor flooding while ensuring water savings. A shift in the spatial layout of modelled systems from highly distributed to more centralised, however, raises a potential conflict with disaster resilience where more local solutions would be preferable.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000556202",,"2617-4782",,"10.2166/bgs.2022.008","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/556202","en","IWA Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Blue-Green Infrastructure||climate change impacts||natural disasters||rainwater harvesting||UrbanBEATS||water supply security","Multi-scale stormwater harvesting to enhance urban resilience to climate change impacts and natural disasters",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-05T03:02:27Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85134697119",,"000817003800001",,"1","Blue-Green Systems","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Predicting these effects requires setting up and simulating complex detailed hydraulic sewer network models. Often, precise details of the sewer network layout and diurnal patterns of the wastewater flows are not available, limiting the applicability of using model predictions for such phenomena. In this study, the applicability of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms for the development of a simplified surrogate model to predict solid accumulation in sewer pipes was investigated. A large number of highly variable sewer networks were synthetically generated and used to produce results that can be generalizable within the limitations of the current study. A hydrodynamic sewer model was set up and simulated for each synthetic sewer network and various scenarios in which different water-efficient solutions were considered. Simulation results indicated that the most impacts are expected to occur in the upstream part of the sewer networks, and that with 50% reduction in (waste-)water flows, 3–20% more pipes are expected to accumulate solids. It was further found that ML algorithms can be used to successfully predict locations of solids accumulation in sewer pipes without using hydrodynamic models. A simple tool based on the findings of this study, sparing the need to conduct complex hydraulic simulations, was developed. It allows the user to enter a set of pipe characteristics and the proportion of flow that is reduced due to the implementation of water efficient solutions, and it predicts whether the pipe will accumulate solids or not. The study results and the proposed ML algorithms can support the implementation of optimal water-efficient solutions that will promote designing and managing the water sensitive cities of the future.",,,,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2022.118247","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/540684","en","Elsevier",,,"Linear regression||Neural networks||Random forest||Sediments||Synthetic sewer networks||Water saving","Potential of supervised machine learning algorithms for estimating the impact of water efficient scenarios on solids accumulation in sewers",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-04-04T03:07:22Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85126982190",,"000790943400005","Water Res.",,"Water Research","216","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Modelling studies indicate that the inlets of agricultural storm drainage systems can considerably increase the connectivity of surface runof and pesticides to surface waters. These model results have however not yet been validated with feld measurements. In this study, we measured discharge and concentrations of 51 pesticides in four out of 158 storm drainage inlets of a small Swiss agricultural catchment (2.8 km2) and in the receiving stream. For this, we performed an event-triggered sampling during 19 rain events and collected plot-specifc pesticide application data. Our results show that agricultural storm drainage inlets strongly infuence surface runof and pesticide transport in the study catchment. The concentrations of single pesticides in inlets amounted up to 62 µg/L. During some rain events, transport through single inlets caused more than 10% of the stream load of certain pesticides. An extrapolation to the entire catchment suggests that during selected events on average 30 to 70% of the load in the stream was transported through inlets. Pesticide applications on felds with surface runof or spray drift potential to inlets led to increased concentrations in the corresponding inlets. Overall, this study corroborates the relevance of such inlets for pesticide transport by establishing a connectivity between felds and surface waters, and by their potential to deliver substantial pesticide loads to surface waters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000595950",,"0944-1344||1614-7499",,"10.1007/s11356-022-18933-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/595950","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Storm drainage inlets||Hydraulic shortcuts||Field study||Agricultural runoff||Surface runoff||Spray drift||Pesticide concentrations||Pesticide transport pathways","Pesticide concentrations in agricultural storm drainage inlets of a small Swiss catchment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-01-30T16:02:18Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Environ Sci Pollut Res","29","Environmental Science and Pollution Research","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In the biofilm lifestyle, bacteria embed themselves in a self-secreted matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which acts as a shield against mechanical and chemical insults. When ambient flow is present, this viscoelastic scaffold can take a streamlined shape, forming biofilm filaments suspended in flow, called streamers. Streamers significantly disrupt the fluid flow by causing rapid clogging and affect transport in aquatic environments. Despite their relevance, the structural and rheological characterization of biofilm streamers is still at an early stage. In this work, we present a microfluidic platform that allows the reproducible growth of biofilm streamers in controlled physico-chemical conditions and the characterization of their biochemical composition, morphology, and rheology in situ. We employed isolated micropillars as nucleation sites for the growth of single biofilm streamers under the continuous flow of a diluted bacterial suspension. By combining fluorescent staining of the EPS components and epifluorescence microscopy, we were able to characterize the biochemical composition and morphology of the streamers. Additionally, we optimized a protocol to perform hydrodynamic stress tests in situ, by inducing controlled variations of the fluid shear stress exerted on the streamers by the flow. Thus, the reproducibility of the formation process and the testing protocol make it possible to perform several consistent experimental replicates that provide statistically significant information. By allowing the systematic investigation of the role of biochemical composition on the structure and rheology of streamers, this platform will advance our understanding of biofilm formation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000547526",,"1744-683X||1744-6848",,"10.1039/d2sm00258b","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/547526","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"A microfluidic platform for characterizing the structure and rheology of biofilm streamers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-05-17T02:48:23Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"The role of ambient flow and physico-chemical microenvironment in determining the microstructure of the biofilm matrix||BioEncounters – where physics encounters microbial ecology","179834||202188","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","PRIMA||Ambizione",,,"85131018860",,"000792651100001",,"20","Soft Matter","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The day-and-night and all-weather capability of TRI together with the ability to measure line-of-sight displacements in the range of sub-centimeter to sub-millimeter precision are strong assets that complement other geodetic measurement techniques and devices such as total stations, GNSS, terrestrial laser scanning, and close/mid-range photogrammetric techniques.  (Quasi-)stationary TRI systems are bound to relatively high frequencies (X- to Ku-band or even higher) to obtain reasonable spatial resolution in azimuth and yet the azimuth resolution is typically only in the order of tens of meters for range distances beyond a few kilometers. These aspects are limiting factors to obtain surface displacement maps at high spatial resolution for areas of interest at several kilometers distance and also for (slightly) vegetated slopes due to the fast temporal decorrelation at high frequencies.   Recently, we have implemented and demonstrated car-borne and UAV-borne repeat-pass interferometry-based mobile mapping of surface displacements with an in-house-developed compact L-band FMCW SAR system which we have deployed 1) on a car and 2) on VTOL UAVs (Scout B1-100 and Scout B-330) by Aeroscout GmbH [3,4]. The SAR imaging and interferometric data processing is performed directly in map coordinates using a time-domain back-projection (TDBP) approach [5,6] which precisely takes into account the 3-D acquisition geometry.  We have meanwhile further consolidated our experience with the repeat-pass SAR interferometry data acquisition, SAR imaging, interferometric processing, and surface displacement mapping using the car-borne and UAV-borne implementations of our InSAR system based on a number of repeat-pass interferometry campaigns. In our contribution, we present the capabilities of this new InSAR-based mobile mapping system and we discuss the lessons learned from our measurement campaigns.

The waste rock and mine tailings originated from an active Cu-Zn mine and were characterized by a high content of Cu, Zn, Pb, and As. Part of the waste rock was cleaned by flotation before use, while the mine tailings were used without pre-cleaning.   Bricks, clinkers, cements, and inorganic polymers in which from 14 wt% up to 100 wt% of primary raw materials had been replaced by mine tailings or (cleaned) waste rock, were subjected to various leaching tests: (i) a single batch leaching test (EN 12457-2), (ii) the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP), and (iii) a cascade leaching test (NEN 7349). The influence of the processing of the mine waste, the pH of the leachates, and the mineralogical composition of the building materials on the immobilisation of metal(loid)s were assessed.  Clinkers and cements were the most efficient building materials to immobilise all metal(loid)s, even when uncleaned waste materials were used as a raw material. For the inorganic polymer produced from uncleaned mine waste rock, the leaching of Zn, Pb, Cu, and As was a point of concern, promoted by the alkaline pH of this material. The bricks had a lower release of metal(loid)s  compared to the inorganic polymers, which also showed the importance of an efficient cleaning procedure before using the mine waste as a raw material.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000573509",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-1736","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/573509","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Immobilisation of metal(loid)s in building materials made with mine waste",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2022-09-30T06:56:56Z",,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23-27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The recently developed partial nitritation anammox (PNA) process, for example, consumes less energy for aeration and reduces nitrate in the effluent without requiring additional organic carbon. However, achieving stable nitritation (ammonium oxidation; NH4+ → NO2−) at mainstream conditions (T = 10–25 °C, C:N > 10, influent ammonium < 50 mgNH4-N/L and effluent < 1 mgNH4-N/L) remains challenging. This study explores the potential and mechanism of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) suppression in a bottom-fed sequencing batch reactor (SBR). Two bench-scale (11 L) reactors and a pilot-scale reactor (8 m3) were operated for over a year and were fed with organic substrate depleted municipal wastewater. Initially, nitratation (nitrite oxidation; NO2− → NO3−) occurred occasionally until an anaerobic phase was integrated into the operating cycle. The introduction of the anaerobic phase effectively suppressed the regrowth of NOB while nitritation was stable over 300 days, down to 8 °C and at ammonium influent concentrations < 25 mgNH4-N/L. Batch experiments and process data revealed that parameters typically affecting NOB growth (e.g., dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, trace elements, lag-phase after anoxia, free nitrous acid (FNA), free ammonia (FA), pH, sulfide, or solids retention time (SRT)) could not fully explain the suppression of nitratation. Experiments in which fresh nitrifying microbial biomass was added to the nitritation system indicated that NOB inactivation explained NOB suppression better than NOB washout at high SRT. This study concludes that bottom-fed SBRs with anaerobic phases allow for stable nitritation over a broad range of operational parameters. Coupling this type of SBR to an anammox reactor can enable efficient mainstream anammox-based wastewater treatment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000534165",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153546","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/534165","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Municipal wastewater||Nitritation||Anaerobic||Plug flow||NOB inactivation","Successful mainstream nitritation through NOB inactivation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-02-25T04:37:44Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85124222888",,"000766801200012","Sci.

It has been argued that PFAS should only be employed in those uses that are necessary for health or safety or are critical for the functioning of society and where no alternatives are available (“essential-use concept”). Implementing the essential-use concept requires a sufficient understanding of the current uses of PFAS and of the availability, suitability, and hazardous properties of alternatives. To illustrate the information requirements under the essential-use concept, we investigate seven different PFAS uses, three in consumer products and four industrial applications. We investigate how much information is available on the types and functions of PFAS in these uses, how much information is available on alternatives, their performance and hazardous properties and, finally, whether this information is sufficient as a basis for deciding on the essentiality of a PFAS use. The results show (i) the uses of PFAS are highly diverse and information on alternatives is often limited or lacking; (ii) PFAS in consumer products often are relatively easy to replace; (iii) PFAS uses in industrial processes can be highly complex and a thorough evaluation of the technical function of each PFAS and of the suitability of alternatives is needed; (iv) more coordination among PFAS manufacturers, manufacturers of alternatives to PFAS, users of these materials, government authorities, and other stakeholders is needed to make the process of phasing out PFAS more transparent and coherent.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000512283",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.1c03732","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/512283","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","PFAS||Essential use||Chrome plating||Fluoropolymer||Carpet","Information Requirements under the Essential-Use Concept: PFAS Case Studies",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-10-28T09:15:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Innovative Training Network on PER and polyfluorinated alkyl substances towards the Future Of Research and its Communication in Europe 3","860665||860665","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC","H2020||H2020",,,"10.1021/acs.est.1c03732",,"000804806300024","Environ.

The emission inventories of 8 AMR related genes from all 163-layer poultry farms around Beijing city were quantified. We developed the atmospheric transport model with a gene degradation module to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of airborne AMR, and also assessed their corresponding regional exposure and sedimentation. Total emissions of 16 S rDNA and AMR related genes from layer houses ranged from 1015 to 1016 copies year−1. Those layer-sourced genes contributed 1–14.6% of antimicrobial resistant genes, 4.9% of Staphylococcus spp. and 2.2% of CintI1 to the corresponding annual genetic burden of Beijing's urban air. The average exposure of the Beijing residents to layer-sourced airborne 16 S rDNA was 1.39 × 104 copies year−1 person−1, approximately 87% of them would be deposited in the upper respiratory tract.

Here, we provide a comparison of aerosol-assisted immobilization methods, such as spray-drying (SD), spray atomization (SA), and spray gun (SG), which were used for the deposition of TiO2 dispersions onto fibrous filter media. The morphology, microstructure, and electronic properties of the structures with deposited TiO2 were characterized by SEM and TEM, BET and USAXS, and UV-Vis spectrometry, respectively. The photocatalytic performances of the functionalized filters were evaluated and compared to the benchmark dip-coating method. Our results showed that the SG and SA immobilization methods led to the best photocatalytic and operational performance for the degradation of toluene, whereas the SD method showed the lowest degradation efficiency and poor stability of coating. We demonstrated that TiO2 sprays using the SG and SA methods with direct deposition onto filter media involving dispersed colloidal droplets revealed to be promising alternatives to the dip-coating method owing to the ability to uniformly cover the filter fibers. In addition, the SA method allowed for fast and simple control of the coating thickness as the dispersed particles were continuously directed onto the filter media without the need for repetitive coatings, which is common for the SG and dip-coating methods.

Previous research has demonstrated that particulate matter (PM) emissions from aircraft gas turbine engines can impair human health and environment, and may play a significant role in global climate change via direct absorption of solar radiation and indirect effect by their interaction with clouds. Using alternative aviation fuels (AAFs) from different sources have become a promising means to reduce aviation PM emissions and ensure energy sustainability. This work presents a review of non-volatile PM (nvPM) emission characteristics of aircraft gas turbine engines burning conventional aviation fuel (CAF) and CAF/AAF blends from recent ground and cruise tests. Current engine emission regulations, as well as available aviation PM emission prediction models and inventories are also discussed. Available nvPM emission characteristics, including particle number, particle mass, and particle size distribution (PSD), are analyzed and compared among different studies. The synthesized results indicate that burning AAFs tends to generate smaller size nvPM and reduce up to 90% nvPM number as well as 60–85% nvPM mass. The reduction is the most significant at low engine power settings, but becomes marginal at high engine power settings. The utilization of AAF blends reduces nvPM emission yet increases water vapor emission, which may promote contrail and even widespread cirrus cloud formation. Therefore, more investigation is required to quantify the potential impact of burning AAF at cruise altitudes on cloud formation and climate change. An appropriate estimation method for the particle number emissions from aircraft gas turbine engines fueled by both CAF and CAF/AAF blends is also in need aiming to establish a global aviation nvPM emission inventory and improve relevant global climate models.",,,,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153233","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528680","en","Elsevier",,,"Alternative aviation fuels||Aircraft gas turbine engines||Non-volatile particulate matter||Emission inventory||Climate change","Mitigation effects of alternative aviation fuels on non-volatile particulate matter emissions from aircraft gas turbine engines: A review",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-01-26T08:34:13Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85123693639",,"000766803500019","Sci.

Here, using a field-based microfluidic platform to quantify the behavioural responses of marine bacteria and archaea, we observed significant levels of chemotaxis towards microscale hotspots of phytoplankton-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) at a coastal field site across multiple deployments, spanning several months. Microscale metagenomics revealed that a wide diversity of marine prokaryotes, spanning 27 bacterial and 2 archaeal phyla, displayed chemotaxis towards microscale patches of DOM derived from ten globally distributed phytoplankton species. The distinct DOM composition of each phytoplankton species attracted phylogenetically and functionally discrete populations of bacteria and archaea, with 54% of chemotactic prokaryotes displaying highly specific responses to the DOM derived from only one or two phytoplankton species. Prokaryotes exhibiting chemotaxis towards phytoplankton-derived compounds were significantly enriched in the capacity to transport and metabolize specific phytoplankton-derived chemicals, and displayed enrichment in functions conducive to symbiotic relationships, including genes involved in the production of siderophores, B vitamins and growth-promoting hormones.

To better understand the environmental impacts of China’s aviation sector, this study developed a real-world flight trajectory-based emission inventory, which enabled the fine-grained characterization of four-dimensional (time, longitude, latitude, and altitude) emissions of various flight stages. Our results indicated that fuel consumption and CO2 emissions showed two peaks in altitude distribution: below 1,000 m and between 8,000 and 12,000 m. Various pollutants depicted different vertical distributions; for example, nitrogen oxides (NOX) had a higher fraction during the high-altitude cruise stage due to the thermal NOX mechanism, while hydrocarbons had a dominant fraction at the low-altitude stages due to the incomplete combustion under low-load conditions. This improved aviation emission inventory approach identified that total emissions of CO2 and air pollutants from short-distance domestic flights would be significantly underestimated by the conventional great-circle-based approach due to underrepresented calculation parameters (particularly, flight distance, duration, and cruise altitude). Therefore, we suggest that more real-world aviation flight information, especially actual trajectory records, should be utilized to improve assessments of the environmental impacts of aviation.",,,,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.1c08741","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/548792","en","American Chemical Society",,,"aviation||emission||inventory||high resolution||ADS-B","Developing a High-Resolution Emission Inventory of China’s Aviation Sector Using Real-World Flight Trajectory Data",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-05-24T07:57:20Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85128918034",,"000798709200044","Environ.

Formation of N2O occurs during biological nitrogen removal, involves multiple microbial pathways, and is typically very dynamic. Consequently, N2O mitigation strategies require an improved understanding of nitrogen transformation pathways and their modulating controls. Analyses of the nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) isotopic composition of N2O and its substrates at natural abundance have been shown to provide valuable information on formation and reduction pathways in laboratory settings, but have rarely been applied to full-scale WWTPs.  Here we show that N-species isotope ratio measurements at natural abundance level, combined with long-term N2O monitoring, allow identification of the N2O production pathways in a full-scale plug-flow WWTP (Hofen, Switzerland). Heterotrophic denitrification appears as the main N2O production pathway under all tested process conditions (0–2 mgO2/l, high and low loading conditions), while nitrifier denitrification was less important, and more variable. N2O production by hydroxylamine oxidation was not observed. Fractional N2O elimination by reduction to dinitrogen (N2) during anoxic conditions was clearly indicated by a concomitant increase in site preference, δ18O(N2O) and δ15N(N2O). N2O reduction increased with decreasing availability of dissolved inorganic N and organic substrates, which represents the link between diurnal N2O emission dynamics and organic substrate fluctuations. Consequently, dosing ammonium-rich reject water under low-organic-substrate conditions is unfavorable, as it is very likely to cause high net N2O emissions.  Our results demonstrate that monitoring of the N2O isotopic composition holds a high potential to disentangle N2O formation mechanisms in engineered systems, such as full-scale WWTP. Our study serves as a starting point for advanced campaigns in the future combining isotopic technologies in WWTP with complementary approaches, such as mathematical modeling of N2O formation or microbial assays to develop efficient N2O mitigation strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000535984",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2022.100130","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/535984","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nitrification||Denitrification||Stable isotopes||Isotopomer analysis||Nitrous oxide||GHG mitigation","Tracing N2O formation in full-scale wastewater treatment with natural abundance isotopes indicates control by organic substrate and process settings",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-03-08T08:01:19Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85125862820",,"000770058200001",,,"Water Research X","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To measure sea ice elevation, a theory of polarimetric interferometry for both monostatic and bistatic radars is developed based on analytic solutions of Maxwell's equations, accounting for realistic and complicated properties of snow, sea ice, and seawater. This analytic method inherently preserves phase information that is imperative for radar polarimetry and interferometry. Among a multitude of complex radar coefficients in the general polarimetric interferometric covariance matrix, the symmetry group theory is utilized to identify and select appropriate terms pertaining to the retrieval of sea ice elevation while avoiding radar parameters that may inadvertently introduce non-uniqueness and excessive uncertainty. Theoretical calculations compare well with field observations for rough and old sea ice encountered in the Operation-IceBridge and TanDEM-X Antarctic Science Campaign over the Western Weddell Sea. The results show that the magnitude of the coefficient of normalized correlation between co-polarized horizontal and co-polarized vertical radar returns is inversely related to sea ice elevation, while the associate phase term is nonlinear and noisy and should be excluded. From these analyses, a protocol is set up to measure Antarctic sea ice elevation to be presented in the next companion paper.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000546697",,"2333-5084","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/585803||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/546697",,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/585819","en","California Institute of Technology, Jet Propulsion Laboratory","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Sea ice elevation||radar polarimetric interferometry||Maxwell's equations||analytic method||Weddell Sea||Antarctic","Theory of Radar Polarimetric Interferometry and Its Application to the Retrieval of Sea Ice Elevation in the Western Weddell Sea, Antarctic",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-05-12T02:59:26Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85130621093",,"000789930500001",,"5","Earth and Space Science","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

It is known that complex relations between such forcings and sediment mobilization may lead to dampened or erased environmental signals in sediment records. But it is unclear under which circumstances environmental signals are transmitted and measurable downstream. We used a numerical approach consisting of a sediment cascade model and a stochastic weather generator to quantify climate forcing effects under a range of sediment supply regimes in a debris-flow catchment in the Swiss Alps (Illgraben). We show that sediment yields estimated from short records are highly uncertain both in terms of mean and interannual variability. Furthermore, sediment yields tend to be underestimated in supply-limited systems, where also long-term memory effects, driven by the history of sediment storage, are evident. Consequently, determining geomorphic system response from short records may be grossly inaccurate and should be extended with sediment supply detection and uncertainty analysis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543973",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2021GL096440","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543973","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","environmental signals||geomorphic record||sediment yield||debris flows||stochastic modeling||uncertainty||detrended fluctuation analysis","Numerical Investigation of Sediment-Yield Underestimation in Supply-Limited Mountain Basins With Short Records",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-04-27T03:13:23Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85128490226",,"000782449400003","Geophys.

The evaluation approaches applied at various conditions deserve further development, especially when a high pressure drop is induced by the sampler. In this work, an elution-based method using NaCl aerosol was proposed to estimate the size-resolved collection efficiency which was not affected by the pressure drop. More specifically, a Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) was used to count the upstream particle number, and the collected NaCl particles were eluted and determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for estimating the collected particle number. The relationship between number-based concentration and mass-based concentration of NaCl particles was established. A stainless steel impactor for Differential Mobility Analyzer (DMA), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microchannel, and a homemade impactor containing 151 nozzles with a diameter of 0.1 mm were employed to investigate the feasibility of the elution method. DMA-selected particles with a nominal size are considered to be the monodisperse aerosol, which was commonly used for estimating the collection efficiencies of samplers, but size redistribution of downstream monodisperse aerosol with the particle size smaller than 100 nm and larger than the cutoff size (D50) was revealed through the elution method, which affected the collection efficiency measured by either conventional CPC- or elution-based method. It was found that the elution method was dependent on the D50 value of the sampler, and the applicable size range was from 100 nm to D50 (D50 < 500 nm) or from 100 nm to 500 nm (D50 greater than 500 nm). This study provided insights into the size-dependent particle transport through aerosol samplers, and the development of an elution-based method to estimate pressure drop-independent collection efficiencies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000533355",,"1383-5866",,"10.1016/j.seppur.2022.120590","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/533355","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Elution||NaCl||Collection efficiency||Aerosol sampler||Pressure drop||Size redistribution","An elution-based method for estimating efficiencies of aerosol collection devices not affected by their pressure drops",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-02-19T05:52:26Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85123855709",,"000781664400003",,,"Separation and Purification Technology","287","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

MiDAS 4 is an amplicon sequence variant resolved, full-length 16S rRNA gene reference database with a comprehensive taxonomy from domain to species level for all sequences. We use an independent dataset (269 WWTPs) to show that MiDAS 4, compared to commonly used universal reference databases, provides a better coverage for WWTP bacteria and an improved rate of genus and species level classification. Taking advantage of MiDAS 4, we carry out an amplicon-based, global-scale microbial community profiling of activated sludge plants using two common sets of primers targeting regions of the 16S rRNA gene, revealing how environmental conditions and biogeography shape the activated sludge microbiota. We also identify core and conditionally rare or abundant taxa, encompassing 966 genera and 1530 species that represent approximately 80% and 50% of the accumulated read abundance, respectively.

This waste can pollute natural environments, and in particular, the heavy metal emissions of the tailings may pose long-term consequences. Currently, life cycle assessments of mine tailings are hampered by both limited data availability in the metal production value chain and lack of appropriate methodologies. We collect data from 431 active copper mine sites using a combination of information available from the market research and technical handbooks to develop site-specific life cycle inventories for disposal of tailings. The approach considers the influences of copper ore composition and local hydrology for dynamically estimating leached metals of tailings at each site. The analysis reveals that together, copper tailings from the large (i.e., porphyry) and medium-size copper deposits (i.e., volcanogenic massive sulfide and sediment-hosted) contribute to more than three quarters of the total global freshwater ecotoxicity impacts of copper tailings. This strongly correlates with hydrological conditions, leading to high infiltration rates. The generated inventories vary locally, even within single countries, showcasing the importance of site-specific models.

Seven main plas-tic application segments are distinguished (packaging; build-ing and construction; automotive; electrical and electronic equipment; agriculture; household items, furniture, leisure and others; and textiles), further divided into 54 product subsegments. For each segment, the most commonly used plastic types are considered, in total including eleven plas-tic types (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PET, PS, PVC, ABS, HIPS, PA, PC, and PUR). All product life cycle stages are regarded, including the determination of the product subsegments in which the individual post-consumer secondary materials obtained from mechanical recycling are applied. The underlying data are gathered from official statistics and administrative databases, scientific literature, reports by industry organizations and re-search institutions, websites, and personal communication with stakeholders. The compiled data are then reconciled. All flow data are provided and depicted in two Sankey diagrams: one diagram shows the material flows on a productsubsegment level and the second one on a plastic-type level. Users may retrieve the data with a script and transfer them into a relational database. The present material flow analysis data are used as a basis for the scenario analysis in Klotz et al. [1]. Besides scenario modelling, the data can be used in conducting life cycle assessments. Both utilizations can serve as a support for designing future plastic flow systems. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Remote sensing may provide cost-effective information capable of discriminating the weather spatial variability thus reducing the spatial basis risk, i.e., the mismatch between the weather-based index triggering the insurance payout and the actual damage experienced by the farmers, which is often one of the causes hindering the wide implementation of WIIs. In this work we assess which indices based on remote sensing datasets are the best proxy indicators for rainfed maize yield in Malawi. We analyse the spatial (district scale) and temporal (monthly) correlations of historical maize yield data and several remote sensing datasets including the Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset, the ESA CCI Soil Moisture combined dataset (version 4.2), the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) from the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inversion model (ALEXI), the MOD13Q1 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). With respect to the previous literature, this work exploits a historical crop yield dataset at the sub-national level which allows us to analyse the correlation of the hydro-meteorological and vegetation variables at a higher spatial resolution than what is commonly done (i.e., at the national level using FAO national yield statistics) and ultimately explore the issues related to WII spatial basis risk. Results show that the correlations between crop yield and satellite datasets show high spatial and temporal variability, making it difficult to identify a unique WII index that is at the same time simple and effective for the entire country. Precipitation, particularly the standardized March precipitation anomaly, has the highest correlations with maize yield (with Pearson correlation values higher than 0.55), in Central and South Malawi. Soil moisture and NDVI do not add much value to precipitation in anticipating historical maize yield at the district scale. From a methodological perspective, our work shows that WII indexes are best identified by: i) considering datasets with fine spatial resolution, whenever possible; ii) accounting for the vulnerability of the different crop growing stages to water-stress; iii) distinguishing between water scarce and water abundant events.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542330",,"0378-3774||1873-2283",,"10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107375","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542330","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Precipitation||Drought risk||Weather Index-based Insurance||Spatial basis risk||Data scarce regions||Sub-Saharan Africa","Comparison of hydrological and vegetation remote sensing datasets as proxies for rainfed maize yield in Malawi",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-04-14T02:54:23Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85121105909",,"000788760900009","Agric. water manag.",,"Agricultural Water Management","262","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

To evaluate this risk, surgical masks of Type IIR were submitted to four simulated treatments: folding, ageing with artificial saliva or sweat and washing cycles. The air permeability, mechanical integrity, electrostatic potential, and filtration efficiency (FE) of the masks were measured to quantify possible degradation. Overall, air permeability and mechanical integrity were not affected, except after washing, which slightly degraded the filtering layers. Electrostatic potential and FE showed a strong correlation, highlighting the role of electrostatic charges on small particle filtration. A slight decrease in FE for 100 nm particles was found, from 74.4% for the reference masks to 70.6% for the mask treated in saliva for 8 h. A strong effect was observed for washed masks, resulting in FE of 46.9% (± 9.5%), comparable to that of a control group with no electrostatic charges. A dry store and reuse strategy could thus be envisaged for the public if safety in terms of viral and bacterial charge is ensured, whereas washing strongly impacts FE and is not recommended.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000541622",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-022-09068-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/541622","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"On the durability of surgical masks after simulated handling and wear",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-04-07T17:51:15Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85126848911",,"000772605500102","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Although microbial oil degradation is a central process in the remediation of hydrocarbon pollution in marine environments, the relationship between droplet size distribution and oil degradation rates by bacteria remains unclear, with a conflicting history of laboratory studies. Despite this knowledge gap, the use of chemical dispersants in oil spill response and mitigation is based on the rationale that increasing the surface-area-to-volume ratio of droplets will enhance net bacterial biodegradation rates. We demonstrate that this intuitive argument does not apply to most natural marine environments, where the abundance of oil droplets is much lower than in laboratory experiments and droplet-bacteria encounters are the limiting factor. We present a mechanistic encounter-consumption model to predict the characteristic time for oil degradation by marine bacteria as a function of the initial oil concentration, the distribution of droplet sizes, and the initial abundance of oil-degrading bacteria. We find that the tradeoff between the encounter time and the consumption time leads to an optimal droplet size larger than the average size generated by the application of dispersants. Reducing droplet size below this optimum can increase the persistence of oil droplets in the environment from weeks to years. The new perspective granted by this biophysical model of biodegradation that explicitly accounts for oil-microbe encounters changes our understanding of biodegradation particularly in the deep ocean, where droplets are often small and oil concentrations low, and explains degradation rate discrepancies between laboratory and field studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000540025",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-022-08581-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/540025","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biological physics||Environmental impact||Natural hazards||Statistical physics, thermodynamics and nonlinear dynamics","A tradeoff between physical encounters and consumption determines an optimal droplet size for microbial degradation of dispersed oil",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-03-31T03:00:02Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85126700384",,,"Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, most studies aiming at increasing recycling rates have not investigated how the resulting secondary materials can be utilized in product manufacturing. This study assesses the future substitution potential of primary with secondary plastics, building on a material flow system of 11 plastic types in 54 product subsegments in Switzerland in 2017 with a recycling rate of 9%. In a prospective material flow analysis of a scenario for 2025, the collection rate of the plastic fractions collected in 2017 is increased to 80%. The secondary material flows are allocated to suitable uptaking product subsegments using a linear optimization. The maximum share of secondary materials utilizable in each product subsegment is estimated, whereby three sub-scenarios involving high, moderate and low allowed secondary material shares are modelled. Depending on plastic type and scenario, 21% to 100% of the secondary material gained can substitute for primary material, covering 11% to 17% of the total material demand. While the overall recycling rate could reach 23%, taking into account only the uptaken secondary materials a true recycling rate of only 17% results in the moderate applicability sub-scenario. Based on these results, the secondary material uptake can be said to constitute a limiting factor for increased future recycling. Therefore, thorough consideration of the possible secondary material application is a prerequisite for designing and assessing future recycling systems or for setting recycling rate targets.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000533416",,"0956-053X||1879-2456",,"10.1016/j.wasman.2022.01.002","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/533416","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Material flow analysis||Plastics||Recycling rate||Recycling barriers||Secondary material utilization","Limited utilization options for secondary plastics may restrict their circularity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-02-21T04:50:31Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Towards A sustainable CircuLar Economy – Combining a material flow with a business and policy perspective (TACLE)","172456","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 73: Gesuch",,,"85124604557",,"000784289000016","Waste Manag",,"Waste Management","141","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, prior to implementing GDM filtration in centralized systems, biofilm growth in compacted membrane configurations, such as inside-out hollow fiber (HF), and its impact on permeate flux need to be investigated. To this end, we operated modules with distinct limits on available space for biofilm growth: (1) outside-in 1.5 mm 7-capillary HF (non-limited), (2) inside-out 1.5 mm 7-capillary HF (limited), and (3) inside-out 0.9 mm 7-capillary HF (very limited). Here, we observed that the lower the space available for biofilm growth, the lower the permeate flux. To improve GDM performance with inside-out HF, we applied daily shear stress to the biofilm surface with forward flush (FF) or combined relaxation and forward flush (R+FF). We showed that applying shear stress to the biofilm surface was insufficient for controlling flux loss due to low available space for biofilm growth. At the experimental endpoint, we backwashed with a stepwise transmembrane pressure (TMP) increase or a single TMP on all inside-out HF modules, which removed the biofilm from its base. Afterwards, higher fluxes were yielded. We also showed that all modules exhibited a gradual increase in biopolymer removal followed by stabilization between 70 and 90%. Additionally, control of biofilm growth with surface shear stress did not affect biopolymer removal. In summary, the implementation of inside-out HF with GDM filtration is challenged by low available space for biofilm growth, but may be remedied with a regular backwash to remove biofilm from its base. We showed that a wider range of GDM applications are available; making GDM potentially compatible with implementation in centralized systems, if space limitation is taken into consideration for operation optimization.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000525864",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152307","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/525864","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Gravity-driven membrane filtration||Hollow fiber membranes||Available space for biofilm growth||Backwash","Low maintenance gravity-driven membrane filtration using hollow fibers: Effect of reducing space for biofilm growth and control strategies on permeate flux",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-01-15T04:08:29Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85122439204",,"000755044400008","Sci.

When illuminated and viewed at defined angles, such structural color is characterized by exceptional purity and brightness. To provide further insight into the mechanism of structural coloration, two-photon laser lithography is used to fabricate bioinspired bigrating nanostructures, whose optical properties may be controlled by variation of the height and period of the grating features. Through the use of both spectral measurements and finite-element method simulations, herein specific feature dimensions are identified that due to the combined effects of multilayer interference and diffraction generate excellent spectral characteristics and high color purity over the entire visible range. Additionally, it is demonstrated that variation of feature period and/or height plays a central role in controlling both hue and purity. Importantly, such tuneable bigrating structures are of significant utility in color filtering applications.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526782",,"0935-9648||1521-4095",,"10.1002/adma.202109161","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526782","en","Wiley-VCH","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","3D printing||bigrating||structural colors","Replicating the Cynandra opis Butterfly's Structural Color for Bioinspired Bigrating Color Filters",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-01-19T08:34:59Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"An optofluidic platform based on liquid-gradient refractive index microlens for the isolation and quantification of extracellular vesicles","791144","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85123474328",,"000745849600001","Adv Mater","9","Advanced Materials","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

It is based on two sequential discussion rounds with all participants. Important progress was reported regarding the awareness of P as finite mineable resource, technologies to recycle P, and legislation towards a circular P economy. Yet, critical deficits were identified such as how to handle legacy P, how climate change may affect ecosystem P cycling, or working business models to up-scale existing recycling models. Workshop participants argued for more transdisciplinary networks to narrow a perceived sciencepractice/policy gap.

Centralised management through coordinated operation of all the basin water infrastructures (“hard cooperation”) across the river basin is ideal but hard to achieve given the existing geopolitical context of the region. To overcome these barriers and facilitate a more adaptive and reliable operation of the LMRB's water system, this paper focuses on the concept of “soft-cooperation”, i.e. the idea of indirectly fostering cooperation by sharing data across countries to inform the non-cooperative (or independent) operation of their systems. Here, we first quantify existing riparian conflicts and synergies for the non-cooperative scenario, where upstream and downstream act independently without any form of cooperation, and for the “hard cooperation” configuration, where an ideal centralised operator jointly operates all the infrastructures. Then a “soft cooperation” scheme assuming data sharing across riparian countries is evaluated. The most effective and informative data is selected via machine learning and used to inform the design of the river reservoir system operation via evolutionary multiobjective direct policy search. Results show that the riparian conflicts around water mainly exist between the sectors, i.e. hydropower production vs ecosystem conservation, rather than among countries. For reservoirs with various capacities and locations, the value of information varies. Generally, sharing data about the water currently available in the different river storages results in a large improvement in hydropower production. This study highlights the value of appropriate data sharing and selection in water system operation as an indirect way of promoting cooperation in transboundary river management.",,,,"0022-1694||1879-2707",,"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127464","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529372","en","Elsevier",,,"Lancang-Mekong River||Data sharing||Information selection||Cascade multi-objective reservoir operation","Soft-cooperation via data sharing eases transboundary conflicts in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-01-28T04:11:01Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85123168129",,"000752810500005","J.

Our results indicate intermittent shear helps slowing-down the flux decline but does not help to increase the level of stabilisation of the permeate flux. After several weeks, the biofilms exposed to different shear regimes were indeed characterised by similar hydraulic resistance. But the characteristic time to achieve a stable flux increased from 7 d to 25d when increasing the shear frequency. Also, most of the hydraulic resistance (up to 95%) was governed by the base layer that remained attached after erosion tests. With increasing exposure to shear conditions, the biofilms became more cohesive and more elastic, thus resisting better to cross flow conditions. Overall, our results demonstrate that engineering membrane biofilms with a desired permeability is not feasible using intermittent shear due to significant adaptability of the biofilms to their hydraulic environment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000517354",,"0376-7388",,"10.1016/j.memsci.2021.120079","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517354","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Gravity-driven ultrafiltration||Intermittent shear||Biofilm hydraulic resistance||Consolidation","Cross flow frequency determines the physical structure and cohesion of membrane biofilms developed during gravity-driven membrane ultrafiltration of river water: Implication for hydraulic resistance",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-11-27T04:14:59Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85119381535",,"000722180000002","J.

We deployed 22 novel low-cost level, temperature and conductivity sensors across an urban catchment in Melbourne for a year to monitor the distributed drainage network, thereby detecting likely illicit discharges ranging from a transitory flow with less than 10 minutes to persistent flows lasting longer than 20 hours. We discuss rapid deployment methods, real-time data collection and online processing. The ensemble analysis of all dry weather flow data across all sites indicates that: (i) large uncertainties are associated with discharge frequency, duration, and variation in water quality within industrial and residential land uses; (ii) most dry weather discharges are intermittent and transient flows which are hard to be detected and not simply due to cross-connections with the sewerage network; (iii) detectable diurnal discharge patterns can support mitigation efforts, including policies and regulatory measures (e.g., enforcement or education) to protect receiving waterways; and, (iv) that it is possible to cost effectively isolate sources of dry weather pollution using a distributed sensor network.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000531300",,"0273-1223||1996-9732",,"10.2166/wst.2022.034","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/531300","en","IWA Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","distributed sensing||dry weather flow||illicit discharges||low-cost sensing||pollution source tracking||real-time monitoring","Illicit discharge detection in stormwater drains using an Arduino-based low-cost sensor network",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-02-08T06:50:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85126663260",,"000749229500001","Water sci. technol.","5","Water Science & Technology","85","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Current research and legislation usually only considers direct spray drift. However, also spray drift on roads and subsequent wash-off to surface waters was identified as a possible transport pathway. Hydraulic shortcuts (storm drainage inlets, channel drains, ditches) have been shown to connect roads to surface waters, thus increasing the risk of drift wash-off to surface waters. However, the importance of this pathway has never been assessed on larger scales. To address this knowledge gap, we studied 26 agricultural catchments with a predominance of arable cropping (n = 17) and vineyards (n = 9). In these study sites, we assessed the occurrence of shortcuts by field mapping. Afterwards, we modelled the areas of roads drained to surface waters using a high-resolution digital elevation model (0.5 m resolution) and a multiple flow algorithm. Finally, we modelled drift deposition to drained roads and surface waters using a spatially explicit, georeferenced spray drift model. Our results show that for most sites, the drift to drained roads is much larger than the direct drift to surface waters. In arable land sites, drift to roads exceeds the direct drift by a factor of 4.5 to 18, and in vineyard sites by 35 to 140. In arable land sites, drift to drained roads is rather small (0.0015% to 0.0049% of applied amount) compared to typical total pesticide losses to surface waters. However, substantial drift to drained roads in vineyard sites was found (0.063% to 0.20% of applied amount). Current literature suggests that major fractions of the drift deposited on roads can be washed off during rain events, especially for pesticides with low soil adsorption coefficients. For such pesticides and particularly in vineyards, spray drift wash-off from drained roads is therefore expected to be a major transport pathway to surface waters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000595948",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151102","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/595948","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Spray drift||Surface waters||Agriculture||Shortcuts||Pesticides||Road storm drainage","Are spray drift losses to agricultural roads more important for surface water contamination than direct drift to surface waters?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-01-30T15:58:59Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sci.

The conventional implementation of immunoassays in 96-well plates often encounters difficulties for samples with low concentrations. In this study, the detection performance has been improved using a cellulose acetate membrane for target enrichment and immunodetection. For this end, a compact multichannel filtration device was fabricated using a 3D printer for sample loading. Background effects of the membrane were greatly minimized after pretreatment with a sodium hydroxide solution to significantly reduce non-specific binding. The colorimetric result of the immunodetection of Escherichia coli strain K12 (E.coli K12) was recorded and quantitatively analyzed with a smartphone camera. A limit of detection was calculated as 40 cfu (colony forming unit)/ml, two orders of magnitude more sensitive than that obtained on 96-well plates with standard protocol. The developed approach features an integrated sample enrichment scheme, reduced reagents consumption, multiple channels for parallel processing and no reliance on advanced laboratory instruments, thereby providing potential for a low-cost and easy-to-use immunodetection system.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000518864",,"0925-4005",,"10.1016/j.snb.2021.131142","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518864","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Colorimetric immunodetection||Membrane filter||Bacteria enrichment||Multichannel filtration||Smartphone||Colorimetric immunodetection||Membrane filter||Bacteria enrichment||Multichannel filtration||Smartphone","Colorimetric immunodetection of bacteria enriched on membranes within a compact multichannel filtration device",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-12-06T17:20:32Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85119982125",,"000724256400001",,,"Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical","353","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This work proposes a novel Future Urban Stormwater Simulation (FUSS) model, utilizing previously developed urban planning algorithm (UrbanBEATS) to dynamically assess pollution changes in urban catchments. By using minimal input data and adding stochastic point-source pollution to the build-up/wash-off approach, this study highlights calibration and sensitivity analysis of flow and pollution modules, across the range of common stormwater pollutants. The results highlight excellent fit to measured values in a continuous rainfall simulation for the flow model, with one significant calibration parameter. The pollution model was more variable, with TSS, TP and Pb showing high model efficiency, while TN was predicted well only across event-based assessment. The work further explores the framework for the model application in future pollution assessment, and points to the future work aiming to developing land-use dependent model parameter sets, to achieve flexibility for model application across varied urban catchments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000532930",,"0273-1223||1996-9732",,"10.2166/wst.2022.046","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/532930","en","IWA Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","distributed pollution||hydrological model||pollution prediction||stormwater model||stormwater pollution||water quality model","Calibration and sensitivity analysis of a novel water flow and pollution model for future city planning: Future Urban Stormwater Simulation (FUSS)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-02-17T03:47:31Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85125621775",,"000752505700001","Water sci. technol.","4","Water Science & Technology","85","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In this study, we collected particulates with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) from 8 cities that represent different regions across China and analyzed the samples via high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis, and functional database prediction. Based on the FAPROTAX database, 326 (80.69%), 191 (47.28%) and 45 (11.14%) bacterial genera are possible to conduct the pathways of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles, respectively. The pathway analysis indicated that airborne bacteria may lead to the decrease in organic carbon while the increase in ammonium and sulfate in PM2.5 samples, all of which are the important components of PM2.5. Among the 19 environmental factors studied including air pollutants, meteorological factors, and geographical conditions, PM2.5 concentration manifested the strongest correlations with the functional genes for the transformation of ammonium and sulfate. Moreover, the PM2.5 concentration rather than the sampling site will drive the distribution of functional genera. Thus, a bi-directional relationship between PM2.5 and bacterial metabolism is suggested.

Coal-based emissions have quadrupled since 1995, causing almost half of the plastics-related carbon and particulate-matter-related health footprint in 2015. Plastics-related carbon footprints of China’s transportation, Indonesia’s electronics industry and India’s construction sector have increased more than 50-fold since 1995. In 2015, plastics caused 4.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, 6% of global coal electricity is used for plastics production. The European Union and the United States have increasingly consumed plastics produced in coal-based economies. In 2015, 85% of the workforce required for plastics consumed by the European Union and the United States was employed abroad, but 80% of the related value added was generated domestically.

Exploratory modelling can help to investigate the consequences of these developments on the infrastructure. In order to explore large numbers of adaptation strategies, we need to re-balance the degree of realism of sewer network and ability to reflect key performance characteristics against the model's parsimony and computational efficiency. We present a spatially explicit algorithm for creating sanitary sewer networks that realistically represent key characteristics of a real system. Basic topographic, demographic and urban characteristics are abstracted into a squared grid of ‘Blocks’ which are the foundation for the sewer network's topology delineation. We compare three different pipe dimensioning approaches and found a good balance between detail and computational efficiency. With a basic hydraulic performance assessment, we demonstrate that we attain a computationally efficient and high-fidelity wastewater sewer network with adequate hydraulic performance. A spatial resolution of 250 m Block size in combination with a sequential Pipe-by-Pipe (PBP) design algorithm provides a sound trade-off between computational time and fidelity of relevant structural and hydraulic properties for exploratory modelling. We can generate a simplified sewer network (both topology and hydraulic design) in 18 s using PBP, versus 36 min using a highly detailed model or 1 s using a highly abstract model. Moreover, this simplification can cut up to 1/10th to 1/50th the computational time for the hydraulic simulations depending on the routing method implemented. We anticipate our model to be a starting point for sophisticated exploratory modelling into possible infrastructure adaptation measures of topological and loading changes of sewer systems for long-term planning.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000521371",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2021.117903","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/521371","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Algorithmic network generation||Wastewater infrastructure||Geographic information system (GIS)||Foul sewer system modelling||Network topology","A Simplified Sanitary Sewer System Generator for Exploratory Modelling at City-Scale",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-12-18T05:34:29Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85120936675",,"000758687400007","Water Res.",,"Water Research","209","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Hydrometeorological extremes such as the recent European droughts or the floods of 2013 caused severe and lasting environmental damage. Modeling studies suggest that abrupt permafrost thaw events accelerate Arctic greenhouse gas emissions. Short-lived ocean eddies seem to comprise a significant share of the marine carbon uptake or release. Although there is increasing evidence that such dynamic events bear the potential for major environmental impacts, our knowledge on the processes they trigger is still very limited. MOSES aims at capturing such events, from their formation to their end, with high spatial and temporal resolution. As such, the observation system extends and complements existing national and international observation networks, which are mostly designed for long-term monitoring. Several German Helmholtz Association centers have developed this research facility as a mobile and modular “system of systems” to record energy, water, greenhouse gas, and nutrient cycles on the land surface, in coastal regions, in the ocean, in polar regions, and in the atmosphere—but especially the interactions between the Earth compartments. During the implementation period (2017–21), the measuring systems were put into operation and test campaigns were performed to establish event-driven campaign routines. With MOSES’s regular operation starting in 2022, the observation system will then be ready for cross-compartment and cross-discipline research on the environmental impacts of dynamic events.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528678",,"0003-0007||1520-0477",,"10.1175/bams-d-20-0158.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528678","en","American Meteorological Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Dynamics||Hydrometeorology||Instrumentation/sensors||Measurements||Ecosystem effects||Extreme events","MOSES: A Novel Observation System to Monitor Dynamic Events Across Earth Compartments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-01-26T08:33:09Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85121617201",,"000807211500010","BAMS","2","Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society","103","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Anilines and sulfadiazine are known to undergo back-reduction processes when their degradation is mediated by the excited triplet states of photosensitizers (triplet sensitization). Back-reduction, which inhibits photodegradation, means that phenols or the antioxidant (mostly phenolic) moieties occurring in the natural dissolved organic matter of surface waters reduce, back to the parent compounds, the radical species derived from the mono-electronic oxidation of anilines and sulfadiazine. Here we show that a similar process takes place as well in the case of substrate oxidation by CO3•−. The carbonate radical was here produced upon oxidation of HCO3−/CO32− by either HO•, generated by nitrate photolysis, or SO4•−, obtained by photolysis of persulfate. Back-reduction was observed in both cases in the presence of phenols, but at different extents as far as the details of reaction kinetics are concerned, and the occurrence of additional reductants might affect the efficacy by which phenols carry out the reduction process. In particular, when the carbonate radicals were produced by NO3– photolysis in the presence of HCO3−/CO32−, the numerical values of [PhOH]1/2 (the phenol concentration that halves the photodegradation rate of the substrate) were 2.19 ± 0.23 µM for aniline, 1.15 ± 0.25 µM for 3-chloroaniline, 1.18 ± 0.26 µM for 4-chloroaniline, and 1.18 ± 0.22 µM for 3,4-dichloroaniline. In contrast, when CO3•− was produced by photolysis of persulfate in the presence of HCO3−/CO32−, the corresponding values were 0.28 ± 0.02 µM for aniline and 0.79 ± 0.10 µM for sulfadiazine. Back-reduction has the potential to significantly inhibit photodegradation by CO3•− and excited triplet states in natural waters, and to comparatively increase the importance of HO•-mediated degradation that is not affected by the same phenomenon.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000595944",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2021.117867","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/595944","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Back-reduction||Aniline||Phenol||Excited triplet states||Photochemistry","Inhibition by phenolic antioxidants of the degradation of aromatic amines and sulfadiazine by the carbonate radical (CO3•−)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-01-30T15:56:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Water Res.",,"Water Research","209","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Measurements of SSC at a basin outlet yields a basin-integrated picture of possible hydroclimatically-driven sources of sediment. However, a statistical analysis of one-dimensional input-output relations does not give us a full spatial perspective on sediment pathways of production and, potentially transient, storage within the catchment. These sediment pathways within catchments are difficult to identify and quantify due to the lack of affordable monitoring options that can create both spatially and temporally highly resolved datasets. Here, we propose a methodology to quantify these pathways using Sentinel-2 Level-1C imagery and in-situ measurements from a small network of sensors. The study is carried out on the Vjosa river, which represents one of the last intact large river systems in Europe. Geological diversity in the catchment and its widely unobstructed fluvial morphology over the entire river length makes it extremely interesting to monitor natural sediment dynamics. The remote sensing signal from the river’s water column, extracted from satellite imagery, contains an optical measure of turbidity. Furthermore, in-situ turbidity measurements between May 2019 and July 2020 from seven turbidity sensors located across the Vjosa provide ground-truthing. A significant multiple linear regression model between turbidity and reflectance was fitted to these data. The regression model has a low adjusted R2 value of 0.30 but a highly significant p-value (< 2.2e-16). The satellite data together with the regression model were used to generate longitudinal profiles of predicted turbidity over the catchment from August 2020 to August 2021. Validation of these predictions for two different Sentinel-2 acquisition dates was done with in-situ turbidity measurements taken from a kayak during descents of the entire river. This validation showed accurate prediction of trends on a catchment scale but poor accuracy in the prediction of pointwise turbidity quantification. The model also showed accurate estimation of trends during different climatic seasons, suggesting that our approach captures the temporal variability in suspended sediment concentrations driven by long-term hydrological processes. Gridded rainfall from E-OBS was used to identify short-term hydrological forcing such as storm-driven activation of sediment sources. In order to monitor the many physical connections between hydrology, river processes, and sediment fluxes, future work will include extension of the in-situ turbidity sensor network with new sensors developed by our group. We plan to place these low-cost sensors at the outlet of every major tributary, on the main stem both above and below a confluence with a tributary, and within morphodynamically unique reaches.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594531",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-5665","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594531","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Sediment source and pathway identification using Sentinel-2 imagery and (kayak-based) lagrangian river profiles on the Vjosa river",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2023-01-24T14:06:11Z",,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23–27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Debris-flow (and landslide) early warning systems often rely on rainfall intensity–duration (ID) thresholds. Multiple competing methods exist for the determination of such ID thresholds but have not been objectively and thoroughly compared at multiple scales, and a validation and uncertainty assessment is often missing in their formulation. As a consequence, updating, interpreting, generalizing and comparing rainfall thresholds is challenging. Here, we present the findings of Hirschberg et al. (2021), which focused on (i) uncertainties related to ID thresholds, (ii) differences in local compared to regional ID thresholds, and (iii) how prediction can potentially be improved using statistical learning algorithms. The findings are of interest for debris-flow (and landslide) early-warning developers.  We use a 17-year record of rainfall and 67 debris flows in a Swiss Alpine catchment (Illgraben) to determine ID thresholds and associated uncertainties as a function of record du- ration. This included comparing two methods for rainfall threshold definition based on linear regression and/or true-skill-statistic maximization. The main difference between these approaches and the well-known frequentist method is that non-triggering rainfall events were additionally considered for obtaining ID-threshold parameters. Depending on the method applied, the ID-threshold parameters and their uncertainties differed significantly. We found that 25 debris flows are sufficient to constrain uncertainties in ID-threshold parameters to ±30% for our study site. We further demonstrated the change in predictive performance of the two methods if a regional landslide data set with a regional rainfall product was used instead of a local one with local rainfall measurements. Hence, an important finding is that the ideal method for ID- threshold determination depends on the available landslide and rainfall data sets. Furthermore, for the local data set we tested if the ID-threshold performance can be increased by considering other rainfall properties (e.g. antecedent rainfall, maximum intensity) in a multivariate statistical learning algorithm based on decision trees (random forest). The highest predictive power was reached when the peak 30 min rainfall intensity was added to the ID variables, while no improvement was achieved by considering antecedent rainfall for debris-flow predictions in Illgraben. Although the increase in predictive performance with the random forest model over the classical ID threshold was small, such a framework could be valuable for future studies if more predictors are available from measured or modelled data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594525",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-990","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594525","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Uncertainties in local and regional mass movement prediction using rainfall",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2023-01-24T14:01:43Z",,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23–27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Often, societies rely on surface water from lakes and rivers to sustain their lives and livelihoods. It is therefore essential to monitor and understand the dynamics of these water bodies to assess past, present, and future water resource changes.  Here we use satellite imagery and altimetry to determine water level and storage changes in small water bodies across the African Sahel. The method consists of detecting the ever-shifting edge of lakes and rivers in Landsat and Sentinel-2 optical imagery and assigning heights to shoreline points using altimetric data from ICESat-2satellite. This so-called “waterline method” assumes that the water-land boundary can be regarded as a contour line that connects points of equal elevation. We present novel extension of the waterline method which also allows to identify bathymetry changes over time from shoreline position observations. By tracking the temporal changes of surface water contour shapes, we can quantitatively analyse erosion and deposition processes. Past reservoir capacity changes and water storage variations are thus retrieved from optical remote sensing data, which are available over much longer periods of time and at higher revisiting frequenciesthan altimetry data.  The operational implementation of the method offers access to the water levels and storage variations of more than 300 water bodies in 10 Sahelian countries over the period 2000-2021. The identified spatio-temporal trends reveal fascinatingly heterogeneous patterns of drying and wetting across the Sahelian zone. Wet-season water level data reveal increasing trends over the last 20 years from West to East. Dry-season water availability then depends to a large degree on storage capacity.  Finally, we use the method for a detailed attribution analysis to identify drivers of change at Lac Wégnia, a designated RAMSAR site in Mali. The lake is characterized by an alarming decrease of dry-season surface water extent over the last 20 years. We recognize silting at the tributaries to the lake, but overall, erosion processes are dominant and threaten the persistence of the lake because of continuous backward erosion at the outlet of the lake. This explains the decreasing trend in water levels even for the wet-season, in spite of positive rainfall patterns.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594573",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-5716","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594573","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Unraveling the hydrology of water bodies in the African Sahel Region using continental scale remote sensing",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2023-01-24T15:25:18Z",,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23–27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Furthermore, rainfall spatial variability impacts streamflow, erosion, and sediment transport, and is explored primarily in the context of heavy rainfall triggering floods and rapid morphological changes on hillslopes and in channels. In order to examine the potential effects of warming on hydro-morphological responses, we first examined how changes in air temperature are affecting the spatial structure of rainfall. We observed that heterogeneity increases as temperatures rise. Then, we investigated the sensitivity of fast hydro-morphological responses to increasing temperatures and rainfall heterogeneity scenarios by simulating an extreme rainfall event that occurred in August 2005 in the Kleine Emme stream in Switzerland. The results show that rainfall heterogeneity has a greater impact on erosion processes than simply intensifying high rainfall intensities. We also looked at how changes in rainfall patterns affect landscape evolution over hundreds of years at the catchment scale. Multiple realizations of hourly rainfall fields, each with a different spatial distribution but identical in all other respects, were simulated using a stochastic weather generator, and the impact of the storm heterogeneity on catchment morphology was assessed using a landscape evolution model (CAESAR-Lisflood). We found that erosion and deposition rates increased and net erosion and deposition areas changed (increased and decreased, respectively) when the rain became less uniform in space. Increasing temperatures and rainfall heterogeneity resulted in longer, deeper, and more branched gullies. The results of these studies indicate that heterogeneity in rainfall spatial patterns accelerates landscape development even when rainfall volumes and temporal structures are identical.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594530",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-1854","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594530","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A warming-induced rainfall heterogeneity accelerates landscape evolution",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2023-01-24T14:04:41Z",,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23–27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Due to non-linear relationships of forcings and sediment mobilization, it is debated whether environmental signals are preserved in such systems, or if they are rather dampened or shredded in the sediment output. Tracing the cause and effect in such systems is commonly impossible to do from observations alone. Therefore, numerical models are interesting to study geomorphic system behavior. We use a modeling chain consisting of the SedCas sediment cascade model (Bennett et al., 2014; Hirschberg et al., 2021) and the AWE-GEN stochastic weather generator (Fatichi et al., 2011), which has been calibrated for a debris-flow catchment in the Swiss Alps, the Illgraben, and used for climate change impact assessment (Hirschberg et al., 2021). Here we use this modeling setup to study the long-term behavior of such a system under consideration of different mean erosion rates and sediment production mechanisms. This numerical experiment is unique because we conducted simulations at high temporal resolution (hourly) while also spanning geological time scales (10k years).  We show that the analysis of short sediment records is characterized by high uncertainties and that especially supply-limited systems are at risk to have underestimated mean sediment. This is in concert with field observations on short- and long-term erosion rates from other basins, and can be attributed to transient hillslope sediment supply to the channel. Furthermore, we demonstrate how large hillslope landslides, or the absence of sediment supply, introduce long-term memory effects which can be quantified in the sediment yield. This long-term memory increases uncertainty and reduces interannual variability in annual sediment yields. Interestingly, details of the actual timing of sediment supply events are shredded and have no discernible impact on sediment yields at the outlet. The study highlights the need of characterizing variability in erosional events with regard to their stochastic nature. Furthermore, these results will corroborate the analysis of erosion rates, support decision making and decrease the risk of misinterpretation both in natural hazard and climate change impact assessment, especially if they are based on short records.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594523",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-769","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594523","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Sediment supply affects uncertainties and memory in alpine geomorphic systems",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2023-01-24T13:59:21Z",,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23-27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

They cause not only substantial economic damages, but also human casualties. The focus here is on rainfall induced shallow landslides, which happen following an increase in the pore water pressure in the soil. As the name suggests, this typically occurs after rainfall events, either prolonged in time or short but intense, and combining such rainfall data with landslide inventories allows the definition of landslide-triggering rainfall thresholds. Nevertheless, it is now widely accepted that antecedent conditions, i.e., the wetness of the soil prior to the (non) triggering rainfall, also plays an essential role. Not accounting for the soil condition prior to the rainfall event is the main limitation of rainfall thresholds, together with the fact that they do not consider spatial heterogeneities within the domain.  Here we take advantage of two long records of daily rainfall (MeteoSwiss) and landslides events (WSL) existing in Switzerland, as well as the hydrological estimates provided by two hydrological forecasting systems operational over Switzerland. We use these not only to confirm the importance of antecedent conditions, but also to explore how to best exploit them to improve upon classical rainfall thresholds to predict landslide occurrence.  We start by considering antecedent rainfall and demonstrate that it is helpful in reducing the misclassification associated with rainfall thresholds: missed landslide events are anticipated by high N-day antecedent rainfall, while false alarms by low N-day antecedent rainfall. Recognising the limit of this simple proxy of antecedent conditions, which cannot account for snowmelt or water redistribution, we proceed by considering the soil saturation provided by a) a European physically based hydrological forecasting system (TerrSysMP) and b) a Swiss conceptual hydrological model (PREVAH). The comparison between these two systems leads to the following main findings. First, the soil saturation estimates provided by PREVAH are more informative for landslides prediction, due to a much higher spatial resolution (Prevah 250m while TerrSysMP 12.5km). Second, if spatial heterogeneities in triggering conditions are considered by using the hydrological soil wetness estimates for the calculation of the Factor of Safety (infinite slope stability model), the separation between triggering and non-triggering conditions improves compared to just using saturation. Third, while the information content of antecedent conditions is evident, accounting for them in a regional warning system is not straightforward. In fact, we find a classical hydrometeorological threshold (with a measure of antecedent conditions on the x-axis and a measure of triggering rainfall on the y-axis) to be less successful than a pure rainfall threshold. Instead, we propose a sequential threshold, where first a soil saturation threshold is used to separate “wet” and “dry” conditions, and then 2 rainfall thresholds are utilised for the wet and dry antecedent conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594581",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-12899","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594581","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Rainfall induced shallow landslides: rainfall thresholds and antecedent conditions",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2023-01-24T15:31:20Z",,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23–27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Sulfate is a main component of ambient particulate matter (PM) in the urban environment during haze episodes. Among the pollutants, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is an important precursor of sulfate and new atmospheric particle formation. However, under different atmospheric conditions its underlying formation mechanisms are not clearly elucidated. In the current work, we collected ambient PM in two cities: Zurich (Switzerland) and Beijing (China). The PM morphology and the composition were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy and Raman micro-spectroscopy. In addition, a series of lab controlled experiments were also performed to study the SO2 reaction with CaCO3 aerosol. We found different types of CaSO4·2H2O crystals in the Chinese urban samples, with clearly different compositions than those from Zurich. The experimental data showed that the relative humidity played a significant role on the new CaSO4·2H2O crystal formation including its size, morphology and composition. Relative humidity (RH) above 80% can significantly promote SO2 oxidation on the CaCO3 particles and form the CaSO4·2H2O crystals. In contrast, at relative humidity below 40%, only few CaCO3 particles can be converted to CaSO4 particles. The results of this study facilitate the understanding of secondary inorganic aerosol formation by the reaction of CaCO3 particles with SO2 with different RHs in different city environments, and provide useful information for air pollution control.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000511488",,"1352-2310||0004-6981||1352-3260",,"10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.118776","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/511488","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Haze event||Particulate matter||CaSO4||Relative humidity||Sulfur dioxide||Secondary inorganic aerosol","Effects of relative humidity on heterogeneous reaction of SO2 with CaCO3 particles and formation of CaSO4·2H2O crystal as secondary aerosol",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-10-25T07:34:05Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85117161122",,"000715057900003","Atmos. environ.",,"Atmospheric Environment","268","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In this modeling study, we aim at increasing the efficiency of air-source heat pumps using domestic greywater-contained heat. We assess the performance improvement relative to standard heat pump configurations across various climates, seasons, building envelopes, and domestic hot water consumption patterns. The results show that the annually-averaged coefficient of performance improves by 4.1% on average – ranging from 0.6% to 7.5%. This efficiency gain translates on average to 1.8 kWh/week of compressor electricity savings. Although attractive due to its simplicity, the proposed open-loop configuration – preheating of an external heat source – only leads to moderate performance improvement of air-source heat pumps. Based on these results, we extensively discuss and compare alternative system configurations and identify several fundamental differences in the heat recovery dynamics of each configuration. We show that closed-loop systems – using greywater as direct heat source – show the largest performance improvement potential, although being more expensive and complex to implement.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000517331",,"0306-2619||1872-9118",,"10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117677","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517331","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Greywater heat recovery||Decentralized||Heat pump||Domestic hot water||Wastewater||Energy efficiency","Performance and dynamics of active greywater heat recovery in buildings",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-11-27T04:13:48Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85115030668",,"000704350300001","Appl.

They initiate when ice-rich soils are exposed and thaw, leading to the formation of a steep headwall which retreats during the summer months. The impacts and the distribution and scaling laws governing RTS changes within and between regions are unknown. Using TanDEM-X-derived digital elevation models, we estimated RTS volume and area changes over a 5-year time period from winter 2011/12 to winter 2016/17 and used for the first time probability density functions to describe their distributions. We found that over this time period all 1853 RTSs mobilized a combined volume of 17 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1), corresponding to a volumetric change density of 77 m(3) yr(-1) km(-2). Our remote sensing data reveal inter-regional differences in mobilized volumes, scaling laws, and terrain controls. The distributions of RTS area and volumetric change rates follow an inverse gamma function with a distinct peak and an exponential decrease for the largest RTSs. We found that the distributions in the high Arctic are shifted towards larger values than at other study sites We observed that the area-to-volume scaling was well described by a power law with an exponent of 1.15 across all study sites; however the individual sites had scaling exponents ranging from 1.05 to 1.37, indicating that regional characteristics need to be taken into account when estimating RTS volumetric changes from area changes. Among the terrain controls on RTS distributions that we examined, which included slope, adjacency to waterbodies, and aspect, the latter showed the greatest but regionally variable association with RTS occurrence.

Pesticides used in agriculture are transported to surface waters through various pathways and pose a major threat to aquatic ecosystems. Farmers and authorities take various measures to reduce pesticide transport to surface waters and to protect them from harmful effects. However, such actions can only be effective if the underlying processes driving the pesticide risk are understood well enough. Previous research suggests that so-called hydraulic shortcuts may be an important pesticide transport pathway that has been overlooked in the past. The term hydraulic shortcuts refers to inlet or maintenance shafts of agricultural storm drainage systems, but also to roads, farm tracks, channel drains, and ditches. Even though the relevance of hydraulic shortcuts for pesticide transport has been shown in single cases, it is unclear how often these structures occur and how relevant they are in general for pesticide transport compared to other pathways.  Objectives. This thesis aimed on quantifying the relevance of pesticide losses via hydraulic shortcuts to Swiss surface waters. For this, the following four research questions were investigated: 1) How often do hydraulic shortcuts occur in Swiss agricultural areas? 2) What is their relevance for surface runoff-related pesticide transport? 3) What is their relevance for spray drift-related pesticide transport? 4) What pesticide concentrations and loads are found in hydraulic shortcuts?  Occurrence of hydraulic shortcuts. To determine their occurrence, hydraulic shortcuts were systematically mapped in a set of Swiss arable land and vineyard catchments. The results show that hydraulic shortcuts are a frequent structure in Swiss arable land catchments and that inlet shafts are the most important shortcut type. Most of these inlet shafts belong to the storm drainage systems of roads and farm tracks and few of them are located directly in fields. With very few exceptions, all inlet shafts create a connectivity to surface waters via the underground pipe system, either directly (87%) or via wastewater treatment plants or combined sewer overflows (12%). In vineyards, the occurrence of shortcuts was found to be even higher than on arable land.  Relevance for surface runoff-related pesticide transport. To assess the relevance of shortcuts for surface runoff-related pesticide transport, surface runoff connectivity was modelled for twenty catchments representing arable land in Switzerland. The results show that in the analysed catchments for 43% to 74% of the agricultural areas with a surface runoff connectivity to surface waters, the connectivity is established by hydraulic shortcuts. An extrapolation to the national level shows similar results with 47% to 60% connected via hydraulic shortcuts. The results further imply that around half of the surface runoff from arable land and around half of the surface runoff-related pesticide load reaches surface waters via hydraulic shortcuts.  Relevance for spray drift-related pesticide transport. The relevance of shortcuts for spray drift-related pesticide transport was assessed for a set of arable land and vineyards catchments. For this, spray drift deposition to roads drained by shortcuts and to surface waters was modelled. The results show that for most analysed catchments, the drift to drained roads is much larger than the direct drift to surface waters, especially in vineyards. Compared to typical total pesticide loss fractions to surface waters, the spray drift losses to drained roads are rather small for arable land, but substantial in vineyards. Current literature suggests that during rain events major fractions of the drift deposited on roads can be washed off, especially for pesticides with low soil adsorption coefficients. Consequently, for such pesticides and particularly in vineyards, spray drift wash-off from drained roads is expected to be a major transport pathway to surface waters.  Measurements of concentrations and loads. Discharge and pesticide concentrations during rain events were measured in four out of 158 storm drainage inlets of a small Swiss catchment throughout a full agricultural season. These measurements were accompanied by additional measurements in the stream and by a collection of pesticide application data. The results show that agricultural storm drainage inlets strongly influence surface runoff and related pesticide transport in the studied catchment. High pesticide concentrations (up to 62 μg/L) were found in inlets and, during some rain events, transport through single inlets was responsible for up to 10% to the total stream load of certain pesticides. A rough extrapolation to the entire catchment suggests that during selected rain events, on average 30% to 70% of the load in the stream per pesticide was transported through inlets. Moreover, the results provide insights on the factors causing high pesticide transport through inlets.  Conclusions. Pesticide transport via hydraulic shortcuts is an important pathway for the pollution of Swiss surface waters that has been overlooked in the past. Current regulations and mitigation measures are not addressing this pathway and – consequently – fall short in preventing pesticide losses through this pathway.

Therefore, reliable predictions of low-flow metrics are crucial. In this study, we assess which catchment characteristics (climate, topography, geology and landcover) can explain the spatial variability of low-flow metrics at two different scales: the regional scale and the small headwater catchment scale. For the regional-scale analysis, we calculated the mean 7-day annual minimum flow (qmin), the mean of the flow that is exceeded 95% of the year (q95), and the master recession constant (C) for 280 independent gauging stations across the Swiss Plateau and the Swiss Alps for the 2000–2018 period. We assessed the relation between 44 catchment characteristics and the three low-flow metrics based on correlation analysis and a random forest model. Low-flow magnitudes across the Swiss Plateau were positively correlated with the fraction of the area covered by sandstone bedrock or alluvium, and with the area that has a slope between 10° and 30°. Across the Swiss Alps, low-flow magnitudes were positively correlated with the fraction of area with slopes between 30° and 60°, and the area with glacial deposits and debris cover. There was good agreement between observations and predictions by the random forest regression model with the top 11 catchment characteristics for both regions: for 80% of the Swiss Plateau catchments and 60% of the Swiss Alpine catchments, we could predict the three low-flow metrics within an error of 30%. The residuals of the regression model, however, varied across short distances, suggesting that local catchment characteristics affect the variability of low-flow metrics. For the local-scale headwater catchments, we conducted 1-day snapshot field campaigns in 16 catchments during low-flow periods in 2015 and 2016. The measurements in these sub-catchments also showed that areas with sandstone bedrock and a good storage-to-river connectivity had above average low-flow magnitudes. Including knowledge on local catchment characteristics may help to improve regional low-flow predictions, however, not all local catchment characteristics were useful descriptors at larger scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526146",,"0885-6087||1099-1085",,"10.1002/hyp.14462","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526146","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A multi‐scale study of the dominant catchment characteristics impacting low‐flow metrics",,"Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-01-17T09:54:05Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"105187272","85123683176",,"000747506900018","Hydrol.

The detection and quantification of groundwater infiltration is the first and crucial step towards the more efficient, cost effective and sustainable sewer rehabilitation and management. The tracer based methods are a promising option to directly differentiate and quantify various water sources in the sewer systems. However, due to the harsh environment of the sewer systems, it is generally difficult to find the appropriate tracers and the corresponding analytical methods that can avoid the reliance of the labor-intensive and time-consuming lab-based techniques.  In this thesis, a new tracer method for the groundwater infiltration quantification was proposed and investigated, using the noble gases as tracers coupled with a recent developed portable mass spectrometric system called miniRuedi. The mechanistic modelling was first implemented to better understand the gas-related processes in the sewers and provide guidance for the field experiments. A case study with the field monitoring campaign was then set up in the sewer system of the municipality of Dübendorf (CH) in Dec 2021 to Jan 2022 and Mar 2022. The noble gases were quasi-continuously sampled and analysed on site by miniRuedi from two locations: i) the headspace of a trunk sewer subjected to sewer air transport and ii) the headspace of a pump sump in the experimental hall of Eawag, which is diverting a side-flow of wastewater from the sewer. The local groundwater infiltration was quantified by using several assumptions and a lumped parameter gas loss factor. The accuracy and applicability of the proposed method were analysed via sensitivity and uncertainties analysis. Further, an exploratory data analysis was conducted to extract the information regarding the potential drivers of the sewer gas dynamics in the context of groundwater infiltration. Finally, the general potential of applying the miniRuedi in the urban drainage networks was assessed.  The results of mechanistic modelling showed that the steady state mass balance could be a good approximation to the complete dynamic mass balance. The noble gases signals in terms of concentrations were greatly subject to the sewer air transport and ventilation. In the case study, the groundwater infiltration ratio estimated by noble gases tracer method are around 40 to 80%, and the 24h integrated groundwater infiltration ratio is 57.7% (± 2.7%). These values are in similar range as ""night-minimum"" estimates, though not completely aligned in terms of temporal dynamics. The accuracy of the estimation results from noble gases tracer method greatly depends on the uncertainties in water/noble gases sampling and analysis with miniRuedi. The presented groundwater infiltration ratio might be systematically biased due to the strong assumption regarding the gas exchange and corresponding gas loss factor. The knowledge foundation in the fields of gas-related processes in the sewers are generally lacking.  Overall, despite the noble gases tracer method for groundwater infiltration quantification suffering from uncertainties and potential systematic bias, the miniRuedi per se still shows great potentials in investigating other sewer-related processes, such as oxygen turnovers, in-sewer activities, and sewer air transport and ventilation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000556306",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/556306","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Noble gas||portable mass spectrometer||groundwater infiltration||Sewer||Groundwater","Monitoring groundwater infiltration and gas dynamics in the sewer with the portable mass spectrometer ""MiniRuedi""",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::620 - Engineering & allied operations||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2022-07-05T09:54:33Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Improved options for the management of fecal sludge that accumulates in these onsite systems are required immediately, as the majority of it is currently discharged untreated into the urban environment, placing a huge burden on public and environmental health. One of the greatest obstacles to establishing more reliable and accessible fecal sludge treatment is inconsistent and unpredictable solid-liquid separation. Extreme influent variability in influent fecal sludge poses operational problems with settling and dewatering, reducing the capacity of existing centralized and semi-centralized treatment facilities and hindering the transfer of low-footprint technologies which could extend decentralized and community-scale sanitation coverage in high-density urban areas. In order to develop robust and reliable treatment solutions for fecal sludge, we need to understand the factors governing solid-liquid separation. In this thesis, the influence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), solution properties, particle size distribution, and stabilization in onsite containment on solid-liquid separation performance in fecal sludge was investigated, and a conceptual model for fecal sludge settling and dewatering was developed. Based on this research, field predictors of fecal sludge characteristics and dewatering performance were identified and predictive models and an app were developed that can use photographs and probe measurements to predict dewatering performance of influent sludge. The aim of this thesis was to understand fundamental drivers of solid-liquid separation in fecal sludge and use knowledge gained to inform transfer of treatment technologies, develop methods for rapid characterization of influent, and predict dewatering performance to facilitate responsive process control for dewatering at treatment facilities. In chapter two, the relationships between physical-chemical parameters including EPS and cations and settling and dewatering performance from fecal sludge field samples were evaluated. Higher concentrations of EPS appeared to contribute to turbid supernatant and worsened filtration by clogging pores but were not associated with differences in bound water in dewatered sludge. Fecal sludge had different physical-chemical characteristics and displayed different dewatering and settling behavior compared to wastewater sludges, and the existing conceptual model for sludge dewatering may need to be edited and expanded to include fecal sludge. In chapter three, the results of fundamental research in chapter two was applied to advise practitioners on how to develop, transfer, and scale-up dewatering and drying technologies for fecal sludge treatment. In chapter four, low-cost and simple field measurements and questionnaire data were used to predict fecal sludge influent characteristics and solid-liquid separation performance with different types of empirical models. Color and texture information from photographs and conductivity and pH measurements from probes were good predictors of total solids, ammonium concentration, settling efficiency, and dewatering time when combined with linear and machine learning models. Accuracy of models based on photos and probe measurements could be sufficient for estimating conditioner dosing for dewatering technologies. In chapter five, the results of fundamental research in chapter four were applied to develop the prototype Sludge Snap app. The app automates image processing of field photographs and runs the predictive models developed in chapter 4 to make real-time predictions of influent characteristics and dewatering performance for use by researchers and practitioners in the field. In chapter six, field samples and controlled anaerobic storage experiments were used to determine the relationships between (1) stabilization and time in onsite containment, (2) stabilization and particle size distribution, and (3) particle size distribution and dewaterability. The common perception that stabilization and dewatering of fecal sludge are linked to storage time in onsite containments did not hold up to scientific investigation. However, although time was not a predictor, particle size and dewatering performance were related to stabilization. Particle and aggregate size distribution, especially the concentration of small particles <10 µm, was a driver of dewatering performance. This thesis provides insight into the fundamental drivers of fecal sludge solid-liquid separation and informs suggestions about how to improve and adapt treatment technologies. Overall, suspended small particles were identified as responsible for poor dewatering and settling in fecal sludge, which suggests that treatment efforts should focus on technologies that remove small particles. This currently cannot be reliably achieved during storage in containment, but could be accomplished with treatment options that promote flocculation (e.g. conditioners) or destruction of small particles (e.g. hydrolysis pretreatment followed by controlled anaerobic digestion). Predictive models based on photographs and probe measurements could help to facilitate adaptive process control to allow for these treatment technologies to successfully function with highly variable influent fecal sludge.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000581228",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/581228","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Sanitation||Fecal sludge characterization||Dewatering||WASH","Settling and Dewatering of Fecal Sludge: Building Fundamental Knowledge for Improved Global Sanitation",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::624 - Civil engineering","2022-11-16T16:49:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28520",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a well-established tool for the quantification of the potential environmental impacts of a product or service throughout its complete life cycle. It can be used to compare various alternatives, assess environmental benefits and negative impacts in a systematic manner, integrate environmental sustainability aspects already at the product design and development stages, and support environmental communication and effective decision-making.  LCA models are based on the analysis of complex supply chains and environmental processes. Naturally, there exists variation in the performance of technical systems, differences in efficiencies or output quantities, and changes in equipment efficacy due to varying internal and external factors. A slightly different combination of parameters compared to their default values in simultaneously many processes can significantly affect LCA results. Depending on the objective of LCA, interpretation of the results might change in the presence of selected uncertainties. This raises the question of how sensitive is LCA to variations in the underlying supply chains, or how robust are the results?  To investigate robustness of LCA, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are employed to numerically propagate uncertainty from the large number of LCA model inputs to the output, and uncertainty analysis (UA) is used to quantify the uncertainty in LCA results. In case it is sufficiently narrow to support robust decision-making, no additional analysis is required. Otherwise, it is important to conduct global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and understand which inputs are responsible for most of the LCA output uncertainty. Then for the identified influential processes, researchers can develop better modeling or invest into additional data collection to reduce output uncertainty, and evaluate reliability of results to make better informed decisions.  The objective of this thesis is to develop new methodologies for validated and robust GSA that are suitable for high-dimensional LCA models with nonlinear and correlated inputs in order to identify influential parameters, potentially reduce uncertainty, and enable more reliable decision making. Since nowadays it is becoming more feasible to include novel data sources in life cycle inventories, and the LCA models are evolving to contain complex nonlinear and correlated elements, the aim was to develop GSA methodologies applicable to a wide spectrum of LCA studies. For this purpose, GSA of large LCA models was separated into screening of non-influential inputs, and ranking of the potentially influential inputs that are remaining. Sensitivity indices - the quantitative measures of inputs' degree of importance - were estimated numerically for each input based on the MC simulations. First, a standardized screening procedure was developed for generic, high-dimensional models, and then tested on a proposed benchmark function, and a case study of climate change impacts from Swiss household consumption. Notably, it monitors robustness and convergence of sensitivity indices, conducts validation of sensitivity results, and contains steps that optimize computational performance of GSA depending on the degree of model linearity. Then Spearman correlations are used as sensitivity indices in case the model is approximately linear, and feature importance metrics from the gradient boosted tree machine learning method otherwise. Applying GSA methods to larger models requires fast and memory-efficient computer codes. The absence of such a code motivated the development of the Python package, gsa_framework, which enhances performance of existing libraries.  The complete GSA protocol tailored for LCA models with many uncertain inputs of various types builds on the robust procedure for high-dimensional screening as previously discussed to filter out unimportant inputs, and then ranks the remaining inputs with Sobol indices. Its performance has been compared against the state-of-the-art approach based on the contributions to the deterministic total life cycle impact assessment score on the case study of Swiss consumption. While our GSA protocol needs more computational resources than the contribution-based method, it also yielded more complete results, and was able to identify potential errors in the ecoinvent life cycle background database. It showed that as few as 20 inputs out of hundreds of thousands are responsible for most of the uncertainty in the carbon footprint of Swiss household consumption.  Finally, we investigated how the correlated and causal dependencies between model inputs can be included in GSA of LCA. Correlations is a long recognized and often neglected issue when performing UA and GSA. Based on the conducted literature review, it seems that  no other works performed large scale GSA for complete LCA models in the presence of correlated uncertainties. This work implemented multiple correlated sampling modules that can be included to MC simulations, and then employed Shapley values in combination with gradient boosting to identify important model inputs. Indeed, UA and GSA outcomes change if one accounts for correlations.  Unlike the existing approaches, the GSA protocols proposed in the scope of this thesis are designed to be generic to tackle various complexity of LCA models and data, which includes correlated inputs, model nonlinearities, and real measurements as input samples. At the same time, they contain steps specific for LCA models to optimize computational performance of GSA. They also include systematic validation of sensitivity results on all steps of GSA, allow correlated and nonlinear effects when conducting GSA of LCA, and assess the performance of GSA on the case study of Swiss household consumption. Special focus was placed onto combining classic GSA methods with novel approaches from the fields of dimensionality reduction and interpretability of machine learning models, as well as making it accessible to other LCA practitioners.  This thesis has demonstrated that complex UA and GSA of LCA is nowadays computationally and methodologically feasible, and how it can be rigorously conducted. Such analyses are needed to support more robust and reliable decision-making, and to systematically improve data and modeling quality in commonly used life cycle inventories. GSA of LCA is in principle a well-defined problem that should become part of any LCA study, because it allows us to gain deeper understanding of LCA models, and hence to better identify potentials for informed decisions and policies. Thereby, there is a clear need for advanced modeling paradigms, novel data sources, and better inventory modeling. With this thesis we want to show the potential in conducting new generation UA, GSA and inventory modeling that can be facilitated with open source software solutions and practices supported by community engagement.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000588835",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588835","en","ETH Zurich",,,"Global sensitivity analysis||Life cycle assessment||Uncertainties||Uncertainty analysis||Monte Carlo simulations||Sobol indices||Gradient boosted decision trees||Shapley value||Delta moment-independent indices||Correlated sampling||Global warming potentials||Robustness||Decision-making||Brightway||Python||Open source software","Global Sensitivity Analysis of Life Cycle Assessment",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::0 - Computer science, information & general works::004 - Data processing, computer science||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::620 - Engineering & allied operations","2022-12-22T10:10:42Z","2023-12-22",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28687",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Resource extraction and processing contribute significantly to global environmental impacts. Fundamental changes in human behavior are urgently needed but not readily possible in the current economic system since most activities and products of modern society rely on raw materials. Therefore, the transition to a Circular Economy (CE) is often promoted as one path to ensure sustainable material cycles. CE aims to close material loops based on nature’s example, thus avoiding waste and protecting natural resources. Generally, a distinction is made between two major CE strategy groups: (1) slowing down and (2) closing resource cycles. The transition to (sustainable) CE is facing several challenges. Some of them are addressed in this dissertation. First, there is the question of when to apply which product lifetime extension strategy for energy using products (EuP). However, lifetime extension strategies only delay products from being discarded. Accordingly, the questions remain about how well material quality can be maintained during recycling and how it can be improved through product and service design. Based on these questions, recommendations for a circular product and service design are derived in this dissertation. The aim of CE should be to optimize the lifespan and not necessarily to maximize it. The latter only results in reduced resource consumption in the production phase and thus manufacturing-related impact. However, if the entire life cycle is considered, the environmental impact is not necessarily minimal. The first question of optimal environmental lifetime (OEL) is answered in chapter 3 with non-linear optimization using a dynamic programming approach. This approach allows taking into account various dynamics affecting the OEL of (circular) products and considering several irregular, unordered replacements over the optimization horizon. The approach is used to calculate the OEL of residential heating systems as an example of EuP. Only full substitutes of the gas boiler technology are considered with new evolved or re-manufactured products as replacement options. The efficiency progress of this cohort of products is little within a given period. In this case, the highest savings potential comes from an optimized replacement schedule that includes frequent replacement with re-manufactured products to eliminate unavoidable efficiency degradation at low investment costs. In addition, an optimized replacement policy also exploits some efficiency gains across the product cohort. While the OEL can serve as a target for new product development and the best replacement time for old products, it does not provide by itself any information on how much the environmental impacts increase when deviating from it. Therefore, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) based lifespan indicator ϕ is introduced in chapter 4. This indicator allows evaluating how far away a given lifetime of a product is from the optimal replacement scenario, thus revealing unsustainable throughput of materials and waste of resources. Such a lifespan indicator requires a simple and efficient calculation method that must deal with path dependencies of non-linear dynamics. The indicator builds on the considerations on substitutes from chapter 2. With the indicator ϕ, it is possible to make informed decisions about the selection and optimal timing of CE strategies and to communicate the results clearly. The application of the indicator is illustrated for residential heating systems considering also the technology switch to heat pumps. The replacement of gas heating appliances should be done in short intervals with the same technology at OEL. It is similarly beneficial to wait until the more efficient product becomes available. However, replacing with new, more efficient or re-manufactured gas boilers brings only little savings potential. More effective is the replacement with heat pumps. Material quality degrades through use and especially during recycling, e.g., due to contamination with other materials during shredding. In order to maintain material quality and thus material functionality for as long as possible, it is crucial to maintain material quality when closing material loops. For the second research question, the first step is to analyze how much of the material embodied in a product can hypothetically come from the same recycled product for given material quality. Based on this, the fitness for closed-loop material recycling indicator Θ is developed, which indicates how well the material quality can be preserved (chapter 5). In a case study, the new approach is also applied to gas heating appliances to analyze their recyclability and quantify potential material quality losses. Retaining material quality requires dilution of contaminants with less contaminated material, which significantly limits Θ. The results are summarized in recommendations for the design of circular products and services. Longevity only makes sense when neither more mature product versions with reduced energy requirements during the use phase nor better, more environmentally friendly alternative technologies are available, and efficiency degradation during use can be neglected. Therefore, re-manufacturing of EuP only makes sense if the technology is mature; otherwise, the lifespan should be optimized. Products and services should therefore be designed so that their environmental lifespan is optimized and recycling is improved. This dissertation provides methods for this.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000562388","978-3-907363-03-4",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/562388","en","ETH Zurich",,,,"Environmental lifetime optimization and closed-loop recycling potential of circular products",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::620 - Engineering & allied operations","2022-08-08T10:31:22Z","2023-08-12",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28160",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Predicting the particulate carbon flux is therefore critical for understanding both global carbon cycling and the future climate. Microbes play a crucial role in particulate organic carbon degradation, but the impact of depth-dependent microbial dynamics on ocean-scale particulate carbon fluxes is poorly understood. Here we scale-up essential features of particle-associated microbial dynamics to understand the large-scale vertical carbon flux in the ocean. Our model provides mechanistic insight into the microbial contribution to the particulate organic carbon flux profile. We show that the enhanced transfer of carbon to depth can result from populations struggling to establish colonies on sinking particles due to diffusive nutrient loss, cell detachment, and mortality. These dynamics are controlled by the interaction between multiple biotic and abiotic factors. Accurately capturing particle-microbe interactions is essential for predicting variability in large-scale carbon cycling.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000541810",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-022-29297-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/541810","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Carbon cycle||Marine chemistry||Microbial biooceanography","Microbes contribute to setting the ocean carbon flux by altering the fate of sinking particulates",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-04-10T05:51:42Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85127277967",,"000776008000014","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The use of facemasks by the general public was initially controversial as interrogations remained regarding the airborne transmission of the disease, and the ability of masks to reduce the risk of infection was under scrutiny. However, masks rapidly proved to be one of the best options to curb the spread of the COVID-19, together with distanciation measures and hand disinfection. Governments and health authorities soon recommended or imposed the generalized use of masks, with variations over time to adapt to the different infection waves, and with significant differences between countries. Both insufficient production and stockpiling at the beginning of the pandemic resulted in shortages of personal protective equipment, especially in hospitals, and fueled the development of community masks based on alternative materials (textiles, such as cotton) as a complement to already existing filtering face pieces (FFP) and medical masks (also known as surgical masks). The measurement of the filtration efficiency of various materials intended to be used in facemasks has been widely documented. However, another crucial aspect of the masks’ protection, the leaking flow, has often been neglected in models estimating the impact of masks on the infection risk and on the spread of the disease. This thesis investigates the mechanisms of the protection provided by facemasks with a strong focus on the leakages. To that extend, an extensive literature review was conducted, measurements on full-face masks were completed, and a computational model was developed to integrate leakage in the calculation of the infection risk. The thesis also presents a potential innovation contributing to the development of smarter masks intended to inform the wearer about the air quality. An alternative full-face personal protective device based on a commercial snorkeling mask featuring a 3D-printed adapter to fit two medical-grade filters was presented; and its level of respiratory protection was investigated. The filtration efficiency and pressure drop of several filters regularly used in medical facilities for patient ventilation were measured. Investigations on the full-face mask featuring high-efficiency filters highlighted the impact on the respiratory protection of faceseal leakage and its variability. The developed device provided a level of respiratory protection equivalent to a FFP2 mask and could be reused as it did not suffer from a degradation of its protection efficiency upon disinfection. A computational model was developed to investigate the role of the leaking flow in the ability of masks to offer adequate levels of respiratory protection and source control against SARS- CoV-2. The model is composed of several modules describing the fate of respiratory particles from their emission by an infected individual to their inhalation by a susceptible person, considering their filtration by the emitter’s and the receiver’s facemasks including leakage, their spread and accumulation around the emitter considering local turbulences, and their deposition in the receiver’s respiratory system upon inhalation. The model was applied to compare various types of masks to analyze the efficiency of source control versus respiratory protection, and to assess the impact of different leakage scenarios including a degraded fit for filtering face pieces. The investigations showed that the leaking flow is the main source of particles entering a mask and being released from a mask. Moreover, a degraded fit on a FFP2 mask can offer less protection than a well-fitted surgical or community mask. An updated version of the computational model allowed the calculation of the infection risk in different settings, to compare the impact of leakage and vaccination considering the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2. An extensive literature review provided realistic data on leakage which were integrated into the model. The investigations pointed out the importance to adapt the sizes of the masks to the facial features and dimensions of the wearers to limit the leakage and improve the protection. A widespread and adapted use of facemasks combined with a high vaccination rate was found to be critical to tackle more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants. Finally, a potential innovation for future smart facemasks was investigated, consisting of a 3D- printed sensor prototype for the monitoring of volatile organic compounds. The sensor was based on ionic liquids and showed a reversible and concentration-dependent change of resistive properties upon exposure to various concentrations of polar organic solvents. The compact and energy-efficient sensor has the potential of being integrated into a facemask to monitor the air quality around the wearer.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000554972",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/554972","en","ETH Zurich",,,"COVID-19||sars-CoV-2||Modeling and simulation||facemask||Sensor||air quality||Airborne","Measurement and Modeling of the Role of Face Protections in the Airborne Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 with Focus on Mask Leakage and Development of a Wearable Air Quality Sensor",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::620 - Engineering & allied operations","2022-06-27T15:08:09Z","2023-06-28",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28278",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The knowledge of snow precipitation microstructure is fundamental for many applications such as precipitation remote sensing, polarimetric measurements, and climate model parametrization. Moreover, snowfalls influence snow distribution on the ground, which plays a pivotal role in Earth’s climate regulation due to its high albedo. Therefore, understanding snow particles falling behavior is crucial. The irregular shape of snowflakes makes their falling attitudes elaborate, gives rise to convoluted trajectories, and may trigger meandering and turbulent wakes. This complex interaction between snowflake shape and the surrounding air impacts the particle drag coefficient and its settling velocity, but it is far from being fully understood.  In the first part of this study, a Delayed-Detached Eddy Simulation model is developed to predict the drag coefficient of snowflakes falling at Reynolds number (Re) between 50 and 2200. The model results are then compared against laboratory experiments using 3D-printed snowflake analogs of the same shape, falling at the same Reynolds number. The first objective is to assess the capability of the numerical model to predict the drag coefficient of complex-shaped particles when their orientation is known a posteriori. Close agreement in the drag coefficient value is found in cases where the particles fall steadily, while a more complex behavior is observed in cases where the flow is unsteady. Secondly, a method to estimate the drag coefficient when the orientation of the particle is not known a posteriori is proposed. A suitable average of two orientations corresponding to the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the inertia tensor provides a good estimate of the particle drag coefficient. Meanwhile, existing correlations for the drag of non-spherical particles produce large errors (≈ 50%). The same approach in then used to evaluate the snow particle terminal velocity. Subsequently, the previously validated Delayed-Detached Eddy Simulations (DDES), combined with experimental observations of free-falling, 3D-printed snowflakes analogs, are employed to analyze the wake topology and momentum flux and investigate the influence of shape and wake flow on the drag coefficient, together with its implications on falling attitudes by comparison with experiments. At low Re, the presence of separated vortex rings is related to particle porosity and increased drag coefficient. With regard to the momentum flux, the contribution of the mean velocity term in the wake momentum deficit is the largest for all particles. At moderate flow regimes, the particle roundness impacts the shear layers separation and the momentum loss in the wake, with increasing contribution by the fluctuating velocity term. At high Re, even though the drag coefficient does not change much among the different geometries, although the contribution of the fluctuating velocity term in momentum flux differs significantly.  Finally, to cross-validate and assess the limitation of the numerical and experimental approaches used in this thesis for snowflake wake characterization, 4D-Particle Tracking Velocimetry experiments of free-falling, 3D-printed snowflakes analogs and Delayed-Detached Eddy Simulations of fixed snow particles are compared analyzing time- and space-averaged flow quantities in the snowflake wake. Firstly, the two approaches are cross-validated for low Re cases where close agreement is found and, secondly, we investigate how strongly the wake of freely falling particles deviates from a fixed particle wake at high Re. At low Reynolds numbers (steady falling behavior), the fixed-particle model can properly represent the wake of freely falling particles, while at moderate/high flow regimes (unsteady falling motion), the comparison highlights much larger differences. Accounting for the movement of the particle by applying a co-moving frame to the laboratory data or filtering the numerical data on larger grids partially reduces these differences, implying that an unsteady fall significantly alters the average wake structure as compared to a fixed particle model.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000560502",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/560502","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","complex-shaped particle aerodynamics||Fluid mechanics||computational fluid dynamics (CFD)||Wake field||Drag Force on settling particles||drag coefficient||Particle Tracking Velocimetry||Snowflakes","Computational investigation of complex-shaped snow particle aerodynamics: drag prediction and wake characteristics",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::624 - Civil engineering||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::530 - Physics","2022-07-27T14:57:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28357",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Biofilms are affected by fluid flow through the porous medium, for example, for nutrient supply, and they, in turn, affect the flow. A striking example of this interplay is the strong intermittency in flow that can occur when biofilms nearly clog the porous medium. Intermittency manifests itself as the rapid opening and slow closing of individual preferential flow paths (PFPs) through the biofilm-porous medium structure, leading to continual spatiotemporal rearrangement. The drastic changes to the flow and mass transport induced by intermittency can affect the functioning and efficiency of natural and industrial systems. Yet, the mechanistic origin of intermittency remains unexplained. Here, we show that the mechanism driving PFP intermittency is the competition between microbial growth and shear stress. We combined microfluidic experiments quantifying Bacillus subtilis biofilm formation and behavior in synthetic porous media for different pore sizes and flow rates with a mathematical model accounting for flow through the biofilm and biofilm poroelasticity to reveal the underlying mechanisms. We show that the closing of PFPs is driven by microbial growth, controlled by nutrient mass flow. Opposing this, we find that the opening of PFPs is driven by flow-induced shear stress, which increases as a PFP becomes narrower due to microbial growth, causing biofilm compression and rupture. Our results demonstrate that microbial growth and its competition with shear stresses can lead to strong temporal variability in flow and transport conditions in bioclogged porous media.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000560522",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2122202119","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/560522","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Competition between growth and shear stress drives intermittency in preferential flow paths in porous medium biofilms",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-28T03:31:11Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85134533540",,,"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","30","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","119","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Für solche Zwecke bedarf es Sensoren, welche empfindliche und präzise Messungen gasförmiger, chemischer Verbindungen sowie Bioaerosolen ermöglichen. Solche Sensoren erleichtern eine kontinuierliche Erfassung und Verarbeitung von Messdaten vor Ort und lassen eine evidenzbasierte, öffentliche Risikobewertung für das Gesundheitsmanagement der Bevölkerung zu. Hürden, die es bei der Entwicklung neuer Gassensoren zu überwinden gilt, sind die selektive und hochauflösende Detektion einzelner Komponenten in einem Gasgemisch sowie die Signalstabilität bei atmosphärischen Veränderungen, wie etwa der Luftfeuchtigkeit und der Temperatur. Darüber hinaus wird eine Überwachung von Bioaerosolen, wie etwa den luftübertragbaren SARS-CoV-2-Viren, durch eine komplizierte Aerosolprobenahme und eine extrem niedrige Viruslast erschwert. Dies führt zu Schwierigkeiten bei der Identifizierung und Quantifizierung von Viren in der Luft. Die vorliegende Dissertation setzt sich mit neuartigen und verwendungsfähigen Szenarien zur Nutzung elektrochemischer Sensoren zur zuverlässigen Detektion von gasförmigen, chemischen Verbindungen, der schnellen COVID-19-Patientendiagnostik sowie der Überwachung von SARS-CoV-2-Bioaerosolen unter Umweltbedingungen auseinander.   1. Sensorentwicklung zur temperatur- und luftfeuchtigkeitsabhängigen elektrochemischen Detektion gasförmiger chemischer Verbindungen (Kapitel 2) Der erste Teil der Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit einer vielseitig verwendbaren Methode zur Herstellung dreidimensionaler Gasdiffusionselektroden (GDEs) mittels eines gleichmässigen Beschichtungsprozesses von Metallen (wie etwa Kupfer oder Palladium) auf elektrogesponnene Nanofasermembranen. Dieses Verfahren zur Herstellung von GDEs ermöglicht das Variieren von bis dato schwer zugänglichen Elektrodenparametern, einschliesslich der Elektrodendicke, des Faserdurchmessers, der Porosität, der Faserzusammensetzung und der Beschichtungszusammensetzung. Basierend auf bereits entwickelten GDEs werden die beschichteten Nanofasermembranen in einen grenzflächenvermittelnden Dreiphasen-Elektrolyseur (Gas-Feststoff-Flüssigkeit) für die elektrochemische CO2-Reduktionsreaktion (eCO2RR) und die Detektion gasförmiger Moleküle integriert. Die elektrokatalytische CO2-Reduktion wird anhand einer freistehenden GDE auf Basis von Sn-modifizierten Cu-beschichteten PVDF-Nanofasern gezeigt, dessen Design hohe Massentransportbeschränkungen verringert sowie hohe CO-Teilstromdichten und faradaysche Wirkungsgrade erzeugen kann. Für die elektrochemische Detektion gasförmiger Moleküle werden Pd-beschichtete GDEs auf PVDF-Nanofaserbasis entwickelt. Dank der Konstruktion der Sensorschnittstelle (Gas-Flüssigkeit-Feststoff-Dreiphasenkonjugation) verhält sich unser Sensorsystem wie eine temperatur- und feuchtigkeitsunabhängige Gasmolekulardetektion und zeigt eine hervorragende Signalstabilität bei Änderungen der atmosphärischen Umgebung.  2. Biosensorentwicklung für den sensitiven elektrochemischen Nachweis von klinischen und luftübertragbaren SARS-CoV-2 Viren (Kapitel 3 & 4) Der zweite Teil dieser Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Entwicklung von protein- und aptamerbasierten elektrochemischen Biosensoren für eine preiswerte, einstufige MultiplexDetektion von SARS-CoV-2 Biomarkern von unbehandelten, klinischen Proben. Dies ermöglicht eine patientennahe, schnelle Diagnose zu Hause oder in der Gemeinde. Mittels dieser Technik wird die Übertragung diagnostischer Daten über Smartphone-basierte Benutzeroberflächen ermöglicht und ein direkter Zugang zum Internet erlaubt Ferndiagnosen, Kontaktverfolgungen und das Einrichten von Entscheidungsfindungsplattformen zur Krankheitskontrolle. Darüber hinaus wird eine neuartige, elektrochemische Bioassay-Plattform vorgestellt. Diese basiert auf einer kontinuierlich fliesenden PCR (Polymerase Kettenreaktion; engl. polymerase chain reaction), mikrofluidikbasierten Genamplifikation sowie einer enzymgestützten Signalverstärkung. Sie findet ihren Nutzen in der direkten Quantifizierung von realen SARS-VoV-2-Bioaerosolen in der städtischen Umgebungsluft. Zum ersten Mal konnte eine bioanalytische Plattform zur direkten Quantifizierung von luftübertragbaren SARSCoV-2-Viren in offenen, öffentlichen Bereichen entwickelt werden. Die vorgestellte Technik bietet eine vielversprechende Perspektive für die Überwachung von luftübertragbaren, infektiösen Viren in öffentlichen Bereichen, welche evidenzbasierte Kontrollmassnahmen und Frühwarnungen vor Infektionsrisiken erleichtern.   Darüber hinaus wird eine perspektivische Zusammenfassung der Entwicklung elektrochemischer Sensoren der nächsten Generation zur Detektion von Chemikalien und Biomoleküle im Ultraspurenbereich vorgestellt.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590304",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590304","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Electrochemical Sensors Development for Detecting Gaseous Chemicals and Bioaerosols",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::600 - Technology (applied sciences)","2023-01-04T21:01:38Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28835",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This study explores the relationship between temporal rainfall attributes – seasonality, timing, and duration of the wet season -- and cereal crop productivity in the rainfed agriculture (RFA) areas of Ethiopia using the CHIRPS rainfall. In the first step, we determined the rainfall seasonality using an entropy-based dimensionless seasonality index (DSI), defined the dates of onset and cessation from the cumulative rainfall anomalies, computed the duration of the wet season, and assessed the anomalies and trends in these attributes and their associations to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) over the period 1981-2010. In the second step, we analyzed the correlation between de-trended total cereal production (the sum of maize, teff, sorghum, wheat, barley, millet, oats, and rice productions) during the main growing season (April - September), and anomalies of the temporal rainfall attributes during 1995-2010. We also estimated the effects of variabilities in the rainfall timing attributes on cereal production using a univariate linear regression model. We show that rainfall in the northern RFA areas of Ethiopia is highly seasonal and unimodal whereas the southern and southeastern parts are characterized by low seasonality and a bimodal regime. Anomalies in the onset dates and DSI are meaningfully related with ENSO: 54% of late-onset events and 50% of negative DSI anomalies during 1981-2010 were observed in El Niño years. The response of crop production to changes in the temporal rainfall attributes depends on the rainfall regime. In regions with unimodal and highly seasonal rainfall regimes, we found that cereal production is mostly correlated with the onset (median ρ=-0.39) and duration (ρ=0.24) of the rainy season, whereas in regions with semi-arid bimodal rainfall regime, cereal production is more correlated with the rainfall seasonality (ρ=0.21). The median cereal production losses due to late-onset and shorter duration over the RFA areas are estimated to be ∼1.5% and 1.1% per 5-day period respectively, but much larger losses of up to 12% can be experienced in some regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594583",,,,"10.5194/iahs2022-244","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594583","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The connections between rainfall regimes and crop production in semi-arid and sub-humid climates: an example from Ethiopia",,"Other Conference Item","Open access","IAHS Scientific Assembly 2022",,"2023-01-24T15:37:38Z",,,,,"yes","11th Scientific Assembly of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS 2022)","May 29 - June 3, 2022","Montpellier, France",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

To project the response of hydrological processes to the increasing global temperatures, scientists and practitioners rely on chains of numerical models, each contributing some degree of uncertainty to the overall outputs. Furthermore, the randomness intrinsic to climate phenomena, known as internal climate variability, contributes to the uncertainty of the hydrological projections in the form of an irreducible stochasticity. In this work, we quantify the impacts and partition the uncertainty of hydrological processes emerging from climate models and internal variability  for two mountainous catchments in the Swiss Alps and across a broad range of scales. To that end, we used high-resolution ensembles of climate and hydrological data produced using a two-dimensional stochastic weather generator (AWE-GEN-2d) and a distributed hydrological model (Topkapi-ETH). We quantified the uncertainty in hydrological projections towards the end of the century through the estimation of the values of signal-to-noise ratios (STNR). We found small STNR values (<-1) in the projection of annual streamflow for most sub-catchments in both study sites that are dominated by the large natural variability of precipitation (explains ~70% of total uncertainty). Furthermore, we investigated specific hydrological components that are critical in the model chain with detail. For example, snowmelt or liquid precipitation exhibits robust change signals, which translates into high STNR values for streamflow during warm seasons and at higher elevations, together with a larger contribution of climate model uncertainty, suggesting that an improvement of the involved models has the potential of significantly narrowing the uncertainty. In contrast, extreme flows show low STNR values due to large internal climate variability across all elevations, which limits the possibility of narrowing their estimation uncertainty due to a warming climate. This study demonstrates that high-resolution hydro-climatic ensembles enable the quantification of hydrological projections across spatial and temporal scales, which can be used to assess the potential for narrowing hydrological uncertainties.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594584",,,,"10.5194/iahs2022-273","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594584","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Using high-resolution stochastic climate ensembles to model the impacts and uncertainty of hydrology in mountainous catchments",,"Other Conference Item","Open access","IAHS Scientific Assembly 2022",,"2023-01-24T15:38:49Z",,,,,"yes","11th Scientific Assembly of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS 2022)","May 29 - June 3, 2022","Montpellier, France",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In many places, it is predicted that these extreme short-duration rainfalls will intensify, become more frequent, and shorten in duration. In climate change impact studies, the spatial aspect of torrential rain is often overlooked, despite many case studies demonstrating its importance. The main reason why changes in rainfall structure are ignored is the lack of information derived from convection-permitting models. They are capable of simulating the rainfall at the fine spatial and temporal scales required to accurately represent torrential rainfall under various warming scenarios, although they are very computationally demanding. Recent studies have shown a relationship between rainfall spatial structure and air temperature but the relationship is not universal and varies by location. In some places, increasing temperature is associated with an increase in rainfall heterogeneity and a decrease in storm area, while in other locations it is associated with rainfall intensification and an increase in storm area. For flood impact assessments, we propose a parameterization method to change the spatial structure of extreme short-duration rainfall. The method is applicable to either simulated data derived from convection-permitting models or observed data obtained from remote sensing devices (such as weather radar) and can be adapted to a variety of global warming scenarios. We will illustrate how the method can be applied to alter the spatial profile of a design storm and demonstrate its implications for assessing changes to flood statistics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594582",,,,"10.5194/iahs2022-163","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594582","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Parameterizing the spatial structure of torrential rain for flood impact assessments",,"Other Conference Item","Open access","IAHS Scientific Assembly 2022",,"2023-01-24T15:36:04Z",,,,,"yes","11th Scientific Assembly of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS 2022)","May 29 - June 3, 2022","Montpellier, France",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, the increasing energy need of an ever-growing population led over time to widespread and radical anthropogenic alterations of many rivers and the surrounding floodplains, such as damming, water abstraction and channelization. The impacts of these alterations are being monitored and their importance has been widely recognized in the literature. That notwithstanding, although the many processes taking place in river corridors are strongly intertwined, holistic analyses encompassing all or most of the involved phenomena have barely been attempted, as existing studies have largely focused on only one or few of the many perspectives: analyses of surface water properties, aquifer levels and oscillations, morphological modifications, habitat availability, and riparian vegetation evolution. Furthermore, most of these studies adopted a diagnostic approach, elaborating on the observed or modelled alterations but failing to provide a prognostic view of expected changes due to alternative regulation policies or to climate change. This dissertation attempts to fill the aforementioned gaps by employing a computational framework coupling a two-dimensional hydrodynamic solver of the shallow water equations, a three-dimensional groundwater solver, and a riparian vegetation dynamics simulator in an exemplary case study: the Alpine gravel-bed braided Maggia River, which is characterized by seemingly pristine conditions and strong interactions between river, aquifer and riparian vegetation, despite significant anthropogenic changes in local ecohydrology due to water abstraction for hydropower production purposes. The coupled modelling of surface water, groundwater and riparian vegetation at the river corridor scale is a novelty in itself, resulting in the assessment of the consequences of streamflow regulation on many ecohydrological processes in a single framework, while simultaneously seeking to provide a prognostic outlook on the expected outcomes of alternative regulation regimes. The obtained results, within the context of the adopted simplifications, suggest that flow regulation induces strong and widespread consequences on local ecohydrology: the overall reduction of river width coupled with the decrease of inundation frequencies, especially in secondary channels, and the consequent loss of the braided character of the stream; the generalized sinking of the groundwater table, on average by almost half meter and in some regions up to several meters; the reduction of in-/exfiltrated water volumes by 40% in comparison with natural conditions; the colonization of the floodplain by vegetation and the synchronous evolution towards a predominance of terrestrial species at the expense of riparian species. Seasonally constant environmental flows are shown to have contradictory effects on the riparian system, on the one hand guaranteeing river connectivity and sufficiently high aquifer levels, on the other hand reducing groundwater fluctuations and not preventing the colonization of the floodplain by terrestrial vegetation species. Alternative regulation regimes are expected to potentially improve the current conditions, provided that flow variability is maintained. Preliminary analyses in climate change scenarios show that the projected higher temperatures and consequently increased evapotranspiration rates seem to favour the growth and expansion of riparian vegetation species at the expense of terrestrials, counteracting the effects of streamflow regulation. In conclusion, the application of a coupled surface water-groundwater-riparian vegetation modelling framework in an exemplary gravel-bed braided river shows how numerical models may represent a virtual laboratory to carry out diagnostic and prognostic analyses, capable of reproducing riverine ecohydrology while encompassing a number of connected perspectives and providing insights on potential improvements for streamflow regulation policies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000589544",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589544","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Integrated Modelling of Streamflow, Groundwater and Riparian Vegetation Dynamics",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::620 - Engineering & allied operations||DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment","2022-12-31T17:48:48Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Optimizing Environmental Flow Releases under Future Hydropower Operation (HydroEnv)","153942","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 70: Gesuch","28427",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Thus, plant-specific physiological traits of beech and spruce are key to determine evapotranspiration fluxes from these forests. During dry periods trees adapt to the decreased soil water availability, however these adaptation strategies are not yet well determined by observation data. Adaptations to water limitations are different between species and if not accounted for, may lead to an overestimation of evapotranspiration fluxes. These unknowns add additional uncertainty to the simulation of transpiration patterns with ecohydrological models under water limited conditions. Here we present a comparison of field methods to measure (directly and indirectly) the transpiration process for the purpose of supporting mechanistic ecohydrological modelling. At our mixed beech and spruce forest field site at Waldlabor Zurich we equipped multiple trees with sapflow sensors (hourly measurements) and frequently measured stomatal conductance and leaf water potential (weekly to twice a week) during the 2021 growing season. Along with these plant-physiological measurements, we recorded timeseries of meteorological variables and soil water content and matric potential in different depths (10, 20, 40 and 80cm).  Sapflow measurements suggest that transpiration rates are tightly linked to the magnitude of solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit. Summer transpiration rates were higher in beech trees compared to spruce trees. Most of the early summer of the 2021 growing season was relatively wet, but the months August and September had considerably lower precipitation than the long-term average. This period with low precipitation during August and September led to decreasing soil water content and matric potential, which caused leaf water potentials to decrease accordingly. On the contrary, stomatal conductance remained relatively constant for beech and even increased for spruce, suggesting that under the encountered conditions, stomatal control is not depending directly on leaf water potential. Sapflow rates gradually decreased as the growing season proceeded, but it remains unclear to what degree this decrease was due to phenology, meteorological conditions and/or limited water availability. We compared our measurements to the simulations of an existing mechanistic ecohydrological model (Tethys-Chloris) to test the performance on the observed diurnal dynamics. The comparisons between observed and simulated transpiration rates showed that uncertainties are larger when water availability is limited in the dry periods of August and September.  Our work provides insight into the processes at the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum by the combination of highly resolved measurements and an established mechanistic ecohydrological model. Results highlight how well different measurements of transpiration proxies agree with each other, how suitable they are to assess the actual transpiration rates, and which conditions have larger simulation uncertainties in ecohydrological models and thus need to be better constrained by field observations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594578",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-12488","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594578","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Determining transpiration rates from beech and spruce trees with measurements of sapflow, leaf water potential and stomatal conductance",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2023-01-24T15:29:32Z",,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23–27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Understanding what controls these transformations and how they evolve across seasons is key to assess forest water cycling and nutrient transport. At the Waldlabor Zurich ecohydrological observatory (Switzerland) we measure the amount and chemical signature of precipitation since April 2020. Our measurement setup focusses on spruce (Picea abies) and beech (Fagus silvatica) trees, as they are the two most common species across Switzerland. In addition to the ion and isotope concentrations in precipitation, throughfall, stemflow as well as in the soil at different depths (10, 20, 40 and 80 cm), we also assess the canopy density in weekly resolution, groundwater depth and streamflow amount at the outlet of our forested catchment, as well as their chemical and isotopic composition  We assessed the seasonal variability of throughfall and stemflow and their relation to canopy density measurements for beech, spruce and young spruce trees. Canopy density had little to no effect on interception and stemflow fractions. We found almost half of the total annual precipitation is intercepted in the canopies of spruce and beech trees, this is because most precipitation events were quite small, resulting in almost no throughfall at all. However, in general, the fraction of interception decreased with increasing event size, on the other hand events below 4 mm did not produce significant amounts of throughfall and stemflow. Water chemistry is showing that major enrichment processes took place in the canopy, subsequently the ion signature was different in throughfall and stemflow compared to open field precipitation. Ion concentrations of sodium, chloride, nitrate, ammonium and potassium were 2 - 10 times higher in throughfall and up to 14 times higher in stemflow compared to concentrations measured in open field precipitation. We hypothesize this is the result of accumulation of wind deposits, especially of anthropogenic contaminants on the tree stem, branches and leaves, as we found concentrations where generally higher during events succeeding long periods without precipitation. In accordance with the much rougher surface of spruce needles and stems compared to beech leaves and stems, we found much higher concentrations in throughfall and stemflow below spruce trees and elevated ion concentrations in the soil waters up to 40 cm depth. Overall, our results highlight the importance of forests, not only in redistributing precipitation, but also in changing the chemical signal of precipitation and thus the forest water and nutrient cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594577",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-8574","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594577","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Enrichment Processes in Throughfall and Stemflow in a Mixed Temperate Forest",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2023-01-24T15:26:59Z",,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23–27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We present radar measurements of snow cover obtained with KAPRI, a bistatic polarimetric Ku-band radar system.

In the bistatic configuration, the system is composed of two independently-operating KAPRI devices, one serving as a primary transmitter-receiver, and the other as a secondary receiver. The secondary bistatic dataset is affected by possible offsets between the two devices’ reference clocks, as well as distortions arising from the bistatic geometry. To correct for this, we present a two-chirp bistatic FMCW signal model which accounts for the distortions, and a reference chirp transmission procedure which allows correcting the clock offsets in the deramped signal time domain. The second challenge of operation of a bistatic polarimetric system is polarimetric calibration, since it is not possible to employ purely monostatic targets such as corner reflectors. For this purpose we developed a novel active calibration device VSPARC (Variable-Signature Polarimetric Active Radar Calibrator), designed for monostatic and bistatic calibration of all polarimetric channels. VSPARC and its associated novel polarimetric calibration method were then used to achieve full calibration of both KAPRI devices with polarimetric phase calibration accuracy of 20° and 30 dB polarization purity in field conditions. This article thus presents a complete measurement configuration and data processing pipeline necessary for synchronization, coregistration, and polarimetric calibration of bistatic and monostatic datasets acquired by a real-aperture FMCW radar.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528527",,"0196-2892||1558-0644",,"10.1109/tgrs.2021.3121466","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528527","en","IEEE","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Calibration and Operation of a Bistatic Real-Aperture Polarimetric-Interferometric Ku-Band Radar",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-01-25T16:13:47Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"000753505900021","IEEE Trans.

Measurement inaccuracies from INS/GNSS systems lead to residual phase errors in the SAR products whose minimization is crucial to derive accurate topographic and deformation information. In this work, we analyze the impact of residual positioning errors on car-borne repeat-pass SAR interferometry at L-band for different INS/GNSS measurement configurations and for the typical car-borne acquisition geometry. The positioning errors are evaluated both during single SAR acquisitions with long integration times and between different acquisitions as a function of the distance of the radar platform from the GNSS reference stations. We show the reduction of interferometric phase errors achievable by additionally using a GNSS receiver mounted in the vicinity of the SAR platform as compared to remote reference stations of the national network of permanent GNSS receivers. Test results obtained in a controlled setup with a rail-based SAR system equipped with a navigation-grade INS/GNSS system show maximum repeat-pass trajectory errors on the order of 1–2 cm using a local GNSS reference station and up to 10–15 cm using the remote reference stations, leading to azimuth and range phase trends in the interferometric products.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000560686",,"1939-1404||2151-1535",,"10.1109/jstars.2022.3193053","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/560686","en","IEEE","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Global navigation satellite system||inertial navigation||measurement errors||radar remote sensing||radar interferometry||synthetic aperture radar||terrain mapping","Assessing the impact of positioning errors in car-borne repeat-pass SAR interferometry with a controlled rail-based experiment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-28T12:00:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"000865092000004","IEEE j. sel. top. appl. earth obs. remote sens.",,"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Thus far, the propulsion force determination has been obtained from the colloidal motor motion speed and surrounding viscosity via the Stokes drag. Herein, a precise force measurement method and detailed analysis of the fundamental propulsion mechanisms of colloidal Janus micromotors propelled by thermophoretic and steam bubble force vectors, revealing findings uninvestigated to date, are presented. Optical tweezers provide fast and high-precision force measurements in all three orthogonal dimensions simultaneously. Colloidal Janus micromotors are compared with isotropic hot Brownian reference microparticles, which have no defined force vector that propels them perpendicular to the direction of the laser beam. Janus micromotors display a defined laser power intensity-dependent thermophoretic propulsion, as well as bubble force-based propulsion, after surpassing the threshold value for the water boiling. The steam bubble propulsion force vector and the thermophorethic force vectors sum up for the Janus micromotor propulsion direction. On the contrary, the bubble force counteracts photophoretic force in propagation direction of light. Moreover, the thermal-based reduction of viscosity around the Janus colloidal motor contributes significantly to its speed and guidance abilities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000511489",,"2699-9293",,"10.1002/adpr.202100189","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/511489","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Hot Brownian motion||Janus colloid motors||Microscopic steam bubbles||Optical tweezers||Plasmonic micromotors||Propulsion force measurements||Thermophoresis","Propulsion Mechanisms of Light‐Driven Plasmonic Colloidal Micromotors",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-10-25T07:34:45Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"000969160000012",,"1","Advanced Photonics Research","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This study proposed a feasible binding mode for the first time and provided atomic-level descriptions for the high affinity and specific binding of AS1411. The binding pose predicted by docking was screened using knowledge-based criteria, and a microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulation showed the stable existence of the predicted structure in the solution. Structural analysis shows that the unique capping of the 5′ end of AS1411 provides the specific binding with RBD1, and the interactions of hydrogen bond, salt bridge, and water-mediated network between AS1411 and RBD1,2 stabilize the binding. The calculation of per-residue decomposition emphasizes the dominant contribution of van der Waals energy and critical residues are screened. Our study provides the molecular basis of this specific binding and can guide rational AS1411-based aptamers design. Further insights require tight collaborations between the experiments and in silico studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576030",,"2296-889X",,"10.3389/fmolb.2022.1025313","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576030","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Insights into the binding mode of AS1411 aptamer to nucleolin",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-10-14T13:53:11Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85139948471",,"000871320700001",,,"Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.
