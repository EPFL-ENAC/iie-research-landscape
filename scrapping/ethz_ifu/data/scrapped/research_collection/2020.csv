More specifically, FL has been highly successful in producing micron-sized, encoded particles of bespoke shape, size, and color. That said, to date, FL has been restricted to generating barcoded microparticles and has lacked the ability to produce hybrid fibers which are structurally and spectrally encoded. To this end, we herein present a method that combines a continuous flow microfluidic system with two-photon polymerization (2PP) to fabricate microscale-encoded fibers and Janus strips in a high-throughput manner. Specifically, two co-flow liquid streams containing a monomer and initiator are introduced through a Y-shape channel to form a stable interface in the center of a microfluidic channel. The flow containing the (fluorescently labeled) monomer is then patterned by scanning the voxel of the 2PP laser across the interface to selectively polymerize different regions of the forming fiber/particle. Such a process allows for rapid spectral encoding at the single fiber level, with the resulting structurally coded fibers having obvious application in the fields of security identification and anticounterfeiting.",,,,"1944-8244||1944-8252",,"10.1021/acsami.0c14917","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453817","en","American Chemical Society",,,"Microfluidics||Laminar flow||Two-photon polymerization||Hybrid fiber||Barcoding","Laminar Flow-Based Fiber Fabrication and Encoding via Two-Photon Lithography","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-11-30T16:16:06Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85096712478",,"000596876400050","ACS Appl Mater Interfaces","48","ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02020 - Dep.

Weather generator (WG) models, generally designed for mesoscale applications (e.g., 101–105 km2), are popular and widely used tools to downscale climate data to finer resolution. One advantage of using WGs is their ability to generate the necessary climate variables for impact studies in data sparse regions. In this study, we evaluate the ability of a previously established state of the art WG (the AWE‐GEN‐2d model) to perform in data sparse regions that are beyond the mesoscale, using the Zambezi River basin (106 km2) in southeast Africa as a case study. The AWE‐GEN‐2d model was calibrated using data from satellite retrievals and climate re‐analysis products in place of the absent observational data. An 8‐km climate ensemble at hourly resolution, covering the period of 1976–2099 (present climate and RCP4.5 emission scenario from 2020), was then simulated. Using the simulated 30‐member ensemble, climate indices for both present and future climates were computed. The high‐resolution climate indices allow detailed analysis of the effects of climate change on different areas within the basin. For example, the southwestern area of the basin is predicted to experience the greatest change due to increased temperature, while the southeastern area was found to be already so hot that is less affected (e.g., the number of 'very hot days' per year increase by 18 and 9 days, respectively). Rainfall intensities are found to increase most in the eastern areas of the basin (1 mm·d−1) in comparison to the western region (0.3 mm·d−1). As demonstrated in this study, AWE‐GEN‐2d can be calibrated successfully using data from climate reanalysis products in the absence of ground station data and can be applied at larger scales than the mesoscale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000411774",,"0899-8418||1097-0088",,"10.1002/joc.6578","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/411774","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Climate change||Climate indices||Extreme climate indices||Rainfall||Stochastic downscaling||Temperature||Weather generator||Zambezi River","Downscaling climate projections over large and data sparse regions: Methodological application in the Zambezi River Basin","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-04-26T02:31:06Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,"85083782845",,"000525837000001","Int. j. climatol.","15","International Journal of Climatology","40","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Despite the development of various SSA frameworks, sanitation planning still often follows a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. Structured decision making (SDM) can help by balancing trade-offs among different solutions. But SDM requires a set of appropriate sanitation options to choose from. Because conventional sewer-based sanitation is often inappropriate, many novel technologies and systems have been developed (e.g. container-based sanitation). While these innovations enhance sustainability, they also increase planning complexity. In this review, we look at available frameworks and tools for SSA and discover a lack of systematic tools for the identification of planning options that are able to consider the growing portfolio of available solutions and multiple sustainability criteria. Therefore, we critically compare 15 tools from which we compile eight qualities that could help any future tool address the current sanitation challenge: it should be comprehensive, automated to deal with a large number of options, systematic, flexible towards future innovation and should consider all sustainability dimensions, make a contextualized evaluation, allow for participation, and consider uncertainties to be applicable ex-ante also for novel technologies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000454462",,"2043-9083",,"10.2166/washdev.2020.062","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454462","en","IWA Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Appropriate technologies||Developing countries||Sanitation systems||SDG 6||Strategic sanitation planning (SSP)||Structured decision making (SDM)||Sustainable sanitation","Review of frameworks and tools for urban strategic sanitation planning: considering technology innovations and sustainability.","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-03T12:43:51Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4","Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This network layout parametrizes a second model that determines hydraulic features including the diameter and the upstream and downstream invert elevations of pipes using a shortest path algorithm. These models are embedded in an iterative scheme that refines a cost function approximation for the first model upon learning the actual design cost from the second model. The framework was successfully tested on two sewer network benchmarks from the literature and a real sewer network located in Bogotá, Colombia, that is proposed as a new instance. For both benchmarks, the proposed methodology found a better solution with up to 42% cost reduction compared to the best methodologies reported in the literature. These are near-optimal solutions with respect to construction cost that satisfy all hydraulic and pipe connectivity constraints of a sewer system.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456282",,"2073-4441",,"10.3390/w12123337","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456282","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","sewer network design||layout selection||hydraulic design||mix-integer programming||dynamic programming","Sewer network layout selection and hydraulic design using a mathematical optimization framework","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-15T03:20:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85097277833",,"000602893200001",,"12","Water","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, the process of labelling data is typically cumbersome and, as a result, a hindrance to the adoption of machine learning methods for automated anomaly detection. In this work, we propose to address this challenge by means of active learning. This method consists of querying the domain expert for the labels of only a selected subset of the full data set. We show that this reduces the time and costs associated to labelling while delivering the same or similar anomaly detection performances. Finally, we also show that machine learning models providing a nonlinear classification boundary are to be recommended for anomaly detection in complex environmental data sets. © 2020 The Authors","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000447213",,"1364-8152||1873-6726",,"10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104869","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/447213","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Active learning||Anomaly detection||Machine learning||Environmental monitoring","Active learning for anomaly detection in environmental data","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-22T08:53:55Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85092525742",,"000591712700007","Environ.

The two technologies available today, i.e. an on-line nitrite analyzer and a spectrophotometric sensor, have strong limitations such as sample preparation, cost of ownership and strong interferences. A promising alternative is the amperometric measurement of nitrite, which we assessed in this study. We investigated the sensor in a urine nitrification reactor and in ex-situ experiments. Based on theoretical calculations as well as a practical approach, we determined that the critical nitrite concentrations for nitrite oxidizing bacteria lie between 12 and 30 mgN/L at pH 6 to 6.8. Consequently, we decided that the sensor should be able to reliably measure concentrations up to 50 mgN/L, which is about double the value of the critical nitrite concentration. We found that the influences of various ambient conditions, such as temperature, pH, electric conductivity and aeration rate, in the ranges expected in urine nitrification systems, are negligible. For low nitrite concentrations, as expected in municipal wastewater treatment, the tested amperometric nitrite sensor was not sufficiently sensitive. Nevertheless, the sensor delivered reliable measurements for nitrite concentrations of 5–50 mgN/L or higher. This means that the amperometric nitrite sensor allows detection of critical nitrite concentrations without difficulty in high-strength nitrogen conversion processes, such as the nitrification of human urine.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000420264",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2020.100055","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/420264","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Continuous measurement||In-situ measurement||Electrochemical measurement||Amperometric sensor||Critical nitrite concentration||Nitrite measurement","Electrochemical nitrite sensing for urine nitrification","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-15T03:07:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85086125260",,"000600678000001",,,"Water Research X","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are new generation adsorbents with previously demonstrated potential as filter media to improve virus removal. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the field applicability of MWCNT-filters for virus removal in water containing natural organic matter (NOM) as co-solute to viruses, using batch equilibrium experiments. Contrary to previous studies, our results showed with MS2 bacteriophages single-solute systems that the affinity of MWCNT for MS2 was low, since after 3 h of equilibration only 4 log10 reduction value (LRV) of MS2 (20 mL at an initial concentration of 106 PFU MS2/mL) were reached. Single solute experiments with Suwannee river NOM (SRNOM) performed with environmentally-relevant concentrations showed MWCNT surface saturation at initial SRNOM concentrations between 10 and 15 mgC/L, for water pH between 5.2 and 8.7. These results suggested that at NOM:virus ratios found in natural waters, the NOM would competitively suppress virus adsorption onto MWCNT, even at low NOM concentrations. We confirmed this expectation with SRNOM-MS2 co-solute experiments, which showed an exponential decrease of the MS2 LRV by MWCNT with an increase in the initial SRNOM concentration. More interestingly, we showed that pre-equilibrating MWCNT with a SRNOM solution at a concentration as low as 0.4 mgC/L resulted in a LRV decrease of 3 for MS2, due to the formation of a negatively charged SRNOM adlayer on the MWCNT surface. Complementary batch experiments with natural NOM-containing waters and competition experiments with SRNOM in the presence of CaCl2 confirmed that the presence of NOM in waters challenges virus removal by MWCNT-filters, irrespective of the concentration and type of NOM and also in the presence of Ca2+. We therefore conclude that MWCNT-filters produced with commercially available pristine MWCNT cannot be considered as a viable technology for drinking water virus removal.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000423473",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2020.100058","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/423473","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Multiwalled carbon nanotubes||Virus treatment||Natural organic matter||Competitive adsorption||Drinking water","Competitive co-adsorption of bacteriophage MS2 and natural organic matter onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-28T02:43:37Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85086710219",,"000600678000004",,,"Water Research X","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, the impact of XB on aerobic granular sludge (AGS) systems is not fully understood. This study evaluated the physical retention of XB in AGS sequencing batch reactor (SBR) during anaerobic plug-flow and then aerobic fully-mixed conditions. The influence of different sludge types and operational variables on the extent and mechanisms of XB retention in AGS SBR were evaluated. XB mass-balancing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were applied. During the anaerobic plug-flow feeding, most XB was retained in the first few cm of the settled sludge bed within the interstitial voids, where XB settled and accumulated ultimately resulting in the formation of a filter-cake. Sedimentation and surface filtration were thus the dominant XB retention mechanisms during plug-flow conditions, indicating that contact and attachment of XB to the biomass was limited. XB retention was variable and influenced by the XB influent concentration, sludge bed composition and upflow feeding velocity (vww). XB retention increased with larger XB influent concentrations and lower vww, which demonstrated the importance of sedimentation on XB retention during plug-flow conditions. Hence, large fractions of influent XB likely re-suspended during aerobic fully-mixed conditions, where XB then preferentially and rapidly attached to the flocs. During fully-mixed conditions, increasing floc fractions, longer mixing times and larger XB concentrations increased XB retention. Elevated XB retention was observed after short mixing times < 60 min when flocs were present, and the contribution of flocs towards XB retention was even more pronounced for short mixing times < 5 min. Overall, our results suggest that flocs occupy an environmental niche that results from the availability of XB during aerobic fully-mixed conditions of AGS SBR. Therefore, a complete wash-out of flocs is not desirable in AGS systems treating municipal wastewater.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450217",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2020.100075","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450217","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Aerobic granular sludge||Municipal wastewater||Particulate substrate||Plug-flow feeding||Attachment||Flocs","Particulate substrate retention in plug-flow and fully-mixed conditions during operation of aerobic granular sludge systems","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-09T04:14:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85094955463",,"000600678000019",,,"Water Research X","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, many of these advancements are scattered throughout the scientific literature, making it difficult for practitioners to apply the new models. Here, we present the LC‐IMPACT method that provides characterization factors at the damage level for 11 impact categories related to three areas of protection (human health, ecosystem quality, natural resources). Human health damage is quantified as disability adjusted life years, damage to ecosystem quality as global species extinction equivalents (based on potentially disappeared fraction of species), and damage to mineral resources as kilogram of extra ore extracted. Seven of the impact categories include spatial differentiation at various levels of spatial scale. The influence of value choices related to the time horizon and the level of scientific evidence of the impacts considered is quantified with four distinct sets of characterization factors. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method with an illustrative life cycle assessment example of different fuel options in Europe (petrol or biofuel). Differences between generic and regionalized impacts vary up to two orders of magnitude for some of the selected impact categories, highlighting the importance of spatial detail in LCIA.

Because Ce in sewage sludge can also be of geogenic origin, the quantification of anthropogenic Ce in sewage sludge remains elusive. In this study, we evaluated the suitability of Ce oxidation state and rare earth element (REE) patterns for the quantification of anthropogenic Ce fractions in sewage sludge. A diverse set of soil samples served to gain baseline information on geogenic Ce. Geogenic Ce in the soils was characterized by high Ce(III) fractions (≥70%) and their REE patterns were comparable to the REE patterns of the upper continental crust. The sewage sludges contained on average ∼80% Ce(IV) (range 18–108%), pointing to the importance of anthropogenic inputs of Ce(IV). The quantification of the anthropogenic Ce fraction based on Ce oxidation state, however, was associated with considerable uncertainty because geogenic and anthropogenic Ce cannot exclusively be assigned to Ce(III) and Ce(IV), respectively. The REE patterns of most sewage sludges indicated a clear enrichment of Ce compared to heavier REE. Based on the assumption that the industrially used Ce is free of (most) other REE, we estimated the fraction of anthropogenic Ce in the sludges based on individual Ce/REE ratios. For the individual sludges the anthropogenic contributions were very variable (10–100%) but consistent fractions were obtained for individual sludges when calculated based on Ce/Dy (dysprosium), Ce/Er (erbium) and Ce/Eu (europium) ratios. Electron microscopy analysis of sludges dominated by anthropogenic Ce revealed that the Ce was mostly contained in nanoscale particles devoid of elements characteristic of Ce-bearing minerals. Thus, anthropogenic Ce contents derived from REE patterns may be used to validate current mass flow models for engineered CeO2 nanoparticles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429180",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2020.100059","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429180","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Engineered nanoparticles||Cerium||X-ray absorption spectroscopy||Wastewater||Biosolids","Quantification of anthropogenic and geogenic Ce in sewage sludge based on Ce oxidation state and rare earth element patterns","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-30T07:36:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85088394959",,"000600678000005",,,"Water Research X","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Atmospheric transport and pollutant chemistry of primary particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) from stack emissions were modeled and used to calculate monthly high-resolution maps of global characterization factors that can be used for life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and risk assessment. These characterization factors are applied to a global data set of coal power emissions. The results show large regional and temporal differences in health impacts per kg of emission and per amount of coal power generation (5 to 1300 DALY TWh−1). While small emission reductions of PM2.5 and SO2 from coal power lead to similar health benefits across densely populated areas of Asia and Europe, we find that larger emission reductions result in up to three times higher health benefits in parts of Asia because of the non-linear health responses to pollution exposure changes. Hence, many regions in Asia benefit disproportionately much from large coal power PM2.5 and SO2 emission reductions. NOx emission reductions can lead to equally high health benefits where unfavorable atmospheric conditions coincide with elevated NH3 background pollution and a large amount of population (e.g. in Central Europe, Indonesia or Japan but also numerous other places).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000452729",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.0c05691","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/452729","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Particulate matter||Air pollution||Health impact assessment||Life cycle assessment (LCA)||Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA)||Coal||Energy||Electricity","Globally Regionalized Monthly Life Cycle Impact Assessment of Particulate Matter","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-24T09:20:19Z","2021-11-23",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85097995065",,"000600100400047","Environ.

Despite this high diversity, all PFAS are alike in that they contain perfluoroalkyl moieties that are extremely resistant to environmental and metabolic degradation. The vast majority of PFAS are therefore either non-degradable or transform ultimately into stable terminal transformation products (which are still PFAS). Under the European chemicals regulation this classifies PFAS as very persistent substances (vP). We argue that this high persistence is sufficient concern for their management as a chemical class, and for all “non-essential” uses of PFAS to be phased out. The continual release of highly persistent PFAS will result in increasing concentrations and increasing probabilities of the occurrence of known and unknown effects. Once adverse effects are identified, the exposure and associated effects will not be easily reversible. Reversing PFAS contamination will be technically challenging, energy intensive, and costly for society, as is evident in the efforts to remove PFAS from contaminated land and drinking water.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000448509",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/d0em00355g","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448509","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"The High Persistence of PFAS is Sufficient for their Management as a Chemical Class","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-29T09:02:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85098465159",,"000599425400001","Environ Sci Process Impacts","12","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In addition to well-known categories such as textile impregnation, fire-fighting foam, and electroplating, the identified use categories also include many categories not described in the scientific literature, including PFAS in ammunition, climbing ropes, guitar strings, artificial turf, and soil remediation. We further discuss several use categories that may be prioritised for finding PFAS-free alternatives.

Here, we quantified the detailed aviation particle number emission from Zurich Airport and evaluated its influences on the annual mean particle number concentrations in the surrounding communities. The actual flight trajectory data were utilized for the first time to develop an emission inventory with high spatial resolution. The estimated total particle number emission was in the magnitude of 1024 particles per year. The annual mean particle mass concentrations in the nearby communities were increased by about 0.1 μg m–3 due to the aviation emission, equivalent to about 1% of the background concentration. However, the particle number concentration could be increased by a factor of 2–10 of the background level (104 cm–3) for nearby communities.

Accurate prediction of the capture efficiency of airborne GNPs is significant to avoid occupational exposure. Herein, the aerodynamic property and filtration mechanisms of airborne GNPs with plate-like shape and folded structure were studied. Different equivalent diameters of GNPs (aerodynamic diameter da, mobility diameter dm) were derived and used to describe diverse mechanisms in the filtration model. The capture efficiency of plate-like GNPs and sphere-like NaCl particles was measured with Nuclepore membranes and nanofibrous membranes to assess the particle shape effect during filtration. The plate-like GNPs showed higher capture efficiency due to the larger interception length. SEM measurement showed that not only planar GNPs, GNPs with folded structure also occurred due to the large lateral size to thickness ratio and strong mechanical stimulation in the atomization process. For GNPs with aerodynamic diameter of 0.5 – 0.9 μm, the capture efficiency for folded GNPs decreased by 20 – 30% according to the analytical calculation. In addition, the effects of membrane structural parameters (Nuclepore membrane pore radius, fiber diameter, solidity) on the quality factor (Qf) were systematically analyzed to evaluate the overall filtration performance. This study not only elucidates the effect of plate-like shape and folded structure on the aerodynamics of airborne GNPs, but also contributes to better design of Nuclepore and nanofibrous membranes to improve the filtration performance of plate-like particles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000424105",,"1383-5866",,"10.1016/j.seppur.2020.117293","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424105","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Graphene nanoplatelets||Folded structure||Aerodynamic property||Filtration efficiency||Quality factor","Aerodynamic property and filtration evaluation of airborne graphene nanoplatelets with plate-like shape and folded structure","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-01T14:38:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85087135731",,"000564725900011",,,"Separation and Purification Technology","251","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We provide a comprehensive data-driven assessment of the effects of rainfall temporal resolution (hourly versus daily) on rainfall threshold performance in Switzerland, with sensitivity to two other important aspects which appear in many landslide studies the normalisation of rainfall, which accounts for local climatology, and the inclusion of antecedent rainfall as a proxy of soil water state prior to landsliding. We use an extensive landslide inventory with over 3800 events and several daily and hourly, station, and gridded rainfall datasets to explore different scenarios of rainfall threshold estimation. Our results show that although hourly rainfall did show the best predictive performance for landslides, daily data were not far behind, and the benefits of hourly resolutions can be masked by the higher uncertainties in threshold estimation connected to using short records. We tested the impact of several typical actions of users, like assigning the nearest rain gauge to a landslide location and filling in unknown timing, and we report their effects on predictive performance. We find that localisation of rainfall thresholds through normalisation compensates for the spatial heterogeneity in rainfall regimes and landslide erosion process rates and is a good alternative to regionalisation. On top of normalisation by mean annual precipitation or a high rainfall quantile, we recommend that non-Triggering rainfall be included in rainfall threshold estimation if possible. Finally, while antecedent rainfall threshold approaches used at the local scale are not successful at the regional scale, we demonstrate that there is predictive skill in antecedent rain as a proxy of soil wetness state, despite the large heterogeneity of the study domain. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

In this context, sanitation systems are the most often structured using technology-driven templates rather than performance-based sustainability indicators. In this work, we answer two questions: Firstly, can we estimate generic resource recovery and loss potentials and their uncertainties for a diverse and large set of sanitation systems? And secondly, can we identify technological aspects of sanitation systems that indicate a better overall resource recovery performance? The aim is to obtain information that can be used as an input into any strategic planning process and to help shape technology development and system design for resource recovery in the future. Starting from 41 technologies, which include novel and conventional options, we build 101,548 valid sanitation system configurations. For each system configuration we quantify phosphorus, nitrogen, total solids, and water flows and use that to calculate recovery potentials and losses to the environment, i.e. the soil, air, or surface water. The four substances cover different properties and serve as a proxy for nutrient, organics, energy, and water resources. For modelling the flows ex-ante, we use a novel approach to consider a large range of international literature and expert data considering uncertainties. Thus all results are generic and can therefore be used as input into any strategic planning process or to help guide future technology development. A detailed analysis of the results allows us to identify factors that influence recovery and losses. These factors include the type of source, the length of systems, and the level of containment in storage and treatment. The factors influencing recovery are related to interactions of different technologies in a system which shows the relevance of a modelling approach that allows to look at all possible system configurations systematically. Based on our analysis, we developed five recommendations for the optimization of resource recovery: (i) prioritize short systems that close the loop at the lowest possible level; (ii) separate waste streams as much as possible, because this allows for higher recovery potentials; (iii) use storage and treatment technologies that contain the products as much as possible, avoid leaching technologies (e.g. single pits) and technologies with high risk of volatilization (e.g. drying beds); (iv) design sinks to optimise recovery and avoid disposal sinks; and (v) combine various reuse options for different side streams (e.g. urine diversion systems that combine reuse of urine and production of biofuel from faeces). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2020.116281","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/442205","en","Elsevier",,,"Substance flow modelling||Resource recovery||Sustainable sanitation||Technology innovation||Structured decision making||Multi-criteria decision analysis","Comparative analysis of sanitation systems for resource recovery: Influence of configurations and single technology components","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-09-24T06:20:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85090953267",,"000589968700002","Water Res.",,"Water Research","186","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, typical methods use Gaussian error models, which often cannot describe the complex temporal patterns of residuals. Consequently, this results in overconfidence in the identified parameters and, in turn, optimistic reactor designs. In this work, we assess the strengths and weaknesses of a method to statistically describe these patterns with autocorrelated error models. This method produces increased widths of the credible prediction intervals following the inclusion of the bias term, in turn leading to more conservative design choices. However, we also show that the augmented error model is not a universal tool, as its application cannot guarantee the desired reliability of the resulting wastewater reactor design.

The periodic sediment mobilization from incised areas and landslides by hillslope runoff and river discharge is simulated in addition to overland flow erosion to quantify their contributions to suspended sediment fluxes. The framework simulates the suspended sediment load provenance at the outlet and its temporal dynamics, by routing fine sediment along topographically driven pathways from the distinct sediment sources to the outlet. We show that accounting for localized sediment sources substantially improves the modelling of observed sediment concentrations and loads at the outlet compared to overland flow erosion alone. We demonstrate that the modelled river basin can shift between channel‐process and hillslope‐process dominant behaviour depending on the model parameter describing gully competence on landslide surfaces. The simulations in which channel processes dominate were found to be more consistent with observations, and with two independent validations in the Kleine Emme, by topographic analysis of surface roughness and by sediment tracing with 10Be concentrations. This research shows that spatially explicit modelling can be used to infer the dominant sediment production process in a river basin, to inform and optimize sediment sampling strategies for denudation rate estimates, and in general to support sediment provenance studies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,"0197-9337||1096-9837",,"10.1002/esp.4979","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444648","en","Wiley",,,"sediment sources||sediment provenance||mountain basin||cosmogenic radionuclides||suspended sediment transport modelling||mesoscale catchment","Modelling localized sources of sediment in mountain catchments for provenance studies","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-10-06T02:34:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,"85091153639",,"000571352500001","Earth Surf Process Landforms","14","Earth Surface Processes and Landforms","45","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

An application of this method is the observation of the surface flow velocity of steep, fast-flowing aglaciers. For these observations, the main factor limiting the accuracy of TRI observations is the spatial and temporal variabilities in the distribution of atmospheric water vapor content, causing a phase delay [atmospheric phase screen (APS)] whose magnitude is similar to the displacement phase. This contribution presents a geostatistical analysis of the spatial and temporal behaviors of the APS in Ku-Band TRI. The analysis is based on the assumption of a separable spatiotemporal covariance structure, which is tested empirically using variogram analysis. From this analysis, spatial and temporal APS statistics are estimated and used in a two-step procedure combining regression-Kriging with generalized least squares (GLS) inversion to estimate a velocity time-series. The performance of this method is evaluated by cross-validation using phase observations on stable scatterers. This analysis shows a considerable reduction in residual phase variance compared with the standard approach of combining the linear models of APS stratification and interferogram stacking.",,,,"0196-2892||1558-0644",,"10.1109/tgrs.2020.2976656","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/419838","en","IEEE",,,"Atmospheric modeling||Atmospheric phase screen (APS)||Differential radar interferometry (D-InSAR)||Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)||Terrestrial radar interferometry (TRI)","Geostatistical Analysis and Mitigation of the Atmospheric Phase Screens in Ku-Band Terrestrial Radar Interferometric Observations of an Alpine Glacier","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-06-11T14:32:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85095755793",,"000583850500003","IEEE Trans.

Comprehensive experiments regarding FFR regeneration were performed in this study with model bacteria to illustrate the decontamination performance of the regeneration processes. The results showed that it is dangerous to use a contaminated FFR without any microbe inactivation treatment because the bacteria can live for more than 8 h. The filtration efficiency and surface electrostatic potential of 75% ethanol-treated FFRs were significantly reduced, and a most penetrating particle size of 200 nm was observed. Steam and microwave irradiation (MWI) showed promising decontamination performances, achieving 100% inactivation in 90 and 30 min, respectively. The filtration efficiencies of steam-treated FFRs for 50 and 100 nm particles decreased from 98.86% and 99.51% to 97.58% and 98.79%, respectively. Ultraviolet irradiation (UVI) effectively inactivated the surface bacteria with a short treatment of 5 min and did not affect the filtration performance. However, the UV dose reaching different layers of the FFP2 mask sample gradually decreased from the outermost layer to the innermost layer, while the model bacteria on the second and third layers could not be killed completely. UVI+MWI and steam were recommended to effectively decontaminate the used respirators and still maintain the respirators’ filtration efficiency. The present work provides a comprehensive evaluation for FFR regeneration in terms of the filtration efficiencies for 50–500 nm particles, the electrostatic properties, mechanical properties, and decontamination effects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000444642",,"1936-0851||1936-086X",,"10.1021/acsnano.0c04782","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444642","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","COVID-19||nanoparticles||mask regeneration||filtration performance||charge decay","Evaluation of Regeneration Processes for Filtering Facepiece Respirators in Terms of the Bacteria Inactivation Efficiency and Influences on Filtration Performance","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-05T16:52:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85094983074",,"000586793400069","ACS Nano","10","ACS Nano","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Production of some fluoropolymers is intimately linked to the use and emissions of legacy and novel PFAS as polymer processing aids. There are serious concerns regarding the toxicity and adverse effects of fluorinated processing aids on humans and the environment. A variety of other PFAS, including monomers and oligomers, are emitted during the production, processing, use, and end-of-life treatment of fluoropolymers. There are further concerns regarding the safe disposal of fluoropolymers and their associated products and articles at the end of their life cycle. While recycling and reuse of fluoropolymers is performed on some industrial waste, there are only limited options for their recycling from consumer articles. The evidence reviewed in this analysis does not find a scientific rationale for concluding that fluoropolymers are of low concern for environmental and human health.

Over the last decades, space heating loads have decreased in modern buildings, and domestic hot water (DHW) is now oftentimes the largest energy consumer in the household. We developed the WaterHub modeling framework to assess the potential of technologies or measures targeting DHW energy demand. The framework combines process-based technological models and stochastic water demand modeling in a modular way to allow for holistic simulations of complex DHW systems. In two rigorous tests of the modeling framework, we demonstrated the importance of water consumption dynamics in the modeling of DHW systems, showing that static modeling leads to underestimated heat losses and wrong energy consumption predictions. In an exemplary case study, we identified and quantified the synergistic interactions between water boiler temperatures and a drain water heat recovery device, demonstrating the strength of this methodology for optimizing strategies targeting DHW systems. With its modular structure, this open-source modeling framework can be extended to include any DHW-related technology, providing a useful common platform for collaboration between technology developers and water experts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429619",,"0378-7788||1872-6178",,"10.1016/j.enbuild.2020.110262","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429619","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Water-energy nexus||Modelica||Domestic hot water systems","Modeling the water-energy nexus in households","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-08-03T02:50:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85088662461",,"000573587500001","Energy build.",,"Energy and Buildings","225","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Here, we show that, after accounting for the limited environmental information available to microorganisms, optimal foraging theory and, in particular, patch use theory also applies to the behavior of marine bacteria in particle seascapes. Combining modeling and experiments, we find that the marine bacterium Vibrio ordalii optimizes nutrient uptake by rapidly switching between attached and planktonic lifestyles, departing particles when their nutrient concentration is more than hundredfold higher than background. In accordance with predictions from patch use theory, single-cell tracking reveals that bacteria spend less time on nutrient-poor particles and on particles within environments that are rich or in which the travel time between particles is smaller, indicating that bacteria tune the nutrient concentration at detachment to increase their fitness. A mathematical model shows that the observed behavioral switching between exploitation and dispersal is consistent with foraging optimality under limited information, namely, the ability to assess the harvest rate of nutrients leaking from particles by molecular diffusion. This work demonstrates how fundamental principles in behavioral ecology traditionally applied to animals can hold right down to the scale of microorganisms and highlights the exquisite adaptations of marine bacterial foraging. The present study thus provides a blueprint for a mechanistic understanding of bacterial uptake of dissolved organic matter and bacterial production in the ocean—processes that are fundamental to the global carbon cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000448046",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2012443117","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448046","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","patch use theory||Vibrio sp.||motility||biofilm||cyclic di-GMP","Constrained optimal foraging by marine bacterioplankton on particulate organic matter","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-27T00:30:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85092902625",,"000579507500004","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","41","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","117","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Here, we review experimental and theoretical advances to argue that networks of trophic interactions, in which the metabolic excretions of one species are the primary resource for another, constitute the central drivers of microbial community assembly. Trophic interactions emerge from the deconstruction of complex forms of organic matter into a wealth of smaller metabolic intermediates, some of which are released to the environment and serve as a nutritional buffet for the community. The structure of the emergent trophic network and the rate at which primary resources are supplied control many features of microbial community assembly, including the relative contributions of competition and cooperation and the emergence of alternative community states. Viewing microbial community assembly through the lens of trophic interactions also has important implications for the spatial dynamics of communities as well as the functional redundancy of taxonomic groups. Given the ubiquity of trophic interactions across environments, they impart a common logic that can enable the development of a more quantitative and predictive microbial community ecology. What are the principles that underlie the assembly and succession of dynamic and complex microbial communities? In this Review, Gralka et al. lay out a conceptual framework to understand this issue, arguing that networks of trophic interactions constitute the central drivers of microbial community assembly.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000444972",,"0960-9822||1879-0445",,"10.1016/j.cub.2020.08.007","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444972","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Trophic Interactions and the Drivers of Microbial Community Assembly","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-08T02:51:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85091773939",,"000579845200035","Curr Biol","19","Current Biology","30","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Thereby, focusing on cities is especially important because of today's large share of the global population living in cities and because local authorities are close to the needs of their residents. However, devising targeted and effective policy measures implies a thorough understanding of prevailing consumption patterns and associated environmental consequences. The goal of this article is to investigate and compare household behaviours and lifestyle-induced carbon footprints in Sydney and Melbourne in order to enhance today's understanding of household consumption in cities of a high-income, high-emission country. For this purpose, we employed a two-stage clustering approach with a Self-Organising Map and a subsequent Ward-clustering. This allowed for including expenditure data along with socio-economic attributes and thus for recognising lifestyle-archetypes. These emerging archetypes represent households with similar characteristics and comparable consumption patterns. Analysing the archetypes in detail and performing a city-comparison based on multi-dimensional scaling revealed similarities and dissimilarities between the two metropoles. 'Older' archetypes seem to behave more alike across cities but show different carbon footprints emphasising the importance of regionalised environmental assessments and of city-specific supply chains. Distinct patterns especially emerged in the high- and low-income segments highlighting the different importance of different lifestyles in each city. Socio-economically similar family-archetypes were found in both cities, but some of them showed diverging consumption behaviours. This article showed that studying household-induced environmental impacts in cities should not rely on macro-trends but should rather be based on city-specific analyses that capture local peculiarities and consider socio-economic characteristics and consumption data simultaneously.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000447486",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/abb502","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/447486","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","household consumption||carbon footprint||data mining||input-output life cycle assessment||urban households","A two-stage clustering approach to investigate lifestyle carbon footprints in two Australian cities","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-23T09:49:55Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"000581515800001","Environ.

First, GRMs were labeled with lead and immersed into epoxy resin. Composites were produced by adding hardener and curing.  Results from EDX-SEM (energy-dispersive X-ray-scanning electron microscopy) mapping and Raman spectroscopy mapping showed exposed GRMs on the surface of the abraded powders.  In the first approach, we identified the released exposed GRM fraction by measuring the amount of detached lead ions from lead-labeled GRMs using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). In the second approach, we employed Raman spectroscopy mapping as a semi quantitative method to assess the released exposed GRM fraction via determining the GRM surface coverage in the abraded powders. The results from the Raman intensity ratio maps are similar to those of the ICP-OES technique. The fractions of released exposed GRMs ranged from 18% to 92% depending on the type of GNP.

GNP was homogeneously dispersed into the epoxy matrix using a solvent-free three-roll milling process, while DOPO was incorporated into the epoxy resin by mechanical stirring at elevated temperature. The incorporation of DOPO reduced the crosslinking density of the epoxy resin. When using polyetheramine as a hardener, the structural rigidity effect of DOPO overshadowed the crosslinking effect and governed the flexural moduli of epoxy/DOPO resins. The flexural moduli of the nanocomposites were improved by adding GNP up to 5 wt % and DOPO up to 30 wt %, whereas the flexural strengths deteriorated when the GNP and DOPO loading were higher than 1 wt % and 10 wt %, respectively. Limited by the adverse effects on mechanical property, the loading combinations of GNP and DOPO within the range of 0–1 wt % and 0–10 wt %, respectively, in epoxy resin were further studied. Flame retardancy index (FRI), which depended on three parameters obtained from cone calorimetry, was considered to evaluate the flame retardancy of the epoxy composites. DOPO showed better performance than GNP as the flame retardant additive, while combining DOPO and GNP could further improve FRI to some extent. With the combination of 0.5 wt % GNP and 10 wt % DOPO, improvement in both mechanical properties and flame retardant efficiency of the nanocomposite was observed. Such a combination did not affect the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposites since the percolation threshold was at 1.6 wt % GNP.

These options are often independent of sewers, water, and energy and therefore promise to be more appropriate for fast-growing urban areas. They also allow for resource recovery and and are adaptable to changing environmental and demographic conditions what makes them more sustainable. More options, however, also enhance planning complexity. Structured decision making (SDM) can help balance opposing interests. Yet, most of the current research focuses on the selection of a preferred option, assuming that a set of appropriate options is available. There is a lack of reproducible methods for the identification of sanitation system planning options that can consider the growing number of available technology and the many possible system configurations. Additionally, there is a lack of data, particularly for novel options, to evaluate the various sustainability criteria for sanitation.To overcome this limitation, we present a novel software supported approach: the SANitation sysTem Alternative GeneratOr (Santiago). To be optimally effective, Santiago is required to be integrated into an SDM approach. In this paper, we present all the elements that such an integration requires and illustrate these methods at the case of Arba Minch, a fast growing town in Ethiopia. Based on this example and experiences from other cases, we discuss the lessons learnt and present the advantages potentially brought by Santiago for sanitation planning The integration requires four elements: a set of technologies to be looked at, decision objectives for sustainable sanitation, screening criteria to evalute technology appropriateness, and about the technologies and the casea. The main output is a set of sanitation system options that is locally appropriate, diverse in order to reveal trade-offs, and of a manageable size. To support the definition of decision objectives, we developed a generic objective hierarchy for sustainable sanitation. Because one of the main challenges lies in the quantification of screening criteria, we established the data for 27 criteria and 41 technologies in a library.The case studies showed, that if the integration is successful, then Santiago can provide substantial benefits: (i) it is systematic and reproducible; (ii) it opens up the decision space with novel and potentially more appropriate solutions; (iii) it makes international data accessible for more empirical decision making; (iv) it enables decisions based on strategic objectives in line with the sustainable development goals; (v) it allows to prioritise appropriate and resource efficient systems right from the beginning (vi) and it contributes to a more citywide inclusive approach by bridging strategic objectives with an area-based appropriateness assessment. The here presented approach enables the prioritisation of appropriate and resource efficient sanitation technologies and systems in strategic planning. Thereby this approach contributes to SDG 6.2, 6.3, and 11, sustainable sanitation for all.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000428109",,"0301-4797||1095-8630",,"10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111004","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/428109","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Strategic sanitation planning||Appropriate technologies||Sustainable sanitation||Structured decision making||Citywide inclusive sanitation","Developing sanitation planning options: A tool for systematic consideration of novel technologies and systems","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-23T05:45:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85087941042",,"000558812000064","J. environ. manag.",,"Journal of Environmental Management","271","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Mitigating its environmental burdens relies on quantifying them globally, on a high resolution. Here, with an unprecedented combination of detail and coverage, the Rankine cycle was individually modelled for >21 000 geocoded steam-electric generating units globally. Accounting for different cooling systems and fuels enabled the calculation of three major environmental stressors on a generating unit level. Geographical, chronological, and technological patterns are examined, as are trade-offs and improvement scenarios. Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from young (>2000) Chinese coal-fuelled generating units are equal to the sum of GHG emissions from all steam-electric power plants of all ages in the U.S. and Europe, and occupy 5% of all GHG emissions from the entire global economy. Twenty-four per cent of freshwater consumed from steam-electric power originates from nuclear power units from the 1970s/1980s, mainly in the U.S. and Europe. One per cent of steam-electric generating units is responsible for 50% of global heat emissions to freshwater. The median carbon intensity of Indian coal-fired units (>= 50 MW) is 7%-16% higher than that in any other region globally. As concerns GHGs, technology-related efficiency differences (Rankine cycle, cooling system) play a small role compared to the fuel, which dominates the carbon intensity (GHGs/GJ el.). With the highest shares of cogeneration, 1 GJ electricity from tower-cooled coal units in Russia consumes on average 8%-49% less freshwater compared to respective units globally. There is a small margin for improvement based on alternative steam-electric technologies: retiring inefficient units and replacing their demand by ramping up more efficient ones with the same fuel, within the same country results in, respectively, similar to 1%, 6%, and 11% fewer GHG emissions, freshwater consumption, and heat emissions globally. The full environmental benefits of completely retiring old units (<1970) consist of 9% fewer GHG emissions, 7% less freshwater consumed, and 18% fewer thermal emissions globally.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000446704",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aba6ac","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446704","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","electricity generation||global analysis||environmental impacts||trade-offs||scenario assessment||energy-water nexus||carbon footprint","The greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and heat emissions of global steam-electric power production: a generating unit level analysis and database","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-20T04:47:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85090202354",,"000575559400001","Environ.

The retrieved cloud information intends to improve the atmospheric trace gas products based on the Environment Monitoring Instrument (EMI) spectrometer. The HECORA method builds on OMCLDO2 and presents some evolutions. The Vector Linearized Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (VLIDORT) model has been used to produce the Top of the Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance Look-up Tables (LUT) as a function of the cloud fraction and cloud pressure. Applying the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique to the synthetic reflectance LUT, the reflectance spectra can be associated with O2-O2 geometrical vertical column densities (VCDgeo) and continuum reflectance. This is the core of the retrieval method, since there is a one-to-one relationship between O2-O2 VCDgeo and continuum reflectance, on the one hand, and effective cloud fraction and effective cloud pressure, on the other hand, for a given illumination and observing geometry and given surface height and surface albedo. We first used the VLIDORT synthetic spectra to verify the HECORA algorithm and obtained good results in both the Lambertian cloud model and the scattering cloud model. Secondly, HECORA is applied to OMI and TROPOMI and compared with OMCLDO2, FRESCO+, and OCRA/ROCINN cloud products. Later, the cloud pressure results from TROPOMI observations obtained using HECORA and FRESCO+ are compared with the CALIOP Cloud Layer product. HECORA is closer to the CALIOP results under low cloud conditions, while FRESCO+ is closer to high clouds due to the higher sensitivity of the O2 A-band to cloud vertical information. Finally, HECORA is applied to the TROPOMI NO2 retrieval. Validation of the tropospheric NO2 VCD with ground-based MAX-DOAS measurements shows that choosing HECORA cloud products to correct for photon path variations on the TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 VCD retrievals has better performance than using FRESCO+ under low cloud conditions. In conclusion, this paper shows that the HECORA cloud products are in good agreement with the well-established cloud products and that they are suitable for correcting the effect of cloud in trace gas retrievals. Therefore, HECORA has the potential to be applied to EMI.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000524049",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs12183039","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524049","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","cloud fraction||cloud pressure||EMI||TROPOMI||DOAS","Development and Application of HECORA Cloud Retrieval Algorithm Based On the O2-O2 477 nm Absorption Band","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-08T15:45:12Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Remote Sens.","18","Remote Sensing","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Commonly used products, such as rain gauges, rain gauge networks, and weather radar, differ in their information content regarding intensities, spatial variability, and natural climatic variability, therefore producing different estimates. Landscape evolution models (LEMs) simulate the geomorphic changes in landscapes, and current models can simulate timeframes from event level to millions of years and some use rainfall inputs to drive them. However, the impact of different rainfall products on LEM outputs has never been considered. This study uses the STREAP rainfall generator, calibrated using commonly used rainfall observation products, to produce longer rainfall records than the observations to drive the CAESAR‐Lisflood LEM to examine how differences in rainfall products affect simulated landscapes. The results show that the simulation of changes to basin geomorphology is sensitive to the differences between rainfall products, with these differences expressed linearly in discharges but non‐linearly in sediment yields. Furthermore, when applied over a 1500‐year period, large differences in the simulated long profiles were observed, with the simulations producing greater sediment yields showing erosion extending further downstream. This suggests that the choice of rainfall product to drive LEMs has a large impact on the final simulated landscapes. The combination of rainfall generator model and LEMs represents a potentially powerful method for assessing the impacts of rainfall product differences on landscapes and their short‐ and long‐term evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000424332",,"0197-9337||1096-9837",,"10.1002/esp.4894","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424332","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Landscape evolution||Weather generator||Numerical modelling||Rainfall||Uncertainty","The impact of different rainfall products on landscape modelling simulations","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-03T19:10:09Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85087215963",,"000540887800001","Earth Surf Process Landforms","11","Earth Surface Processes and Landforms","45","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We used PhenoChip to expose single cells of the coral symbiont Symbiodinium to thermal and chemical treatments and monitor single-cell photophysiology via chlorophyll fluorometry. This revealed strain-specific thermal sensitivity thresholds and distinct pH optima for photosynthetic performance, and permitted the identification of single cells with elevated resilience toward rising temperature. Optical expulsion technology was used to collect single cells from PhenoChip, and their propagation revealed indications of transgenerational preservation of photosynthetic phenotypes.

This thesis investigates illegal alluvial mining-related risks and impacts in the Pra basin of Ghana using a spatially distributed GIS-based approach. Land use, river and geomorphol-ogy and environmental pollution were investigated using exclusively public data. Land use was assessed based on Sentinel-2 imagery from Dec. 2018 - Jan. 2020. Iso Cluster Unsupervised Classification in ArcGIS was conducted using a Modified Normalized Di˙erence Water Index (MNDWI)-based image stack to optimally detect mines. In total, 0.95% of the basin are cov-ered in open mining pits, resulting in approx. 2% of the basin if mining-related bareland is additionally considered. The proposed detection method showed high eÿciency compared to supervised classification, and an overall accuracy of 91.2%. River and geomorphological im-pacts of mining were assessed using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), channel stream power based on mean discharge and slope, as well as actual landscape and riverbed eleva-tion change derived from a DEM of Di˙erence between 2000 and 2015. USLE predicted low rates of erosion across the basin, but was shown to be an insuÿcient tool to model the dom-inant processes of gully and channel erosion which are exacerbated by alluvial mining. Mean landscape elevation change in the basin over 15 years was -0.87 m, with mining areas experi-encing a significantly elevated mean loss of -3.96 m in this period. All main channels showed significant erosion, with the largest riverbed elevation change taking place in the Lower Pra reach. Stream power indicated concordant behaviour, but requires further on-site verification before it can be used as an indicator. Environmental pollution was assessed in a structured literature review that identified over 2400 heavy metal concentration datapoints of 12 di˙er-ent metals in 168 locations and all environmental compartments with exception of ambient air. 36% of datapoints exceeded WHO recommended limits for the respective environmental compartment. Widespread heavy metal pollution was evident throughout the basin even in locations far away from mining sites, despite no or minimal other anthropogenic and geogenic sources in the basin. Groundwater was found to be heavily polluted with mercury, with 82.1%of measurements exceeding WHO recommended limits. Risk predictions were made based on existing surface water abstraction points in the basin using Pearson Correlation Analysis. Various potential predictors of pollution were investigated. Upstream fraction of mining land use and local channel slope were identified as the only significant predictors of pollution risk. Pollution pathway tracing was conducted to better understand the mechanisms of pollution transport throughout the basin. The analysis was conducted using results from the environ-mental pollution survey, additional literature review, a specifically developed pollutant routing algorithm, and 2D floodplain analysis. Overall, river-driven processes including contamination via floodplain inundation and aquifer recharge from polluted surface waters were shown to be the dominant pollution transfer processes in the basin, thereby providing a foundation for targeted future research and remediation strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000468482",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468482","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Mining||Risk assessment||Environmental stress||Ghana","Developing an integrated methodology for assessing risk and impact of illegal alluvial mining-related environmental stressors in the Pra river basin, Ghana.","Master Thesis","Open access",,,,"2021-02-09T08:10:04Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This paper presents a study in a typical county in the North China Plain. It discusses the application and challenges of an indirect, energy-based approach to groundwater abstraction monitoring. Intensive field experiments at individual wells were carried out to provide a basis for the conversion from electric energy consumption to groundwater abstraction and to explore the feasibility of direct and indirect abstraction monitoring methods in the study area. The results show that the main challenge of electricity-to-water conversion lies in the large spread of conversion factors between wells. The conversion error at an individual well is found to be less than 20%. The same accuracy is achieved on spatially aggregated levels by testing only a small number of wells. Trade-offs can be made to obtain groundwater abstraction estimates at the required accuracy and with reasonable efforts regarding data collection. The analysis shows that energy-based groundwater abstraction monitoring outperforms direct water metering with respect to cost and robustness. It provides satisfactory data accuracy and equitability in regions where irrigation wells are powered by electricity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000442202",,"2073-4441",,"10.3390/w12092477","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/442202","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Groundwater management||Indirect monitoring||Electricity-groundwater nexus||Irrigation","How to Meter Agricultural Pumping at Numerous Small-Scale Wells?-An Indirect Monitoring Method Using Electric Energy as Proxy","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-24T06:20:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85090980914",,"000580301800001",,"9","Water","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

It is important to create accurate flood maps to plan (offline) and conduct (real-time) flood mitigation and flood rescue operations. Arguably, images collected from social media can provide useful information for that task, which would otherwise be unavailable. We introduce a computer vision system that estimates water depth from social media images taken during flooding events, in order to build flood maps in (near) real-time. We propose a multi-task (deep) learning approach, where a model is trained using both a regression and a pairwise ranking loss. Our approach is motivated by the observation that a main bottleneck for image-based flood level estimation is training data: it is difficult and requires a lot of effort to annotate uncontrolled images with the correct water depth. We demonstrate how to efficiently learn a predictor from a small set of annotated water levels and a larger set of weaker annotations that only indicate in which of two images the water level is higher, and are much easier to obtain. Moreover, we provide a new dataset, named DEEPFLOOD, with 8145 annotated ground-level images, and show that the proposed multi-task approach can predict the water level from a single, crowd-sourced image with ≈11 cm root mean square error.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000432187",,"0924-2716",,"10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.07.003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432187","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Object detection||Deep learning||Image segmentation||Flood estimation||Learning to rank||Flood detection","Water level prediction from social media images with a multi-task ranking approach","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-08-21T03:18:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85089367305",,"000561346200018","ISPRS j. photogramm. remote sens.",,"ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","167","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Comparing the relationship of actual and potential evapotranspiration across the region, diﬀerences be-tween cocoa producing countries are found and discussed, aﬃrming that cocoa producing regions in Ghana and Nigeria are the most restricted by water availability. Further, us-ing a machine learning approach (Maxent) the optimal climatic conditions for successful cultivation are determined and used in a model to assess climatic suitability. It is shown, that the precipitation during the driest month of the year is the most speciﬁc predictor of production suitability. The model overall predicts the area suitable for cocoa production with high accuracy (AUC = 0.983). Applying the model to climatic data from past years the average suitability is calculated for every county and year. Comparing its yearly vari-ability with reported yield commonalities are observed, but farming practices are found to aﬀect the recorded yield more signiﬁcantly. Further, the suitability time series shows large areas in Nigeria, Liberia and along the northern borders of the cocoa producing area being vulnerable to prolonged poor weather conditions.

To stabilize the performance of unattended plants, soft sensors could expose faults and failures to the operator. In a previous study, we developed soft sensors and showed that soft sensors with data from unmaintained physical sensors can be as accurate as soft sensors with data from maintained ones. The monitored variables were pH and dissolved oxygen (DO), and soft sensors were used to predict nitrification performance. In the present study, we use synthetic data and monitor three plants to test these soft sensors. We find that a long solids retention time and a moderate aeration rate improve the pH soft-sensor accuracy and that the aeration regime is the main operational parameter affecting the accuracy of the DO soft sensor. We demonstrate that integrated design of monitoring and control is necessary to achieve robustness when extrapolating from one OST to another in the absence of plant-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, we provide a unique labeled dataset for further feature and data-driven soft-sensor development. Our benchmarking results indicate that it is feasible to monitor OSTs with unmaintained sensors and without plant-specific tuning of the developed soft sensors. This is expected to drastically reduce monitoring costs for OST-based sanitation systems.",,,,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.9b07760","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/439496","en","American Chemical Society",,,,"Benchmarking Soft Sensors for Remote Monitoring of On-Site Wastewater Treatment Plants","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-09-10T05:49:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85090175639",,"000568649900044","Environ.

This new approach revealed that genetically dissimilar sperm can exhibit strikingly similar flagellar waveforms and identifies two dominant flagellar waveforms among the deuterostomes studied here, corresponding to internal and external fertilizers. The phylokinematic tree shows marked discordance from the phylogenetic tree, indicating that physical properties of the fluid environment, more than genetic relatedness, act as an important selective pressure in shaping the evolution of sperm motility.

Intensive fertilization is common to enhance their yields, thus creating negative externalities on water quality that are difficult to evaluate without reliable estimates of nutrient fluxes. We apply a 1-D mechanistic ecosystem model, seamlessly integrating land-surface energy balance, soil hydrology, vegetation dynamics, and soil biogeochemistry aiming at assessing the grassland response to fertilization. We simulate the major water, carbon, nutrient, and energy fluxes of nine grassland plots across the broad European Alpine region. We provide an unprecedent interdisciplinary model evaluation confirming its performance against observed variables from different datasets. Subsequently, we apply the model to test the influence of fertilization practices on grassland yields and nitrate (NO3) losses through leaching. Despite the generally low NO3 concentration in groundwater recharge, the variability across sites is remarkable, mostly, but not exclusively, dictated by elevation. In high-Alpine sites short growing seasons lead to less efficient nitrogen (N) uptake for biomass production. This combined with lower evapotranspiration rates results in higher amounts of drainage and NO3 leaching to groundwater. The local soil hydrology has a crucial role in driving the NO3 use efficiency. The commonly applied fixed-threshold limit on fertilizer N input is suboptimal. We suggest that major hydrological and soil property differences across sites should be considered in the delineation of best practices or regulations for management. Using distributed maps informed with key soil and climatic attributes or systematically implementing integrated ecosystem models as shown here can contribute to achieving more sustainable practices.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000454430",,"1810-6277||1810-6285",,"10.5194/bg-2020-294","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454430","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Impacts of fertilization on grassland productivity and water quality across the European Alps: insights from a mechanistic model","Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2020-12-03T10:24:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268||690268","10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100007352","SBFI||SBFI","H2020||H2020",,,,,,"Biogeosci. discuss.",,"Biogeosciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. The Australian landscape is affected by abandoned mines that pose environmental, public health and safety risks. To promote the beneficial reuse, rehabilitation and/or remediation of these sites and understand their spatial arrangement, we compiled, classified and analysed a country-wide geospatial database of all known inactive hard rock mine sites. Following extensive review and classification of disparate records of such sites that have been terminated, neglected or classified as heritage, plus those under care and maintenance in Australia, we assessed state-by-state reporting and cross-border rehabilitation requirements. This was enabled by the development of the Mining Incidence Documentation & Assessment Scheme (MIDAS) that can be used to catalogue and compare active or inactive mine data regardless of reporting conventions. At a national level, and with four case studies, we performed GIS-based spatial analyses and environmental risk assessments to demonstrate potential uses of our database. Analyses considered the proximity of sites to factors such as infrastructure and sensitive environmental receptors. As Australia struggles to manage the ongoing technical, socioeconomic and environmental challenges of effective mine rehabilitation, the insights enabled by this national-level spatial database may be key to developing coordinated responses that extend beyond state boundaries. Our classification and methodology are easily transferable, thereby encouraging more formalized, systematic and widespread documentation of abandoned mines worldwide.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000443292",,,,"10.3390/MIN10090745","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/443292","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A geospatial database for effective mine rehabilitation in Australia","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-29T03:35:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85091352100",,"000581335000001",,"9","Minerals","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Thermal insulation is by far the largest market for silica aerogels, which are ideal materials when space is limited. One drawback of silica aerogels is their brittleness. Fibre reinforcement and binders can be used to overcome this for large-volume applications in building and industrial insulation5,12, but their poor machinability, combined with the difficulty of precisely casting small objects, limits the miniaturization potential of silica aerogels. Additive manufacturing provides an alternative route to miniaturization, but was “considered not feasible for silica aerogel”13. Here we present a direct ink writing protocol to create miniaturized silica aerogel objects from a slurry of silica aerogel powder in a dilute silica nanoparticle suspension (sol). The inks exhibit shear-thinning behaviour, owing to the high volume fraction of gel particles. As a result, they flow easily through the nozzle during printing, but their viscosity increases rapidly after printing, ensuring that the printed objects retain their shape. After printing, the silica sol is gelled in an ammonia atmosphere to enable subsequent processing into aerogels. The printed aerogel objects are pure silica and retain the high specific surface area (751 square metres per gram) and ultralow thermal conductivity (15.9 milliwatts per metre per kelvin) typical of silica aerogels. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ease with which functional nanoparticles can be incorporated. The printed silica aerogel objects can be used for thermal management, as miniaturized gas pumps and to degrade volatile organic compounds, illustrating the potential of our protocol.",,,,"0028-0836||1476-4687",,"10.1038/s41586-020-2594-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432026","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Additive manufacturing of silica aerogels","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-08-20T06:22:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85089573073",,"000563935100014",,"7821","Nature","584","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Here, water-soluble extracts of PMs collected from four global cities via automobile air-conditioning filters were consecutively injected three times by an amount of 1, 2, and 2 mg into the blood circulation of Wistar rats after filtration by a 0.45 μm pore size membrane. Acute health effects, such as immune and inflammatory responses and hemorrhage in alveoli, were observed right after the PM extraction injection. Significant differences between cities in biomarker tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels were detected following the second and third PM injections. Rats' inflammatory responses varied substantially with the injections of city-specific PMs. Repeated PM extract exposure rendered the rats more vulnerable to subsequent challenges, and downregulation of certain microRNAs was observed in rats. Among the studied miRNAs, miR-125b, and miR-21 were most sensitive to the PM exposure, exhibiting a negative dose-response-type relationship with a source-specific PM (oxidative potential) toxicity (r2 = 0.63 and 0.57; p-values < 0.05).

Specifically, we design surfaces comprising bioinspired, mushroom-like repelling heads and spring-like flexible supports, which are realized by three-dimensional direct laser lithography. The flexible supports elevate liquid repellency by resisting droplet impalement and reducing contact time. This, previously unknown, use of spring-like flexible supports to enhance liquid repellency provides an excellent level of control over droplet manipulation. Moreover, this extends repellent microstructure research from statics to dynamics and is envisioned to yield functionalities and possibilities by linking functional surfaces and mechanical metamaterials.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438558",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.aba9721","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438558","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Liquid repellency enhancement through flexible microstructures","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-04T19:59:54Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85089818917",,"000560452300018","Sci Adv","32","Science Advances","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The question of which source is more influential in shaping the dynamics of solute concentration cannot be easily addressed due to the general lack of input data. An analysis of solute concentrations and their dependence on discharge across 585 catchments in nine countries leads us to hypothesize that both the timing and the vertical distribution of the solute generation are important drivers of solute export dynamics at the catchment scale. We test this hypothesis running synthetic experiments with a tracer‐aided distributed hydrological model. The results reveal that the depth of solute generation is the most important control of the concentration‐discharge (C‐Q) relation for a number of solutes. Such relation shows that C‐Q patterns of solute export vary from dilution (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, and Cl−) to weakly enriching (dissolved organic carbon). The timing of the input imposes a signature on temporal dynamics, most evident for nutrients, and adds uncertainty in the exponent of the C‐Q relation.",,,,"0043-1397||1944-7973",,"10.1029/2019WR026695","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454429","en","Wiley",,,,"Depth of solute generation is a dominant control on concentration-discharge relations","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-12-03T10:21:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,,,,"Water Resour.

Among the main sources of this variability are the spatially distributed nature of overland flow as an erosion driver and of surface erodibility given by soil type and vegetation cover distribution. Temporal variability mainly results from the time sequence of rainfall intensity during storms and snowmelt leading to soil saturation and overland flow. We present a new spatially distributed soil erosion and suspended sediment transport module integrated into the computationally efficient physically based hydrological model TOPKAPI-ETH, with which we investigate the effects of the two erosion drivers - precipitation and surface erodibility - on catchment sediment fluxes in a typical pre-Alpine mesoscale catchment. By conducting a series of numerical experiments, we quantify the impact of spatial variability in the two key erosion drivers on erosion-deposition patterns, sediment delivery ratio, and catchment sediment yields. Main findings are that the spatial variability in erosion drivers affects sediment yield by (i) increasing sediment production due to a spatially variable precipitation, while decreasing it due to a spatially variable surface erodibility, (ii) favouring the clustering of sediment source areas in space by surface runoff generation, and (iii) decreasing their connectivity to the river network by magnifying sediment buffers. The results highlight the importance of resolving spatial gradients controlling hydrology and sediment processes when modelling sediment dynamics at the mesoscale, in order to capture the key effects of sediment sources, buffers, and hillslope hydrological pathways in determining the sediment signal.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000430401",,"2196-632X||2196-6311",,"10.5194/esurf-8-619-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/430401","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Modelling impacts of spatially variable erosion drivers on suspended sediment dynamics","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-08-06T14:05:32Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,"85090680558",,"000551507600002","Earth Surf.

The integration of absorbance analysis in microfluidic chips could significantly reduce the sample consumption and contribute to the system miniaturization. However, the sensitivity and limit of detection (LoD) of analysis in microfluidic chips with conventional configuration need improvements due to the limited optical pathway and unregulated light propagation. In this work, a 3D-microlens-incorporating microfluidic chip (3D-MIMC) with a greatly extended detection channel was innovatively fabricated using two-photon stereolithography. The fabrication was optimized with a proposed hierarchical modular printing strategy. Due to the incorporation of 3D microlenses, the light coupling efficiency and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were respectively improved approximately 9 and 4 times. An equivalent optical path length (EOL) of 62.9 mm was achieved in a 3.7 μl detection channel for testing tartrazine samples. As a result, the sensitivity and LoD of the 3D-MIMC assay were correspondingly improved by one order of magnitude, compared with those of the 96-well plate assay. Notably, the 3D-MIMC has the potential to be integrated into a general microanalysis platform for multiple applications.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000416283",,"1473-0197||1473-0189",,"10.1039/d0lc00235f","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/416283","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","3D microlens||Microfluidic chip||Two-photon stereolithography||Absorbance measurement","Self-aligned 3D microlenses in a chip fabricated with two-photon stereolithography for highly sensitive absorbance measurement","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-05-22T08:04:41Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85087434456",,"000545864300005","Lab chip","13","Lab on a Chip","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In this paper we review various grouping strategies that could be used to inform actions on these chemicals and outline the motivations, advantages and disadvantages for each. Grouping strategies are subdivided into (1) those based on the intrinsic properties of the PFAS (e.g.persistence, bioaccumulation potential, toxicity, mobility, molecular size) and (2) those that inform risk assessment through estimation of cumulative exposure and/or effects. The most precautionary grouping approach of those reviewed within this article suggests phasing out PFAS based on their high persistence alone (the so-called ""P-sufficient"" approach). The least precautionary grouping approach reviewed advocates only grouping PFAS for risk assessment that have the same toxicological effects, modes and mechanisms of action, and elimination kinetics, which would need to be well documented across different PFAS. It is recognised that, given jurisdictional differences in chemical assessment philosophies and methodologies, no one strategy will be generally acceptable. The guiding question we apply to the reviewed grouping strategies is: grouping for what purpose? The motivation behind the grouping (e.g.determining use in productsvs.setting guideline levels for contaminated environments) may lead to different grouping decisions. This assessment provides the necessary context for grouping strategies such that they can be adopted as they are, or built on further, to protect human and environmental health from potential PFAS-related effects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429995",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/d0em00147c","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429995","en","RSC Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Strategies for grouping per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to protect human and environmental health","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2020-08-05T02:46:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85088043565",,"000551295200001","Environ Sci Process Impacts","7","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

When blooms collapse, dead cells settle and aggregate into “marine snow” particles, resulting in a large and climatically important vertical flux of carbon from the ocean surface to its depth, a process known as the “biological pump.” To date, the formation of marine snow has been modeled as coagulation between spherical particles driven by gravitational settling and turbulent mixing, characterized by coagulation dynamics that converge onto time-independent concentrations of aggregates. However, many phytoplankton species are elongated and how their rodlike shape affects the aggregation process has remained unknown. Here, we study marine snow formation in a quiescent fluid assuming the constituent particles are elongated and form bundles upon encounter. We derive the collision kernel between dissimilar rods settling under gravity and discover that the most frequent collisions occur between the thinnest and thickest bundles, rather than between bundles of similar size. As a consequence, in the full coagulation model that combines exponential growth with settling, the thin-thick coupling can lead to statistically stationary states where the concentrations of aggregates of different size oscillate in time, exhibiting periodic bursts. The bursts are predicted to occur on the scale of a week and eventually lead to broadening of aggregate size spectra and may thus be highly relevant for plankton dynamics and the carbon cycle in the ocean.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000425357",,"0031-9007||1079-7114",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.258001","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/425357","en","American Physical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Bursts Characterize Coagulation of Rods in a Quiescent Fluid","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-09T05:06:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,"The effect of high-frequency nutrient fluctuations on bacterial growth","176189","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85087722620",,"000542522800011","Phys.

Batch treatment with each technology demonstrated an ability to remove ≥95% DOC. Ozone demonstrated a reaction selectivity through increased reaction rates with larger compounds and color-contributing compounds. Electrolysis and GAC demonstrated generally less-selective reactivity. Adding post-treatments to full-scale systems reduced DOC (55–91%), AOC (34–62%), and color (75–98%), without significant reaction selectivity. These reductions in DOC and AOC were not linked to reduction of bacterial concentrations in treated water. Reductions in bacterial concentrations were observed with ozone and electrolysis, but this is credited to oxidation chemicals produced in these systems and not the removal or transformations of organic materials.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000405331",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137489","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/405331","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biologically activated membrane bioreactor (BAMBi)||Decentralized||Greywater||Electrolysis||Granular activated carbon (GAC)","Linking transformations of organic carbon to post-treatment performance in a biological water recycling system","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-03-17T02:29:47Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85081118402",,"000535900200020","Sci.

Among the most rapid and dramatic changes are retrogressive thaw slumps. These slumps evolve by a retreat of the slump headwall during the summer months, making them detectable by comparing digital elevation models over time using the volumetric change as an indicator. Despite the availability of many topographic InSAR observations to generate digital elevation models, there is currently no method to map and analyze retrogressive thaw slumps.  Here, we present and assess a method to detect and monitor thaw slumps using time-series of elevation models (DEMs), generated from single-pass InSAR observations, which have been acquired across the Arctic at high resolution since 2011 by the TanDEM-X satellite pair.  At least three observations over this timespan are available with a spatial resolution of about 12 meter and the height sensitivity of 0.5-2 meter. We first difference the generated digital elevation and detect significant elevation changes taking the uncertainty estimates of each elevation measurement into account. In the implementation of the processing chain we focused on making it as automated as much as possible to be able to cover large areas of the northern hemisphere. This includes detecting common problems with the data and apply appropriate algorithms to obtain DEMs with high accuracy. Additionally we implemented methods to deal with problematic features like wet-snow, vegetation and water bodies. After generating the DEMs we us DEM differencing followed by a blob detection and cluster algorithm to detect active thaw slumps. To improve the accuracy of our method we apply and compare different machine learning methods, namely a simple threshold method, a Random Forest and a Support-Vector-Machine. To estimate the accuracy of our method we use data from past studies as well as a classification based on optical satellite data. The obtained locations of thaw slumps can be used as a starting point to extract important slump properties, like the headwall height and volumetric change, which are currently not available on regional scales. Additionally to the thaw slump detection, we show first results of the thaw slump property extraction for thaw slumps located in Northern Canada (Peel Plateau, Mackenzie River Delta, Banks Island, Ellesmere Island).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000453189",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-6965","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453189","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Monitoring rapid permafrost thaw using elevation models generated from satellite radar interferometry","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2020-11-26T09:35:30Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2020","May 4-8, 2020","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

These demonstrated state-of-the-art capabilities in obtaining high spatial resolution space-based gravimetry, and helped to improve understanding of mantle rheology, potentially even providing a route to developing early warning capabilities for future seismic events. We describe a new mission concept, GRAvity observations by Vertical Laser ranging (GRAVL), which aims to extend the earthquake detection limit down to magnitude 6.5 Mw, significantly increasing the number of observable events.  GRAVL directly measures the radial component of the acceleration vector via “high-low” inter-satellite laser ranging, increasing gravity field sensitivity. A constellation of Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites act as test masses, equipped with reflectors and high precision accelerometers to account for non-gravitational forces. Two or more larger satellites are placed above these, in Geostationary or Medium Earth Orbit (GEO / MEO), and measure the distance to the LEO satellites via time-of-flight measurement of a laser pulse. To do this, the GEO/MEO spacecraft are each equipped with a laser, telescope and detector, and additionally require highly  accurate timing systems to enable ranging accuracy down to sub-micron precision. To detect co-seismic mass redistribution events of the desired magnitude, we determine a gravity field measurement requirement of order 0.1 µGal at a spatial resolution of approximately 100 km over a 3-day revisit interval. These are challenging requirements, and we will discuss possible approaches to achieving them.  The GRAVL mission concept was developed during the FFG/ESA Alpbach Summer School 2019 by a team of science and engineering students, and further refined using the Concurrent Engineering approach during the Post-Alpbach Summer School Event at ESA Academy's Training and Learning Facility at ESEC-Galaxia in Belgium.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000452168",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-8304","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/452168","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"GRAVL: a new satellite mission concept aiming to detect earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.5 Mw and higher","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2020-11-20T09:42:34Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2020","May 4-8, 2020","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The variability of local consumption patterns and associated environmental impacts needs to be quantified as an important starting point to devise targeted measures aimed at reducing household environmental footprints. The goal of this article is the development and appraisal of a comprehensive regionalized bottom‐up model that assesses realistic environmental profiles for individual households in a specific region. For this purpose, a physically based building energy model, the results of an agent‐based transport simulation, and a data‐driven household consumption model were interlinked within a new probability‐based classification framework and applied to the case of Switzerland. The resulting model predicts the demands in about 400 different consumption areas for each Swiss household by considering its particular circumstances and produces a realistic picture of variability in household environmental footprints. An analysis of the model results on a municipal level reveals per‐capita income, population density, buildings' age, and household structure as possible drivers of municipal carbon footprints. While higher‐emission municipalities are located in rural areas and tend to show higher shares of older buildings, lower‐emission communities have larger proportions of families and can be found in highly populated regions by trend. However, the opposing effects of various variables observed in this analysis confirm the importance of a model that is able to capture regional distinctions. The overall model constitutes a comprehensive information base supporting policymakers in understanding consumption patterns in their region and deriving environmental strategies tailored to their specific population.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000382428",,"1088-1980||1530-9290",,"10.1111/jiec.12969","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/382428","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","data mining||household consumption||industrial ecology||large-scale bottom-up model||machine learning||spatial analysis","Machine learning based modeling of households: A regionalized bottom-up approach to investigate consumption-induced environmental impacts","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-04T03:42:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85075452942",,"000498217600001","J. ind. ecol.","3","Journal of Industrial Ecology","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

One approach uses the metaphor of a “handprint,” complementing the notion of environmental footprints, which have been widely adopted for impact measurement and accounting. We analyze this idea by establishing core principles of handprint thinking: Handprint encourages actions with positive impacts and connects to analyses of footprint reductions but adds value to them and addresses the issue of what action should be taken. We also identify five key questions that need to be addressed and decisions that need to be made in performing a (potentially quantitative) handprint assessment, related to scoping of the improvement to be made, how it is achieved, and how credit is assigned, taking into account constraints on action. A case study of the potential water footprint reduction of an average Finn demonstrates how handprint thinking can be a natural extension of footprint reduction analyses. We find that there is a diversity of possible handprint assessments that have the potential to encourage doing good. Their common foundation is “handprint thinking.”","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000424394",,"2328-4277",,"10.1029/2019EF001422","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424394","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Giving Legs to Handprint Thinking: Foundations for Evaluating the Good We Do","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-04T03:01:54Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85087070413",,"000545702400004",,"6","Earth's Future","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This may inhibit progress at the intersection of climate change and trade and could present a serious constraint for global climate action. One key risk is carbon leakage through emission outsourcing, i.e. reductions in emissions in countries with rigorous climate policies being offset by increased emissions in countries with less stringent policies. We first analyze the Paris Agreement's nationally determined contributions (NDC) and investigate how carbon leakage is addressed. We find that the risk of carbon leakage is insufficiently accounted for in these documents. Then, we apply a novel quantitative approach (Jiborn et al.,2018; Baumert et al.,2019) to analyze trends in carbon outsourcing related to a previous international climate regime-the Kyoto Protocol-in order to assess whether reported emission reductions were offset by carbon outsourcing in the past. Our results for 2000-2014 show a more nuanced picture of carbon leakage during the Kyoto Protocol than previous studies have reported. Carbon outsourcing from developed to developing countries was dominated by the USA outsourcing to China, while the evidence for other developed countries was mixed. Against conventional wisdom, we find that, in general, countries that stayed committed to their Kyoto Protocol emission targets were either only minor carbon outsourcers or actually even insourcers-although the trend was slightly negative-indicating that binding emissions targets do not necessarily lead to carbon outsourcing. We argue that multiple carbon monitoring approaches are needed to reduce the risk of carbon leakage.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000443791",,"1567-9764||1573-1553",,"10.1007/s10784-020-09507-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/443791","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Carbon leakage||Paris agreement||Kyoto protocol||Emission outsourcing||Climate policy||Carbon monitoring","The risk of carbon leakage in global climate agreements","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-01T07:13:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85091103629",,"000570023600001",,"2","International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Reliable laboratory diagnosis of the disease has been one of the foremost priorities for promoting public health interventions. The routinely used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the reference method for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, it also reported a number of false-positive or -negative cases, especially in the early stages of the novel virus outbreak. In this work, a dual-functional plasmonic biosensor combining the plasmonic photothermal (PPT) effect and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensing transduction provides an alternative and promising solution for the clinical COVID-19 diagnosis. The two-dimensional gold nanoislands (AuNIs) functionalized with complementary DNA receptors can perform a sensitive detection of the selected sequences from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through nucleic acid hybridization. For better sensing performance, the thermoplasmonic heat is generated on the same AuNIs chip when illuminated at their plasmonic resonance frequency. The localized PPT heat is capable to elevate the in situ hybridization temperature and facilitate the accurate discrimination of two similar gene sequences. Our dual-functional LSPR biosensor exhibits a high sensitivity toward the selected SARS-CoV-2 sequences with a lower detection limit down to the concentration of 0.22 pM and allows precise detection of the specific target in a multigene mixture. This study gains insight into the thermoplasmonic enhancement and its applicability in the nucleic acid tests and viral disease diagnosis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000409414",,"1936-0851||1936-086X",,"10.1021/acsnano.0c02439","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/409414","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","plasmonic photothermal effect||severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2||coronavirus disease||LSPR||biosensors||nuclei acids||RNA virus","Dual-Functional Plasmonic Photothermal Biosensors for Highly Accurate Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Detection","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-04-14T07:29:46Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85083419257",,"000537682300015","ACS Nano","5","ACS Nano","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Moreover, GRMs have been studied and applied as fillers in polymer composite manufacturing to enhance the polymer performance. With the foreseen growth in GRM production, occupational and consumer exposure is inevitable, thus raising concerns for potential health risks. Therefore, this study aims (1) to characterize aerosol particles released after mechanical abrasion on GRM-reinforced epoxy composites, (2) to quantify the amounts of protruding and free-standing GRMs in the abraded particles and (3) to assess the potential effects of the pristine GRMs as well as the abraded particles on human macrophages differentiated from the THP-1 cell line in vitro. GRMs used in this study included graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). All types of pristine GRMs tested induced a dose-dependent increase in reactive oxygen species formation, but a decrease in cell viability was only detected for large GNPs at high concentrations (20 and 40 μg mL−1). The particle modes measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) were 300–400 nm and using an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) were between 2–3 μm, indicating the release of respirable particles. A significant fraction (51% to 92%) of the GRMs embedded in the epoxy composites was released in the form of free-standing or protruding GRMs in the abraded particles. The abraded particles did not induce any acute cytotoxic effects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000416284",,"2040-3364||2040-3372",,"10.1039/c9nr10245k","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/416284","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Release of graphene-related materials from epoxy-based composites: characterization, quantification and hazard assessment in vitro","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-05-22T08:06:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Graphene-based disruptive technologies","696656","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85085265498",,"000537113200024",,"19","Nanoscale","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This rainfall data-driven prediction of landsliding can be extended by the inclusion of antecedent wetness conditions. Although useful for first order assessment of landslide triggering conditions in warning systems, this approach relies heavily on data quality and temporal resolution, which may affect the overall predictive model performance as well as its reliability.  In this work, we address three key aspects of rainfall thresholds when applied at large spatial scales: (a) the tradeoffs between higher and lower temporal resolution (hourly or daily) (b) the spatial variability associated with long term rainfall, and (c) the added value of antecedent rainfall as predictor. We explore all of these by utilizing a long-term landslide inventory, containing more than 2500 records in Switzerland and 3 gridded rainfall records: a long daily rainfall dataset and two derived hourly products, disaggregated using stations or radar hourly measurements.  We observe that while predictive performances improve slightly when utilizing high quality hourly record (using radar information), the length of the record decreases, as well as the number of landslides in the inventory, which affects the reliability of the thresholds. A tradeoff has to be found between using long records of less accurate daily rainfall data and landslide timing, and shorter records with highly accurate hourly rainfall data and landslide timing. Even daily rainfall data may give reasonable predictive performance if thresholds are estimated with a long landslide inventory. Good quality hourly rainfall data significantly improve performance, but historical records tend to be shorter or less accurate (e.g. fewer stations available) and landslides with known timing are fewer. Considering antecedent rainfall, we observe that it is generally higher prior to landslide-triggering events and this can partially explain the false alarms and misses of an intensity-duration threshold. Nevertheless, in our study antecedent rainfall shows less predictive power by itself than the rainfall event characteristics. Finally, we show that we can improve the performances of the rainfall thresholds by accounting for local climatology in which we define new thresholds by normalizing the event characteristics with a chosen quantile of the local rainfall distribution or using the mean annual precipitation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000454487",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-19395","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454487","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Can we get more out of rainfall thresholds?

Many of these innovations allow for resource recovery and reuse and are independent from energy, water, and sewer networks. This makes them more resilient to changing environmental and socio-demographic conditions and thus more appropriate for developing urban areas. But while novel technologies and systems potentially enhance sustainability, they also increase planning complexity: how can the different technologies be assembled into entire systems? How appropriate are the resulting systems for a given application case? And how can relevant sustainability indicators such as resource recovery and losses be quantified? This thesis contributes with a theoretical description, implementation, and practical applications of methods for: (1) the generation of all valid system configurations from a set of potential technologies considering innovations; (2) the identification of a set of locally appropriate systems as an input into strategic planning using a structured decision-making approach; and (3) the ex-ante quantification of resource recovery potentials of entire systems consider. The methods are generic to be applied to any case or (future) technology, flexible to fit into any international established planning procedures; automated to consider a diverse and large set of potential options; systematic to enhance transparency; and explicitly consider uncertainty related to technology implementation or the local context. Because one of the main challenges in practice is the lack of knowledge and data, especially for novel technologies, the methods are complemented with a technology library providing international data and expert knowledge to be matched to the local conditions. The practical experiences from six case studies showed that the approach allows the prioritisation of more appropriate and more resource efficient systems when strategically planning for sanitation improvements. As more technology and sanitation system options are added to the already large portfolio, the methods presented in this thesis may become an essential tool for the putting SDG 6.2, 6.3 and SDG 11 into practice.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000444234",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444234","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Substance flow modelling||Sustainable development goals (SDG)||Sanitation systems||Sanitation service planning||Urban water management||Structured decision making (SDM)","Generation and evaluation of sanitation options for urban planning: systematic consideration of technology innovations and sustainability criteria","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::620 - Engineering & allied operations","::JEL - JEL::O - Economic Development, Innovation, Technological Change, and Growth","2020-10-02T09:48:08Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"26812",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Nature-based solutions, such as the increase in urban biomass, are often proposed to mitigate excessive urban heat. Trees are expected to decrease temperatures due to shade provision on surfaces and evapotranspiration but their canopy blocks wind flow, thus potentially induce warming by reduction of heat removal. Several studies have shown that trees have a varying potential for air temperature reduction throughout the diurnal cycle as well as in different climates. Studies that partition and attribute the temperature reduction to the aforementioned effects are still lacking though, thus making the explanation of the observed differences difficult.  To address this knowledge gap, we use the mechanistic urban ecohydrological model, Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&C, Meili et al. 2019), which accounts for radiation, evapotranspiration and roughness effects of trees in the urban canyon. Turning these components on and off by means of virtual experiments allows us to quantify their contribution to the air and surface temperature modification caused by the tree cover. The results are analysed for compact low-rise residential areas (LCZ3) in four different climates (Phoenix, Singapore, Melbourne, Zurich).  We find that tree evapotranspiration is able to lower 2 m air temperature at maximum by 3-4°C in all four climates as stomatal closure due to high vapour pressure deficits in dry and hot cities limit the transpirative cooling effect during mid-day. Counterintuitively, tree-radiation interaction increases the 2 m air temperature up to 2°C at noon time even though a decrease in surface temperatures is observed. While the surfaces underneath the tree canopy receive less radiation due to shading, the overall absorbed solar radiation within the canyon increases due to radiation trapping. In the analysed scenarios, the presence of trees leads to a decrease in the city roughness hindering turbulent energy exchange and thus, increasing the 2 m air temperature in all climates during daytime. The tree-radiation and tree-roughness effects on 2 m air temperature during night vary in different climates due to atmospheric stability effects.  Combining the different tree effects as in the real world, leads to a distinct diurnal pattern of air temperature reduction which is consistent with the observations in the literature. The numerical experiment allows reconciling differences in temperature changes induced by trees across the diurnal cycle and in various climates. The results could be used to guide green cover and tree type selection in cities and inform future studies aimed at optimizing the role of urban greening for improving local microclimatic conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000412420",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-4339","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/412420","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Radiation, evapotranspiration, and roughness effects of urban trees on local microclimate: A modelling study","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2020-04-30T01:49:53Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2020","May 4-8, 2020","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Traditional technical solutions, i.e., pipe-based, grey infrastructure, have a single purpose and are proven to be unsustainable compared to multi-purpose nature-based solutions. Green Infrastructure encompasses on-site stormwater management practices, which, in contrast to the centralised grey infrastructure, are often decentralised. Technologies such as green roofs, walls, trees, infiltration trenches, wetlands, rainwater harvesting and permeable pavements exhibit multi-functionality. They are capable of reducing stormwater runoff, retaining stormwater in the landscape, preserving the natural water balance, enhancing local climate resilience and also delivering ecological, social and community services. Creating multi-functional, multiple-benefit systems, however, also warrants multidisciplinary approaches involving landscape architects, urban planners, engineers and more to successfully create a balance between cities and nature. This Special Issue aims to bridge this multidisciplinary research gap by collecting recent challenges and opportunities from on-site systems up to the watershed scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539071",,"2073-4441","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528328||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528331","10.3390/w12051456","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539071","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","environmental benefits||ecosystem services||water policy||performance assessment","Green Infrastructures for Urban Water System: Balance between Cities and Nature","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-25T10:39:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85085910553",,"000555915200235",,"5","Water","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We developed a treatment system (aerated bioreactor, ultrafiltration membrane, granular activated carbon and electrolysis for chlorine disinfection) that recycles hand washing and toilet flush water.  Three prototypes were field-tested in non-sewered areas, one in Switzerland (hand washing) and two in South Africa (hand washing, toilet flushing), over periods of 63, 74 and 94 days, respectively.  We demonstrated that the system is able to recycle sufficient quantities of safe and appealing hand washing and toilet flush water for domestic or public use in real-life applications. Chemical contaminants were effectively removed from the used water in all prototypes. Removal efficiencies were 99.7% for the chemical oxygen demand (COD), 98.5% for total nitrogen (TN) and 99.9% for phosphate in a prototype treating hand washing water, and 99.8% for COD, 95.7% for TN and 89.6% for phosphate in a prototype treating toilet flush water. While this system allowed for true recycling for the same application, most on-site wastewater reuse systems downcycle the treated water, i.e., reuse it for an application requiring lower water quality. An analysis of 18 selected wastewater reuse specifications revealed that at best these guidelines are only partially applicable to innovative recycling systems as they are focused on the downcycling of water to the environment (e.g., use for irrigation). We believe that a paradigm shift is necessary and advocate for the implementation of risk-based (and thus end-use dependent) system performance targets to evaluate water treatment systems, which recycle and not only downcycle water.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429563",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2020.100051","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429563","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Field test||Water recycling||Hand washing||Toilet flushing||Wastewater reuse||Biologically activated membrane bioreactor (BAMBi)","Practical implementation of true on-site water recycling systems for hand washing and toilet flushing","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-08-02T03:05:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85084499306",,"000536628800004",,,"Water Research X","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

It uses the pair-wise cross-correlation of images acquired at two different times to detect offsets between image templates of a certain size. Despite the simplicity and reliability of the method, accurate estimations of glacier velocities are limited by the accountability of features and the noise, e.g. radar speckles in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. One way of gaining robust estimations is to increase the size of image templates, but the resolution of obtained velocity field is inevitably depreciate. Furthermore, for templates that only contain extremely weak features with respect to the noise, increasing the size of templates is not helpful as the noise is boosted more than the features.  To overcome these issues, we propose a temporal stacking algorithm that first averages a time series of local cross-correlation functions calculated from a series of consecutive image pairs, and then estimates the averaged velocity from the stacked cross-correlation functions. Assuming the flow velocity of a glacier is constant during a certain time span (e.g. a season), the offsets between consecutive image pairs in the time series ought to be equal. Therefore, the cross-correlation functions can be considered as a time series of signals that record the identical offsets and thus are temporally coherent. Hence, we can temporally stack the signals to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of cross-correlation functions and better estimate offsets from the stacked cross-correlation functions.   The proposed algorithm is assessed by mapping the flow velocity of the Aletsch Glacier using a time series of about 10 SAR images acquired by TanDEM-X in 2017 with constant revisit time of 11 days. The results show that temporal stacking of cross-correlation functions significantly enhances the spatial coverage and resolution of the obtained velocity fields compared to standard offset tracking using only pair-wise cross-correlation functions. This algorithm promotes the ability of mapping glacier velocities to a new extent with larger spatial coverage and higher spatial resolution, and provides a new perspective of measuring glacier velocities through exploiting the emerging time series data from recent high resolution space-born imaging sensors.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000453641",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-7348","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453641","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Temporal Stacking of Cross-Correlation for Glacier Offset Tracking","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2020-11-29T15:33:46Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2020","May 4-8, 2020","online",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

But practical experience and literature suggests that SND and thus total nitrogen removal are limited during treatment of municipal wastewater using AGS systems. This study thus aims at quantifying the extent and understanding the mechanisms of SND during treatment of municipal wastewater with aerobic granular sludge (AGS) systems. Experiments (long-term and batch-tests) as well as mathematical modelling were performed. Our experimental results demonstrate that SND is significantly limited during treatment of low-strength municipal wastewater with AGS systems (14–39%), while almost full SND is observed when treating synthetic influent containing only diffusible substrate (90%). Our simulations demonstrate that the main mechanisms behind limited SND are (1) the dynamics of anoxic zone formation inside the granule, (2) the diffusibility and availability of electron-donors in those zones and (3) the aeration mode. The development of anoxic zones is driven by the utilisation of oxygen in the upper layers of the granule leading to transport limitations of oxygen inside the granule; this effect is closely linked to granule size and wastewater composition. Development of anoxic zones during the aerobic phase is limited for small granules at constant aeration at bulk dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of 2 mgO2 L−1, and anoxic zones only develop during a brief period of the aerated phase for large granules. Modelling results further indicate that a large fraction of electron-donors are actually utilised in aerobic rather than anoxic redox zones – in the bulk or at the granule surface. Thus, full SND cannot be achieved with AGS treating low strength municipal wastewater if a constant DO is maintained during the aeration phase. Optimised aeration strategies are therefore required. 2-step and alternating aeration are tested successfully using mathematical modelling and increase TN removal to 40–79%, without compromising nitrification, and by shifting electron-donor utilisation towards anoxic redox conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000403818",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2020.100048","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/403818","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Aerobic granular sludge||Municipal wastewater||Simultaneous nitrification denitrification||Total nitrogen removal||Aeration strategy","Limited simultaneous nitrification-denitrification (SND) in aerobic granular sludge systems treating municipal wastewater: Mechanisms and practical implications","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-03-08T03:53:47Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85080124840",,"000536628800002",,,"Water Research X","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This literature is based on models with prediction variables to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from hydropower globally, to understand the impact that hydropower has on climate change. However, previous calculations have not been based on ISO 14067 and might therefore overestimate respective carbon footprints. This study was commissioned by IAI with the goal to perform the carbon footprint assessment focusing on CO2 and CH4 emissions of selected hydropower reservoirs considering the existing standard ISO 14067:2018. This includes GHG emissions and removals arising from fossil and biogenic carbon sources and sinks as well as GHG emissions and removals occurring as a result of direct and indirect land use change. Assumptions for carbon burial and CH4 ebullition (bubbling) need to be made. Also, the allocation of emissions due to the multipurpose nature of dams has been taken into account. In order to conform with ISO 14067 under high uncertainties of the emissions, we accounted only for methane emission of the reservoir based on different models, as well as the GHG emission from land use change, i.e. the emissions due to changes in above and below-ground biomass when flooding e.g. a forest area. However, we did not account for the total GHG emission occurring from dams, since the biogenic CO2 emissions might not be additional to the alternative scenario, except those attributed to land use change. The results are shown in the Summary Table below. In general, GHG emission factors of the hydropower plants which generate electricity for aluminium smelters are one to three orders of magnitude lower than the emission factors of coal-fired power plants except for the High Aswan Dam in Egypt. High Aswan has a high carbon footprint due to methane emissions, which have very high uncertainties due to the modeling required to assess them. Additionally, the regression models result in high CH4 emissions in high temperature regions, which might mainly reflect tropical situations. However, there is no evidence or studies showing that methane emissions from High Aswan are low and the high sediment load might lead to high methane emissions. This might require detailed research on the dam. In general, the contributions of methane emission and emissions caused by direct land-use change are in the same order of magnitude, but methane emissions are dominant in Brazil, Mozambique and Egypt.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488994",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488994","en","ETH Zurich, Chair of Ecological System Design","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Greenhouse Gas Emissions of selected Hydropower Reservoirs","Report","Open access",,,,"2021-06-09T14:14:30Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Based on the review and assessment of 27 existing LCIA methods, accomplished in the first part of this paper series (Sonderegger et al. 2020), this paper provides recommendations regarding the application-dependent use of existing methods and areas for future method development.  Method Within the “global guidance for LCIA indicators and methods” project of the Life Cycle Initiative hosted by UN Environment, 62 members of the “task force mineral resources” representing different stakeholders discussed the strengths and limitations of existing LCIA methods and developed initial conclusions. These were used by a subgroup of eight members at the Pellston Workshop® held in Valencia, Spain, to derive recommendations on the application-dependent use and future development of impact assessment methods.  Results and discussion First, the safeguard subject for mineral resources within the area of protection (AoP) natural resources was defined. Subsequently, seven key questions regarding the consequences of mineral resource use were formulated, grouped into “inside-out” related questions (i.e., current resource use leading to changes in opportunities for future users to use resources) and “outside-in” related questions (i.e., potential restrictions of resource availability for current resource users). Existing LCIA methods were assigned to these questions, and seven methods (ADPultimate reserves, SOPURR, LIME2endpoint, CEENE, ADPeconomic reserves, ESSENZ, and GeoPolRisk) are recommended for use in current LCA studies at different levels of recommendation. All 27 identified LCIA methods were tested on an LCA case study of an electric vehicle, and yielded divergent results due to their modeling of impact mechanisms that address different questions related to mineral resource use. Besides method-specific recommendations, we recommend that all methods increase the number of minerals covered, regularly update their characterization factors, and consider the inclusion of secondary resources and anthropogenic stocks. Furthermore, the concept of dissipative resource use should be defined and integrated in future method developments.  Conclusion In an international consensus-finding process, the current challenges of assessing impacts of resource use in LCA have been addressed by defining the safeguard subject for mineral resources, formulating key questions related to this safeguard subject, recommending existing LCIA methods in relation to these questions, and highlighting areas for future method development.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000399088",,"0948-3349||1614-7502",,"10.1007/s11367-020-01737-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/399088","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Life cycle assessment||Life cycle impact assessment||Mineral resources||Raw materials||Resource depletion||Resource dissipation||Life Cycle Initiative||Task force mineral resources","Mineral resources in life cycle impact assessment: part II – recommendations on application-dependent use of existing methods and on future method development needs","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-02-13T10:02:59Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85079460734",,"000516172400002","Int J Life Cycle Assess","4","The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment","25","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Current encounter models focus on the diffusive regime, valid for particles larger than the bacterial run length, yet the majority of marine snow particles are small, and the encounter process is then ballistic. Here, we analytically and numerically quantify the encounter rate between sinking particles and non-motile or motile micro-organisms in the ballistic regime, explicitly accounting for the hydrodynamic shear created by the particle and its coupling with micro-organism shape. We complement results with selected experiments on non-motile diatoms. The shape-shear coupling has a considerable effect on the encounter rate and encounter location through the mechanisms of hydrodynamic focusing and screening, whereby elongated micro-organisms preferentially orient normally to the particle surface downstream of the particle (focusing) and tangentially to the surface upstream of the particle (screening). Non-motile elongated micro-organisms are screened from sinking particles because shear aligns them tangentially to the particle surface, which reduces the encounter rate by a factor proportional to the square of the micro-organism aspect ratio. For motile elongated micro-organisms, hydrodynamic focusing increases the encounter rate when particle sinking speed is similar to micro-organism swimming speed, whereas for very quickly sinking particles hydrodynamic screening can reduce the encounter rate below that of non-motile micro-organisms. For natural ocean conditions, we connect the ballistic and diffusive limits and compute the encounter rate as a function of shape, motility and particle characteristics. Our results indicate that shear should be taken into account to predict the interactions between bacteria and sinking particles responsible for the large carbon flux in the ocean's biological pump.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000414675",,"1367-2630",,"10.1088/1367-2630/ab73c9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/414675","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ocean biophysics||encounter rates||hydrodynamic focusing and screening||flow-induced symmetry breaking||Jeffery equation","Encounter rates between bacteria and small sinking particles","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-05-14T02:40:12Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85085245196",,"000529432700001","New J.

Here, 22 chemical inventories from 19 countries and regions are analyzed to achieve a first comprehensive overview of chemicals on the market as an essential first step toward a global understanding of chemical pollution. Over 350 000 chemicals and mixtures of chemicals have been registered for production and use, up to three times as many as previously estimated and with substantial differences across countries/regions. A noteworthy finding is that the identities of many chemicals remain publicly unknown because they are claimed as confidential (over 50 000) or ambiguously described (up to 70 000).

Stacking multiple XRF maps along the energy axis yields chemical images that contain spatially resolved information on the speciation of the absorber in the sample matrix at the micrometre scale. Short dwell times needed to keep measurement time and radiation-induced sample changes within acceptable limits result in spectral noise that affects the uncertainty in data analysis. In this study, we develop a model to quantify the uncertainty associated with the processing of XRF image stacks using Bayesian inference. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, the model is applied to stacks of XRF maps collected around the copper (Cu) K-edge (pixel size: 3 × 3 μm2, map sizes: 500 × 500 μm2). The investigated samples include digested sewage sludge spiked with either CuO nanoparticles (NP) or dissolved CuSO4 and their corresponding ashes obtained through incineration. The chemical imaging data reveal differences in species distribution between sludge spiked with CuO NP or dissolved Cu. These differences disappear during the incineration process and the resulting ashes exhibit almost identical Cu species distribution. The uncertainty analysis approach developed in this study can be used for data interpretation, but can also be used for the planning of chemical imaging experiments at synchrotron beamlines.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000407083",,"0267-9477||1364-5544",,"10.1039/c9ja00394k","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/407083","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Synchrotron hard X-ray chemical imaging of trace element speciation in heterogeneous samples: Development of criteria for uncertainty analysis","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-03-29T05:11:27Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85082070618",,"000519646000011","J Anal At Spectrom","3","Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry","35","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02130 - Dep.

By combin-ing stable isotope probing, optical tweezers, Raman microspectroscopy, and microfluidics, the platform performs automated Raman-based sorting of taxa from within a complex community in terms of their functional properties. In comparison with manual sort-ing approaches, our method provides high throughput (up to 500 cells per hour) and very high sorting accura-cy (98.3 ± 1.7%), and significantly reduces the human labour required. The system provides an efficient manner to untangle the contributions of individual members within environmental and host-associated microbiomes. In this News and Thoughts, we provide an overview of our platform, describe potential appli-cations, suggest ways in which the system could be improved, and discuss future directions in which Ra-man-based analysis of microbial populations might be developed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450316",,"2311-2638",,"10.15698/mic2020.03.709","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450316","en","Shared Science Publishers","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Raman-based sorting of microbial cells to link functions to their genes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-09T12:29:06Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85096034522",,"000518456500001",,"3","Microbial Cell","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We find the corresponding collision kernel Γrods=lβ1ΔρVrodg/(16Aμ), where l, A, and Vrod are the rods’ length, aspect ratio (length divided by width), and volume, respectively, Δρ is the density difference between rods and fluid, μ is the fluid’s dynamic viscosity, g is the gravitational acceleration, and β1(A) is a geometrical parameter. We apply this formula to marine snow formation following a phytoplankton bloom. Over a broad range of aspect ratios, the formula predicts a similar or higher encounter rate between rods as compared to the encounter rate between (equal volume) spheres aggregating either by differential settling or due to turbulence. Since many phytoplankton species are elongated, these results suggest that collisions induced by the orientation-dependent settling velocity can contribute significantly to marine snow formation, and that marine snow composed of elongated phytoplankton cells can form at high rates also in the absence of turbulence.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000401689",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.1917163117","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/401689","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","ocean biophysics||marine snow||biological pump||collision kernels||encounter rates in fluids","On the collision of rods in a quiescent fluid","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-02-26T03:27:08Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85079556772",,"000514096400012","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","7","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","117","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

To identify its main contributors and their geographical distribution, a structural decomposition analysis is applied to global multi-regional input-output tables. A new variant of this type of analysis is developed that introduces energy transition (i.e. the substitution of non-renewable energy by renewable energy) as one of the contributors. Global renewable energy use rose by 22.1 Exa Joules (EJ), from 57.8 EJ in 2000 to 79.9 in 2014. The contribution of energy transition at the global level to this 22.1 EJ increase was small and positive (+1.3 EJ). As for the geographical distribution of the effects, positive effects are found for the European Union and the United States, negative effects for China, India, and the Rest of the World (which includes many developing and emerging countries). Trade structure changes also had a small effect on global renewable energy use (+1.1 EJ). The main contributions were the worldwide changes in: technology and overall energy efficiency (−23.6 EJ); consumption per capita (+32.2EJ); and population (+11.0 EJ).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450315",,"0306-2619||1872-9118",,"10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114040","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450315","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Structural decomposition analysis||Multi-regional input-output analysis||Global energy use||Energy transition","Measuring the effects of energy transition: A structural decomposition analysis of the change in renewable energy use between 2000 and 2014","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-09T12:29:06Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appl.

Nevertheless, there is a poor understanding of which commensals use mucin-derived sugars in situ as well as their potential to impede pathogen colonization. Here, we identify mouse gut commensals that utilize mucus-derived monosaccharides within complex communities using single-cell stable isotope probing, Raman-activated cell sorting and mini-metagenomics. Sequencing of cell-sorted fractions reveals members of the underexplored family Muribaculaceae as major mucin monosaccharide foragers, followed by members of Lachnospiraceae, Rikenellaceae, and Bacteroidaceae families. Using this information, we assembled a five-member consortium of sialic acid and N-acetylglucosamine utilizers that impedes C. difficile’s access to these mucosal sugars and impairs pathogen colonization in antibiotic-treated mice. Our findings underscore the value of targeted approaches to identify organisms utilizing key nutrients and to rationally design effective probiotic mixtures.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000446229",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-020-18928-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446229","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Rational design of a microbial consortium of mucosal sugar utilizers reduces Clostridiodes difficile colonization","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-16T03:42:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85092260011",,"000581916500018","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

On-site wastewater treatment plants (OSTs) treat wastewater from a single household or dwelling directly on site. Because of the low initial investment costs, high flexibility, and resource recovery potential, they are used worldwide. Their core problem is that they are mostly operated without constant supervision. To keep costs low, common practice is to have one to four annual inspections. But with no online monitoring in place, treatment performance of such plants is low. Furthermore, failures are not noticed promptly after their occurrence, but only during the next inspection, if at all. This leads to reduced overall treatment performance and reinforces the widespread prejudice that OSTs are a makeshift solution. Aim. The overall goal of this work is to see if OST systems can achieve treatment performances that are comparable to conventional centralised systems. The vision is that treatment performance should no longer be a criterion to rule out OSTs in the future any more. To get closer to this overall objective, two main objectives were defined: •	To identify a performance sensor that only requires maintenance annually or less frequent. This could greatly reduce maintenance costs, therefore enabling large-scale monitoring of OSTs. •	To investigate how such a nominally inaccurate sensor influences the treatment performance of a single OST unit as well as a system of OSTs and its quantification.  A specific hurdle when monitoring individual OSTs is sensor accuracy. In a nutrient-rich wet environment such as wastewater, biofilm grows every-where within a few days. Therefore, manufacturers usually recommend monthly or even weekly sensor maintenance routines. Our idea was to use established, but unmaintained sensors for monitoring.  Methods. Instead of using the directly measured values, a trend in the signal is used to predict effluent quality. In other words, the target value is determined indirectly based on an inaccurate sensor signal. This approach is referred to as soft sensing.  The soft sensors were developed using data acquired in a laboratory experiment. Optimizing these soft sensors required an extensive measurement campaign to gather reference measurements. Therefore, the application of the developed soft sensor is only viable if the parameters of the soft sensor do not need to be re-optimized for each new installation. In a next step, we therefore checked the transferability from laboratory to the field as well as the limitations of such a transfer. For this the soft sensors were benchmarked on three OSTs of the sequencing batch reactor (SBR) type and with synthetic data. Finally, the new findings were used to investigate the use of inaccurate sensors on the treatment performance and the quantification of this performance with a stochastic model. Results and conclusions. Soft sensors based on maintained and unmaintained pH sensors have been compared and no significant difference in the accuracy of the relevant target information content was found. A soft sensor, based on signals from the unmaintained dissolved oxygen (DO) sensors, achieved an accuracy comparable to the pH sensor. The attempt to design a soft sensor for the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) failed under the given operating conditions. The results show that soft sensors, based on unmaintained measurement signals offer a possibility to monitor OSTs. The study clearly encourages to focus on information content in-stead of solely on the most accurate measurement. The benchmarking study showed that the accuracy of the soft sensors is influenced by the design of the OST and its control system. Sludge age, aeration regime, and aeration rate have a major influence on the soft sensor. Therefore, the soft sensors can only be used for monitoring if implemented together with a proper plant setup, operation, and controls. How-ever, if implemented properly they provide a successful online monitoring method for OSTs and fill a longstanding research gap. The final step is the modelling of a fleet of OSTs to quantify the potential difference between their real and measured treatment performance. The influence of alarm management strategy, the accuracy of soft sensors, and the reliability of the individual OSTs on the system performance is evaluated. The modelling shows that even inaccurate soft sensors improve the treatment performance of individual OSTs and therefore, of the overall system. A well-designed alarm management strategy can compensate for sensor inaccuracy, while preventing unnecessary maintenance. The deviation of the observed performance from the real performance can be reduced by optimising the soft sensor accordingly.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000445338",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/445338","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Decentralized wastewater treatment||Qualitative trend analysis||Sequencing batch reactor||Soft-sensors||Feature engineering","Monitoring and quantifying the treatment performance of on-site wastewater treatment plants","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::620 - Engineering & allied operations",,"2020-10-09T13:18:08Z","2020-10-13",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"26958",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Among the most rapid and dramatic changes are retrogressive thaw slumps. These slumps evolve by a retreat of the slump headwall during the summer months, making them detectable by comparing digital elevation models over time using the volumetric change as an indicator. Here, we present and assess a method to detect and monitor thaw slumps using time series of elevation models applied on two contrasting study areas in Northern Canada. Our two-step method is tailored to single-pass InSAR observations from the TanDEM-X satellite pair, which have been acquired since 2011. For each acquisition, we derive a digital elevation model and uncertainty estimates. In the first step, we difference digital elevation models and detect the significant elevation changes using a blob-detection algorithm. In the second step, we classify the detections into those due to thaw slumps and other causes using a simple thresholding method (accuracy: 78%), a random forest classifier (87%), and a support vector machine (86%). When our method is applied to other areas, the classifiers should be trained with data from part of the study area or with data obtained from similar areas in terms of topography, vegetation, and thaw slump characteristics to achieve the best performance. The obtained locations of thaw slumps can be used as a starting point to extract important slump properties, such as the headwall height and the volumetric change, which are currently not available on regional scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000426695",,"1939-1404||2151-1535",,"10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3000648","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/426695","en","IEEE","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Abrupt thaw||Banks island||Digital elevation model (DEM) differencing||DEM generation||Interferometry||Mackenzie river delta||Permafrost||Remote sensing||Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs)||Single-pass radar interferometry||Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)||Thermokarst","Mapping Retrogressive Thaw Slumps Using Single-Pass TanDEM-X Observations","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-17T02:41:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"000543958200002","IEEE j. sel. top. appl. earth obs. remote sens.",,"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

To enable the use of the anisotropy in snowpack models as an internal variable, we propose a simple model based on a rate equation for the temporal evolution. The model is validated with a comprehensive set of anisotropy profiles and time series from X-ray microtomography (CT) and radar measurements. The model includes two effects, namely temperature gradient metamorphism and settling, and can be forced by any snowpack model that predicts temperature and density. First, we use CT time series from lab experiments to validate the proposed effect of temperature gradient metamorphism. Next, we use SNOWPACK simulations to calibrate the model with radar time series from the NoSREx campaigns in Sodankylä, Finland. Finally we compare the simulated anisotropy profiles against field-measured full-depth CT profiles. Our results confirm that the creation of vertical structures is mainly controlled by the vertical water vapor flux through the snow volume. Our results further indicate a yet undocumented effect of snow settling on the creation of horizontal structures. Overall the model is able to reproduce the characteristic anisotropy variations in radar time series of four different winter seasons with a very limited set of calibration parameters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000393988",,"1994-0416||1994-0424",,"10.5194/tc-14-51-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/393988","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Modeling the evolution of the structural anisotropy of snow","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-25T03:26:12Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85078293457",,"000507320700001",,"1","The Cryosphere","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In Switzerland, the public is informed by an avalanche bulletin issued twice a day during winter which is based on weather information and snow and avalanche reports from a network of observers. During bad weather, however, information about avalanches that have occurred can be scarce or even be missing completely. To assess the potential of weather-independent radar satellites, we compared manual and automatic change detection avalanche mapping results from high-resolution TerraSAR-X (TSX) stripmap images and medium-resolution Sentinel-1 (S1) interferometric wide-swath images for a study site in central Switzerland. The TSX results were also compared to available mapping results from high-resolution SPOT-6 optical satellite images. We found that avalanche outlines from TSX and S1 agree well with each other. Cutoff thresholds of mapped avalanche areas were found with 500 m2 for TSX and 2000 m2 for S1. S1 provides a much higher spatial and temporal coverage and allows for mapping of the entire Alps at least every 6 d with freely available acquisitions. With costly SPOT-6 images the Alps can even be covered in a single day at meter resolution, at least for clear-sky conditions. For the SPOT-6 and TSX mapping results, we found a fair agreement, but the temporal information from radar change detection allows for a better separation of overlapping avalanches. Still, the total mapped avalanche area differed by at least a factor of 3 because with radar mainly the avalanche deposition zone was detected, whereas the release zone was very visible already in SPOT-6 data. With automatic avalanche mapping we detected around 70 % of manually mapped new avalanches, at least when the number of old avalanches is low. To further improve the radar mapping capabilities, we combined S1 images from multiple orbits and polarizations and obtained a notable enhancement of resolution and speckle reduction such that the obtained mapping results are almost comparable to the single-orbit TSX change detection results. In a multiorbital S1 mosaic covering all of Switzerland, we manually counted 7361 new avalanches which occurred during an extreme avalanche period around 4 January 2018.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000424357",,"1561-8633||1684-9981",,"10.5194/nhess-20-1783-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424357","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Snow avalanche detection and mapping in multitemporal and multiorbital radar images from TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-03T19:30:26Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85086923461",,"000543513800001","Nat. hazards earth syst. sci.","6","Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The spatio-temporal extent of lake ice cover, along with the timings of key phenological events such as freeze-up and break-up, provide important cues about the local and global climate. We present a lake ice monitoring system based on the automatic analysis of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with a deep neural network. In previous studies that used optical satellite imagery for lake ice monitoring, frequent cloud cover was a main limiting factor, which we overcome thanks to the ability of microwave sensors to penetrate clouds and observe the lakes regardless of the weather and illumination conditions. We cast ice detection as a two class (frozen, non-frozen) semantic segmentation problem and solve it using a state-of-the-art deep convolutional network (CNN).We report results on two winters (2016–17 and 2017–18) and three alpine lakes in Switzerland. The proposed model reaches mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores >90% on average, and >84% even for the most difficult lake. Additionally, we perform cross-validation tests and show that our algorithm generalises well across unseen lakes and winters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000440146",,"2194-9042||2194-9050",,"10.5194/isprs-Annals-V-3-2020-409-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/440146","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Lake Ice||Climate Monitoring||Sentinel-1 SAR||Semantic Segmentation||Convolutional Neural Networks","Lake Ice Detection from Sentinel-1 SAR with Deep Learning","Conference Paper","Open access",,,,"2020-09-12T03:03:04Z",,,,"yes","XXIV ISPRS Congress 2020 (virtual)","August 31 - September 2, 2020","Online",,,,,,,,"85090348941",,,"ISPRS Ann.

The current extraction and degradation of natural resources might limit the available supply that future generations require to meet their own needs. These impacts of natural resource consumption should be covered in environmental assessments in order to guide us towards more sustainable resource use and to protect the natural resource base.  Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a method to identify strategies to reduce environmental impacts. It quantitatively assesses environmental impacts occurring throughout the entire life cycle of goods and processes. Natural resources have their own place in the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) framework, where environmental impacts are assessed in so-called “Areas of Protection” (AoPs): “human health”, “ecosystem quality”, and “natural resources”. The role of the latter is not yet fully agreed upon, and while its name is established, this is not the case for its more specific safeguard subject, i.e. what exactly is it about natural resources that we want to protect?   Criticality assessments have been developed to address concerns about supply security of industrial metals and minerals caused by the increasing demand since the beginning of the 21st century. Some criticality based supply risk methods have been adapted (to some degree) to the LCA context. While LCIA methods assess how current use of natural resources affects opportunities for future resource users, supply risk methods assess potential supply risks for current resource users. They might complement LCA studies, in particular if the focus is on natural resources.  The goal of this thesis is to harmonize, complement, and thereby strengthen the assessment of natural resource use in life cycle approaches. This is addressed at the conceptual and the methodological level. At the conceptual level, definitions of “natural resources” and the “natural resources” AoP safeguard subject are suggested and a framework for integrating different natural resources in LCIA is developed. At the methodological level, existing LCIA methods are reviewed and the range of natural resources covered by LCIA methods and criticality assessments is increased by developing LCIA methods assessing impacts on soil and a method assessing water criticality.  Defining natural resources and the safeguard subject for the “natural resources” AoP is a challenge since the target elements of mineral resources, e.g. copper, can also be extracted from anthropogenic sources. Including the human-made environment as a potential source would shift the focus from “How many natural resources do we use?” to “How many resources do we lose?”. However, it is not yet clear how losses in the technosphere and natural resource occupation should then be addressed, as these challenge the LCA practice of assessing elementary flows between ecosphere and technosphere. Suggested definitions are discussed regarding these implications.  Eight natural resource categories were identified based on literature. Existing LCIA methods addressing these are reviewed and evaluated according to their underlying principles: use-to-availability ratios/depletion potential, potential future efforts of future resource extraction, and thermodynamic accounting. Depletion and future efforts methods have already been developed for several natural resource categories, but no set of methods is available yet to consistently capture all of these categories. While thermodynamic accounting methods can do that, they miss the link between exergy or energy consumption to changes in availability or provisioning capacity of a specific natural resource.   Natural resources are categorized into stock, fund, and flow resources and a framework making use of these categories is developed. This helps in identifying whether usage potential of natural resources is reduced by losses leading to depletion, by pollution leading to degradation, or by occupation leading to deprivation of other users. This general framework for all natural resources is further specified for the methods developed in this thesis that assess the natural resource soil.  The LCIA methods developed for the assessment of impacts on soil consider the effects of compaction and erosion. They assess potential long-term impacts on the production capacity of soils and are able to distinguish between different management choices such as machinery selection and tillage practices. This is achieved by modeling new elementary flows based on the relevant activities, e.g. agricultural fieldwork, that are causing soil degradation as opposed to previous methods that were based on already available elementary flows of general land use classes. Characterization factors are provided as global raster datasets at high spatial resolution (~1 km). The application of the methods is demonstrated and discussed in a simplified case study. The results demonstrate the relevance of compaction and erosion impacts for agricultural LCAs. The methods are compatible with the suggested safeguard subject definition and developed frameworks. The soil specific framework allows consistent integration of further impacts on soil.  A database and matching code are provided to collect agricultural inventory data and calculate elementary flows, which can be used for comparing the impact potential of different agricultural practices. Global maps of compaction and erosion susceptibility allow for identification of global hot spot areas and for performing impact assessment.  The criticality method for water is developed following an existing approach for metals since comparability of criticality across natural resources is desirable. Several other approaches exist and there is no harmonized framework as for LCIA and no uniform approach regarding what indicators should be included and how these should be aggregated. The single water criticality indicators cover the main aspects of criticality assessments: probability of and vulnerability to supply disruption, as well as risk mitigation options. They might inspire further methodological developments and pave the way for future integrated criticality assessment of metals, water and other natural resources.  Water criticality scores were calculated for 159 countries subdivided into 512 geographic units and made available in an online tool. This allows analyses of locally specific characteristics of water criticality that might be used for the screening of sites, indicating potential water related problems and possible mitigation options. Global maps of water criticality scores allow for identification of global hot spot areas and for performing impact assessment.  By providing definitions, frameworks, and methods that are conceptually consistent, this thesis contributes to harmonizing, complementing, and thereby strengthening the assessment of natural resource use in life cycle approaches.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000409207",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/409207","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)||Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) indicators||Natural resources||Water||Soil||Agriculture||Soil degradation||Soil compaction||Soil erosion||Criticality||Water criticality||Soil productivity","Towards Sustainable Use of Natural Resources","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,"2020-04-09T13:27:30Z","2020-05-28",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"26604",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Where salinity affects crop water uptake and yield, sodicity may additionally cause poorly reversible soil structure degradation and a severely reduced hydraulic conductivity. We use the model HYDRUS‐1D to simulate sodicity development in soils with shallow, Na‐rich groundwater under a normal weather regime with distinct dry seasons. Attention is given to the impact of a sudden fresh water input on the formation of a sodic layer. The complex interplay between soil chemistry, soil physics, soil mechanics (as far as swell–shrink behavior is concerned), and fluctuating atmospheric conditions results in a remarkably regular relation between depth, location, and severity of a sodic layer that forms within the soil as a function of rainfall intensity. A threshold behavior is observed: sodic layer formation is absent at rainfall intensities below this threshold, whereas sodic layer thickness and hydraulic conductivity reduction increase rapidly with intensities exceeding this threshold. This is the case even for different soil types and groundwater depths. Field observations agree with our simulations: the properties of the layer with sodicity‐induced structure degradation are more strongly developed, as this layer is situated at a shallower depth. The implementation of hydraulic conductivity reduction as a function of exchangeable Na percentage and ionic strength in HYDRUS‐1D can be improved towards a smooth reduction function, changing soil physical parameters due to swelling and dispersion of clay and reconsideration of the reversibility of sodicity development.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000454483",,"1539-1663",,"10.1002/vzj2.20010","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454483","en","Soil Science Society of America","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Soil sodicity originating from marginal groundwater","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-03T14:04:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85081029610",,"000618773300010","Vadose Zone J.","1","Vadose Zone Journal","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The link between bacterial navigation and nutrient cycling highlights the need to understand how chemotaxis functions in the context of marine microenvironments. Chemotaxis hinges on the stochastic binding/unbinding of molecules with surface receptors, the transduction of this information through an intracellular signaling cascade, and the activation and control of flagellar motors. The intrinsic randomness of these processes is a central challenge that cells must deal with in order to navigate, particularly under dilute conditions where noise and signal are similar in magnitude. Such conditions are ubiquitous in the ocean, where nutrient concentrations are often extremely low and subject to rapid variation in space (e.g., particulate matter, nutrient plumes) and time (e.g., diffusing sources, fluid mixing). Stochastic, biophysical models of chemotaxis have the potential to illuminate how bacteria cope with noise to efficiently navigate in such environments. At the same time, new technologies for experimentation allow for continuous interrogation—from milliseconds through to days—of bacterial responses in custom dynamic nutrient landscapes, providing unprecedented access to the behavior of chemotactic cells in microenvironments engineered to mimic those cells navigate in the wild. These recent theoretical and experimental developments have created an opportunity to derive population-level uptake from single-cell motility characteristics in ways that could inform the next generation of marine biogeochemical cycling models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000431110",,"2296-7745",,"10.3389/fmars.2020.00527","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/431110","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Chemotaxis||Bacteria||Motility||Sensing noise||Ocean||Microbial ecology||Navigation||Fluctuations","Cutting Through the Noise: Bacterial Chemotaxis in Marine Microenvironments","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-08-12T02:46:08Z",,,,"yes",,,,"The effect of high-frequency nutrient fluctuations on bacterial growth","176189","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85089347715",,"000553333900001",,,"Frontiers in Marine Science","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Ambitious targets have been proposed, such as reversing the declining trends in biodiversity3; however, just feeding the growing human population will make this a challenge4. Here we use an ensemble of land-use and biodiversity models to assess whether—and how—humanity can reverse the declines in terrestrial biodiversity caused by habitat conversion, which is a major threat to biodiversity5. We show that immediate efforts, consistent with the broader sustainability agenda but of unprecedented ambition and coordination, could enable the provision of food for the growing human population while reversing the global terrestrial biodiversity trends caused by habitat conversion. If we decide to increase the extent of land under conservation management, restore degraded land and generalize landscape-level conservation planning, biodiversity trends from habitat conversion could become positive by the mid-twenty-first century on average across models (confidence interval, 2042–2061), but this was not the case for all models. Food prices could increase and, on average across models, almost half (confidence interval, 34–50%) of the future biodiversity losses could not be avoided. However, additionally tackling the drivers of land-use change could avoid conflict with affordable food provision and reduces the environmental effects of the food-provision system. Through further sustainable intensification and trade, reduced food waste and more plant-based human diets, more than two thirds of future biodiversity losses are avoided and the biodiversity trends from habitat conversion are reversed by 2050 for almost all of the models. Although limiting further loss will remain challenging in several biodiversity-rich regions, and other threats—such as climate change—must be addressed to truly reverse the declines in biodiversity, our results show that ambitious conservation efforts and food system transformation are central to an effective post-2020 biodiversity strategy.",,,,"0028-0836||1476-4687",,"10.1038/s41586-020-2705-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/442009","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Bending the curve of terrestrial biodiversity needs an integrated strategy","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-09-23T02:44:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85090443427",,"000567780100001",,,"Nature","585","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, critical discussions about unintended, adverse effects of ENP on humans, soil- and aquatic organisms have always accompanied their usage. Therefore, investigations into the fate of ENP after their use phase are necessary to enable a reliable assessment of the risks associated with the use of such novel materials. Previous research efforts showed that after usage, large shares of ENP applied in consumer products are discharged to wastewater and transported to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). WWTPs retain > 95% of ENP leading to their accumulation in sewage sludge. In Switzerland, sewage sludge is incinerated preferably in mono-combustion fluidized bed reactors (FBRs) and the resulting ashes are landfilled for resource recovery in the future. To contribute to a better understanding of the fate and behavior of ENP in the urban environment, the following research questions were addressed: (i) how can the kinetics of sewage sludge devolatilization be quantified, (ii) what chemical and physical transformations of ENP occur during the sewage sludge combustion, (iii) what are the possibilities of synchrotron hard X-ray chemical imaging to study transformation products of ENP, and lastly (iv) to what extent are ENP released from sewage sludge ash landfill sites?  The devolatilization kinetics of digested sludge were studied using thermogravimetric analysis. Results revealed that 10 individual first-order reactions with Arrhenius rate constants are sufficient to describe the devolatilization kinetics. The detailed analyses of the kinetic parameters was used to estimate the speciation of the major compounds of the combustibles which were cellulose (36%), lignin (20%), calcite (11%), alginate (8%) and hemicellulose (6%). Generalized, the presented method can be used to determine the main components of any heterogeneous fuel.  The transformation of ENPs during sewage sludge incineration were investigated using a pilot scale FBR mimicking the reactions occurring in full scale FBRs used for sludge combustion. TiO2 (anatase and rutile), CuO and ZnO were selected as relevant particles and their transformation was studied using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Results revealed CuO and ZnO-NP to transform into CuS and ZnS phases during anaerobic digestion, whereas both TiO2 polymorphs remained unaffected. During incineration, 70% of CuS transformed to Cu coordinated to O, the remaining 30% of Cu were present as CuS. ZnS fully transformed into weakly crystalline spinel phases (ZnFe2O4 and Al2ZnO4) during incineration. Anatase ENP mostly (80%) reacted with hematite to form members of the hematite-ilmenite solid solution series (Fe2-xTixO3, 0 < x < 1), a poorly crystalline 6-fold O coordinated phase represented by Ti(IV)sulfate and rutile. Larger rutile particles transformed to a smaller extent into similar phases. It can be concluded that during sludge incineration most ENP loose their engineered integrity and properties and may thus rather be classified as incidental than as engineered nanoparticles.  XAS based chemical imaging data shows that CuO-NP spiked to sewage sludge form Cu hotspots in which Cu is present as CuO. These hotspots were absent in Cu+IISO4 (dissolved) spiked sludge. Through incineration, these differences vanish, and the elemental Cu distribution is more homogeneous in the ash. The limitations of XAS chemical imaging were evaluated based on the CuO-NP case study. For that purpose, an algorithm using Bayesian inference was developed and tested using synthetic data. The algorithm allows an estimation of the reliability of the identification of individual phases based on chemical images. It can be applied to large datasets also from other analytical instruments where spectral differences are explored based on linear combination fit analyses.  To investigate to what extent ENPs can be released from ashes in landfill sites, a pilot scale WWTP and FBR were operated “in-sequence” to mimic the fate of ENP from the wastewater to the ash as realistically as possible. The ash containing Au, Ag and CeO2-NP or their transformation products was packed into columns to simulate landfill sites and the elements’ release was quantified. Ag and CeO2-NP that transform to other species during anaerobic digestion and sludge incineration remained in the ash. In contrast, about 17% of the Au in the ash was released after passing ca. 450 pore volumes of artificial rainwater through the column. Around 30% of the released Au was smaller 10 kDa, the remaining 70% were present as AuNP. Similar results were obtained for the release of AuNP from ash with high Au concentrations originating from industrial sources in the catchment of two WWTP. These data suggest that the release of ENP from landfill sites also depends on transformation occurring in several waste management facilities. ENP transforming during anaerobic digestion and/or incineration are likely retained in sewage sludge ash landfill sites.||Künstlich produzierte Nanopartikel (NP) werden in Konsumgütern und industriellen Prozessen zur Steigerung von Effizienz und Nachhaltigkeit durch reduzierten Ressourceneinsatz verwendet, z.B. TiO2-NP in Sonnencreme, ZnO-NP in Kosmetika und Farbe oder Ag-NP und CuO-NP zu antimikrobiellen Zwecken. Allerdings ist stets vor ungewollten, nachteiligen Effekten solcher NP gegenüber Menschen, sowie Boden- und Wasserorganismen gewarnt worden. Daher sind Studien über die Transformation und den Verbleib von NP nach ihrer Nutzungsphase notwendig um die oben genannten Risiken der Nutzung solcher neuartigen Materialen zuverlässig abschätzen zu können. Vorangegangene Studien haben gezeigt, dass ein grosser Teil der NP in Konsumgütern in Abwasserkanäle entlassen wird und in Abwasserreinigungsanlangen (ARAs) gelangt. ARAs halten über 95% der einkommenden NP zurück, welche folglich im Faulschlamm aufkonzentriert werden. In der Schweiz wird Faulschlamm vorzugsweise in speziell dafür errichteten Wirbelbettreaktoren verbrannt und die anfallende Asche wird von Asche aus anderen Brennstoffen getrennt deponiert um daraus in der Zukunft Ressourcen rückzugewinnen.  Um ein besseres Verständnis des Verhaltens von NP in städtischen Abwassersystemen und insbesondere während der Klärschlammverbrennung zu gewinnen, wurden die folgenden Forschungsfragen adressiert: (i)Wie lässt sich die Verbrennungskinetik von Klärschlamm quantifizieren, (ii) welche physikalischen und chemischen Transformationsprozesse unterlaufen NP während der Klärschlammverbrennung, (iii) wie können Transformationsprodukte von NP mithilfe synchrotronbasierter, chemische Bildgebung identifiziert werden und (iv) wie gross ist das Freisetzungspotential von NP aus Klärschlammaschedeponien?  Die Kinetik der Klärschlammentgasungsreaktionen wurde mithilfe von Thermogravimetrischer Analyse bestimmt. Ergebnisse zeigen, dass 10 individuelle erster Ordnung Reaktionen mit Arrhenius Ratenkonstanten ausreichend sind um die Kinetik dieser Entgasungsreaktionen zu beschreiben. Durch eine detaillierte Analyse der Daten war es möglich die wichtigsten entgasenden Substanzen zu speziieren. Die Anteile von Zellulose (36%), Lignin (20%), Kalzit (11%), Alginat (8%) und Hemizellulose (6%) konnten quantifiziert werden. Damit wurde eine allgemeine Methode zur Speziierung der Hauptbestandteile von heterogenen Brennstoffen entwickelt.  Die Transformation von NPs während der Klärschlammverbrennung in grossskaligen Anlangen wurde mithilfe eines pilotskaligen Wirbelbettreaktors untersucht. TiO2 (Anatas und Rutil), CuO und ZnO-NP wurden ausgewählt und ihre Transformation wurde mithilfe von Röntgenabsorptionspektroskopie (XAS) bestimmt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass CuO und ZnO-NP während der Faulung in CuS bzw. ZnS Phasen umgewandelt werden, während beide TiO2 Modifikationen keine Transformation unterlaufen. Während der Verbrennung wandeln sich 70% des CuS in O koordiniertes Cu um, während die verbleibenden 30% Cu als CuS verbleiben. ZnS wird vollständig in niederkristalline Spinelphasen (ZnFe2O4 und Al2ZnO4) transformiert. Etwa 80% der Anatas NP reagieren mit Hämatit und wandeln sich während der Verbrennung in Phasen auf der Hämatit-Ilmenit Mischkristallreihe (Fe2-xTixO3, 0 < x < 1), eine niederkristalline sechsfach an O koordinierte und von Ti(IV)sulfate repäsentierte Phase und Rutil um. Grössere Rutilpartikel werden zu geringerem Anteil in vergleichbare Phasen umgewandelt. Aus den Ergebnissen lässt sich schliessen, dass künstliche NP während der Schlammverbrennung ihre Integrität und Eigenschaften verlieren und somit nicht mehr als „künstlich“ klassifiziert werden können.  XAS basierte chemische Bildgebung zeigt, dass CuO-NP in Klärschlamm Cu Hotspots bilden, in denen Cu als CuO vorliegt. Diese Hotspots waren in mit gelöstem Cu+IISO4 gespikten Schlamm nicht beobachtbar. Nach der Verbrennung waren diese Unterschiede verschwunden und Cu in der Asche gleichmässiger verteilt. Limitierungen in der Interpretierbarkeit der chemischen Bilder wurden anhand der CuONP Fallstudie evaluiert, wofür ein auf Bayesscher Statistik beruhender Algorithmus entwickelt und getestet wurde. Der Algorithmus evaluiert die Verlässlichkeit der Identifikation individueller Phasen in den chemischen Bildern, kann aber auch auf Datensätze anderer analytischer Methoden angewandt werden in denen Spektralanalysen grösserer Datensätze auf der Basis von Linearkombinationsfits durchgeführt werden.  Um die Freisetzung von NP aus Klärschlammaschedeponien zu untersuchen wurden eine pilotskalige ARA und Wirbelbettreaktor in Serie betrieben um die Propagation von NP (Au, Ag und CeO2-NP) während der Abwasser- und Schlammbehandlung möglichst realitätsnah zu simulieren. Die Au, Ag und CeO2-NP oder deren Transformationsprodukten enthaltende Klärschlammasche wurde in Säulen gefüllt und die Freisetzung der jeweiligen Elemente untersucht. Ag und CeO2-NP, die während Faulung und Verbrennung in andere Phasen umgewandelt werden verbleiben grösstenteils in der Asche. Im Gegensatz dazu wurden etwa 17% des Au in der Asche freigesetzt nachdem ca. 450 Porenvolumen künstlichen Regenwassers die Asche durchflossen hat. Etwa 30% des freigesetzten Golds ist kleiner 10 kDa (gelöst), während die verbleibenden 70% als NP vorliegen. Vergleichbare Experimente mit AuNP industriellen Ursprungs bestätigten diese Beobachtungen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Freisetzung von NP aus Klärschlammasche von deren Transformationspotential in vorangegangenen Prozessschritten abhängig ist. NP, welche während Faulung und/oder Verbrennung transformiert werden, werden zu grössten Teilen in Klärschlammaschedeponien zurückgehalten.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000473625",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473625","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Incineration||Nanoparticle||Environment||Landfill effluxes||Transformation||X-ray absorption spectroscopy","Investigations into the fate of engineered transition metal nano particles during sewage sludge incineration","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::624 - Civil engineering",,"2021-03-09T13:35:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27020",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Marine bacteria transform DMSP via two competing pathways with considerably different biogeochemical implications: demethylation channels sulfur into the microbial food web, whereas cleavage releases sulfur into the atmosphere. Here, we present single-cell measurements of the expression of these two pathways using engineered fluorescent reporter strains of Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3, and find that external DMSP concentration dictates the relative expression of the two pathways. DMSP induces an upregulation of both pathways, but only at high concentrations (>1 μM for demethylation; >35 nM for cleavage), characteristic of microscale hotspots such as the vicinity of phytoplankton cells. Co-incubations between DMSP-producing microalgae and bacteria revealed an increase in cleavage pathway expression close to the microalgae’s surface. These results indicate that bacterial utilization of microscale DMSP hotspots is an important determinant of the fate of sulfur in the ocean.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000412734",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-020-15693-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/412734","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Single-cell bacterial transcription measurements reveal the importance of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) hotspots in ocean sulfur cycling","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-05-03T02:52:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85083855210",,"000530273600001","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The spatial variability of rainfall can affect streamflow and sediment transport volumes and peaks. Yet, the effect of climate change on the small-scale spatial structure of heavy rainfall and subsequent impacts on hydrology and geomorphology remain largely unexplored. In this study, the sensitivity of the hydro-morphological response to heavy rainfall at the small-scale resolution of minutes and hundreds of metres was investigated. A numerical experiment was conducted in which synthetic rainfall fields representing heavy rainfall events of two types, stratiform and convective, were simulated using a space-time rainfall generator model. The rainfall fields were modified to follow different spatial rainfall scenarios associated with increasing temperatures and used as inputs into a landscape evolution model. The experiment was conducted over a complex topography, a medium-sized (477 km2) Alpine catchment in central Switzerland. It was found that the responses of the streamflow and sediment yields are highly sensitive to changes in total rainfall volume and to a lesser extent to changes in local peak rainfall intensities. The results highlight that the morphological components are more sensitive to changes in rainfall spatial structure in comparison to the hydrological components. The hydro-morphological features were found to respond more to convective rainfall than stratiform rainfall because of localized runoff and erosion production. It is further shown that assuming heavy rainfall to intensify with increasing temperatures without introducing changes in the rainfall spatial structure might lead to overestimation of future climate impacts on basin hydro-morphology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000396006",,"2196-632X||2196-6311",,"10.5194/esurf-8-17-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/396006","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Temperature effects on the spatial structure of heavy rainfall modify catchment hydro-morphological response","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-31T03:11:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85078297689",,"000508196200001","Earth Surf.

We provide the first direct evidence that capillary driven liquid reconfiguration in porous media under reduced gravity conditions reduces oxygen diffusion pathways and enhances anoxic conditions within bacterial hotspots. Parabolic flight experiments using model porous media inoculated with aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria reveal the systematic enhancement of anoxic conditions during the reduced gravity periods in the presence but not in the absence of bacterial activity. The promotion of anoxic conditions under reduced gravity may lead to higher nitrous oxide and methane emissions relative to Earth conditions, on the other hand, anoxic conditions could be beneficial for perchlorate bioremediation of Martian soil.

Here we show that the colonization of non-planar surfaces by motile bacteria is largely controlled by flow. Using microfluidic experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that the velocity gradients created by a curved surface drive preferential attachment to specific regions of the collecting surface, namely the leeward side of cylinders and immediately downstream of apexes on corrugated surfaces, in stark contrast to where nonmotile cells attach. Attachment location and rate depend on the local hydrodynamics and, as revealed by a mathematical model benchmarked on the observations, on cell morphology and swimming traits.

Understanding the origins of events like these is important for water resources management. In this work, we provide data illustrating the individual and joint contributions of precipitation and evapotranspiration to low flows in both typical and dry years. To quantify how weather drives low flows, we explore how deviations from mean seasonal climate conditions (i.e., climate anomalies) of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration correlate with the occurrence and magnitude of annual 7 d lowest flows (Qmin) during the warm season (May through November) across 380 Swiss catchments from 2000 through 2018. Most warm-season low flows followed periods of below-average precipitation and above-average potential evapotranspiration, and the lowest low flows resulted from both of these drivers acting together. Low-flow timing was spatially variable across Switzerland in all years, including the driest (2003, 2011, 2015 and 2018). Low flows in these driest years were associated with much longer-lasting climate anomalies than the ≤2 month anomalies which preceded typical warm-season low flows in other years. We found that snow water equivalent and winter precipitation totals only slightly influenced the magnitude and timing of warm-season low flows in low-elevation catchments across Switzerland. Our results provide insight into how precipitation and potential evapotranspiration jointly shape warm-season low flows across Switzerland and potentially aid in assessing low-flow risks in similar mountain regions using seasonal weather forecasts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000454330",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-24-5423-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454330","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Effects of climate anomalies on warm-season low flows in Switzerland","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-03T03:53:59Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85096633912",,"000592926500001","Hydrol.

In this study, we demonstrate energetic O2 activation towards volatile organic compounds control can be realized via constructing a sophisticated surface hydrogen bond (HB) network bearing a dual-function. The extensive HBs established between hydroxyl-rich BiOCl surface and phosphoric acid are first shown to significantly weaken surface Bi-O bonds, enabling facile oxygen vacancies (OVs) generation. OVs, which act as the reliable electron capture and static O2 activation center, reinforce the interaction between photons and excitons for rapid charge carriers separation. Moreover, dynamic O2 activation with sluggish kinetics can be surmounted by another type of HBs localized between hydroxyl groups of phosphoric acid and OV-adsorbed O2. These unique localized HBs facilitate interfacial electron transfer from BiOCl to O2, displaying a unique energy coupling route between charge carriers and reactants. For simulated indoor toluene oxidation, the substantially boosted O2 activation is shown to accelerate the kinetic processes associated with the primary oxidation of toluene into benzaldehyde and benzoic acid, as well as aromatic ring opening towards deep oxidation. Undesirable intermediates accumulation and catalyst deactivation are thus avoided. The present work highlights the pivotal roles of HB for robust photocatalytic O2 activation. It will provide novel insights into the design of high-performance catalysts for efficient and safe control of indoor volatile organic compounds.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000448971",,"2044-4753||2044-4761",,"10.1039/d0cy01907k","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448971","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Dual-Function Surface Hydrogen Bonds Enable Robust O2 Activation for Deep Photocatalytic Toluene Oxidation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-31T13:40:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Metal halide perovskite nanocrystals: Solving their problematic instability through microfluidics","190750","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Spark",,,"85099750771",,"000609012400026","Catal.

Urban green spaces are often proposed as a mitigation strategy to counteract these adverse effects, and many recent developments of urban climate models focus on the inclusion of green and blue infrastructure to inform urban planning. However, many models still lack the ability to account for different plant types and oversimplify the interactions between the built environment, vegetation, and hydrology. In this study, we present an urban ecohydrological model, Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&C), that combines principles of ecosystem modelling with an urban canopy scheme accounting for the biophysical and ecophysiological characteristics of roof vegetation, ground vegetation, and urban trees. UT&C is a fully coupled energy and water balance model that calculates 2 m air temperature, 2 m humidity, and surface temperatures based on the infinite urban canyon approach. It further calculates the urban hydrological fluxes in the absence of snow, including transpiration as a function of plant photosynthesis. Hence, UT&C accounts for the effects of different plant types on the urban climate and hydrology, as well as the effects of the urban environment on plant well-being and performance. UT&C performs well when compared against energy flux measurements of eddy-covariance towers located in three cities in different climates (Singapore, Melbourne, and Phoenix). A sensitivity analysis, performed as a proof of concept for the city of Singapore, shows a mean decrease in 2 m air temperature of 1.1 ∘C for fully grass-covered ground, 0.2 ∘C for high values of leaf area index (LAI), and 0.3 ∘C for high values of Vc,max (an expression of photosynthetic capacity). These reductions in temperature were combined with a simultaneous increase in relative humidity by 6.5 %, 2.1 %, and 1.6 %, for fully grass-covered ground, high values of LAI, and high values of Vc,max, respectively. Furthermore, the increase of pervious vegetated ground is able to significantly reduce surface runoff.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000399323",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-13-335-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/399323","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"An urban ecohydrological model to quantify the effect of vegetation on urban climate and hydrology (UT&C v1.0)","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-02-14T03:18:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85078910805",,"000512297800002","Geosci. model dev.","1","Geoscientific Model Development","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

A better knowledge of the distribution of water vapor improves both GNSS- and InSAR-derived data products. In this work, we present a collocation framework to combine and retrieve zenith and (relative) slant tropospheric delays. GNSS and InSAR meteorological products are combined aiming at a better retrieval of the atmospheric water vapor. We investigate the combination approach with synthetic and real data acquired in the Alpine region of Switzerland. Based on a closed-loop validation with simulated delays, a few mm accuracy is achieved for the GNSS-InSAR combination in terms of retrieved ZTDs. Furthermore, when real delays are collocated, the combination results are more congruent with InSAR computed products. This research is a contribution to improve the spatio-temporal mapping of tropospheric delays by combining GNSS-derived and InSAR-derived delays.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000451868",,,,"10.1002/navi.398","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/451868","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","GNSS < Atmospheric Effects||Radar < Alternatives and Backups to GNSS||Troposphere < Atmospheric Effects","A collocation framework to retrieve tropospheric delays from a combination of GNSS and InSAR","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-18T12:37:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,"High-Resolution Atmospheric Water Vapor Fields by Spaceborne Geodetic Sensing, Tomographic Fusion, and Atmospheric Modeling","168952","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85096761244",,"000584814200001",,"4","Navigation","67","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.
