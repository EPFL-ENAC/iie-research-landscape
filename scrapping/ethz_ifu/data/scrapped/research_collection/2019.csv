While mechanisms of dewatering in sludges from wastewater treatment are well understood, it is not clear how dewatering of faecal sludge fits into the framework of existing knowledge. We evaluate physical-chemical parameters, including EPS and cations, and demographic (source), environmental (microbial community), and technical factors (residence time) as possible predictors of dewatering performance in faecal sludge, and make comparisons to the existing conceptual model for wastewater sludge. Faecal sludge from public toilets took longer to dewater than sludge from other sources, and had turbid supernatant after settling. Slow dewatering and turbid supernatant corresponded to high EPS and monovalent cation concentrations, conductivity, and pH, but cake solids after dewatering was not correlated with EPS or other factors. Faecal sludges with higher EPS appeared less stabilised than those with lower EPS, potentially a result of inhibition of biological degradation due to high urine concentrations. However, distinct microbial community compositions were also observed in samples with higher and lower EPS concentrations. Higher EPS faecal sludge was comparable in dewatering behaviour and EPS content to anaerobically digested and primary wastewater sludges. However lower EPS faecal sludges had different dewatering behaviour than wastewater sludges and may be governed by different mechanisms.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000367398",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2019.115101","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/367398","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Fecal sludge||EPS||CST||Stabilization||Public toilet","Evaluation of conceptual model and predictors of faecal sludge dewatering performance in Senegal and Tanzania",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-09-30T17:32:12Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85072617034",,"000493220400009","Water Res.",,"Water Research","167","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

They are an important element of the carbon and water cycle as they can act as both sinks and sources. As a result, they can influence the local and global climate. At the same time, forests are an important economic factor as they provide wood and food, and of high ecological importance as they provide habitat for numerous plants and animals. Due to its importance, the mapping, inventory and assessment of forests and their changes worldwide become a priority for scientists and governments, and is the motivation for this thesis. In particular, the thesis focuses on the study of the three dimensional (3-D) forest structure, as it is a key parameter of the forest ecosystem useful for many applications like biomass estimation, plant biodiversity or forest management and productivity.   Since decades, the most common way to characterize forest structure has been the use of single-tree information collected in situ. However, this type of measurement is typically limited to small and accessible forest areas. Remote sensing techniques overcome these limitations allowing large coverage and the collection of information without physical contact. Across the different remote sensing techniques, synthetic aperture radars (SAR) play an essential role. They provide unique ability to systematically image large areas at high spatial and temporal resolution, while at the same time they allow penetrating into forest volumes (especially at low frequencies) providing information about its 3-D structure.  SAR tomography (TomoSAR) uses multiple SAR acquisitions at slightly different positions to reconstruct the 3-D radar reflectivity, by means of imaging techniques without the need of using scattering models. However, the potential of TomoSAR configurations to extract 3-D structural information with ecological meaning has not been fully assessed yet. In this context, the first goal of this thesis is to establish a link between TomoSAR measurements and 3-D forest structure. In this sense, a framework that allows the qualitative and quantitative characterization of the 3-D forest structure from tomographic SAR profiles has been proposed. From the statistical distribution of the local maxima of the TomoSAR profiles, two indices are proposed to describe the horizontal density and the vertical complexity of a forest. This approach has been evaluated on a TomoSAR L-band data set over a temperate forest in Germany, together with the structure obtained from single-tree ground measurements and Lidar data. The results show a high correlation between the structures derived from the three sources of data, which confirms the ecological significance of the proposed method. Moreover, the same methodology has been used to demonstrate the ability of TomoSAR profiles to detect and characterize structure changes of forest stands.  The second goal of the thesis is to evaluate different TomoSAR algorithms and configurations with a focus on forest structure applications. Fourier beamforming, Capon beamforming and compressive sensing have been analyzed with simulated and real TomoSAR data at L-band. The results indicate that compressive sensing is the most appropriate one for the characterization of forest structure as proposed in this thesis, but it has the drawback of introducing sometimes false local maxima. Furthermore, it has been found that in tandem-like (bistatic) TomoSAR implementations the reconstruction of the profiles is robust to temporal changes of the scattering on a longer time span, in contrast to repeat-pass (monostatic) implementations. Finally, the requirements of TomoSAR acquisitions for distinguishing different structure types have been evaluated in terms of vertical resolution, height of ambiguity and peak side-lobe level of the point spread function. The results show that, for a limited number of images (5 to 7), a non-uniform distribution of the tracks with low vertical resolution (10 to 15 m) is the best compromise to avoid higher values of the peak to sidelobe level that would degrade the quality of the TomoSAR profiles and their interpretation.  The results of the thesis underline the potential of TomoSAR as a 3-D imaging tool for forest structure applications and contribute to better understand the TomoSAR profiles. Moreover, they open the door to further evaluate, investigate and exploit the enormous amount of TomoSAR data that the two upcoming SAR missions (ESA’s BIOMASS and DLR’s Tandem-L) will provide over all forests of the Earth.","application/pdf",,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/390170","en","ETH Zurich",,,"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)||Tomographic imaging||Forest structure","Forest Structure Characterization from SAR Tomography",,"Doctoral Thesis","Closed access",,"DDC - DDC::0 - Computer science, information & general works::000 - Generalities, science||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC::3 - Social sciences",,"2020-01-14T10:09:02Z","9999-12-31",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"26470",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

There is, however, the potential to further reduce the uncertainties in these projections by developing innovative remote sensing methods. One of these remote sensing techniques, the polarimetric synthetic aperture radar interferometry (Pol-InSAR), is known since decades to have the potential to assess the geophysical properties below the surface of ice sheets, because of the penetration of microwave signals into dry snow, firn, and ice. Despite this, only very few studies have addressed this topic and the development of robust Pol-InSAR applications is at an early stage. Two potential Pol-InSAR applications are identified as the motivation for this thesis. First, the estimation and compensation of the penetration bias in digital elevation models derived with SAR interferometry. This bias can lead to errors of several meters or even tens of meters in surface elevation measurements. Second, the estimation of geophysical properties of the subsurface of glaciers and ice sheets using Pol-InSAR techniques. There is indeed potential to derive information about melt-refreeze processes within the firn, which are related to density and affect the mass balance. Such Pol-InSAR applications can be a valuable information source with the potential for monthly ice sheet wide coverage and high spatial resolution provided by the next generation of SAR satellites. However, the required models to link the Pol-InSAR measurements to the subsurface properties are not yet established.  The aim of this thesis is to improve the modeling of the vertical backscattering distribution in the subsurface of ice sheets and its effect on polarimetric interferometric SAR measurements at different frequencies.  In order to achieve this, polarimetric interferometric multi-baseline SAR data at different frequencies and from two different test sites on the Greenland ice sheet are investigated. This thesis contributes with three concepts to a better understanding and to a more accurate modeling of the vertical backscattering distribution in the subsurface of ice sheets. First, the integration of scattering from distinct subsurface layers. These are formed by refrozen melt water in the upper percolation zone and cause an interesting coherence undulation pattern, which cannot be explained with previously existing models. This represents a first link between Pol-InSAR data and geophysical subsurface properties. The second step is the improved modeling of the general vertical backscattering distribution of the subsurface volume. The advantages of more flexible volume models are demonstrated, but interestingly, the simple modification of a previously existing model with a vertical shift parameter lead to the best agreement between model and data. The third contribution is the model based compensation of the penetration bias, which is experimentally validated. At the investigated test sites, it becomes evident that the model based estimates of the surface elevations are more accurate than the interferometric phase center locations, which are conventionally used to derive surface elevations of ice sheets.

We performed a suite of numerical simulations at the Darcy scale that quantify the instantaneous, irreversible bimolecular reaction Aaq+Bs→Caq, under various transport conditions (Péclet numbers) and porous media configurations (correlation lengths). We find that the global reaction rate is sensitive to both the Péclet number and the correlation length. The total amount of product decreases with increasing Péclet number, while it increases with increasing correlation length. In addition, for all of these scenarios, the global reaction rate is shown to be time dependent and is an outcome of the anomalous transport behavior of the chemical species. The time-dependent behavior of the reaction rate is amplified with increasing Péclet number and decreasing correlation length and can be well approximated by a power law relationship. We find, too, that the transport behavior of the reaction products (C) often deviates from that of the inflowing reactant species (A), because reactions occur preferentially within the flow domain. Finally, and due to the influence of the Péclet number on reactive transport, we show that temporal variations in the magnitude of the flow field (i.e, changing the Péclet number over time) shift the reaction and transport behavior into a state measurably different than that for steady flow conditions.",,,,"0043-1397||1944-7973",,"10.1029/2019wr025585","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/520675","en","Wiley",,,,"Reactive Transport in Heterogeneous Porous Media Under Different Péclet Numbers",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-12-15T07:18:30Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Water Resour.

To determine when uses of PFASs have an essential function in modern society, and when they do not, is not an easy task. Here, we: (1) develop the concept of “essential use” based on an existing approach described in the Montreal Protocol, (2) apply the concept to various uses of PFASs to determine the feasibility of elimination or substitution of PFASs in each use category, and (3) outline the challenges for phasing out uses of PFASs in society. In brief, we developed three distinct categories to describe the different levels of essentiality of individual uses. A phase-out of many uses of PFASs can be implemented because they are not necessary for the betterment of society in terms of health and safety, or because functional alternatives are currently available that can be substituted into these products or applications. Some specific uses of PFASs would be considered essential because they provide for vital functions and are currently without established alternatives. However, this essentiality should not be considered as permanent; rather, constant efforts are needed to search for alternatives. We provide a description of several ongoing uses of PFASs and discuss whether these uses are essential or non-essential according to the three essentiality categories. It is not possible to describe each use case of PFASs in detail in this single article. For follow-up work, we suggest further refining the assessment of the use cases of PFASs covered here, where necessary, and expanding the application of this concept to all other uses of PFASs. The concept of essential use can also be applied in the management of other chemicals, or groups of chemicals, of concern.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000365088",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/c9em00163h","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/365088","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"The concept of essential use for determining when uses of PFASs can be phased out",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-09-19T08:23:35Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85073822559",,"000498711800002","Environ Sci Process Impacts","11","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

A common terminology for PFASs was recommended in 2011, including broad categorization and detailed naming for many PFASs with rather simple molecular structures. Recent advancements in chemical analysis have enabled identification of a wide variety of PFASs that are not covered by this common terminology. The resulting inconsistency in categorizing and naming of PFASs is preventing efficient assimilation of reported information. This article explores how a combination of expert knowledge and cheminformatics approaches could help address this challenge in a systematic manner. First, the “splitPFAS” approach was developed to systematically subdivide PFASs (for eventual categorization) following a CnF2n+1–X–R pattern into their various parts, with a particular focus on 4 PFAS categories where X is CO, SO2, CH2 and CH2CH2. Then, the open, ontology-based “ClassyFire” approach was tested for potential applicability to categorizing and naming PFASs using five scenarios of original and simplified structures based on the “splitPFAS” output. This workflow was applied to a set of 770 PFASs from the latest OECD PFAS list. While splitPFAS categorized PFASs as intended, the ClassyFire results were mixed. These results reveal that open cheminformatics approaches have the potential to assist in categorizing PFASs in a consistent manner, while much development is needed for future systematic naming of PFASs. The “splitPFAS” tool and related code are publicly available, and include options to extend this proof-of-concept to encompass further PFASs in the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000379529",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/c9em00321e","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/379529","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Exploring open cheminformatics approaches for categorizing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-11-22T03:37:40Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85074963160",,"000498711800017","Environ Sci Process Impacts","11","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Here, we propose a mechanism that exploits particle surface roughness to induce metastable wetting and obtain mechanically-responsive Pickering emulsions. We postulate that the phase inversion is driven by an in situ switch of the particle wettability from metastable positions at the interface following the input of controlled mechanical energy. Oil-in-water emulsions can be prepared at low energy using mildly hydrophobic rough colloids, which are dispersed in water and weakly pinned at the interface, and switched to water-in-oil emulsions by a second emulsification at higher energy, which triggers the relaxation of the particle contact angle. The same principle is demonstrated for the complementary emulsions using mildly hydrophilic colloids initially dispersed in oil. Our experiments and simulations support that the delicate interplay between particle surface design during synthesis and the energy of the emulsification process can encode a kinetic pathway for the phase inversion. Both organic and inorganic nanoparticles can be used, allowing for the future implementation of our strategy in a broad range of smart industrial formulations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000371467",,"1744-683X||1744-6848",,"10.1039/c9sm01352k","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/371467","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Mechanical phase inversion of Pickering emulsions via metastable wetting of rough colloids",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-18T09:44:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Two-dimensional self-assembled materials at liquid interfaces: basics, shear and patches||Complex colloids assembled using capillary interactions: a new route towards active materials","144646||172913||144646||172913||144646||172913","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,"85073125434",,"000496486700015",,"39","Soft Matter","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02020 - Dep.

These residues, when poorly managed, would become a detrimental environmental hazard in addition to its acid mine drainage effects. Nevertheless, given the contents of these tailings such as valuable metals and its minerals for construction applications, it is critical to transform this waste problem into a resource-recovery opportunity through sustainable processes in the future. Directly utilizing these tailings as inputs to produce different outputs, however, is not sufficient to justify that a process is environmentally friendly; the processes developed must be evidently better from a life cycle perspective than business as usual. This project aims to provide a life cycle based environmental assessment of the sulfidic tailings reprocessing and remediation in selected EU mine sites. Within the European Training Network ‘SULTAN’ H2020, this work should assist to find novel technologies for resource recovery and wastes valorization from mining industries. Performing life cycle assessment (LCA) at early process design would allow hotspots identification for environmental performance improvements before industrial scale is installed. Furthermore, an environmental assessment of the conventional tailings disposal method is also conducted to have the basis of comparison with the new processes. By analyzing the environmental assessments of tailings through multiple processing routes, the results will further provide holistic views of mine wastes resource-recovery solutions. Thus, this dissertation will contribute to a more comprehensive mine tailings life cycle inventory model, both at different processes scales and conventional tailings facility for enhancing its overall ecological performance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000479633",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/479633","en","ETH Zurich, Institute of Environmental Engineering","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Let’s be clear(-er) about mining wastes: Junks vs. valuables",,"Presentation","Open access",,,,"2021-04-21T04:49:30Z",,,,,"yes","3rd D-BAUG Meet and Share Your Research","October 24, 2019","Zurich, Switzerland",,,,"European Training Network for the remediation and reprocessing of sulfidic mining waste sites","812580","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

While chains swim more rapidly than single cells of the same species, chain formation also markedly reduces phytoplankton’s ability to maintain their bearing. This suggests that turbulence, which acts to randomize swimming direction, could sharply attenuate a chain’s ability to migrate between well-lit surface waters during the day and deeper nutrient-rich waters at night. Here, we use numerical models to investigate how chain formation affects the migration of phytoplankton through a turbulent water column. Unexpectedly, we find that the elongated shape of chains helps them travel through weak to moderate turbulence much more effectively than single cells, and isolate the physical processes that confer chains this ability. Our findings provide a new mechanistic understanding of how turbulence can select for phytoplankton with elongated morphologies and may help explain why turbulence triggers chain formation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000374052",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.aaw7879","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/374052","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Chain formation can enhance the vertical migration of phytoplankton through turbulence",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-31T03:23:08Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85074275363",,"000491132700067","Sci Adv","10","Science Advances","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Yet noise is often neglected when impact assessment studies are conducted and when policy interventions are designed. In this study, we provide a way to calculate the noise footprint of citizens directly determined by their use of private and public transport on land. The study combines the results of the large transport simulation model MATSim applied to Switzerland, with a noise characterization model, N‐LCA, developed in the context of life cycle assessment. MATSim results allow tracking the use of private and public transportation by agents in the model. The results after characterization provide a consumption‐based noise footprint, thus the total noise and impacts that are caused by the private mobility demand of the citizens of Switzerland. Our results confirm that road transportation is the largest contributor to the total noise footprint of land‐based mobility. We also included a scenario with a full transition to an electrified car fleet, which showed the potential for the reduction of impacts, particularly in urban areas, by about 55% as compared to the modeled regime with combustion engines.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000310225",,"1088-1980||1530-9290",,"10.1111/jiec.12837","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/310225","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","agent‐based modeling||industrial ecology||life cycle assessment||noise||private mobility demand||transportation","Noise-footprint from Personal Land-Based Mobility",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-12-12T08:37:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060649960",,"000488924100003","J. ind. ecol.","5","Journal of Industrial Ecology","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Multi-regional input-output databases contain all the information to assess impacts along the value chain, but standard calculation routines to track the impacts of any sector along the global upstream and downstream value chain are missing. Mapping the impacts of materials has been a particular challenge owing to difficulties with double-counting. This is attributed to the strong intertwining of the material supply chain meaning that different materials occur in the supply chains of other materials. Here, we present a new method which can be applied to any MRIO system to track the impacts of any sector or region without double-counting upstream and downstream the global value chain. We apply this approach to EXIOBASE3 and implement a cutting-edge set of regionalized environmental impact categories and socio-economic indicators. Applied to global material production, our method shows that the issue of double-counting (prevented in this study) would overestimate global impacts of materials by up to 30%. In contrast, assessing only the direct impacts would lead to an underestimation by ~20%. Our evaluation further reveals that 25–35% of global material-related impacts are embodied in trade among ten world regions. Thereby, we identify the major international trade relations of key materials and found a clear trend of industrialized nations causing impacts in less developed economies. It was further revealed that during 1995–2011, the share of materials in total global climate change impacts has remained almost constant at ~50%, but total impacts have significantly increased for minerals and fossils. Our results demonstrate the importance for improved environmental policy strategies that target several stages of the global value chain. The methodology is provided as Matlab tool and can be applied to any material, industrial sector and region to track the related impacts upstream and downstream the global value chain.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000346449",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.434","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/346449","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Double-counting||Environmental impacts||International trade||Life-cycle assessment (LCA)||Multi-regional input output analysis (MRIO)||Nexus between material impacts","A new method for analyzing sustainability performance of global supply chains and its application to material resources",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-06-08T12:19:24Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85066292786",,"000472024300015","Sci.

Thus, reliable assessments of future resource availability are needed to support the decision-making process. In Switzerland, similarly to other countries, only a limited part of the available wet biomass feedstock is currently used for anaerobic digestion. Understanding potential future trajectories of the available biomass amount is therefore essential to facilitate its deployment for energetic use and to establish adequate bioenergy strategies. Here, we utilized extensive government data, historical trends, and data from academic literature to identify relevant drivers and their trends. Starting with current biomass potential, the future availability and variation of resources was estimated by taking into account selected drivers and their projected future development. Our results indicated an increase of over 6% in available wet bioenergy resources by 2050 (from 43.4 petajoules (PJ) of primary energy currently to 44.3 PJ in 2035 and 45.4 PJ in 2050), where a Monte Carlo analysis showed that this projection is linked to high uncertainty. Manure remains by far the biomass with the largest additional potential. Possible consequences regarding the country’s pool of biogas facilities and their development are discussed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000367076",,"1996-1073",,"10.3390/en12183585","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/367076","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biomass feedstock||Energy||Future availability||Drivers||Monte Carlo","Long-Term Wet Bioenergy Resources in Switzerland: Drivers and Projections until 2050",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-09-28T08:35:33Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85072510106",,"000489101200181",,"18","Energies","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Urban green spaces are often proposed as a mitigation strategy to counteract these adverse effects and many recent developments of urban climate models focus on the inclusion of green and blue infrastructure to inform urban planning. However, many models still lack the ability to account for different plant types and oversimplify the interactions between the built environment, vegetation, and hydrology. In this study, we present an urban ecohydrological model, Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&C), that combines principles of ecosystem modelling with an urban canopy scheme accounting for the biophysical and ecophysiological characteristics of roof vegetation, ground vegetation and urban trees. UT&C is a fully coupled energy and water balance model that calculates 2 m air temperature, 2 m humidity, and surface temperatures based on the infinite urban canyon approach. It further calculates all urban hydrological fluxes, including transpiration as a function of plant photosynthesis. Hence, UT&C accounts for the effects of different plant types on the urban climate and hydrology, as well as the effects of the urban environment on plant well-being and performance. UT&C performs well when compared against energy flux measurements of eddy covariance towers located in three cities in different climates (Singapore, Melbourne, Phoenix). A sensitivity analysis, performed as a proof of concept for the city of Singapore, shows a mean decrease in 2 m air temperature of 1.1 °C for fully grass covered ground, 0.2 °C for high values of leaf area index (LAI), and 0.3 °C for high values of Vc,max (an expression of photosynthetic activity). These reductions in temperature were combined with a simultaneous increase in relative humidity by 6.5 %, 2.1 %, and 1.6 %, for fully grass covered ground, high values of LAI, and high values of Vc,max, respectively. Furthermore, the increase of pervious vegetated ground is able to significantly reduce surface runoff. These results show that urban greening can lead to a decrease in urban air temperature and surface runoff, but this effect is limited in cities characterized by a hot, humid climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000369204",,"1991-962X||1991-9611",,"10.5194/gmd-2019-225","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/369204","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"An urban ecohydrological model to quantify the effect of vegetation on urban climate and hydrology (UT&C v1.0)",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2019-10-08T13:17:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Geosci. model dev. discuss.",,"Geoscientific Model Development Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Today, mass-based indicators, such as recycling rates, are used to assess the circularity of individual products, firms and of entire countries. These indicators, however, fail to cover the environmental perspective – one of the most mentioned reasons to move from a linear to a circular economy. Here, we propose a complementary environmental-impact based indicator that measures the environmental value retained through reuse, remanufacturing, repairing or recycling. The indicator extends the focus from end-of-life to the entire life cycle and includes substitution of primary materials. Furthermore, it allows for monitoring the transition towards a circular economy from an environmental and possibly economic and social perspective. We provide three examples that highlight the application of the indicator and also reveal that common beliefs about the environmental performance of the circular economy are sometimes misleading and counter-productive.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000364533",,"2665-9727",,"10.1016/j.indic.2019.100005","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/364533","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Circular economy||Environmental sustainability||Environmental indicator||Monitoring||Value retention processes||Recycling","Measuring the Environmental Sustainability of a Circular Economy",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-09-17T13:13:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Environmental and Sustainability Indicators","1-2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

UT&C is a fully coupled energy and water balance model that calculates 2 m air temperature, 2 m humidity, and surface temperatures. It explicitly resolves biophysical and ecophysiological characteristics of ground vegetation, urban trees, and green roofs and models all urban water fluxes including evapotranspiration, canopy interception, infiltration, and soil moisture transport. UT&C accounts for variations in urban densities, building properties, and urban irrigation schemes. Hence, the model is able to account for the effects of different plant types on the urban climate and hydrology, as well as the effects of the urban environment on plant well-being and performance. UT&C is one of the first urban canyon parameterizations to include detailed ecohydrology. Its low computational demand allows for analyses spanning multiple years with an hourly time step, therefore, facilitating long-term and seasonal analysis.

The physiological origins of Kleiber’s law are still debated and generalizations of the law accounting for deviations from the scaling behavior have been proposed. Most theoretical and experimental studies of Kleiber’s law, however, have focused on the relationship between the average body size of a species and its mean metabolic rate, neglecting intraspecific variation of these 2 traits. Here, we propose a theoretical characterization of such variation and report on proof-of-concept experiments with freshwater phytoplankton supporting such framework. We performed joint measurements at the single-cell level of cell volume and nitrogen/carbon uptake rates, as proxies of metabolic rates, of 3 phytoplankton species using nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and stable isotope labeling. Common scaling features of the distribution of nutrient uptake rates and cell volume are found to hold across 3 orders of magnitude in cell size. Once individual measurements of cell volume and nutrient uptake rate within a species are appropriately rescaled by a function of the average cell volume within each species, we find that intraspecific distributions of cell volume and metabolic rates collapse onto a universal curve. Based on the experimental results, this work provides the building blocks for a generalized form of Kleiber’s law incorporating intraspecific, correlated variations of nutrient-uptake rates and body sizes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000361962",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.1906762116","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/361962","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Phenotypic heterogeneity||Synechococcus||Scenedesmus||Cryptomonas||Metabolic theory of ecology","Generalized size scaling of metabolic rates based on single-cell measurements with freshwater phytoplankton",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-09-03T02:30:26Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85071401621",,"000483396800032","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","35","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","116","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

To identify the most relevant trends, we conducted a horizon scan regarding how ubiquitous sensing will shape the future of urban drainage and wastewater management. Our survey of the international urban water community received an active response from both the academics and the professionals from the water industry. The analysis of the responses demonstrates that emerging topics for urban water will often involve experts from different communities, including aquatic ecologists, urban water system engineers and managers, as well as information and communications technology professionals and computer scientists. Activities in topics that are identified as novel will either require (i) cross-disciplinary training, such as importing new developments from the IT sector, or (ii) research in new areas for urban water specialists, for example, to help solve open questions in aquatic ecology. These results are, therefore, a call for interdisciplinary research beyond our own discipline. They also demonstrate that the water management community is not yet prepared for the digital transformation, where we will experience a data demand, i.e. a “pull” of urban water data into external services. The results suggest that a lot remains to be done to harvest the upcoming opportunities. Horizon scanning should be repeated on a routine basis, under the umbrella of an experienced polling organization.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000360368",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.8b06481","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/360368","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"How Urban Storm- and Wastewater Management Prepares for Emerging Opportunities and Threats: Digital Transformation, Ubiquitous Sensing, New Data Sources, and Beyond - A Horizon Scan",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-25T02:15:11Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85071068984",,"000480370600005","Environ.

This study compares start-up of AGS systems fed by different synthetic and municipal wastewaters (WW), characterised by increasing complexity in terms of non-diffusible organic substrate. Four AGS reactors were started with the same inoculum activated sludge and operated for one year. The development of AGS, settling characteristics, nutrient and substrate removal performance as well as microbial community composition were monitored. Our results indicate that the higher the content of diffusible organic substrate in the WW, the faster the formation of AGS. The presence of non-diffusible organic substrate in the influent WW led to the formation of small granules and to the presence of 20–40% (% of total suspended solids) of flocs in the AGS. When AGS was fed with complex influent WW, the classical phosphorus and glycogen accumulating organisms (PAO, GAO) were outcompeted by their fermentative equivalents. Substrate and nutrient removal was observed in all reactors, despite the difference in physical and settling properties of the AGS, but the levels of P and N removal depended on the influent carbon composition. Mechanistically, our results indicate that increased levels of non-diffusible organic substrate in the influent lower the potential for microbial growth deep inside the granules. Additionally, non-diffusible organic substrates give a competitive advantage to the main opponents of AGS formation – ordinary heterotrophic organisms (OHO). Both of these mechanisms are suspected to limit AGS formation. The presented study has relevant implications for both practice and research. Start-up duration of AGS systems treating high complexity WW were one order of magnitude higher than a typical lab-scale system treating VFA-rich synthetic WW, and biomass as flocs persisted as a significant fraction. Finally, the complex synthetic influent WW – composed of VFA, soluble fermentable and particulate substrate - tested here seems to be a more adequate surrogate of real municipal WW for laboratory studies than 100%-VFA WW.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000346517",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2019.100033","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/346517","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Aerobic granular sludge||Influent composition||Low-strength municipal wastewater||Microbial community||Particulate substrate","Organic substrate diffusibility governs microbial community composition, nutrient removal performance and kinetics of granulation of aerobic granular sludge",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-06-10T19:23:03Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85066401148",,,,,"Water Research X","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Thus, the life of individual microbes in their natural environments is a continual sequence of decisions based on the perceived chemical gradients. However, it has remained unclear to what extent the chemotaxis properties vary among cells of one species, and whether there is a spectrum of different ‘decision makers’ within populations of bacteria. In our recent study (Salek, Carrara et al., Nature Communications 10 (1), 1877), we combine microfluidic experiments with mathematical modeling to demonstrate that even in clonal populations, bacteria are individuals with different abilities to climb chemical gradients.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000361627",,"2311-2638",,"10.15698/mic2019.08.688","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/361627","en","Shared Science Publishers","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","bacterial chemotaxis||microfluidics||T-maze geometry||phenotypic heterogeneity||Escherichia coli||chemotactic sensitivity","Bacterial maze runners reveal hidden diversity in chemotactic performance",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-30T16:41:32Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85070972259",,,,"8","Microbial Cell","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Tropospheric delays are usually considered to be an error for both GNSS and InSAR, and are typically removed. However, recently these delays are also recognized as a signal of interest, for example for assimilation into numerical weather models or climate studies. The GNSS and InSAR are techniques of complementary nature, as one has sparse spatial but high temporal resolution, and the other very dense spatial coverage but repeat pass of only a few days. This raises expectations for a combination of these techniques. For this purpose, a comprehensive comparison between the techniques must be first performed. Due to the relative nature of InSAR estimates, we compare the difference slant tropospheric delays ( dSTD ) retrieved from GNSS with the dSTD s estimated using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) of 32 COSMO-SkyMed SAR images taken in a snow-free period from June to October between 2008 and 2013. The GNSS estimates calculated at permanent geodetic stations are interpolated to the locations of persistent scatterers using an in-house developed least-squares collocation software COMEDIE. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between InSAR and GNSS estimates averaged over all acquisitions is equal to 0.64 and larger than 0.8 for approximately half of the layers. Better agreement is obtained mainly for days with high variability of the troposphere (relative to the tropospheric conditions at the time of the reference acquisition), expressed as standard deviations of the GNSS-based dSTD s. On the other hand, the most common feature for the days with poor agreement is represented by very stable, almost constant GNSS estimates. In addition, there is a weak correlation between the agreement and the water vapor values in the area, as well as with the number of stations in the closest vicinity of the study area. Adding low-cost L-1 only GPS stations located within the area of the study increases the biases for most of the dates, but the standard deviations between InSAR and GNSS decrease for the limited area with low-cost stations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000358145",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs11151789","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/358145","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Tropospheric delays||InSAR||GNSS||PSI||Low-cost GPS||Alpine areas","Comparison of tropospheric path delay estimates from GNSS and space-borne SAR interferometry in alpine conditions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-13T09:26:47Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85070463337",,"000482442800053","Remote Sens.","15","Remote Sensing","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

A big obstacle lies in obtaining complete data, required for accurate structure determination. Many crystals have a preferred orientation on conventional, flat sample supports. This systematically shades some part of the sample and prevents the collection of complete data, even when several data sets are combined. We introduce two types of three-dimensional sample supports that enable the collection of complete data sets. In the first approach the carbon layer forms coils on the sample support. The second approach is based on chaotic nylon fibres. Both types of grids disrupt the preferred orientation as we demonstrate with a well suited crystal type of MFI-type zeolites. The easy-to-obtain three-dimensional sample supports have different features, ensuring a broad spectrum of applications for these 3D support grids.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000355679",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-019-11326-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/355679","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"3D-structured supports create complete data sets for electron crystallography",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-07-29T21:17:22Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85070700305",,"000477017300005","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

As a first step we modeled the ice flow field and the evolution of Gauligletscher from 1946 using a combined Stokes ice flow and surface mass balance model, which was calibrated with surface elevation and velocity observations. In a second step the modeled ice velocity fields were integrated forward-in-time, starting from the crash location. Our results suggest that the main body of the damaged aircraft will be released approximately between 2027 and 2035, 1 km upstream of the parts that emerged between 2012 and 2018.

Guantao County of Hebei Province, China, serves as an example to demonstrate the decomposition technique. The groundwater flow model of Guantao was constructed using observed heads as prescribed head boundary conditions. The model was coupled with Hydrus 1-D to calculate the groundwater recharge distribution in time reflecting the delay and damping effects of the soil column on seepage at the surface. The model was calibrated by adjusting parameters such as hydraulic conductivities, recharge infiltration ratios and specific yields. The calibrated parameters are then used in a large model with a boundary at a large distance from Guantao administrative boundary to determine the groundwater head changes due to inside drivers. The differences of the two models on the Guantao boundary serve as the specified head values on the boundary for a small-scale model, which is used to calculate the groundwater head imposed by outside drivers. To eliminate inconsistencies caused by the different types of boundary conditions of large and small models, the groundwater head changes due to inside drivers must be updated. The results indicate that the groundwater head changes in the center and south of Guantao County are influenced equally by both inside and outside contributions, while in the north outside contributions have the stronger impact. On average, 48.5 % of groundwater head changes in the whole of Guantao County is influenced by inside contributions, while 51.5 % is due to outside contributions. The sensitivity analysis shows that the groundwater head changes and their decomposition are much more sensitive to infiltration ratios than to the aquifer parameters. The parameters within Guantao have a certain influence on the net groundwater head changes, while the parameters outside of Guantao only have an influence on the decomposition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000353114",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-23-2823-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/353114","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Decomposition technique for contributions to groundwater heads from inside and outside of an arbitrary boundary: application to Guantao County, North China Plain",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-07-15T02:26:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85068577804",,"000474459300001","Hydrol.

The aim of the present study was to understand how operating conditions impact microbial competition and the control of NOB in hybrid PN/A systems, where biofilm and flocs coexist. A hybrid PN/A moving-bed biofilm reactor (MBBR; also referred to as integrated fixed film activated sludge or IFAS) was operated at 15 °C on aerobically pre-treated municipal wastewater (23 mgNH4-N L−1). Ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and NOB were enriched primarily in the flocs, and anammox bacteria (AMX) in the biofilm. After decreasing the dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) from 1.2 to 0.17 mgO2 L−1 - with all other operating conditions unchanged - washout of NOB from the flocs was observed. The activity of the minor NOB fraction remaining in the biofilm was suppressed at low DO. As a result, low effluent NO3− concentrations (0.5 mgN L−1) were consistently achieved at aerobic nitrogen removal rates (80 mgN L−1 d−1) comparable to those of conventional treatment plants. A simple dynamic mathematical model, assuming perfect biomass segregation with AOB and NOB in the flocs and AMX in the biofilm, was able to qualitatively reproduce the selective washout of NOB from the flocs in response to the decrease in DO-setpoint. Similarly, numerical simulations indicated that flocs removal is an effective operational strategy to achieve the selective washout of NOB. The direct competition for NO2− between NOB and AMX - the latter retained in the biofilm and acting as a “NO2-sink” - was identified by the model as key mechanism leading to a difference in the actual growth rates of AOB and NOB (i.e., μNOB < μAOB in flocs) and allowing for the selective NOB washout over a broad range of simulated sludge retention times (SRT = 6.8–24.5 d). Experimental results and model predictions demonstrate the increased operational flexibility, in terms of variables that can be easily controlled by operators, offered by hybrid systems as compared to solely biofilm systems for the control of NOB in mainstream PN/A applications.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000327328",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2018.12.051","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/327328","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Mainstream anammox||Partial nitritation/anammox||Hybrid system||IFAS||Biomass segregation||NOB washout||Mathematical modelling||Nitrite sink","Biomass segregation between biofilm and flocs improves the control of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in mainstream partial nitritation and anammox processes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-24T11:33:29Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85061635723",,"000462104100012","Water Res.",,"Water Research","154","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In this paper, we argue that the higher the persistence of a chemical, the greater the emphasis that it should be given in chemicals assessment and decision making. We provide case studies for three classes of highly persistent chemicals (chlorofluorocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) to exemplify problems unique to highly persistent chemicals, despite their otherwise diverse properties. Many well-known historical chemical pollution problems were the result of the release of highly persistent chemicals. Using evaluative modeling calculations, we demonstrate that if a chemical is highly persistent, its continuous release will lead to continuously increasing contamination irrespective of the chemical's physical–chemical properties. We argue that these increasing concentrations will result in increasing probabilities of the occurrence of known and unknown effects and that, once adverse effects are identified, it will take decades, centuries or even longer to reverse contamination and therefore effects. Based on our findings we propose that high persistence alone should be established as a sufficient basis for regulation of a chemical, which we term the “P-sufficient approach”. We argue that regulation on high persistence alone is not over-precautionary given the historical and ongoing problems that persistent chemicals have caused. Regulation of highly persistent chemicals, for example by restriction of emissions, would not only be precautionary, but would serve to prevent poorly reversible future impacts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000345064",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/c8em00515j","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/345064","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Why is high persistence alone a major cause of concern?",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2019-06-03T03:56:19Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85066110091",,"000468787800002","Environ Sci Process Impacts","5","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Consequently, the local viscosity of the fluid also varies in space with a non-linear dependence on the Darcy velocity. Therefore, an effective viscosity μeff is usually used to describe the flow at the Darcy scale. For most non-Newtonian flows the rheology of the fluid can be described by a (non linear) function of the shear rate. Current approaches estimate the effective viscosity by first calculating an effective shear rate mainly by adopting a power-law model for the rheology and including an empirical correction factor. In a second step this averaged shear rate is used together with the real rheology of the fluid to calculate μeff. In this work, we derive a semi-analytical expression for the local viscosity profile using a Carreau type fluid, which is a more broadly applicable model than the power-law model. By solving the flow equations in a circular cross section of a capillary we are able to calculate the average viscous resistance ⟨μ⟩ directly as a spatial average of the local viscosity. This approach circumvents the use of classical capillary bundle models and allows to upscale the viscosity distribution in a pore with a mean pore size to the Darcy scale. Different from commonly used capillary bundle models, the presented approach does neither require tortuosity nor permeability as input parameters. Consequently, our model only uses the characteristic length scale of the porous media and does not require empirical coefficients. The comparison of the proposed model with flow cell experiments conducted in a packed bed of monodisperse spherical beads shows, that our approach performs well by only using the physical rheology of the fluid, the porosity and the estimated mean pore size, without the need to determine an effective shear rate. The good agreement of our model with flow experiments and existing models suggests that the mean viscosity ⟨μ⟩ is a good estimate for the effective Darcy viscosity μeff providing physical insight into upscaling of non-Newtonian flows in porous media.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000346883",,"2296-424X",,"10.3389/fphy.2019.00071","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/346883","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","non-newtonian fluids||porous media||flow profile||shear rate||effective viscosity","Determination of the Effective Viscosity of Non-newtonian Fluids Flowing Through Porous Media",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-06-12T02:09:33Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000469467800001",,,"Frontiers in Physics","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Chemotaxis has been primarily studied as an average characteristic of a population, with little regard for variability among individuals. Here, we adopt a classic tool from animal ecology – the T-maze – and implement it at the microscale by using microfluidics to expose bacteria to a sequence of decisions, each consisting of migration up or down a chemical gradient. Single-cell observations of clonal Escherichia coli in the maze, coupled with a mathematical model, reveal that strong heterogeneity in the chemotactic sensitivity coefficient exists even within clonal populations of bacteria. A comparison of different potential sources of heterogeneity reveals that heterogeneity in the T-maze originates primarily from the chemotactic sensitivity coefficient, arising from a distribution of pathway gains. This heterogeneity may have a functional role, for example in the context of migratory bet-hedging strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000340550",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-019-09521-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340550","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Bacterial chemotaxis in a microfluidic T-maze reveals strong phenotypic heterogeneity in chemotactic sensitivity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-05-04T00:48:13Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064933603",,"000465201500010","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We assessed the removal of MC from added Microcystis aeruginosa biomass in GDMs fed with water from a lake with regular blooms of toxic cyanobacteria (ExpL) or from a stream without such background (ExpS). While initial MC removal was exclusively due to abiotic processes, significantly higher biological MC removal was observed in ExpL. By contrast, there was no difference in MC degradation capacity between lake and stream bacteria in separately conducted liquid enrichments on pure MC. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed a pronounced modularity of the biofilm communities, with a clear hierarchic distinction according to feed water origin and treatment type. Genotypes in the network modules associated with ExpS had significantly more links to each other, indicating that these biofilms had assembled from a more coherent source community. In turn, signals for stochastic community assembly were stronger in ExpL biofilms. We propose that the less “tightly knit” ExpL biofilm assemblages allowed for the better establishment of facultatively MC degrading bacteria, and thus for higher overall functional efficiency.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000340278",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2019.00843","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340278","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","biofilm||microcystin||drinking water||membrane filtration||microbial communities||network analysis||operational taxonomic unit","Source Community and Assembly Processes Affect the Efficiency of Microbial Microcystin Degradation on Drinking Water Filtration Membranes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-05-01T00:36:24Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000464973000001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Species distribution will be affected and some species are anticipated to be winners (increasing their range) or losers (at risk of extinction). Climate change vulnerability is seldom integrated when assessing threat status for lists of species at risk (Red Lists), even though this might appear an important addition in the current context. The main objective of our study was to assess the potential vulnerability of Ephemeroptera (E), Plecoptera (P) and Trichoptera (T) species to global warming in a Swiss mountainous region by supplementing Species Distribution Models (SDMs) with a trait-based approach, using available historical occurrence and environmental data and to compare our outcomes with the Swiss National Red List. First, we used nine different modelling techniques and topographic, land use, climatic and hydrological variables as predictors of EPT species distribution. The shape of the response curves of the species for the environmental variables in the nine modelling techniques, together with three biological and ecological traits were used to assess the potential vulnerability of each species to climate change. The joint use of SDMs and trait approach appeared complementary and even though discrepancies were highlighted between SDMs and trait analyses, groups of potential “winners” and “losers” were raised out. Plecoptera appeared as the most vulnerable group to global warming. Divergences between current threat status of species and our results pointed out the need to integrate climate change vulnerability in Red List assessments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000341308",,"2073-4441",,"10.3390/w11040636","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/341308","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Species Distribution Models||Ensemble forecasting||Swiss Alps||Climate change||Red Lists","Assessing the Vulnerability of Aquatic Macroinvertebrates to Climate Warming in a Mountainous Watershed: Supplementing Presence-Only Data with Species Traits",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-05-09T00:52:40Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85065029768",,"000473105700006",,"4","Water","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The analysis is based on open discharge daily time series from the Global Runoff Data Center database and daily MODIS snow cover data. Runoff events are identified by a base flow separation approach. The MODIS snow cover characteristics are derived from Terra 500 m observations (MOD10A1 dataset, V005) in the period 2000-2015 and include snow cover area, cloud coverage, regional snowline elevation (RSLE) and its changes during the snowmelt runoff events. The snowmelt events are identified by using estimated RSLE changes during a runoff event. The results indicate that in the majority of catchments there are between 3 and 6 snowmelt runoff events per year. The mean duration between the start and peak of snowmelt runoff events is about 3 days and the proportion of snowmelt events in all runoff events tends to increase with the maximum elevation of catchments. Clouds limit the estimation of snow cover area and RSLE, particularly for dates of runoff peaks. In most of the catchments, the median of cloud coverage during runoff peaks is larger than 80%. The mean minimum RSLE, which represents the conditions at the beginning of snowmelt events, is situated approximately at the mean catchment elevation. It means that snowmelt events do not start only during maximum snow cover conditions, but also after this maximum. The mean RSLE during snowmelt peaks is on average 170 m lower than at the start of the snowmelt events, but there is a large regional variability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000328367",,,,"10.2478/johh-2018-0011","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/328367","en","De Gruyter Open","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","MODIS||Snowmelt||Runoff events||Europe||Snowline elevation","MODIS snowline elevation changes during snowmelt runoff events in Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-03-01T05:03:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000449717800011",,"1","Journal of Hydrology and Hydromechanics","67","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We simulate fluid flow and transport through two-dimensional pore-scale matrices with varying structural complexity. With increasing Pe, the anomalous nature of the transport becomes enhanced as the host domain becomes more heterogeneous, due to the increasingly dominant effects of the complex velocity field. The sensitivity of (anomalous) transport to Pe is shown to be controlled by the medium structure. We quantify the effects of Pe by interpreting the numerical simulations within the continuous time random walk method (CTRW) framework, and incorporating Pe within the underlying tracer transition time distribution. We then investigate transport behavior subjected to temporal variation in the velocity field magnitude, accounting for tracer propagation controlled by Pe. Because of the nonlinear influence of Pe on the transport behavior, we show that temporal variations in the velocity field can lead to an increase in the anomalous nature of the transport.",,,,"1539-3755||1063-651X||1095-3787||1550-2376",,"10.1103/physreve.99.033108","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/520671","en","American Institute of Physics",,,,"Anomalous transport dependence on Péclet number, porous medium heterogeneity, and a temporally varying velocity field",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-12-15T07:13:51Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Phys. rev., E","3","Physical Review E","99","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Researchers focusing on the gap between consumption-based and production-based emissions have concluded that developed countries are systematically outsourcing emissions to developing countries. However, asymmetries in emissions embodied in trade may emerge due to differences in carbon intensity of energy and production between different countries, and need not be evidence of outsourcing. This study investigates if previous results concerning emission in –and outsourcing of developed and developing countries hold when emission flows are adjusted for technological differences. Two striking results are demonstrated: first, the magnitude of outsourcing is significantly smaller than previous studies have suggested, and, second, there is no clear divide between developing and developed countries. Large developed Anglophone countries (US, UK, Canada and Australia) were increasingly outsourcing emissions between 1995 and 2009 by shifting toward more carbon-intensive goods in their imports and less carbon intensive goods in exports, whereas other developed countries (i.e. the Nordics, advanced Asia and even the aggregate EU-27) maintained a positive emission trade balance. Among major developing countries, China is a major insourcer of emissions, while other emerging economies show no consistent pattern (e.g. India, Turkey and Brazil) or marginal outsourcing (e.g. Indonesia and Mexico). These results contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the impact of international trade on global carbon emissions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000472858",,"1462-9011||1873-6416",,"10.1016/j.envsci.2018.10.010","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472858","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Carbon leakage||Climate mitigation||Emission outsourcing||Input-output analysis||Emissions embodied in trade||Consumption-based accounting","Global outsourcing of carbon emissions 1995–2009: A reassessment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-04T06:56:54Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Environ.

While physical barriers such as ultrafiltration membranes effectively prevent the passage of bacteria, and chemical and biological treatments can effectively reduce the carbon content of the treated water, there exists a knowledge gap regarding the application of anti-bacterial strategies to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria following treatment. In this study, the effluent water from a household-scale greywater treatment system was fed to seven parallel experimental post-treatment tanks: three receiving direct chlorination with free chlorine residuals of 0.2, 1 or 5 mg Cl2/L, three with chlorine produced through electrolysis at the same residual concentrations, and one control with no chlorine added. For increasing concentrations of direct chlorination, the median total cell count (TCC) values were 9 × 104, 2.9 × 104 and 1.8 × 103 cells/mL, respectively. Electrolysis treatment produced very similar TCC concentrations, 8.8 × 104, 1.1 × 104 and 2.3 × 103 cells/mL. The TCC concentrations were lower than the concentration of the water entering each tank (∼3 × 105 cells/mL). Intact cell count (ICC) measurements indicated that the viable cell concentrations, were less than 10% of the TCC values. Though electrolysis treatment can produce powerful oxidants, such as hydroxyl radical, there was no evidence that electrolysis in this system provided additional benefits beyond chlorine production for control of total or intact cell counts. Oxidation of bacteria by chlorine was the dominant anti-bacterial mechanism in our system. Monitoring of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and assimilable organic carbon (AOC) did not suggest that carbon-limitation significantly impacted cell counts when chlorination or electrolysis treatment was applied. This work demonstrates that either direct chlorination or electrolysis treatment are able to reduce bacteria concentrations over long-term operation of a hand washing water treatment system. We recommend selecting chlorine residual targets such that a chlorine residual is maintained during periods of challenging operating conditions. We observed that a target residual of 1 mg Cl2/L, in our system, maintained the TCC below the concentration found in Zürich drinking water.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000324085",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2018.100020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/324085","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Greywater||Regrowth||Decentralized||Assimilable organic carbon (AOC)||Biologically activated membrane bioreactor (BAMBi)||Hydroxyl radical","Comparing the anti-bacterial performance of chlorination and electrolysis post-treatments in a hand washing water recycling system",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-11T04:33:18Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85061064633",,,,,"Water Research X","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The particle number and size distribution are crucial metrics for toxicological analysis and aerosol-cloud interactions. Here, a size-resolved BC particle number emission inventory was developed for the global civil aviation. The BC particle number emission is approximately (10.9 ± 2.1) × 1025 per year with an average emission index of (6.06 ± 1.18) × 1014 per kg of burned fuel, which is about 1.3% of the total ground anthropogenic emissions, and 3.6% of the road transport emission. The global aviation emitted BC particles follow a lognormal distribution with a geometric mean diameter (GMD) of 31.99 ± 0.8 nm and a geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 1.85 ± 0.016. The variabilities of GMDs and GSDs for all flights are about 4.8 and 0.08 nm, respectively. The inventory provides new data for assessing the aviation impacts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000322734",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-019-08491-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322734","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A number-based inventory of size-resolved black carbon particle emissions by global civil aviation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-01T19:34:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060914337",,"000457440500002","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Climate change is affecting the water budget of mountains at a fast pace and it has thus become a priority for hydrologists to quantify the vulnerability of each hydrological component to climate change, in order to assess the availability of water in the near future. However, our incomplete understanding of mountain hydrology implies that our knowledge about the future water supply of billions of people worldwide is limited. In this thesis, I use the ecohydrological model Tethys-Chloris (T&C) to (1) explore the responses of forests to the increasing atmospheric CO2, (2) quantify the major drivers of ecohydrological processes and their vulnerability to climate change across the European Alpine environments, and (3) partition the water budget into blue (hydrological) and green (biological) water fluxes and quantify the sensitivity of each component to temperature and precipitation change at the pan-Alpine scale. The first part of the thesis focuses on vegetation parameterization in ecohydrological models. It is a common practice to apply static vegetation parameters, although recently several studies have questioned this approach, showing that vegetation may adjust to climate change at shorter timescales than previously thought. This implies that traditional model approaches using temporally constant parameters might be biased. Recent evidence suggests that one such example of vegetation plasticity may be related to the increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Through numerical simulations with T&C, I show that plasticity in key vegetation parameters can explain the changes in water and carbon vegetation fluxes in 20 forest sites in the northern Hemisphere; changes that otherwise cannot be explained. In the second part of the thesis, I explore the key drivers of Alpine ecohydrology. Applying T&C on three case studies, I quantified the drivers of ecohydrological fluxes and explored the vulnerability of different Alpine ecosystems to climate change. By correlating the spatial distribution of ecohydrological responses with that of meteorological and topographic attributes, I computed spatially explicit sensitivities of net primary productivity, transpiration, and snow cover to air temperature, radiation, and water availability to evaluate their absolute and relative importance. The results demonstrate the sharp differences between different parts of the Alps, thus highlighting the need for a high-resolution assessment of the Alpine water budget. The third part of the thesis addresses the ecohydrological sensitivity to climatic variables across the Alps. I collected a dataset from meteorological and environmental agencies and universities from six countries and combined it with new distributed products of meteorological forcing, soil properties, vegetation and snow cover to perform and validate large-scale, high-resolution ecohydrological simulations of the entire Alpine region for a period of three years (2001-2003). The focus in these simulations is on the partitioning of the pan-Alpine water budget into runoff and evapotranspiration. These simulations allowed us to quantify the sensitivity of each component of the pan-Alpine water budget to climate change and show that even during major heatwaves, Alpine vegetation keeps high transpiration rates, thus amplifying the decrease in streamflow. These unique simulations permitted vi for the first time a very detailed understanding of water sinks and sources at the scale of the Alps, and a correlation analysis revealed the potential “hot spots” of changes in the water cycle in space and time under climate change. This study also shows that recent advances in ecohydrological modeling, combined with large scale datasets and new computational capabilities, can bridge the gap between coarse-scale Earth system models and detailed catchment analyses, providing more reliable, high-resolution climate change impact assessments in the world’s mountain regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000348653",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/348653","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Ecohydrology||Water use efficiency||Alpine ecohydrology||Climate change||Numerical modelling||Spatial heterogeneity||Ecosystem plasticity||Ecosystem sensitivity","Ecohydrological sensitivity to climatic variables: dissecting the water tower of Europe",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2019-06-20T09:28:07Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25949",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Although emerging low-power wireless communication techniques allow efficient data transfers with great above-ground performance, for underground or indoor applications in a large coverage range are difficult to achieve due to physical and topological limitations, particularly in dense urban areas. In this paper, we first discuss the range limitations of the LoRaWAN standard based on a systematic evaluation of a long-term operation of a sensor network monitoring in-sewer process dynamics. Analyses reveal an-on average-five-fold higher data packet loss for sub-surface nodes, which steadily grows with increasing distance to the gateway. Second, we present a novel LPWAN concept based on the LoRaR technology that enhances transmission reliability, efficiency, and flexibility in range-critical situations through meshed multi-hop routing and ensures a precise time-synchronization through optional GPS or DCF77 long-wave time signaling. Third, we illustrate the usefulness of the newly developed concept by evaluating the radio transmission performance for two independent full-scale field tests. Test results show that the synchronous LoRa mesh network approach clearly outperforms the standard LoRaWAN technique with regard to the reliability of packet delivery when transmitting from range-critical locations. Hence, the approach is expected to generally ease data collection from difficult-to-access locations such as underground areas.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000348400",,"2169-3536",,"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2913985","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/348400","en","IEEE","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Environmental engineering||Internet of Things||LoRaWAN||mesh networks||time-division multiple access||water pollution||wide area networks||wireless sensor networks||urban drainage","Synchronous LoRa Mesh Network to Monitor Processes in Underground Infrastructure",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-06-19T02:11:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000470254500001",,,"IEEE Access","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, the numerical models used for flood forecasting and risk mitigation suffer from a pronounced lack of monitoring data, which affects model accuracy. Monitoring data are necessary so the models, which contain undefined parameters, can be calibrated and validated against real flood events. In particular, it is important that the models are able to reproduce flood behavior in and around buildings, where the most damage is caused. However, conventional flow and water level sensors reach their limits in public spaces like streets due to irregular topography, moving obstacles, and the risk of vandalism. It has been suggested that surveillance cameras and social media could provide the necessary surface flooding data at a fraction of the cost of conventional sensors. The objective of this thesis is to explore how trend-like data can be extracted from surveillance footage and assimilated to boost the reliability of urban pluvial flood models.  Methodology and outcome The first deliverable of this thesis addresses the general lack of data necessary for researching novel, video-based monitoring methods. For this, the floodX data sets were created by conducting realistic flooding experiments at a special flood training facility, where conventional sensors and surveillance cameras collected data in parallel. Besides supporting multiple research projects, including the methods developed and tested in this thesis, the rapid publishing of the data pushes the bar for Open Research in the field of urban water management. The second main deliverable of the thesis is a method (SOFI) to automatically obtain trend-like flooding data from surveillance cameras with the help of a convolutional neural network. The SOFI method is fully automatic, which will be necessary for deployment due to privacy concerns and data volume challenges. Despite the limited number of images used, it was possible to train a deep convolutional neural network to detect floodwater in a range of flooding situations. By performing an analysis every few seconds, trend-like water level data was obtained that had, on average, a correlation of 75% with the actual water level. While the SOFI method suffers if image quality is poor or if large obstructions block the view of the water, it has the advantage of being applicable to footage without the need for on-site surveys. In the third part of this thesis, practical value of trend-like data for improving a flood model’s predictive performance was assessed under a variety of data qualities and sensor network layouts in the floodX case study. The results indicate that error-free trend-like data can be nearly as good as - and sometimes better than - sensors when it comes to improving model performance. However, this result only holds for trend-like data with uncorrelated errors or no errors at all. Correlated errors in the trend-like data reduced the improvement achieved and in some cases, the use of erroneous data even worsened model performance. Based on the results, models calibrated with trend-like SOFI data still need to be cross-validated to ensure that any errors present in the data are not compromising predictive performance.  Impact Although public surveillance is controversial from a social perspective, this thesis suggests that surveillance cameras could be used as a cost-effective data source to enhance the reliability of urban pluvial flood models, for the benefit of flood risk mitigation. For cities rushing to adapt to a changing climate with more intense rainfall, trend-like data obtained from surveillance footage, uncalibrated sensors, or other sources remain a promising alternative to costly conventional sensor data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000397587",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/397587","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Urban flooding||Surveillance systems||model calibration||Proxy data||Convolutional neural network (CNN)","Public Surveillance and the Future of Urban Pluvial Flood Modelling",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::620 - Engineering & allied operations",,"2020-02-07T14:32:39Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"26460",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Through systematic collection and analysis of these markers within wastewater samples it is possible to measure the public health of whole populations. The analysis of effluent and biosolids can also be used to understand the release of chemicals from wastewater treatment plants into the environment. Wastewater analysis and comparison with catchment specific data (e.g. demographics) however remains largely unexplored. This manuscript describes a national wastewater monitoring study that combines influent, effluent and biosolids sampling with the Australian Census. An archiving program allows estimation of per capita exposure to and consumption of chemicals, public health information, as well as per capita release of chemicals into the environment. The paper discusses the study concept, critical steps in setting up a coordinated national approach and key logistical and other considerations with a focus on lessons learnt and future applications. The unique combination of archived samples, analytical data and associated census-derived population data will provide a baseline dataset that has wide and potentially increasing applications across many disciplines that include public health, epidemiology, criminology, toxicology and sociology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000394979",,"0160-4120||1873-6750",,"10.1016/j.envint.2018.12.003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/394979","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Census||Wastewater||Influent||Effluent||Biosolids||Australia","A national wastewater monitoring program for a better understanding of public health: a case study using the Australian census.",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-28T14:10:20Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Environ.

However, first, the highly complex microbial community in wastewater treatment plants and very different compositions of wastewaters impede a complete understanding of nitrification. Second, the determination of the states of the process is seldom exact because sensors are subject to a high level of wear and tear. Consequently, instrumentation, control, and automation (ICA) of nitrification processes are a challenge. I hypothesize that soft-sensors - based on the signals of robust, physical sensors - and specially designed control loops, which do not need redundant information to correct for drift, can reduce the maintenance needs for the control of nitrification. Consequently, the econonomical application range for ICA of nitrification processes can be extended. A large part of this thesis is dedicated to the stabilisation of urine nitrification as a pretreatment for nutrient recovery. To this end, an online nitrite detection and an according control of the process are required. Furthermore, the thesis comprises an ammonia aeration controller, which is based on pH signals, to be used in municipal wastewater. The four chapters of the thesis focus on the following topics. The first chapter investigates calibration experiments for in-line UV-Vis sensors. Such sensors can serve as soft-sensors for numerous substances. With differently designed experi- ments, data for the calibration of UV-Vis based nitrite models in high strength wastewater was recorded. Online experiments executed in-situ allow calibrating similarly exact models like experiments which are conducted by spiking additional nitrite. The good performance of the models being based on online experiments is explained by the correlation of other light-absorbing substances in the process with nitrite. The second chapter evaluates the potential of a stoichiometry-based soft-sensor for nitrite. The stoichiometry of nitrification theoretically allows distinguishing the ammonia and the nitrite oxidation rates by means of the derivatives of the dissolved oxygen and of the pH signal and in turn detecting nitrite accumulations. We show that under relatively ideal conditions the dynamics in the ratio of the two derivatives show similarities with the dynamics in the nitrite concentration. Factors that deteriorate this information quality are identified. The third part of this thesis investigates how drifting sensor signals can be used as an input for a feedback controller without relying on redundant information to correct this drift. The controller shall prevent uncontrolled nitrite accumulation in a urine nitrification system. To this end, the controller does not use the absolute value of the nitrite signal, but its 1st and 2nd derivative as inputs. By controlled accumulation and degradation of nitrite, the controller can keep the derivatives continuously informative. The switch from substrate inhibition to substrate limitation of the nitrite oxidising bacteria can be identified by means of the inflection point in the signal. The developed controller is tested successfully on a lab-scale reactor. The fourth chapter of this thesis describes an ammonia based aeration controller. These controllers usually require maintenance intensive instrumentation. Therefore a new am- monia soft sensor for continuously operated municipal wastewater treatment plants is developed. It relies on the 1st derivative of a pH difference measured over the aerated zone. This soft sensor is successfully tested in a controller deployed on various municipal wastewater treatment plants. The controller was designed to increase its robustness towards drift in the pH signals.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000347049",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/347049","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Soft-Sensing, Automation, and Diagnosis for Nitriﬁcation",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::624 - Civil engineering",,"2019-06-12T12:52:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25893",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Here, we show how stratigraphy is being made in a lake that is heavily impacted upon by climate change and human activities. For one of the largest inner-Alpine catchments in the European Alps, we draw attention to how sedimentation rates are a product of non-stationary, reflexive, human actions. In Lake Geneva, we identify both a human-induced climate change (HCC) signature and the effects of a recent economic shock on sediment extraction upon sediment loading to and sedimentation rates in the lake. The HCC signature thus reflects the nature of climate change impacts in this basin, where sediment accumulation rates evolve with climate, but where economic conditions contribute to shifts in the supply of sediment to the lake. Following social theory, we call this glocalization because of the combined importance and inseparability of human impacts across different spatial scales. The nature of human impacts on sediment delivery to the lake mean that the influence of humans is unlikely to be captured in the long-term depositional record.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000353690",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-019-44914-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/353690","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Making stratigraphy in the Anthropocene: climate change impacts and economic conditions controlling the supply of sediment to Lake Geneva",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-07-17T18:38:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"SEDFATE: Sediment fate in a changing watershed during the Anthropocene","147689","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Sinergia",,,"85069268881",,"000473416000001","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Our surface water is impacted by a wide variety of contaminants released through human activities. One contaminant group of concern is micropollutants, which can have eco-toxicological effects in trace concentrations. Micropollutants, for example, include plant protection products and biocides, which are specifically designed to harm organisms. An important input pathway of micropollutants to surface water can be untreated sewer overflows (combined sewer overflows and stormwater outlets). However, the understanding of factors influencing the occurrence and levels of micropollutants is limited and challenged by: i) high spatial differences among sites, ii) a large number of discharge sites and iii) high temporal fluctuating discharge events. Research objective. This thesis intends to enhance our understanding of micropollutants in sewer overflows. It aims to investigate efficient methods to prioritize sewer overflow sites, which can be potentially harmful for receiving waters. The presented work focuses on the development of model prediction and efficient monitoring approaches and includes the following: i) a Swiss-wide model to assess how many discharge sites may be critical (Chapter 2), ii) fundamentals to develop passive sampling as an alternative monitoring method for short duration sewer overflows (Chapter 3 and 4) and iii) an extended monitoring study covering 20 combined sewer overflows (CSOs) to explore spatial differences among sites (Chapter 5). The main findings of this thesis are presented in the following. Model-based screening. A dynamic substance flow modeling approach was applied to 2,500 Swiss municipalities, considering micropollutant accumulation and wash-off on urban surfaces. The approach is based on the simplification, that there is one CSO and one stormwater outlet per municipality. The model allows for an estimation of the micropollutant concentration fluctuations in sewer overflows in 10-min resolution. The results show the importance of untreated discharges from sewer overflows as emission into receiving waters. The load contribution to sewer overflows of micropollutants in stormwater (e.g. plant protection products and biocides) is estimated to be considerably higher than of micropollutants in municipal wastewater (e.g. pharmaceuticals and other household chemicals). In addition, the results indicate that up to 83% of all urban catchments have sewer overflows that need to rely on upstream dilution in order to not exceed substance-specific environmental quality standards (EQS). Thus, this nationwide screening approach clearly highlights the need for a more detailed assessment of micropollutants in sewer overflows, and especially, the need for more measured data to allow the development of validated micropollutant prediction models. Measuring. Difficulties of monitoring sewer overflows with traditional methods are i) high concentration fluctuations with unknown event durations which require a high temporal sampling resolution, ii) many discharge sites and iii) placement, operation, and maintenance of equipment. Hence, passive samplers for polar organic micropollutants are analyzed systematically as a viable alternative to monitor short duration sewer overflows. The main advantage of passive samplers is the continuous accumulation of contaminants from the water phase, with no need for external energy sources nor for immense water sample storage volume. In a first step, the impact of fluctuating concentrations on deviations from true time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations was studied. The results highlight that the deviations induced by fluctuating concentrations are similar or smaller than uncertainties arising from chemical analysis and environmental factors. Understanding the uptake mechanism of micropollutants is one of the most important issues that needs to be resolved to reduce uncertainties in passive sampling data. The uptake experiments in sewer conditions for short duration events (<36h) indicate that the mass transfer is either dominated by the sorbent, or, by a multi-step mechanism. Therefore, a new semi-empirical mixed rate control model is proposed, which can be directly used for IV future studies under similar conditions. A field validation (3 locations, 10 events) shows that TWA concentration estimates measured by passive samplers are within a factor of 0.4 to 3.1 compared to composite water samples. Hence, the use of upper limit TWA concentration estimates is recommended for compliance checking with EQS. The findings clearly show that passive samplers are suitable to estimate TWA concentration ranges in sewer overflows and, thus facilitate identification of potentially critical discharge sites. Occurrence of micropollutants. Unique monitoring data from 20 CSO sites was collected with passive samplers. In total 13 polar organic micropollutants were analysed in 95 events (2-7 events per site). The results highlight indicator micropollutants, which were often found in the monitored CSOs and could be used in future monitoring studies: diclofenac, benzotriazole, carbamazepine, diazinon, diuron, carbendazim, mecoprop, metolachlor and terbutryn. Further, our results reveal that the spatial differences among CSO sites are bigger than the inter-event differences within a site for all studied micropollutants. Nevertheless, no significant correlation with land use data could be identified. The results, therefore, suggest that additional factors, most likely the contaminant usage pattern, have a considerable influence on the observed spatial differences. Both municipal wastewater and stormwater contributed to concentrations above the EQS in CSOs (not in the receiving water). In addition, the monitoring with passive samplers indicates that at least 13 out of 20 CSOs show concentrations above EQS in CSOs, and would rely on dilution by receiving waters to not exceed EQS. Outlook. Overall, the thesis shows the relevance of sewer overflows as a source of micropollutants entering receiving water bodies. The findings can serve as a basis for the development of a systematic and stepwise approach to efficiently identify critical sites. The development of such an approach would require joint efforts by eco-toxicologists, analytical chemists, regulators and wastewater engineers. This approach could be based on a simplified modeling approach as a first indicator, followed by passive sampling to assess micropollutant levels. To enable the widespread application of passive samplers in monitoring programs, regulators’ and operators’ confidence in passive sampling needs to be strengthened with more field validation studies and common guidelines.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000349443",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/349443","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","micropollutant||sewer overflow||Polar organic pollutant||Passive sampling||Chemcatcher||Field monitoring","Spatiotemporal variability of micropollutants in sewer overflows",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::624 - Civil engineering",,"2019-06-24T14:33:11Z","2021-06-25",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25892",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

We investigate long-term water quality data of 11 Swiss catchments with the objective to discern the influence of major catchment characteristics and anthropic activities on delivery of solutes in stream water. Magnitude, trends, and seasonality of water quality samplings of different solutes are evaluated and compared across catchments. Subsequently, the empirical dependence between concentration and discharge is used to classify the solute behaviors.  While the anthropogenic impacts are clearly detectable in the concentration of certain solutes (i.e., Na+, Cl−, NO3, DRP), the influence of single catchment characteristics such as geology (e.g., on Ca2+ and H4SiO4), topography (e.g., on DOC, TOC, and TP), and size (e.g., on DOC and TOC) is only sometimes visible, which is also because of the limited sample size and the spatial heterogeneity within catchments. Solute variability in time is generally smaller than discharge variability and the most significant trends in time are due to temporal variations of anthropogenic rather than natural forcing. The majority of solutes show dilution with increasing discharge, especially geogenic species, while sediment-bonded solutes (e.g., total phosphorous and organic carbon species) show higher concentrations with increasing discharge. Both natural and anthropogenic factors affect the biogeochemical response of streams, and, while the majority of solutes show identifiable behaviors in individual catchments, only a minority of behaviors can be generalized across the 11 catchments that exhibit different natural, climatic, and anthropogenic features.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000338392",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-23-1885-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338392","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Anthropogenic and catchment characteristic signatures in the water quality of Swiss rivers: a quantitative assessment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-04-17T00:52:44Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064131979",,"000463864500001","Hydrol.

There, these particles can more efficiently interact with solar radiation than at ground. Due to the lack of measurement data, the radiative forcing from aircraft exhaust aerosol remains uncertain. To better estimate the global radiative effects of aircraft exhaust aerosol, its optical properties need to be comprehensively characterized. In this work we present the link between the chemical composition and the optical properties of the particulate matter (PM) measured at the engine exit plane of a CFM56-7B turbofan. The measurements covered a wide range of power settings (thrust), ranging from ground idle to take-off, using four different fuel blends of conventional Jet A-1 and hydro-processed ester and fatty acids (HEFA) biofuel. At the two measurement wavelengths (532 and 870 nm) and for all tested fuels, the absorption and scattering coefficients increased with thrust, as did the PM mass. The analysis of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) revealed a significant mass fraction of OC (up to 90 %) at low thrust levels, while EC mass dominated at medium and high thrust. The use of HEFA blends induced a significant decrease in the PM mass and the optical coefficients at all thrust levels. The HEFA effect was highest at low thrust levels, where the EC mass was reduced by up to 50 %–60 %. The variability in the chemical composition of the particles was the main reason for the strong thrust dependency of the single scattering albedo (SSA), which followed the same trend as the fraction of OC to total carbon (TC). Mass absorption coefficients (MACs) were determined from the correlations between aerosol light absorption and EC mass concentration. The obtained MAC values (MAC532=7.5±0.3 m2 g−1 and MAC870=5.2±0.9 m2 g−1) are in excellent agreement with previous literature values of absorption cross section for freshly generated soot. While the MAC values were found to be independent of the thrust level and fuel type, the mass scattering coefficients (MSCs) significantly varied with thrust. For cruise conditions we obtained MSC532=4.5±0.4 m2 g−1 and MSC870=0.54±0.04 m2 g−1, which fall within the higher end of MSCs measured for fresh biomass smoke. However, the latter comparison is limited by the strong dependency of MSC on the particles' size, morphology and chemical composition. The use of the HEFA fuel blends significantly decreased PM emissions, but no changes were observed in terms of EC∕OC composition and radiative properties.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000343417",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-6809-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/343417","en","Copernicus GmbH","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Chemical composition and radiative properties of nascent particulate matter emitted by an aircraft turbofan burning conventional and alternative fuels",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-05-22T06:56:14Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85066090028",,"000468590900004","Atmos. chem. phys.","10","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Cities trying to adapt to this growing risk are challenged by a chronic lack of surface flooding data that are needed for flood risk assessment and planning. In this work, we propose a new approach that exploits existing surveillance camera systems to provide qualitative flood level trend information at scale. The approach uses a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to detect floodwater in surveillance footage and a novel qualitative flood index (namely, the static observer flooding index – SOFI) as a proxy for water level fluctuations visible from a surveillance camera's viewpoint. To demonstrate the approach, we trained the DCNN on 1218 flooding images collected from the Internet and applied it to six surveillance videos representing different flooding and lighting conditions. The SOFI signal obtained from the videos had a 75 % correlation to the actual water level fluctuation on average. By retraining the DCNN with a few frames from a given video, the correlation is increased to 85 % on average. The results confirm that the approach is versatile, with the potential to be applied to a variety of surveillance camera models and flooding situations without the need for on-site camera calibration. Thanks to this flexibility, this approach could be a cheap and highly scalable alternative to conventional sensing methods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000380012",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-23-4621-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/380012","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Scalable flood level trend monitoring with surveillance cameras using a deep convolutional neural network",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-11-24T03:25:54Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85075132409",,"000497758300003","Hydrol.

In order to investigate impacts of materials on a building level, we present a bottom-up building stock model that uses three dimensional and geo-referenced building data to determine volumetric information of material stocks in Swiss residential buildings. We used a probabilistic modeling approach to calculate future material flows for the individual buildings. We investigated six scenarios with different assumptions concerning per capita floor area, building stock turnover, and construction material. The Swiss building stock will undergo important structural changes by 2035. While this will lead to a reduced number in new constructions, material flows will increase. Total material inflow decreases by almost half while outflows double. In 2055 the total amount of material in- and outflows are almost equal, which represents an important opportunity to close construction material cycles. Total environmental impacts due to production and disposal of construction material remain relatively stable over time. The cumulated impact is slightly reduced for the wood-based scenario. The scenario with more insulation material leads to slightly higher material-related emissions. An increase per capita floor area or material turnover will lead to a considerable increase in impacts. The new modeling approach overcomes the limitations of previous bottom-up building models and allows for investigating building material flows and stocks in space and time. This supports the development of tailored strategies to reduce the material footprint and environmental impacts of buildings and settlements.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000238488",,"1088-1980||1530-9290",,"10.1111/jiec.12739","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/238488","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","building material||construction and demolition waste||geographic information systems (GIS)||industrial ecology||life cycle assessment (LCA)||material flow analysis (MFA)","Tracking construction material over space and time: Prospective and geo-referenced modeling of building stocks and construction material flows",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-02-02T16:55:06Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85043264886",,"000459917300019","J. ind. ecol.",,"Journal of Industrial Ecology","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

These variations act as a disturbance in tomographic focusing. In mountainous regions, the mitigation of these disturbances is particularly challenging due to strong spatial variations of the local atmospheric conditions and propagation paths through the troposphere. In this paper, we assess a data-driven approach to estimate these phase variations under a regression-kriging framework. The vertical stratification of the troposphere is modeled functionally, while the impact of the spatial turbulence is considered in a stochastic sense. The methodology entails an initial persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) analysis. The atmospheric phases isolated for the persistent scatterers (PS) within the PSI processing are considered as samples of the 3-D distribution of the phase delay variations over the scene. These atmospheric phases are regressed against the spatial coordinates in map geometry at PS locations. In turn, kriging predictions are obtained at each location along the elevation profile, where tomographic focusing is intended. A key point of this approach is that the requisite atmospheric corrections are incorporated within the tomographic focusing model. A case study has been performed on a data stack comprising 32 COSMO-SkyMed stripmap images acquired over the Matter Valley in the Swiss Alps, in the summers of 2008-2013. The results show locally improved deformation sampling with tomographic methods compared to the initial PSI solution, primarily due to the improved phase calibration. In general, this paper underscores the indispensability of height-dependent correction of atmospheric phases for SAR tomography.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000285833",,"0196-2892||1558-0644",,"10.1109/tgrs.2018.2855101","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/285833","en","IEEE","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","SAR||SAR interferometry||SAR Tomography||SAR tomography||Deformation monitoring||Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI)||Radar signal processing (Radar engineering)||Atmospheric phase delay||alpine environment","A Case Study on the Correction of Atmospheric Phases for SAR Tomography in Mountainous Regions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-30T14:01:02Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85052649884",,"000455089000032","IEEE Trans.

These devices have been exploited for a range of applications in the geosciences; for example to monitor glacier flows, the inflation of volcanoes, to de- tect land subsidence or to estimate environmental parameters. Spaceborne imaging radars are used in the reconstruction of post-seismic displacements, for the observation of land subsidence, in mar- itime surveillance, for the estimation of vegetation height and growth stage, the production of digital elevation models and many other applications. In most of the above cases, spaceborne —or to a lesser extent airborne— synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are employed to acquire the data. These systems acquire images with excellent spatial resolution and coverage; their main drawback —particularly in the case of spaceborne SAR— is the inflexible acquisition schedule, which does not allow to image the same region more often than every few days at best. However, the study of many natural processes requires a denser temporal sampling to capture their dynamics. Terrestrial radars —also known as ground based radars or ground based SAR— are complementary to space- and airborne SAR systems for the observation of fast changes of limited spatial extent since they permit greater flexibility in the acquisition mode and scheduling. This dissertation concentrates on KAPRI a Ku-Band polarimetric terrestrial radar interferometer based on the Gamma Portable Radar In- terferometer II (GPRI-II), which was modified by the manufacturer to add polarimetric imaging capabilities. The thesis focuses on two aspects: on the one hand the data processing and calibration techniques needed to obtain radar data free from distortion caused either by the device’s design and environmental effects; on the other hand the applications and the suitability of such data for the observation of changes in the natural environment. These two aspects are elaborated and assessed with three publications that are the main contributions of this research work; these papers focus respectively on data preprocess- ing and polarimetric calibration, phase calibration for differential interferometry and the analysis of polarimetric signatures of natural terrain. The first investigation deals with the data processing and calibration needed to convert the raw data acquired by the radar into properly focused polarimetric radar images. Preprocessing methods to mitigate the geometric distortion caused by the antenna frequency response inducing beam squint and cross-range phase ramp induced by the polar acquisition geometry were developed, followed by a polarimetric calibration model adapted to the system’s antenna design. These methods were validated by studying the response of corner reflectors, whose radar reflectivity and polarimetric signature is well- known. The results show that applying the proposed methods permits to obtain radar images with an imaging resolution close to the nominal resolution, free of cross-range phase ramps and with minimal residual polarimetric distortion. The second investigation is dedicated to the statistical modeling and correction of the atmospheric phase screen (APS), a significant obstacle to precise deformation monitoring using radar interferometry: by exploiting the sensitivity of the radar signal’s phase to variations in the distance between sensor and targets, this technique allows to measure displacements with a precision potentially limited only by the wavelength and by various sources of phase noise. However, other effects also modify the radar phase; among them variations in the distribution of atmospheric water vapor in the scene, which can be of a magnitude comparable to the displacement signal and may severely reduce the precision of the displacement estimates. The spatio-temporal statistical behavior of the APS and its mitigation has been extensively studied: the main assumption being that the APS is correlated in space and uncorrelated in time for the typical acquisition scenarios. However, there is lack of research on whether these results can translate to terrestrial radar interferometry (TRI), where the spatial extension of the scene is typically smaller and the acquisition repeat time can be as short as a minute. In this study, these questions are assessed with the help of an interferometric stack acquired using KAPRI near the Bisgletscher glacier, in the Swiss Alps. The analysis shows that the APS is correlated both in space and time but that its spatiotemporal statistics are approximately separable, so that given a stack of interferograms a fraction of the phase variation can be corrected on individual interferograms by spatial interpolation from a set of locations known not to be affected by deformation, while the remaining residual phase variation is only correlated in time and can be corrected by a temporal filter operating on individual pixels along the stack reducing the computational complexity of the correction. The third and last investigation returns to the polarimetric aspects of KAPRI and aims to assess the suitability of Ku-Band polarimetric data for the observation of natural terrain: while the polarimetric response of natural surfaces at L- and X- band are widely investigated thanks to the availability of space- and airborne sensors operating at these wavelengths, much less information is available at Ku- Band. Two datasets covering alpine terrain and an agricultural areas are used to this end by studying the polarimetric signatures of different terrain types, showing a consistently high cross-polarized power and Cloude-Pottier entropy for all land cover types but for individual highly reflective scatterers such as radar reflectors or single buildings. These observations suggest a high level of scattering randomness, likely due to the presence of depolarizing scattering from random media and to the combination of a short wavelength and a relatively large resolution cell size.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000334412",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/334412","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Radar||radar interferometry||radar polarimetry||terrestrial radar interferometric measurements||atmospheric phase corrections||Atmospheric phase delay||Polarimetric SAR||InSAR","Development of Calibration Methods For A Ku-Band Polarimetric Terrestrial Radar Interferometer",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::621.3 - Electric engineering||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2019-03-28T12:20:00Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25673",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.
