However, there is always a concern that the different physical properties between inert particles and biological particles may affect the filtration efficiencies of filter media. In the present study, the inert particles, e.g. NaCl and polystyrene latex (PSL), and biological particles, e.g. E.coli, B.sublitis, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and endotoxin, were used to evaluate the filtration efficiencies of the filtering materials of a surgical mask and a N95-rated respirator. The results showed that the difference in the filtration efficiencies of the N95-rated respirator for the tested inert particles and biological particles was smaller than 0.02%. The filtration efficiency of the surgical mask for PSL particles was lower than that for E.coli and B.subtilis particles with the same aerodynamic diameter because of the larger interception lengths of E.coli and B.subtilis particles. The average filtration efficiencies of the surgical mask for the tested NaCl particles and biological particles in the size range of 20–600 nm were similar. For the monodisperse particles, the filtration efficiency of the surgical mask for NaCl, BSA and endotoxin particles in the size range of 50–250 nm decreased in the above order due to the different shapes, dielectric properties, and multiply-charged fractions of the particles. The surgical mask presented the highest filtration efficiency for BSA particles and the lowest filtration efficiency for NaCl particles when the particle size was larger than 300 nm, which could be related to the difference in the electrostatic deposition and bounce probabilities. The present work revealed that the influence of several particle characteristics such as shape, dielectric property, and charge state on filtration efficiency should be considered when using common inert particles to replace biological particles to measure efficiencies of air filters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000602993","1383-5866","10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123472","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/602993","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Filtration efficiency||Inert particle||Bioaerosol||Electret filter||Aerosol generation","A comparison study of the filtration behavior of air filtering materials of masks against inert and biological particles","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-03-13T14:42:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"85149261237","000965780100001",,,"Separation and Purification Technology","313","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, facile processes with cost-effectiveness and large-scale throughput still present challenges. Nano-transfer printing together with the imprinting process shows potential for the efficient fabrication of 100 nm structures. Herein, a wafer-scale gold nanomesh (AuNM) structure on glass substrates with 100 nm scale features via nano-imprinting and secondary transfer printing technology is reported. Furthermore, potential sensing applications are demonstrated towards biochemical substance detection by using AuNM structures as highly responsive substrates for achieving the surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and as working electrodes of electrochemical analysisfor the detection of metallic ions. In the SERS detection mode, different nucleotides can be detected down to 1 nm level and distinguished via theirunique fingerprint patterns. As for electrochemical analysis mode, Pb2+ ions can be detected out of other interfering components with concentration down to 30 nm. These multimodal sensing mechanisms provide complementary informationand pave the way for low-cost and high-performance sensing platforms.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000606185","2365-709X||2365-709X","10.1002/admt.202201758","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/606185","en","Wiley-VCH","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","electrochemical sensors||gold nanomeshes||nanotransfer printing||plasmonics||SERS","Wafer-Scale Gold Nanomesh via Nanotransfer Printing toward a Cost-Efficient Multiplex Sensing Platform","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-04-03T03:18:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"000950294500001",,"9","Advanced Materials Technologies","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Mining waste valorization may offer environmental advantages over traditional make-waste-dispose approaches. However, a quantitative environmental assessment for large-scale reprocessing, accounting for future trends and a broad set of environmental indicators, is still lacking. This article assesses the life cycle impacts and resource recovery potential associated with alternative waste management through mine tailings reprocessing at a regional scale. Sulfidic copper tailings in the EU were selected as a case study. We perform prospective life cycle assessments of future reprocessing scenarios by considering emerging resource recovery technologies, market supply & demand forecasts, and energy system changes. We find that some reprocessing and valorization technologies in future scenarios may have reduction potentials for multiple impact indicators. However, results for indicators such as climate change and energy-related impacts suggest that specific scenarios perform sub-optimally due to energy/resource-intensive processes. The environmental performance of reprocessing of tailings is influenced by technology routes, secondary material market penetration, and choices of displaced products. The trade-off between climate change and energy related impacts, on the one hand, and toxicity impacts, on the other hand, requires critical appraisal by decision makers when promoting alternative tailings reprocessing. Implementing value recovery strategies for building material production, can save up to 3 Mt. CO2-eq in 2050 compared to business as usual, helping the copper sector mitigate climate impacts. Additional climate mitigation efforts in demand-side management are needed though to achieve the 1.5 °C climate target. This work provides a scientific basis for decision-making toward more sustainable reprocessing and valorization of sulfidic tailings.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000598085","0048-9697||1879-1026","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162038","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/598085","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Mine waste||Resource recovery||Circular economy||Life cycle assessment||Scenario analysis","Toward sustainable reprocessing and valorization of sulfidic copper tailings: Scenarios and prospective LCA","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-02-13T07:47:44Z",,,,"yes","European Training Network for the remediation and reprocessing of sulfidic mining waste sites","812580","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,"85147605221","000953425900001","Sci.

However, to formulate such conductive inks as well as to realize continuous conductive films in the absence of percolation issue are quite challenging. Herein, the scalable slot-die coating of Ti3C2Tx MXene aqueous inks is reported for the first time to yield large-area uniform TCEs with outstanding optoelectronic performance, that is, average DC conductivity of 13 000 ± 500 S cm−1. The conductive MXene nanosheets are forced to orientate horizontally as the inks are passing through the moving slot, leading to the rapid manufacturing of highly aligned MXene TCEs without notorious percolation problems. Moreover, through tuning the ink formulations, such conductive MXene films can be easily adjusted from transparent to opaque as required, demonstrating very low surface roughness and even mirror effects. These high-quality, slot-die-coated MXene TCEs also demonstrate excellent electrochemical charge storage properties when assembled into supercapacitors.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000600986","1616-3028||1616-301X","10.1002/adfm.202213183","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/600986","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","MXenes||percolation||slot-die coating||transparent conductive electrodes","Large‐Area Smooth Conductive Films Enabled by Scalable Slot‐Die Coating of Ti3C2Tx MXene Aqueous Inks","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-02-28T20:18:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"85147522623","000928833000001","Adv.

Our approach reconstructs changes in import flows after the entry into force of a preferential trade agreement (PTA) while taking into account different dynamics of trade diversion and trade growth. Our empirical application focuses on whether and how much the entry into force of 25 PTAs affected greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions embodied in Swiss imports between 2000 and 2018. The analysis is based on a unique dataset for more than 7′ 000 products that includes information on whether and how much of a given product was imported under a particular PTA or other trade rules. We find that the relocation of embodied GHG emissions attributed to the 25 PTAs is relatively small compared to the overall increase in imported GHG emissions. Most of the additional relocation of GHG emissions via trade diversion between 2000–2018 took place via imports under other trade rules. These findings indicate that the marginal effect of additional PTAs only has a small effect on overall embodied emissions in imports, at least when it comes to GHG emissions and as long as these PTAs have a similar scope as prior trade liberalisations. Given the widespread controversies over the environmental implications of PTAs, our approach provides a useful template for ex-post assessments of such implications. The results of such assessments can help stakeholders and policymakers in designing evidence based policies to identify and mitigate the “outsourcing” environmental impacts of consumption that may result from PTAs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000585656","0921-8009","10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.107690","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/585656","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","International trade||Environmental impacts||Preferential trade agreements||Carbon leakage||World Trade Organization (WTO)","How to estimate whether preferential trade agreements contribute to international environmental impact shifting.

These findings point to a risk for continued lock-in to fossil energy in the industry.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000585650","2211-3398","10.1016/j.coche.2022.100881","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/585650","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Mapping GHG emissions and prospects for renewable energy in the chemical industry","Review Article","Open access",,,"2022-12-07T14:53:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"85143511367",,,,"Current Opinion in Chemical Engineering","39","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In this study, we analyse the viability of urban mining in Switzerland using a representative survey of 2,500 Swiss respondents and an experiment with 15,000 employees of a Swiss institution. We estimate that there are around seven million unused phones with embedded gold worth USD 10 million in Switzerland. People do not particularly value their retired phones: 22% do not know why they keep it, and 40% said they are willing to sell their old device for less than USD 5. We further find that while informational treatments do not change recycling rates, reducing transaction costs of recycling double return rates from 2.1% to 5.5%. Lastly, while urban mining is not economically viable if we only consider the market value of embedded metals, it is profitable when taking into account the environmental cost of producing a new mobile device with metals from a primary mine.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591932","0921-8009","10.1016/j.ecolecon.2022.107735","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591932","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Urban mining||Metals||Recycling||Experiment||Cost-benefit analysis","Urban mining: The relevance of information, transaction costs and externalities","Journal Article","Open access",,"JEL - JEL::D - Microeconomics::D1 - Household Behavior and Family Economics::D15 - Intertemporal Household Choice; Life Cycle Models and Saving||JEL - JEL::Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics::Q3 - Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation::Q39 - Other||JEL - JEL::Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics::Q5 - Environmental Economics::Q53 - Air Pollution; Water Pollution; Noise; Hazardous Waste; Solid Waste; Recycling||JEL - JEL::C - Mathematical and Quantitative Methods::C9 - Design of Experiments::C93 - Field Experiments","2023-01-12T10:37:11Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"85145984604","000918078500001",,,"Ecological Economics","205","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02045 - Dep.

However, litter layer wetting/drying dynamics are often overlooked when estimating forest water budgets. Here, we present field and laboratory experiments characterizing water cycling in the forest-floor litter layer and outline its implications for subcanopy microclimatic conditions and for estimates of transpiration and recharge. Storage capacities of spruce needle litter and beech broadleaf litter averaged 3.1 and 1.9 mm, respectively, with drainage/evaporation timescales exceeding 2 days. Litter-removal experiments showed that litter reduced soil water recharge, reduced soil evaporation rates, and insulated against ground heat fluxes that impacted snowmelt. Deadwood stored similar to 0.7 mm of water, increasing with more advanced states of decomposition, and retained water for >7 days. Observed daily cycles in deadwood weight revealed decreasing water storage during daytime as evaporation progressed and increasing storage at night from condensation or absorption. Water evaporating from the forest-floor litter layer modulates the subcanopy microclimate by increasing humidity, decreasing temperature, and reducing VPD. Despite the relatively small litter storage capacity (<3.1 mm in comparison to similar to 10(2) mm for typical forest soil rooting zones), the litter layer alone retained and cycled 18% of annual precipitation, or 1/3 of annual evapotranspiration. These results suggest that overlooking litter interception may lead to substantial overestimates of recharge and transpiration in many forest ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000582214","1936-0592||1936-0584","10.1002/eco.2493","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/582214","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","deadwood||evaporation||forest||interception||litter||precipitation partitioning||storage||water cycle","Potential for significant precipitation cycling by forest-floor litter and deadwood","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-11-22T04:02:35Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"85141588620","000880360000001",,"2","Ecohydrology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, we dynamically harmonized the results from the two dominant source apportionment methods, the source-oriented and receptor models, by updating the emission inventories of primary PM2.5 from the major sectors based on the Bayesian Inference. An adjoint model was developed to efficiently construct the source-receptor sensitivity matrix, which was the critical information for the updates, and depicted the response of measurements to the changes in the emissions of various sources in different regions. The harmonized method was applied to a measurement campaign in Beijing from January to February 2021. The results suggested a significant reduction of primary PM2.5 emissions in Beijing. Compared with the baseline emission inventory of 2017, the primary PM2.5 emissions from the local residential combustion and industry in Beijing had significantly declined by about 90 % during the investigated period of the year, and the traffic emission decreased by about 50 %. The proposed methods successfully identified the temporally dynamic changes in the emissions induced by the Spring Festival. The methods could be a promising pathway for the harmonization of source-oriented and receptor source apportionment models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583201","0048-9697||1879-1026","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160312","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583201","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Source apportionment||Source-oriented model||Receptor model||Bayesian inference||Emission inventory","Dynamic harmonization of source-oriented and receptor models for source apportionment","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-11-25T20:57:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"85142141583","000894631700002","Sci.

Observed daily Tx and Tn at 154 stations in Ethiopia covering record lengths of 5–30 years were used as a reference. The statistics that define the Gaussian distribution (mean and standard deviation) of Tx and Tn from the station observations were interpolated in space to create a monthly climatology and interannual statistics at 0.05° × 0.05° resolution using a hybrid interpolation approach that combines linear regression with topographic and location attributes, and non-Euclidean inverse distance weighting interpolation. The interpolated monthly and interannual statistics were then used to debias the ERA5L Tx and Tn using a quantile mapping approach. Leave-one-out cross-validation showed that the mean absolute errors in the corrected and downscaled daily temperatures are about 0.7 °C for Tx and 1.1 °C for Tn, reducing the statistical biases in the ERA5L Tx and Tn by 68% and 25% respectively. For monthly climatology, 40–64% of the biases were removed for Tx while for Tn the reductions range from 19% to 32%. The correction also improved commonly used indices for extremes like the probability of warm days, cold days, and warm nights, but overestimated the probability of cold nights. The presented open-access Tx and Tn dataset is a substantial improvement over existing gridded temperature datasets for Ethiopia, such as ERA5L and the Climate Hazards Infrared Temperature with Station (CHIRTS), and we suggest it is suitable for a wide range of environmental applications, e.g. in the fields of hydrology, agriculture, and ecology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000589286","2352-3409","10.1016/j.dib.2022.108844","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589286","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate data||Linear regression||Inverse distance weighting||Spatial interpolation||Bias correction||Quantile mapping","Gridded daily 2-m air temperature dataset for Ethiopia derived by debiasing and downscaling ERA5-Land for the period 1981–2010","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-12-27T16:46:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"000916189800001",,,"Data in Brief","46","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The present work developed a scheme to update the obsolescent SO2 emission inventory in Chongqing obtained from Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China in 2008 (MEIC2008). The updated emission inventory was estimated by integrating the a priori knowledge of the baseline emissions and the current observations based on Bayesian inference, in which the source-receptor sensitivities were calculated by the Decoupled Direct Method in Three Dimensions in the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ DDM-3D). An analytical solution of the Bayesian theorem was derived based on the linear response assumption and applied to estimate the actual SO2 emissions. The updated emission inventory was comparable with the most recent MEIC emission inventory in 2016 and 2017, and was in line with the decline trend of SO2 emissions in Chongqing in the last decade. The adjustment of the emissions improved the accuracy in predicting SO2 concentrations with the developed method.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000587259","1352-2310||0004-6981||1352-3260","10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.119519","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587259","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Emission inventory||Inverse problem||CMAQ DDM-3D||SO2 pollution","Update of SO2 emission inventory in the Megacity of Chongqing, China by inverse modeling","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-12-15T04:07:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"85143518720","000928178200005","Atmos. environ.",,"Atmospheric Environment","294","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Part of the problem reflects the multifarious origins of these micropollutants, which can derive from urban and agricultural sources. Understanding how micropollutants harm ecosystems is a major scientific challenge due to asymmetries of stress across trophic levels and ecological surprises generated by multiple drivers interacting in human-impacted landscapes. We used field assays above and below municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in 60 sampling locations across 20 Swiss streams to test how micropollutants and nutrients originating from WWTPs affect two trophic levels (microbes and detritivores) and their role in leaf litter processing. Wastewater impacts were asymmetric across trophic levels, with the detritivore contribution declining relative to microbial-driven decomposition. The strength of negative impacts were context dependent, peaking at sites with the highest upstream abundances of detritivorous invertebrates. Diffuse pollution from intensive agriculture and wastewater-born micropollutants contributed to reduced litter processing rates, including indirect effects apparently mediated through negative influences of insecticides on detritivores. Asymmetries in stress responses across trophic levels can introduce quantitative changes in consumer-resource dynamics and leaf litter processing. This means functional redundancies at different trophic levels are insufficient to compensate for biodiversity losses, causing environmental stressors such as chemical pollutants to have pervasive ecosystem-level impacts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583260","0030-1299||1600-0706","10.1111/oik.09131","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583260","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","biodiversity||decomposition||micropollutants||multiple stressors||nutrients||wastewater","Environmental context determines pollution impacts on ecosystem functioning","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-11-28T04:09:35Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"85142008566","000884310000001","Oikos","2","Oikos","2023","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In this study, we detected past events of riverbank erosion along the Jamuna River in Bangladesh using time series of Sentinel-1 satellite radar imagery, ground-range-detected (GRD) data with a 12 d revisit cycle, available in the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Eroded land is detected by performing a land cover classification and by detecting land cover changes from vegetated areas before the monsoon to sand or water after the monsoon. Further, settlements are detected as persistent scatterers and classified as eroded if they are located on eroded land. We found that with Sentinel-1 data, erosion locations can be determined already 1 month after the end of the monsoon and hence potentially earlier than using optical satellite images which depend on cloud-free daylight conditions. Further, we developed an interactive GEE-based online tool allowing the user to explore where riverbank erosion has destroyed land and settlements along the Jamuna in five monsoon seasons (2015–2019).

In this study, we aim to explore the feasibility of a global chemical industry that fully relies on CO2 as its carbon source in 2050. We project the global annual CO2 demand as chemical feedstock to be 2.2-3.1 gigatonnes (Gt), well within the possible range of supply (5.2-13.9 Gt) from the power, cement, steel, and kraft pulp sectors. Hence, feedstock availability is not a constraint factor for the transition towards a fully CO2-based chemical industry on the global basis, with the exception of few regions that could face local supply shortages, such as the Middle East. We further conduct life cycle assessment to examine the environmental benefits on climate change and the trade-offs of particulate matter-related health impacts induced by carbon capture. We conclude that CO2 captured from solid biomass-fired power plants and kraft pulp mills in Europe would have the least environmental and health impacts, and that India and China should prioritize low-impact regional electricity supply before a large-scale deployment of CCUS. Finally, two bottom-up case studies of China and the Middle East illustrate how the total regional environmental and health impacts from carbon capture can be minimized by optimizing its supply sources and transport, requiring cross-sectoral cooperation and early planning of infrastructure. Overall, capture and utilization of unabatable industrial waste CO2 as chemical feedstock can be a feasible way for the net-zero transition of the industry, while concerted efforts are yet needed to build up the carbon-capture-and-utilization value chain around the world.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590811","1463-9262||1463-9270","10.1039/d2gc03047k","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590811","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Net-zero transition of the global chemical industry with CO2-feedstock by 2050: feasible yet challenging","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-01-07T07:37:08Z",,,,"yes","NCCR Catalysis SNF Management KTT","180544","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NCCR (NFS)",,"85143986709","000894108800001","Green Chem.","1","Green Chemistry","25","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The distribution of trapped particles in the filter media in depth and cake filtration regimes was recorded, and the evolution of pressure drop and filtration efficiency was analyzed in depth. This work systematically explored how structural factors such as filter thickness, solidity (i.e., packing density), bulk, and fiber orientation affect the dust holding capacity (DHC) of the filter media. We also investigated better composite filters based on various designed filters with multilayer, uniform, or gradient structures. The results showed that the filter L-bot with a finer fiber layer at the bottom had the highest dust loading capacity, 63.98% higher than the filter L-top with an inverted structure, followed by the gradient filter GI-lin and GI-exp with open pore structure near the inlet.

Estimating the source term plays a significant role in assessing the consequences of an accident to assist in actioning a proper emergency response. However, it is difficult to obtain information on the source term directly through the instruments in the reactor because of the unpredictable conditions induced by the accident. In this study, a deep learning-based method to estimate the source term with field environmental monitoring data, which utilizes the bagging method to fuse models based on the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN), was developed. To reduce the complexity of the model, the particle swarm optimization algorithm was used to optimize the parameters in the fusion model. Seven typical radionuclides (Kr-88, I-131, Te-132, Xe-133, Cs-137, Ba-140, and Ce-144) were set as mixed source terms, and the International Radiological Assessment System was used to generate model training data. The results indicated that the average prediction error of the fusion model for the seven nuclides in the test set was less than 10%, which significantly improved the estimation accuracy compared with the results obtained by TCN or 2D-CNN. Noise analysis revealed the fusion model to be robust, having potential applicability toward more complex nuclear accident scenarios.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000600984","2073-4433","10.3390/atmos14010148","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/600984","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","nuclear accident||radionuclides||source term estimation||gamma dose rate||convolutional neural network","Inversion Method for Multiple Nuclide Source Terms in Nuclear Accidents Based on Deep Learning Fusion Model","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-02-28T20:15:54Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"1","Atmosphere","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The spatial heterogeneity induced by the presence of two immiscible phases, here water and air, in the pore space generates complex flow patterns that dominate reactive mixing across scales. To assess the impact of different macroscopic saturation states (the fraction of pore volume occupied by water) on mixing-controlled chemical reactions, we consider a fast irreversible reaction between two initially segregated dissolved species that mix as one solution displaces the other in the heterogeneous flow field of the water phase. We use the pore-scale geometry and water distributions from the laboratory experiments reported by Jimenez-Martinez et al. (Geophys. Res. Lett. 42: 5316-5324, 2015). We analyze reactive mixing in three complementary ways. Firstly, we post-process experimentally observed spatially distributed concentration data; secondly, we perform numerical simulations of flow and reactive transport in the heterogeneous water phase, and thirdly, we use an upscaled mixing model. The first approach relies on an exact algebraic map between conservative and reactive species for an instantaneous irreversible bimolecular reaction that allows to estimate reactive mixing based on experimental conservative transport data. The second approach is based on reactive random walk particle tracking simulations in the numerically determined flow field in the water phase. The third approach uses a dispersive lamella approach that accounts for the impact of flow heterogeneity on mixing in terms of effective dispersion coefficients, which are estimated from both experimental data and numerical random walk particle tracking simulations. We observe a significant increase in reactive mixing for decreasing saturation, which is caused by the stronger heterogeneity of the water phase and thus of the flow field. This is consistently observed in the experimental data and the direct numerical simulations. The dispersive lamella model, parameterized by the effective interface width, provides robust estimates of the evolution of the product mass obtained from the experimental and numerical data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519180","0169-3913||1573-1634","10.1007/s11242-021-01710-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519180","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Upscaling||Mixing||Unsaturated porous media","Upscaling Mixing-Controlled Reactions in Unsaturated Porous Media","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-12-07T09:29:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"85118639086","000716233400001","Transp Porous Med","1","Transport in Porous Media","146","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

To achieve the desired functionality while minimizing costs, a combination of facile coating methods and accurate microstructural designs is required, but remains elusive. Herein, novel conductive and porous membranes are designed based on a facile and scalable approach to fabricating conformally coated gold layers on electrospun PVDF fibers (Au-PVDF-NFMs) via electroless plating. The deposition of a conformal and fully interconnected gold layer with an average thickness of circa 38 nm on the surface of nanofibers is confirmed by systematic characterizations. The high-conjunction gold layers endows a high electrical conductivity to the membranes, yielding a low sheet resistance of 1.2 Ω/sq. In addition, the membranes show integrated functionalities such as hydrophobicity and gas permeability. Notably, the NFMs also show excellent mechanical durability under both stretching and bending, with negligible conductivity losses after 1000 test cycles. Thanks to these properties, the Au-PVDF-NFMs demonstrates practical suitability as gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for electrochemical CO₂ reduction. The Au-PVDF-NFMs exhibit a substantial Faradaic efficiency towards CO, as high as ∼ 85 % at −0.7 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and are able to reach current densities of 100 mA cm⁻² at −0.95 V versus RHE.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000587257","0264-1275||1873-4197","10.1016/j.matdes.2022.111441","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587257","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Electroless plating","Flexible and ultrathin waterproof conductive cellular membranes based on conformally gold-coated PVDF nanofibers and their potential as gas diffusion electrode","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-12-15T04:07:37Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"85143541776","000936525200001","Mater. des.",,"Materials & Design","225","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

This surface-attached form of bacterial living is common across numerous natural and technical environments, including sediments, rivers, filters, and membranes. These environments can be categorized as porous media, meaning they consist of a solid matrix with void spaces. Fluid flow through porous media influences biofilm growth through both nutrient availability and shear stress, while in turn; growing biofilms clog pores and change fluid flow directions and velocities. In this thesis, this interplay is studied in detail at the pore-scale to understand fundamental mechanisms, which can drive larger-scale processes. Unravelling the highly complex interplay between biofilm development and local hydrodynamics is important for understanding links between ecological processes, biochemical cycling, and flow and mass transport in bioclogged porous media found among others in subsurface biofilm barriers, bioremediation and wastewater treatment.  A microfluidic platform was developed to visualize biofilm development at high spatial and temporal resolution using bright-field microscopy. The microfluidic device was designed to study porous media at three different pore sizes (75 µm, 150 µm, and 300 µm) with different imposed flow rates. To facilitate comparison, all porous media had the same porosity, which led to the same initial mean fluid flow velocity when imposing the same flow rate. The soilborn model organism Bacillus subtilis NCIB 3610 was used for all biofilm development experiments. Measurements of the pressure difference caused by the developing biofilm allowed the identification of correlations between bioclogging and the pressure response of the biofilm-porous medium system. Experiments using the microfluidic platform were conducted to systematically study the influence of flow rate and pore size on biofilm morphogenesis during the initial biofilm development. Then, the impact of the biofilm on the fluid flow velocity distribution was studied. Finally, as the porous medium approached full clogging, the interplay between biofilm growth and hydrodynamics was observed to lead to the formation of preferential flow paths (PFP) through the biofilm-porous medium system. The intermittent opening and closing behaviour of PFPs, which leads to strong changes in local fluid flow and mass transport, was studied to unravel its underlying mechanism and its relation to the pore size and the flow rate in the porous medium.  The biofilm morphogenesis was characterized by analyzing the biofilm cluster dynamics using parameters including the mean cluster area, total cluster area, number of clusters and fractal dimension. Larger flow rates led to larger cluster areas, while smaller pores sizes resulted in larger total cluster area over time, meaning faster bioclogging. Similarly, larger fractal dimensions were measured for smaller pore sizes, which correlated with the higher number of clusters for the smaller pore size as compared to larger pore sizes. The biofilm cluster size distribution scaling, a key parameter for upscaled models of bioclogged porous media, was found to temporally evolve between -2 and -1. Further, a method based on light transmission was developed to obtain the permeability field of the biofilm-porous medium system from experimental images. These permeability fields permitted to resolve the spatio-temporal variability in hydrodynamics during the biofilm development within the porous medium. During the bioclogging process, the temporal evolution of the heterogeneity in permeability peaked and then decreased, while the variance in velocity increased monotonically.  The mechanism for preferential flow path intermittency is a competition between biofilm growth and fluid-induced shear stress, which was shown by a combination of the experiments with a numerical model. The systematic study of twelve combinations of different flow rates and pore sizes showed that intermittent behaviour of PFPs occured at larger flow rates and pore sizes, likely due to higher shear stress and to the biofilm’s material properties. The PFP opening frequency increased with increasing shear rate, while the PFP closing speed was correlated with the nutrient mass flow following a Monod kinetic.  This work is a step forward in improving our understanding and prediction capability of biofilm-porous medium systems. These results could help inform the design of more optimized subsurface biobarriers for flow redirection, bioremediation, soil stabilization or biomineralization where precipitation reactions mainly take place in biofilms. In addition, these insights could facilitate the advancement of more technical applications such as water filtration systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000606793",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/606793","en","ETH Zurich",,,,"Biofilms in porous media: a pore-scale investigation of the interplay between biofilm development and local hydrodynamics","Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed","DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2023-04-05T10:10:47Z","2024-04-06",,,"yes",,,,,,"29090",,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Compounded by the need to supply mineral and metal resources for a sustainable energy transition and for global urbanization, mineral and metal mining and mining waste volumes, especially tailings, are expected to grow globally. In addition to long-term emissions and their adverse environmental effects, poor tailings management might lead to the collapse of waste storage, causing accidental environmental disasters. This pushes the mining industry to commit to developing alternative solutions for tailings management. Reprocessing and valorizing tailings using innovative metallurgical techniques can help reduce environmental burdens and reduce demand for virgin resources. To make sure that new tailings valorization technologies are sustainable, it is important to develop a sound scientific assessment for quantifying the environmental implications of mine tailings management using a life cycle perspective. A better understanding of the environmental impacts of tailings management can help identify the long-term consequences of current disposal options and clarify the benefits of improved tailings management practices. Despite recent policy encouragement for minimizing harm and exploiting new resources from mine waste, these implementations are still unclear. In this context, the guiding research question of this thesis is: How can quantitative environmental methods support decision-making in resource recovery systems of mine tailings?  In order to enable informed environmental decisions, this thesis provides information on: (i) the short- and long-term emissions and resulting environmental impacts of tailings disposal under different technological and geographical conditions, (ii) which emerging reprocessing technologies are suitable for mitigating the environmental impacts through tailings valorization, along with (iii) the impacts of a modeled full-scale implementation of these technologies and ultimately, (iv) the assessment of future environmental impacts of widespread mine tailings reprocessing and valorization in Europe, when considering future scenarios.  A mix of scientific approaches in the field of geochemistry, metallurgical process modeling, and environmental assessment methods are applied to provide a site-specific tailings model. The spatial coverage in the first study is global, which can then be zoomed in to analyze facility-level environmental impacts. Subsequently, various technology upscaling frameworks and engineering-based upscaling approaches are utilized to estimate the environmental performance of numerous new (currently lab-scale) value recovery technologies from tailings. This step allows performing prospective life cycle assessment (LCA), with the ability to compare such valorization alternatives with conventional tailings depositions. The parametric LCA models account for technology inputs from process designers, considering interoperability between any new processes and allowing optimization of reprocessing and valorization routes. The models are then combined with a scenario analysis for the EU copper tailings management, considering changing future energy systems and metal/material flow dynamics.  This thesis is composed of three individual articles, in addition to an overarching introduction and conclusion. Article 1 investigates the site-specific life cycle inventories of copper tailings, capturing 80% of the world’s copper production. This work demonstrates the importance of mechanistic modeling and spatial resolution for modeling tailings emissions. It identifies environmental hotspots of tailings deposition for prioritizing mitigation agendas across the globe. Article 2 considers innovative repurposing technologies for tailings, resulting in multiple reprocessing routes with several secondary products as added-value resources. The detailed characterization of environmental impacts induced by such effort and environmental benefits associated with secondary resources are critically assessed. The results of this study, i.e., parameterized and upscaled LCA models, can be leveraged to detect technoenvironmental performance bottlenecks and indicate improvement potentials in the value chain. In Article 3, particular focus is given to the considerations of the futureoriented environmental assessment of copper tailings management in the EU. Combining datasets and approaches of Articles 1 and 2, Article 3 presents scenario-based LCA to estimate and compare the environmental impacts of different tailings treatment scenarios under various future perspectives, such as metal demand and energy transition. This article also aims to quantify the environmental benefits and impacts of alternative tailings management options. Environmental benefits related to climate change and ecotoxicity are primarily achieved through (i) offsetting energy-intensive construction materials, (ii) reducing tailings discharge volumes in the waste storage, and (iii) substituting primary products and hence saving tailings reprocessing and valorization impacts.  This thesis makes the following three contributions to the scientific literature. First, it develops input-dependent and site-specific models for quantifying emission releases from tailings, which vary across geological settings, climates, and ore processing technologies. Second, by integrating prospective approaches and fit-for-purpose treatment pathways, this thesis provides process-based LCA that demonstrates the holistic technological configurations for tailings repurposing from an environmental life-cycle perspective. Third, the scenario analysis for mine tailings disposal strategies enhances the existing understanding of tailings management's role in the LCA of copper by considering technological development and material systems. The environmental improvement potential of alternative tailings management to achieve 2050 climate targets is investigated.  Finally, the applied research presents three valuable insights for mining practitioners and policy decision-makers toward sustainable mine waste management. First, the global environmental ecotoxicity hotspots induced by copper tailings landfilling are characterized by regions with highly sulfidic ore types and high infiltration rates. Second, the emergence of resource recovery technologies to solve mine waste management challenges emphasizes two key elements: (i) the co-production of building materials such as cement and ceramics for maximum environmental benefits and (ii) on a process level, the continuous development of innovative technologies can further benefit from such prospective LCA due to transparent and modular nature of technology modeling. Third, large-scale reprocessing and valorization of tailings offer the potential to generate useful products from tailings and to reduce future environmental impacts. Tradeoffs exist between climate change and ecotoxicity impacts for different alternative tailings management scenarios. In addition to cradle-to-gate assessment, the environmental impacts associated with the use of tailings-derived products must also be carefully considered in future research. Supporting regulatory policies and incentives are needed to promote the use of secondary materials from mine tailings. The outcomes of this thesis can provide guidance on environmentally sensitive mining operations and future opportunities of tailings processing technologies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000606842",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/606842","en","ETH Zürich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)||Circular Economy||Mining and Metals||Waste Management||Climate scenarios||prospective life cycle assessment","Environmental Perspectives on Emerging Resource Recovery Systems of Mine Tailings: A Life Cycle Consideration","Doctoral Thesis","Open access","DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::600 - Technology (applied sciences)||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::620 - Engineering & allied operations",,"2023-04-05T16:26:42Z",,,,"yes","European Training Network for the remediation and reprocessing of sulfidic mining waste sites","812580","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020","29014",,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.
