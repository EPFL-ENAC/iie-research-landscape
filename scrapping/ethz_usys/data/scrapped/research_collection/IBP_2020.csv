Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) and terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1s. For the last decade available (2010 2019), EFOS was 9.6 ± 0.5 GtC yr-1 excluding the cement carbonation sink (9.4 ± 0.5 GtC yr-1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 1.6 ± 0.7 GtC yr-1. For the same decade, GATM was 5.1 ± 0.02 GtC yr-1 (2.4 ± 0.01 ppm yr-1), SOCEAN 2.5 ± 0.6 GtC yr-1, and SLAND 3.4 ± 0.9 GtC yr-1, with a budget imbalance BIM of -0.1 GtC yr-1 indicating a near balance between estimated sources and sinks over the last decade. For the year 2019 alone, the growth in EFOS was only about 0.1 % with fossil emissions increasing to 9.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr-1 excluding the cement carbonation sink (9.7 ± 0.5 GtC yr-1 when cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 1.8 ± 0.7 GtC yr-1, for total anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 11.5 ± 0.9 GtC yr-1 (42.2 ± 3.3 GtCO2). Also for 2019, GATM was 5.4 ± 0.2 GtC yr-1 (2.5 ± 0.1 ppm yr-1), SOCEAN was 2.6 ± 0.6 GtC yr-1, and SLAND was 3.1 ± 1.2 GtC yr-1, with a BIM of 0.3 GtC. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 409.85 ± 0.1 ppm averaged over 2019. Preliminary data for 2020, accounting for the COVID-19-induced changes in emissions, suggest a decrease in EFOS relative to 2019 of about -7 % (median estimate) based on individual estimates from four studies of -6 %, -7 %, -7 % (-3 % to -11 %), and -13 %. Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959 2019, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr-1 persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from diverse approaches and observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land-use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent discrepancy between the different methods for the ocean sink outside the tropics, particularly in the Southern Ocean. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Le Quéré et al., 2018b, a, 2016, 2015b, a, 2014, 2013).

Here, we present the Mapped Observation‐Based Oceanic DIC (MOBO‐DIC) product, a monthly DIC climatology developed based on the DIC measurements from GLODAPv2.2019 and a two‐step neural network method to interpolate and map the measurements. MOBO‐DIC extends from the surface down to 2,000 m and from 65°N to 65°S. We find the largest seasonal amplitudes of surface DIC in the northern high‐latitude Pacific (∼30 to >50 μmol kg−1). Surface DIC maxima occur in hemispheric spring and minima in fall, driven by the input of DIC into the upper ocean by mixing during winter, and net community production (NCP) driven drawdown of DIC over summer. The seasonal pattern seen at the surface extends to a nodal depth of <50 m in the tropics and several hundred meters in the subtropics. Below the nodal depth, the seasonal cycle of DIC has the opposite phase, primarily owing to the seasonal accumulation of DIC stemming from the remineralization of sinking organic matter. The well‐captured seasonal drawdown of DIC in the mid‐latitudes (23° to 65°) allows us to estimate the spring‐to‐fall NCP in this region. We find a spatially relatively uniform spring‐to‐fall NCP of 1.9 ± 1.3 mol C m−2 yr−1, which sums to 3.9 ± 2.7 Pg C yr−1 over this region. This corresponds to a global spring‐to‐fall NCP of 8.2 ± 5.6 Pg C yr−1.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000458718",,"0886-6236||1944-9224",,"10.1029/2020GB006571","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458718","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","DIC||seasonal variability||neural networks||SOM‐FFN||monthly climatology||NCP","Seasonal Carbon Dynamics in the Near‐Global Ocean","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-30T03:52:26Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097973473",,"000603665500007","Glob. biogeochem. cycles","12","Global Biogeochemical Cycles","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we present a new observational estimate of changes in ocean salinity since 1960 from the surface to 2000 m. We overcome some of the inconsistencies present in existing salinity reconstructions by using an interpolation technique that uses information on the spatiotemporal covariability of salinity taken from model simulations. The interpolation technique is comprehensively evaluated using recent Argo-dominated observations through subsample tests. The new product strengthens previous findings that ocean surface and subsurface salinity contrasts have increased (i.e., the existing salinity pattern has amplified). We quantify this contrast by assessing the difference between the salinity in regions of high and low salinity averaged over the top 2000 m, a metric we refer to as SC2000. The increase in SC2000 is highly distinguishable from the sampling error and less affected by interannual variability and sampling error than if this metric was computed just for the surface. SC2000 increased by 1.9% ± 0.6% from 1960 to 1990 and by 3.3% ± 0.4% from 1991 to 2017 (5.2% ± 0.4% for 1960–2017), indicating an acceleration of the pattern amplification in recent decades. Combining this estimate with model simulations, we show that the change in SC2000 since 1960 emerges clearly as an anthropogenic signal from the natural variability. Based on the salinity-contrast metrics and model simulations, we find a water cycle amplification of 2.6% ± 4.4% K−1 since 1960, with the larger error than salinity metric mainly being due to model uncertainty. © 2020 American Meteorological Society",,,,"0894-8755||1520-0442",,"10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0366.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454820","en","American Meteorological Society",,,"Climate change||Salinity||Climate records||Sampling","Improved Estimates of Changes in Upper Ocean Salinity and the Hydrological Cycle","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-12-06T19:33:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85091608502",,"000615171300020","J. climate","23","Journal of Climate","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are new generation adsorbents with previously demonstrated potential as filter media to improve virus removal. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the field applicability of MWCNT-filters for virus removal in water containing natural organic matter (NOM) as co-solute to viruses, using batch equilibrium experiments. Contrary to previous studies, our results showed with MS2 bacteriophages single-solute systems that the affinity of MWCNT for MS2 was low, since after 3 h of equilibration only 4 log10 reduction value (LRV) of MS2 (20 mL at an initial concentration of 106 PFU MS2/mL) were reached. Single solute experiments with Suwannee river NOM (SRNOM) performed with environmentally-relevant concentrations showed MWCNT surface saturation at initial SRNOM concentrations between 10 and 15 mgC/L, for water pH between 5.2 and 8.7. These results suggested that at NOM:virus ratios found in natural waters, the NOM would competitively suppress virus adsorption onto MWCNT, even at low NOM concentrations. We confirmed this expectation with SRNOM-MS2 co-solute experiments, which showed an exponential decrease of the MS2 LRV by MWCNT with an increase in the initial SRNOM concentration. More interestingly, we showed that pre-equilibrating MWCNT with a SRNOM solution at a concentration as low as 0.4 mgC/L resulted in a LRV decrease of 3 for MS2, due to the formation of a negatively charged SRNOM adlayer on the MWCNT surface. Complementary batch experiments with natural NOM-containing waters and competition experiments with SRNOM in the presence of CaCl2 confirmed that the presence of NOM in waters challenges virus removal by MWCNT-filters, irrespective of the concentration and type of NOM and also in the presence of Ca2+. We therefore conclude that MWCNT-filters produced with commercially available pristine MWCNT cannot be considered as a viable technology for drinking water virus removal.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000423473",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2020.100058","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/423473","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Multiwalled carbon nanotubes||Virus treatment||Natural organic matter||Competitive adsorption||Drinking water","Competitive co-adsorption of bacteriophage MS2 and natural organic matter onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-28T02:43:37Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85086710219",,"000600678000004",,,"Water Research X","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The vast majority of PFAS are therefore either non-degradable or transform ultimately into stable terminal transformation products (which are still PFAS). Under the European chemicals regulation this classifies PFAS as very persistent substances (vP). We argue that this high persistence is sufficient concern for their management as a chemical class, and for all “non-essential” uses of PFAS to be phased out. The continual release of highly persistent PFAS will result in increasing concentrations and increasing probabilities of the occurrence of known and unknown effects. Once adverse effects are identified, the exposure and associated effects will not be easily reversible. Reversing PFAS contamination will be technically challenging, energy intensive, and costly for society, as is evident in the efforts to remove PFAS from contaminated land and drinking water.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000448509",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/d0em00355g","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448509","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"The High Persistence of PFAS is Sufficient for their Management as a Chemical Class","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-29T09:02:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85098465159",,"000599425400001","Environ Sci Process Impacts","12","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Currently, many different PFAS (on the order of several thousands) are used in a wide range of applications, and there is no comprehensive source of information on the many individual substances and their functions in different applications. Here we provide a broad overview of many use categories where PFAS have been employed and for which function; we also specify which PFAS have been used and discuss the magnitude of the uses. Despite being non-exhaustive, our study clearly demonstrates that PFAS are used in almost all industry branches and many consumer products. In total, more than 200 use categories and subcategories are identified for more than 1400 individual PFAS. In addition to well-known categories such as textile impregnation, fire-fighting foam, and electroplating, the identified use categories also include many categories not described in the scientific literature, including PFAS in ammunition, climbing ropes, guitar strings, artificial turf, and soil remediation. We further discuss several use categories that may be prioritised for finding PFAS-free alternatives. Besides the detailed description of use categories, the present study also provides a list of the identified PFAS per use category, including their exact masses for future analytical studies aiming to identify additional PFAS.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450251",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/d0em00291g","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450251","en","Royal Society of Chemistry Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"An overview of the uses of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-09T07:52:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85098451345",,"000599425400005","Environ Sci Process Impacts","12","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Here, we introduce MOSAIC (Modern Ocean Sediment Archive and Inventory of Carbon; DOI: https://doi.org/10.5168/mosaic019.1, mosaic.ethz.ch, Van der Voort et al., 2019), a (radio)carbon-centric database that seeks to address this information void. The goal of this nascent database is to provide a platform for development of regional to global-scale perspectives on the source, abundance and composition of organic matter in marine surface sediments, and to explore links between spatial variability in these characteristics and biological and depositional processes. The database has a continental margin-centric focus given both the importance and complexity of continental margins as sites of organic matter burial. It places emphasis on radiocarbon as an underutilized yet powerful tracer and chronometer of carbon cycle processes, and with a view to complementing radiocarbon databases for other earth system compartments. The database infrastructure and interactive web-application are openly accessible and designed to facilitate further expansion of the database. Examples are presented to illustrate large-scale variabilities in bulk carbon properties that emerge from the present data compilation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456975",,"1866-3591",,"10.5194/essd-2020-199","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456975","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Ocean Sediments||Organic carbon||Radiocarbon||13C||Carbon sequestration||MOSAIC||Database","MOSAIC (Modern Ocean Sediment Archive and Inventory of Carbon): A (radio)carbon-centric database for seafloor surficial sediments","Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2020-12-17T20:26:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Earth syst. sci. data, Pap. open discuss.",,"Earth System Science Data Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02330 - Dep.

Iron mineral transformations have been extensively studied in laboratory-based model studies. However, assessing the relevance of the observed pathways and transformation rates in soil environments can be experimentally challenging. Here, we studied ferrihydrite transformation in soil microcosms, and demonstrate that different soil environments influence the rate and nature of iron mineral transformations. Five rice paddy soils from south, east and south-east Asia were flooded in laboratory microcosms to simulate soil conditions at the start of a rice growing period. We introduced synthetic ferrihydrite samples to the soil in permeable polyethylene terephthalate fabric sachets (max interior dimension approx. 30 mm  12 mm  3 mm, pore size 52 µm), and followed the changes in the mineral composition inside the mineral sachets over time using X-ray diffraction (bulk) and Raman spectroscopy (spatially resolved). Mineral transformations were then analysed in the context of the soil and pore water properties.   Within two weeks, lepidocrocite and goethite partially replaced ferrihydrite in all bulk samples, except ferrihydrite that was incubated an acid-sulfate sub-soil from Thailand. However, ferrihydrite transformation rates and product composition varied widely, reflecting variations in the concentrations of key parameters of the soil solution, including dissolved metal concentrations, oxyanion concentrations and pH. Despite very high concentrations of Fe(II) and sulfate in some soil pore water (>10 mM Fe(II) and >20 mM SO42- after 2 weeks), and evidence of Fe and S reduction, neither magnetite nor sulphide minerals were observed, as might have been predicted from the results of laboratory-based ferrihydrite transformation experiments (e.g. Hansel et al., 2015; Troc et al., 1992). Still, higher iron and sulphate concentrations in solution were associated with faster transformation rates and higher ratios of lepidocrocite to goethite in the product, contradicting the findings of previous laboratory studies (Hansel et al., 2005). Local transformation is likely to have been much faster than bulk transformation rates, as observed in the colour distribution (Figure 1) and spatially resolved Raman spectroscopy of mineral identity across mineral sachet cross-sections. Mineral transformation kinetics and pathways are highly dependent on the location within the mesh bag with reference to the soil. The distribution of minerals in the mesh bags demonstrates the importance of the local environment to ferrihydrite transformation processes in soil, and contributes to understanding how to improve the in-situ investigation of soil mineral transformation processes.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/521324","en","Swiss Academy of Science (SCNAT); ETH Zurich",,,,"Observing in-situ transformations of ferrihydrite in redox-active paddy soil microcosms","Conference Poster","Metadata only",,,,"2021-12-17T13:42:49Z",,,,"yes","18th Swiss Geoscience Meeting (SGM 2020)","November 6-7, 2020","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,"https://geoscience-meeting.ch/sgm2020/andrew-grigg-has-uploaded-a-poster/",,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, little information is available on how their growth and colloidal stability are affected by the concentrations of metals and sulfide in solution, the presence of natural organic matter (NOM), and the possible incorporation of other metal cations such as Fe2+ or Mn2+. Here, we performed experiments on the formation of CdS nanoparticles (CdS NPs) in anoxic solutions with varying Cd (50, 100, 500 μmol L−1) and sulfide (50, 100, 1000 μmol L−1) concentrations in the absence and presence of Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA, 0, 5, 50 mg C per L). Additionally, we studied the influence of different metal-to-sulfide ratios and varying Mn2+ (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1 mmol L−1) concentrations on CdS aggregation using dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electrophoretic mobility measurements. The incorporation of Mn into the crystal lattice of CdS over 8 weeks was investigated with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Our results show that after 24 hours, small CdS primary particles with median diameters of a few nanometers ([d with combining tilde]TEM = 2–14 nm) formed large aggregates ([d with combining tilde]TEM = 167 nm) and that increasing SRFA concentrations progressively constrained the size of these aggregates (down to 19 nm) irrespective of the initial reactant stoichiometry. When NOM was absent or at low concentration, higher metal-to-sulfide ratios (≥1) and Mn2+ concentrations (≥0.5 mmol L−1) led to reduced colloidal stability of the suspensions. We found that in suspensions containing Mn2+, 10–30% of the Cd atoms in the crystal lattice were substituted by Mn during the formation of CdS, which was prevented by NOM.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000453120",,"2051-8153||2051-8161",,"10.1039/d0en00764a","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453120","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Effects of natural organic matter (NOM), metal-to-sulfide ratio and Mn2+ on cadmium sulfide nanoparticle growth and colloidal stability","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-26T04:46:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Mobility of trace metals in periodically flooded soils: Influence of reduced iron, manganese, and sulfur","156392","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85096330269",,"000590786100008","Environ.

Micaceous clay minerals and Mn oxides are considered to be key sorbents for Tl in soils. We studied the sorption and speciation of Tl in 36 geogenically Tl-rich topsoil materials from the Swiss Jura Mountains by combining chem-ical extractions, isotope exchange experiments, adsorption experiments, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and sorption modelling. We demonstrate that the relation between exchangeable and soluble Tl determined in batch extractions of soils with only geogenic and with freshly spiked Tl matches adsorption isotherms of freshly spiked Tl, and that this relation can be described with a published 3-site cation exchange model for Tl adsorption onto illite. Complemented with XAS data, the results show that micaceous clay minerals control the short-term solubility of Tl via cation exchange, but also the long-term sequestration of most geogenic soil Tl (>90%) via structural ﬁxation. Adsorption competition with K+ and NH4+ at the frayed edges of micaceous clay minerals greatly aﬀects Tl solubility. Increases in the dissolved concentrations of K and NH4 in soil pore water may therefore lead to the release of Tl into solution. The fractions of geogenic Tl associated with Mn oxides were about half as high as the fractions of exchangeable Tl. This Mn-associated Tl is not readily mobilized by cation exchange, but could be released during periodic water logging and soil reduction. In (periodically) reducing environments, the potential of Mn oxides for long-term Tl sequestration is therefore limited. In conclusion, the results from this study high-light the importance of micaceous clay minerals for Tl cycling in soils and sediments, and suggest that concepts developed to assess the sorption of (radio)caesium onto micaceous clay minerals in soils and sediments are transferable to Tl.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000432710",,"0016-7037||1872-9533",,"10.1016/j.gca.2020.07.037","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432710","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Thallium||Sorption||Soil||Illite||Clay||Manganese oxides","Thallium sorption and speciation in soils: Role of micaceous clay minerals and manganese oxides","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-08-26T10:10:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85089818717",,"000574850100006","Geochim.

Under sulfate-reducing conditions, the reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite leads to the release of associated constituents, which may be re-immobilized via sorption to secondary Fe minerals. To date, studies following the kinetics and transformation pathways of Fe(III)-(oxyhydr)oxides upon exposure to dissolved sulfide (S(−II)) have largely focused on pure Fe minerals. However, in nature, Fe(III)-(oxyhydr)oxides are often found in association with organic matter (OM). Because ferrihydrite–OM associations exhibit characteristics and biogeochemical reactivity differing from those of pure ferrihydrite, in this study, we compared sulfidization kinetics and transformation pathways of a pure ferrihydrite to those of ferrihydrite coprecipitated with contrasting organic ligands; polygalacturonic acid, galacturonic acid, and citric acid (C/Fe molar ratio ∼0.55). Incorporating aqueous- and solid-phase S and Fe speciation analyses (via wet chemistry techniques and S and Fe X-ray absorption spectroscopy) in addition to X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, we studied both rapid (<7 days) and long-term (12 months) mineral transformations as well as the impact of varying S(−II)/Fe molar ratios at neutral pH. Our results showed that at low S(−II)/Fe molar ratios (=0.1), poorly-crystalline Fe sulfide minerals (e.g. mackinawite) did not form in any (co)precipitate. In contrast, at higher S(−II)/Fe molar ratios (=0.5), mackinawite rapidly precipitated, with higher contributions detected in the coprecipitates than in the pure ferrihydrite. Aging of the samples led to further mineral transformations, including divergent pyrite and greigite precipitation, and an overall increase in the crystallinity of secondary mineral phases. Still, the fraction of residual ferrihydrite at 12 months was higher in the OM-containing coprecipitates, with the most ferrihydrite preservation observed in coprecipitates comprising carboxyl-poor ligands (galacturonic acid and citric acid). This suggests that the presence of OM inhibited S(−II)-induced ferrihydrite mineral transformations and that the composition of the associated OM influenced mineral transformation pathways. Collectively, these results suggest that further studies regarding sulfidization pathways should include OM in order to better represent environmental conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000453119",,"2051-8153||2051-8161",,"10.1039/d0en00398k","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453119","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Organic matter influences transformation products of ferrihydrite exposed to sulfide","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-26T04:46:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Iron mineral dynamics in redox-affected soils and sediments: Pushing the frontier toward in-situ studies","788009","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85096344554",,"000590786100009","Environ.

Here we discuss restrictions on the intentional use of primary microplastics: small solid polymer particles in applications ranging from agriculture to cosmetics. Microplastic hazards are uncertain, and actions are not similarly prioritized by all actors. In some instances, replacement is technically simple and easily justified, but in others substitutions may come with more uncertainty, performance questions and costs. Scientific impact assessment of primary microplastics compared to their alternatives relies on a number of factors, such as microplastic harm, existence of replacement materials and the quality, cost and hazards of alternative materials. Regulations need a precise focus and must be enforceable by these measurements. Policymakers must carefully evaluate under which contexts incentives to replace certain microplastics can stimulate innovation of new, more competitive and environmentally conscious materials.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000448968",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-020-19069-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448968","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Microplastic regulation should be more precise to incentivize both innovation and environmental safety","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-31T03:51:21Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems","168105||168105||168105||168105","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","Ambizione||Ambizione||Ambizione||Ambizione",,,"85093853721",,"000585943800008","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, knowledge on the formation mechanisms of these products is still scarce. In this work, we investigate the triplet-sensitized photodegradation of cysteine sulfinic acid, a (photo)degradation product of cysteine, to sulfate (SO42–). We use kinetic analysis, targeted experiments, and previous literature from several fields of chemistry to explain the elementary steps that lead to the release of sulfate. Our analysis indicates that triplet sensitizers act as one-electron oxidants on the sulfinate S lone pair. The resulting radical undergoes C–S fragmentation to form SO2, which becomes hydrated to sulfite/bisulfite (S(IV)). S(IV) is further oxidized to SO42– in the presence of triplet sensitizers and oxygen. We point out that the reaction sequence SO2 ⇌ S(IV) → SO42– is valid independently of the chemical structure of the model compound and might represent a sulfate photoproduction mechanism with general validity for DOS. Our mechanistic investigation revealed that amino acids in general might also be photochemical precursors of CO2, ammonia, acetaldehyde, and H2O2 and that reaction byproducts can influence the rate and mechanism of S(IV) (photo)oxidation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000448959",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.0c04340","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448959","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Mechanistic Insights into Dissolved Organic Sulfur Photomineralization through the Study of Cysteine Sulfinic Acid","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-31T03:49:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Reactivity-based characterization of photoexcited natural organic matter","188565","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85093898686",,"000584422500028","Environ.

The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the evidence regarding the environmental and human health impacts of fluoropolymers throughout their life cycle(s). Production of some fluoropolymers is intimately linked to the use and emissions of legacy and novel PFAS as polymer processing aids. There are serious concerns regarding the toxicity and adverse effects of fluorinated processing aids on humans and the environment. A variety of other PFAS, including monomers and oligomers, are emitted during the production, processing, use, and end-of-life treatment of fluoropolymers. There are further concerns regarding the safe disposal of fluoropolymers and their associated products and articles at the end of their life cycle. While recycling and reuse of fluoropolymers is performed on some industrial waste, there are only limited options for their recycling from consumer articles. The evidence reviewed in this analysis does not find a scientific rationale for concluding that fluoropolymers are of low concern for environmental and human health. Given fluoropolymers’ extreme persistence; emissions associated with their production, use, and disposal; and a high likelihood for human exposure to PFAS, their production and uses should be curtailed except in cases of essential uses.",,,,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.0c03244","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448503","en","American Chemical Society",,,"Salts||Fluoropolymers||Cations||Industrial manufacturing||Polymers","Are Fluoropolymers Really of Low Concern for Human and Environmental Health and Separate from Other PFAS?","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-10-29T07:44:37Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85093898347",,"000584422500003","Environ.

This study presents a novel automated analytical system for monitoring changes in the electron donating capacity (EDC) and UV absorbance of DOM during ozonation. In a first step, a quantitative photometric EDC assay was developed based on electron-transfer reactions from phenolic moieties in DOM to an added chemical oxidant, the radical cation of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS·+). The assay is highly sensitive (limit of quantification ∼0.5 mgDOC·L−1) and EDC values of model DOM isolates determined by this assay were in good agreement with values determined previously by mediated electrochemical oxidation (slope = 1.01 ± 0.07, R2 = 0.98). In a second step, the photometric EDC measurement method was transferred onto an automated fluidic system coupled to a photometer (EDC analyzer). The EDC analyzer was then used to monitor changes in EDC and UV absorbance of secondary wastewater effluent treated with ozone. While both parameters exhibited a dose-dependent decrease, a more pronounced decrease in EDC as compared to UV absorbance was observed at specific ozone doses up to 0.4 mgO3·gDOC−1. The concentration of 17α-ethinylestradiol, a phenolic micropollutant with a high ozone reactivity, decreased proportionally to the EDC decrease. In contrast, abatement of less ozone-reactive micropollutants and bromate formation started only after a pronounced initial decrease in EDC. The on-line EDC analyzer presented herein will enable a comprehensive assessment of the combination of EDC and UV absorbance as control parameters for full-scale ozonation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000432833",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2020.116235","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432833","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Secondary-treated wastewater||Ozonation||Micropollutant abatement||Electron donating capacity||UV absorbance","Quantification of the electron donating capacity and UV absorbance of dissolved organic matter during ozonation of secondary wastewater effluent by an assay and an automated analyzer","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-08-27T03:14:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85089525965",,"000580639800047","Water Res.",,"Water Research","185","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Arsenic concentrations increased by more than 10 µg/L in 14% (3/22) of re-sampled wells. Similarly, in a larger scale analysis wherein As concentrations measured in 137 wells in 2016 were compared to interpolated, baseline concentrations from 246 wells in 1999, As concentrations rose more than 10 µg/L in 30% of wells. Between 1999 and 2016, the percentage of all wells sampled in each basin-wide sampling campaign exceeding the World Health Organization's 10 µg/L drinking water limit increased from 38 to 64%. Principal Components Analysis (PCA), step-wise multiple regression, and Random Forest modeling (RF) revealed that high As concentrations are closely associated with high pH and temperature, and high concentrations of fluoride (F), molybdenum (Mo), lithium (Li), sodium (Na) and silica (Si), but low calcium (Ca) and nitrate (NO3) concentrations. Pumping-induced mixing with hot, geothermally impacted groundwater generates alkaline water through hydrolysis of silicate minerals. The rising pH converts oxyanion sorption sites from positive to negative releasing As (and Mo) to pore waters. The negative correlation between nitrate and As concentrations can be explained by conservative mixing of shallow, young groundwater with geothermally influenced groundwater. Therefore water carrying an anthropogenic contaminant dilutes water carrying geogenic contaminants. This process is enabled by long well screens. Over-exploitation of aquifers in geothermal regions for agriculture can drive As concentrations in water from production wells to toxic levels even as the total dissolved solids remain low.",,,,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2020.116257","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438634","en","Elsevier",,,,"Rising arsenic concentrations from dewatering a geothermally influenced aquifer in central Mexico","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-09-04T20:18:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85089882986",,"000580639800069","Water Res.",,"Water Research","185","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

MOB communities in lakes are diverse and vertically structured, but their spatio-temporal dynamics along the water column as well as physico-chemical parameters and interactions with other bacterial species that drive the community assembly have so far not been explored in depth. Here, we present a detailed investigation of the MOB and bacterial community composition and a large set of physico-chemical parameters in a shallow, seasonally stratified, and sub-alpine lake. Four highly resolved vertical profiles were sampled in three different years and during various stages of development of the stratified water column. Non-randomly assembled MOB communities were detected in all compartments. We could identify methane and oxygen gradients and physico-chemical parameters like pH, light, available copper and iron, and total dissolved nitrogen as important drivers of the MOB community structure. In addition, MOB were well-integrated into a bacterial-environmental network. Partial redundancy analysis of the relevance network of physico-chemical variables and bacteria explained up to 84% of the MOB abundances. Spatio-temporal MOB community changes were 51% congruent with shifts in the total bacterial community and 22% of variance in MOB abundances could be explained exclusively by the bacterial community composition. Our results show that microbial interactions may play an important role in structuring the MOB community along the depth gradient of stratified lakes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000449958",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2020.579427","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/449958","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Methanotrophs||Methane oxidation||pmoA||Bacterial interactions||Environmental factors||Diversity||Habitat specificity","Environmental and Microbial Interactions Shape Methane-Oxidizing Bacterial Communities in a Stratified Lake","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-05T20:14:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85094572175",,"000586882900001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This sink estimate is based on simulation results from global ocean biogeochemical models (GOBMs) and is compared to data-products based on observations of surface ocean pCO2 (partial pressure of CO2) accounting for the outgassing of river-derived CO2. Here we evaluate the GOBM simulations by comparing the simulated surface ocean pCO2 to observations. Based on this comparison, the simulations are well-suited for quantifying the global ocean carbon sink on the time-scale of the annual mean and its multi-decadal trend (RMSE <20 μatm), as well as on the time-scale of multi-year variability (RMSE <10 μatm), despite the large model-data mismatch on the seasonal time-scale (RMSE of 20–80 μatm). Biases in GOBMs have a small effect on the global mean ocean sink (0.05 PgC yr−1), but need to be addressed to improve the regional budgets and model-data comparison. Accounting for non-mapped areas in the data-products reduces their spread as measured by the standard deviation by a third. There is growing evidence and consistency among methods with regard to the patterns of the multi-year variability of the ocean carbon sink, with a global stagnation in the 1990s and an extra-tropical strengthening in the 2000s. GOBMs and data-products point consistently to a shift from a tropical CO2 source to a CO2 sink in recent years. On average, the GOBMs reveal less variations in the sink than the data-based products. Despite the reasonable simulation of surface ocean pCO2 by the GOBMs, there are discrepancies between the resulting sink estimate from GOBMs and data-products. These discrepancies are within the uncertainty of the river flux adjustment, increase over time, and largely stem from the Southern Ocean. Progress in our understanding of the global ocean carbon sink necessitates significant advancement in modeling and observing the Southern Ocean carbon sink including (i) a game-changing increase in high-quality pCO2 observations, and (ii) a critical re-evaluation of the regional river flux adjustment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000451408",,"2296-7745",,"10.3389/fmars.2020.571720","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/451408","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ocean carbon uptake||anthropogenic CO2||ocean carbon cycle model evaluation||riverine carbon flux||variability of the ocean carbon sink||seasonal cycle","Consistency and Challenges in the Ocean Carbon Sink Estimate for the Global Carbon Budget","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-16T04:56:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85095860104",,"000585734500001",,,"Frontiers in Marine Science","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These plants are widely vilified and motivate expensive control campaigns, but their presence may be providing a poorly recognized function in the cycling of excess nutrients. The capacity for floating plants to absorb nutrients from surface water has been understood for decades, primarily from their use in constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. Yet, in natural settings, there has not been to date any effort to quantify whether floating plant invasions represent important pools or fluxes of nutrients relative to those of the river catchments in which they occur. We found that seasonal hydrologic cycles in the Zambezi trap and flush floating plants from river choke points, such as dams and river confluences, on an annual basis. Peak plant biomass at such choke points constitutes a proxy for estimating annual plant-bound nutrient loads. We assessed the significance of floating vegetation as nutrient sinks by comparing annual plant-bound nutrient loading to conventional river nutrient loading (dissolved and particulate) for four tributaries of the Zambezi River in Zambia. We found that the relative importance of floating vegetation was greatest in the more urbanized catchments, such as the Maramba River draining the city of Livingstone, representing approximately 30% and 9% of annual digestible phosphorus and nitrogen flux respectively. We also found plant-bound phosphorus to be important in the Kafue River (19%), draining the industrial town of Kafue and extensive sugarcane plantations. These results demonstrate the great potential of floating plants to take up excess nutrients from natural river systems. Given the importance of hydrology in the life cycle of floating vegetation, controlled dam discharges may have an important role in managing them and their water quality treatment functions. © 2020, The Author(s).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000442923",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-020-72499-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/442923","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Potential of aquatic weeds to improve water quality in natural waterways of the Zambezi catchment","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-28T02:48:21Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary...","690268-2","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,"85091301295",,"000577219100016","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Past studies have shown that some benzotrifluorides are not stable under UV irradiation in water and convert into benzoic acids due to C-F bond hydrolysis. It was also observed, but never systematically studied, that the ring substituents play an important role on the direct photochemical reactivity of the CF3 moiety. In the present work, we explore the structure-reactivity relationship between ring substituent and direct photodefluorination for 16 different substituents, by determining fluoride production rates, quantum yields, and half-lives, and found that strong electron-donating groups enhance the reactivity toward hydrolysis. In addition, flufenamic acid, travoprost, dutasteride, cyflumetofen, flutoanil, and teriflunomide were also examined, finding that their direct photochemical reactivity could be qualitatively predicted based on their ring substituents.

Here we investigate the contributions of different carbon sources to macrofaunal biomass across five lakes in central Switzerland that range from oligotrophic to highly eutrophic. Macrofaunal communities change with trophic state, with chironomid larvae dominating oligotrophic and tubificid oligochaetes dominating eutrophic lake sediments. 13C-isotopic data suggest that the average contribution of methane-derived carbon to the biomass of both macrofaunal groups is similar, but consistently remains minor, ranging from only ~ 1 % in the oligotrophic lake to at most 12 % in the eutrophic lakes. The remaining biomass can be explained with assimilation of detritus-derived organic carbon. Low abundances of methane cycling microorganisms in macrofaunal specimens, burrows, and surrounding sediment based on 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences and copy numbers of genes involved in anaerobic and aerobic methane cycling (mcrA, pmoA) support the interpretation of isotopic data. Notably, 16S rRNA gene sequences of macrofauna, including macrofaunal guts, are highly divergent from those in tubes or sediments. Many macrofaunal specimens are dominated by a single 16S rRNA phylotype of Fusobacteria, α-, β-, γ-, or ε-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, or Parcubacteria. This raises the question whether dominant lake macrofauna live in so far uncharacterized relationships with detrital organic matter-degrading bacterial endosymbionts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000446782",,"1810-6277||1810-6285",,"10.5194/bg-2020-318","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446782","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Methane-derived carbon||Benthic macrofauna||Lacustrine sediment||Oligochaetes||Chironomid larvae||Methane-oxidizing bacteria||Endosymbionts","Carbon sources of benthic fauna in temperate lakes across multiple trophic states","Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2020-10-20T08:47:59Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Role of Bioturbation in Controlling Microbial Community Composition and Biogeochemical Cycles in Marine and Lacustrine Sediments","163371||163371||163371||163371||163371","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT||Projekte MINT",,,,,,"Biogeosci. discuss.",,"Biogeosciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although there are many textile washing/release studies, it is still unclear to what extent the liberated MPFs originate from processes during washing (e.g. abrasion) or rather from processes earlier in the textile supply chain. Understanding the origin of MPFs is important since different MPF formation mechanisms would lead to different mitigation strategies. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the presence of MPFs in various intermediate and finished polyester textiles products. In this study, we developed a sonication extraction method to quantify and characterize extractable MPFs already present in the textiles (i.e. manufacturing related MPFs). To identify the manufacturing process responsible for the MPF formation, this study included 18 representative products along the textile production line. The extraction dynamics of MPFs for all materials were investigated by ultrasonication. The number of extracted MPFs ranged from 15 MPF/g for a filament to 45′400 MPF/g for a scissor-cut microfiber textile. We found that a rotor yarn exhibited an elevated number of extracted MPFs (4′310 MPF/g) compared to other types of yarns (160–230 MPFs/g), suggesting that the rotor spinning may be a critical step responsible for MPF formation. On average, five times more MPFs could be extracted from textiles with processed surfaces (such as Fleece, Plain brushed and Microfiber) compared to those with unprocessed surfaces. This suggests that abrasive friction during production may be another critical factor for MPF formation. Furthermore, scissor-cut textiles demonstrated three to 31 times higher number of extracted MPFs than laser-cut textiles, enabling us to quantitatively discriminate between the contribution of MPFs from the textile surface opposed to those originating from the textile edges. The majority of the extracted MPFs were found to be between 100 and 800 μm in length. The results of this study may help to reduce the MPF release from textiles by modifications throughout the production and finishing process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,"0959-6526",,"10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121970","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461640","en","Elsevier",,,"Microplastic fiber release||Textile production||Ultrasonic extraction||Polyester||Pollution","The origin of microplastic fiber in polyester textiles: The textile production process matters","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-12T10:34:47Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems","168105","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,,,"J Cleaner Prod.",,"Journal of Cleaner Production","267","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The redox properties of the host rock are important in the context of safety assessment as they affect the speciation and thus the mobility of redox sensitive radionuclides. In this study, redox properties of the clay were assessed by mediated electrochemical analyses. The electron donating (EDC) and accepting (EAC) capacities and reduction potential of a suite of Boom Clay samples were determined. Boom Clay samples from various locations in the Netherlands and Belgium were investigated in unaltered form, and after size separation or chemical treatment to relate variations in redox properties to regional differences in diagenetic history or in the assemblage of allogenic minerals. In the investigated samples, the EDC can be attributed to the oxidation of pyrite, FeII in clay minerals and reduced natural organic matter (NOM) while the EAC can be ascribed to the reduction of FeIII in clay minerals and in Fe (oxyhydr)oxides. Combining Na-pyrophosphate extraction, to remove reactive NOM, with mediated electrochemical oxidation (MEO) allowed determining the individual EDC of NOM and FeII in clay minerals. Mediated electrochemical analysis showed systematic differences between samples from two locations in the Netherlands, Zeeland and Limburg. In samples from Zeeland, the reduction potential was higher, the EAC was larger, and the contribution of NOM to the EDC was smaller compared to samples from Limburg. These differences can be attributed to partial oxidation of Boom Clay in Zeeland during its diagenetic history but partial oxidation could also be a storage artefact. The electron yield obtained by pyrite oxidation in samples from Zeeland was larger compared to those from Limburg, which can be explained by a smaller particle size of pyrite in Zeeland. The size of pyrite particles, in turn, can be used as a proxy for the depositional conditions. The electrochemical activity of Fe in clay minerals did not vary systematically between the two locations in the Netherlands. In general, the fraction of electrochemically active Fe in clay minerals increased with the relative content of 2:1 clay minerals. In comparison with samples from the Netherlands, larger fractions of structural Fe in clay minerals were redox-active in samples from Belgium, which had a higher chlorite or glauconite content.

Yet, little is known about the impact of their unique As accumulation mechanisms on As transformations and cycling at the soil-root interface. Using a combined approach of two-dimensional (2D), sub-mm scale solute imaging of arsenite (AsIII), arsenate (AsV), phosphorus (P), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe) and oxygen (O2), we found localized patterns of AsIII/AsV redox transformations in the PV rhizosphere (AsIII/AsV ratio of 0.57) compared to bulk soil (AsIII/AsV ratio of ≤0.04). Our data indicate that the high As root uptake, translocation and accumulation from the As-rich experimental soil (2080 mg kg−1) to PV fronds (6986 mg kg−1) induced As detoxification via AsV reduction and AsIII root efflux, leading to AsIII accumulation and re-oxidation to AsV in the rhizosphere porewater. This As cycling mechanism is linked to the reduction of O2 and MnIII/IV (oxyhydr)oxides resulting in decreased O2 levels and increased Mn solubilization along roots. Compared to PV, we found 4-fold lower As translocation to PQ fronds (1611 mg kg−1), 2-fold lower AsV depletion in the PQ rhizosphere, and no AsIII efflux from PQ roots, suggesting that PQ efficiently controls As uptake to avoid toxic As levels in roots. Analysis of root exudates obtained from soil-grown PV showed that As acquisition by PV roots was not associated with phytic acid release. Our study demonstrates that two closely-related As-accumulating ferns have distinct mechanisms for As uptake modulating As cycling in As-rich environments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000421485",,"0098-8472||1873-7307",,"10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.104122","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/421485","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Chemical imaging||Arsenic speciation||Rhizosphere||Diffusive gradients in thin films||Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry||Planar optodes","Arsenic redox transformations and cycling in the rhizosphere of Pteris vittata and Pteris quadriaurita","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-21T03:00:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85086460928",,"000546927300008","Environ.

Challenges related to time consuming analytical methods have limited the number of sampling points and detection limits have hampered quantification of nanoplastic and microplastic fiber fluxes through WWTPs. By synthesizing nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers labeled with a rare metal (Pd and In, respectively) which can be measured as a proxy for the plastic itself, we have circumvented major analytical pitfalls associated with (micro)plastic measurements. In this study, we spiked the labeled materials to a pilot WWTP mimicking the activated sludge process (nitrification, de-nitrification and secondary clarification). Using a mass flow model for WWTP sludge, we assessed the behavior of particulate plastic in relation to the removal of organic matter. Triplicate samples were collected from the mixed liquor and from the effluent at least twice weekly over the entire experimental run time of 40 d. Our findings show that in discrete grab samples during steady state conditions, at least 98% of particulate plastics were associated with the biosolids. A positive correlation between total suspended solids (TSS) and plastic concentrations was observed in the sludge as well as in the effluent. Because of the strong association between particulate plastic and TSS, TSS removal is likely a good indicator of plastic removal in a full scale WWTP. Therefore, additional process steps in a full-scale WWTP which further reduce the TSS load will likely retain nanoplastic particles and microplastic fibers effectively and consequently increase the removal rates.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000461658",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2020.115860","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461658","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Waste water||Microplastic||Nanoplastic||Nano||Analysis||Fate","Long-term assessment of nanoplastic particle and microplastic fiber flux through a pilot wastewater treatment plant using metal-doped plastics","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-12T10:57:06Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems","168105","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,,,"Water Res.",,"Water Research","182","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we present the results of extensive nitrous oxide (N2O) measurements as well as the first reported open ocean measurements of hydroxylamine (NH2OH). Enhanced N2O sea-to-air fluxes were found in the zonal band between 5°S and 10°S as a result of wind-driven upwelling, and N2O depth profiles showed supersaturation throughout the water column with a distinct maximum at about 1000 m. Excess N2O (ΔN2O) was found to be positively correlated with apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) and nitrate. Although the water column distribution of NH2OH was highly variable, combined analysis with N2O and nutrient data allows us to argue for nitrification as the major formation pathway of N2O in the SWIO. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,,,"0924-7963||1879-1573",,"10.1016/j.jmarsys.2018.03.003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438549","en","Elsevier",,,"Nitrous oxide||Hydroxylamine||Atmospheric gases||Air-water interface||Hydrography","Nitrous oxide and hydroxylamine measurements in the Southwest Indian Ocean","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-09-04T19:57:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000539373400001","J.

We used reduced-representation genomic sequencing methods to gain a better understanding of genetic structure among and within populations of Lake Tanganyika's two sardine species,Limnothrissa miodonandStolothrissa tanganicae. Samples of these ecologically and economically important species were collected across the length of Lake Tanganyika, as well as from nearby Lake Kivu, whereL. miodonwas introduced in 1959. Our results reveal differentiation within bothS. tanganicaeandL. miodonthat is not explained by geography. Instead, this genetic differentiation is due to the presence of large sex-specific regions in the genomes of both species, but involving different polymorphic sites in each species. Our results therefore indicate rapidly evolving XY sex determination in the two species. Additionally, we found evidence of a large chromosomal rearrangement inL. miodon, creating two homokaryotypes and one heterokaryotype. We found all karyotypes throughout Lake Tanganyika, but the frequencies vary along a north-south gradient and differ substantially in the introduced Lake Kivu population. We do not find evidence for significant isolation by distance, even over the hundreds of kilometres covered by our sampling, but we do find shallow population structure.",,,,"0962-1083||1365-294X",,"10.1111/mec.15559","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432227","en","Wiley",,,"chromosomal rearrangement||Lake Tanganyika||Limnothrissa miodon||sex-specific region||Stolothrissa tanganicae","Structural genomic variation leads to genetic differentiation in Lake Tanganyika's sardines","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-08-22T02:39:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85089109535",,"000557288100001","Mol Ecol","17","Molecular Ecology","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet many details of the fate and circulation of these waters within the Arctic remain unclear. Here, we use the two long-lived artificial radionuclides 129I and 236U together with two tracer age models to constrain the pathways and circulation times of Atlantic waters in the surface and in the mid-depth Atlantic layer (250–800 m depth). We thereby benefit from the unique time-dependent tagging of Atlantic waters by these two isotopes. In the surface layer, a binary mixing model yields tracer ages of Atlantic Waters between 9–16 years in the Amundsen Basin, 12–17 years in the Fram Strait (East Greenland Current) and up to 20 years in the Canada Basin, reflecting the pathways of Atlantic Waters through the Arctic and their exiting through Fram Strait. In the mid-depth Atlantic layer (250 to 800 m), the transit time distribution (TTD) model yields mean ages in the central Arctic ranging between 15 and 65 years, while the mode ages representing the most probable ages of the TTD range between 2 and 30 years. The estimated mean ages are overall in good agreement with previous studies using artificial radionuclides or ventilation tracers. Although we find the overall flow to be dominated by advection, the shift of the mode age towards a younger age compared to the mean age reflects also the presence of a substantial amount of lateral mixing. For applications interested in how fast signals are transported into the Arctic's interior, the mode age appears to be a suitable measure.

Here we use idealized multimillennial global warming simulations with a comprehensive Earth system model to show that the equilibrium response in ocean O2 differs fundamentally from the ongoing transient response. After physical equilibration of the model (>4,000 years) under a two times preindustrial CO2 scenario, the deep ocean is better ventilated and oxygenated compared to preindustrial conditions, even though the deep ocean is substantially warmer. The recovery and overshoot of deep convection in the Weddell Sea and especially the Ross Sea after ~720 years causes a strong increase in deep ocean O2 that overcompensates the solubility‐driven decrease in O2. In contrast, O2 in most of the upper tropical ocean is substantially depleted owing to the warming‐induced O2 decrease dominating over changes in ventilation and biology. Our results emphasize the millennial‐scale impact of global warming on marine life, with some impacts emerging many centuries or even millennia after atmospheric CO2 has stabilized.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438611",,"0886-6236||1944-9224",,"10.1029/2020GB006601","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438611","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","dissolved oxygen||Earth system model||long‐term changes||global warming","Contrasting Upper and Deep Ocean Oxygen Response to Protracted Global Warming","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-04T20:15:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85089902945",,,"Glob. biogeochem. cycles","8","Global Biogeochemical Cycles","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We then summarize research on the removal of arsenic and fluoride from drinking water, focusing on adapted technologies for water treatment.

In this study, the effects of Mn2+ on Cd2+ sorption to two types of clay minerals, a well-crystalline natural kaolinite (KGa-1b) and a synthetic montmorillonite (Syn-1), were investigated. Batch experiments on Mn2+ and Cd2+ sorption to Ca-saturated KGa-1b and Syn-1 were conducted under anoxic conditions. At low Mn2+ and Cd2+ concentrations (1 and 5 µM), both metals exhibited similar affinity for sorption to the clays, suggesting that elevated Mn2+ concentrations might effectively decrease Cd2+ sorption as predicted using a three-plane surface complexation model. However, competitive Mn–Cd experiments at higher concentrations (≥50 µM) revealed that for both clay minerals, the presence of Mn2+ increased Cd2+ sorption to the solid phases. Although solutions were undersaturated with respect to known Mn(II) solid phases, analysis using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) evidenced the formation of Mn(II)-containing solid phases which can specifically adsorb or incorporate Cd2+. This process, which was mediated by the presence of clay minerals, overcompensated the decrease in Cd2+ adsorption to clay surfaces due to competition with Mn2+. We conclude that, contrary to predictions based on a competitive surface complexation model, elevated Mn2+ concentrations can contribute to decrease dissolved Cd2+ concentrations in anoxic clay-containing environments, such as contaminated sediments or flooded paddy soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438534",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/d0em00155d","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438534","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Surface precipitation of Mn2+ on clay minerals enhances Cd2+ sorption under anoxic condition","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-04T19:55:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Mobility of trace metals in periodically flooded soils: Influence of reduced iron, manganese, and sulfur","156392","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85089768304",,"000560533900003","Environ Sci Process Impacts","8","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

After a decade of passive air monitoring (2008–2019), MONET is the first network to produce sufficient data for the analysis of long-term temporal trends of POPs in the African atmosphere. This study reports concentrations of 20 POPs (aldrin, chlordane, chlordecone, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, endosulfan, HBCDD, HCB, HCHs, heptachlor, hexabromobiphenyl, mirex, PBDEs, PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, PeCB, PFOA, and PFOS) monitored in 9 countries (Congo, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria, and Sudan). As of January 1, 2019, concentrations were in the following ranges (pg/m3): 0.5–37.7 (∑6PCB), 0.006–0.724 (∑17PCDD/F), 0.05–5.5 (∑9PBDE), 0.6–11.3 (BDE 209), 0.1–1.8 (∑3HBCDD), 1.8–138 (∑6DDT), 0.1–24.3 (∑3endosulfan), 0.6–14.6 (∑4HCH), 9.1–26.4 (HCB), 13.8–18.2 (PeCB). Temporal trends indicate that concentrations of many POPs (PCBs, DDT, HCHs, endosulfan) have declined significantly over the past 10 years, though the rate was slow at some sites. Concentrations of other POPs such as PCDD/Fs and PBDEs have not changed significantly over the past decade and are in fact increasing at some sites, attributed to the prevalence of open burning of waste (particularly e-waste) across Africa. Modeled airflow back-trajectories suggest that the elevated concentrations at some sites are primarily due to sustained local emissions, while the low concentrations measured at Mt. Kenya represent the continental background level and are primarily influenced by long-range transport.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000461815",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.0c03575","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461815","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Temporal Trends of Persistent Organic Pollutants across Africa after a Decade of MONET Passive Air Sampling","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-12T16:39:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85087757375",,"000677482500003","Environ.

A first study performed in one glacial catchment indicated that CH4 was ubiquitous in sediments and rocks and was largely of thermogenic origin. Here, we present the results of a follow-up study that aimed at (1) determining the occurrence and origin of sediment-entrapped CH4 in other calcareous glacier forefields across Switzerland and (2) providing an inventory of this sediment-entrapped CH4, i.e., determining the contents and total mass of CH4 present, and its spatial distribution within and between five different Swiss glacier forefields situated on calcareous formations of the Helvetic nappes in the Central Alps.  Sediment and bedrock samples were collected at high spatial resolution from the forefields of Im Griess, Griessfirn, Griessen, Wildstrubel, and Tsanfleuron glaciers, representing different geographic and geologic regions of the Helvetic nappes. We performed geochemical analyses on gas extracted from sediments and rocks, including the determination of CH4 contents, stable carbon-isotope analyses (δ13CCH4), and the determination of gas-wetness ratios (ratio of CH4 to ethane and propane contents). To estimate the total mass of CH4 entrapped in glacier-forefield sediments, the total volume of sediment was determined based on the measured forefield area and either literature values of mean sediment thickness or direct depth measurements using electrical resistivity tomography.  Methane was found in all sediments (0.08–73.81 µg CH4 g−1 dry weight) and most rocks (0.06–108.58 µg CH4 g−1) collected from the five glacier forefields, confirming that entrapped CH4 is ubiquitous in these calcareous formations. Geochemical analyses further confirmed a thermogenic origin of the entrapped CH4 (average δ13CCH4 of sediment of −28.23 (± 3.42) ‰; average gas-wetness ratio of 75.2 (± 48.4)). Whereas sediment-entrapped CH4 contents varied moderately within individual forefields, we noted a large, significant difference in the CH4 content and total CH4 mass (range of 200–3881 t CH4) between glacier forefields at the regional scale.

However, the impact of macrofauna on the community structure of microorganisms is poorly understood. Here, we show that microbial communities across bioturbated, but geochemically and sedimentologically divergent, continental margin sites are highly similar but differ clearly from those in nonbioturbated surface and underlying subsurface sediments. Solid- and solute-phase geochemical analyses combined with modeled bioturbation activities reveal that dissolved O2 introduction by burrow ventilation is the major driver of archaeal community structure. By contrast, solid-phase reworking, which regulates the distribution of fresh, algal organic matter, is the main control of bacterial community structure. In nonbioturbated surface sediments and in subsurface sediments, bacterial and archaeal communities are more divergent between locations and appear mainly driven by site-specific differences in organic carbon sources.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000424380",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.1917494117","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424380","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","bioturbation||burrow ventilation||redox state||particle reworking||organic carbon sources","Macrofaunal control of microbial community structure in continental margin sediments","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-04T02:58:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Role of Bioturbation in Controlling Microbial Community Composition and Biogeochemical Cycles in Marine and Lacustrine Sediments","163371||163371","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85088207530",,"000548341000020","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","27","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","117","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The adaptation reaction of an organism under stress is not intrinsically good or bad, and its effect on health or performance depends on a plethora of other interactions of the body with the environment as well as on the history of such interactions. The vagueness of the terms “eustress/distress” has historically led to vast differences in the perception and application of the terms across disciplines. While psychology or sociology perceive eustress as something inextricably linked to positive perception and enhanced cognition, biomedicine perceives eustress as generally associated with better survival, health, or increased longevity, no matter how the event is perceived.

In this paper we review various grouping strategies that could be used to inform actions on these chemicals and outline the motivations, advantages and disadvantages for each. Grouping strategies are subdivided into (1) those based on the intrinsic properties of the PFAS (e.g.persistence, bioaccumulation potential, toxicity, mobility, molecular size) and (2) those that inform risk assessment through estimation of cumulative exposure and/or effects. The most precautionary grouping approach of those reviewed within this article suggests phasing out PFAS based on their high persistence alone (the so-called ""P-sufficient"" approach). The least precautionary grouping approach reviewed advocates only grouping PFAS for risk assessment that have the same toxicological effects, modes and mechanisms of action, and elimination kinetics, which would need to be well documented across different PFAS. It is recognised that, given jurisdictional differences in chemical assessment philosophies and methodologies, no one strategy will be generally acceptable. The guiding question we apply to the reviewed grouping strategies is: grouping for what purpose? The motivation behind the grouping (e.g.determining use in productsvs.setting guideline levels for contaminated environments) may lead to different grouping decisions. This assessment provides the necessary context for grouping strategies such that they can be adopted as they are, or built on further, to protect human and environmental health from potential PFAS-related effects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429995",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/d0em00147c","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429995","en","RSC Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Strategies for grouping per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to protect human and environmental health","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2020-08-05T02:46:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85088043565",,"000551295200001","Environ Sci Process Impacts","7","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The contribution of sediments to the lake MMHg pool remained however unclear. In this work, seven cores representative of the contrasted sediments and aquatic ecotopes of Lake Titicaca were sliced and analyzed for Hg and redox-sensitive elements (Mn, Fe, N and S) speciation in pore-water (PW) and sediment to document early diagenetic processes responsible for MMHg production and accumulation in PW during organic matter (OM) oxidation. The highest MMHg concentrations (up to 12.2 ng L−1 and 90% of THg) were found in subsurface PWs of the carbonate-rich sediments which cover 75% of the small basin and 20% of the large one. In other sediment facies, the larger content of OM restricted MMHg production and accumulation in PW by sequestering Hg in the solid phase and potentially also by decreasing its bioavailability in the PW. Diagenetically reduced S and Fe played a dual role either favoring or restricting the availability of Hg for biomethylation. The calculation of theoretical diffusive fluxes suggests that Lake Titicaca bottom sediments are a net source of MMHg, accounting for more than one third of the daily MMHg accumulated in the water column of the Lago Menor. We suggest that in the context of rising anthropogenic pressure, the enhancement of eutrophication in high altitude Altiplano lakes may increase these MMHg effluxes into the water column and favor its accumulation in water and biota. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,,,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138088","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/422260","en","Elsevier",,,"Methylmercury||Lake sediment||Early diagenesis||High altitude ecosystem||Diffusive fluxes","Diagenetic production, accumulation and sediment-water exchanges of methylmercury in contrasted sediment facies of Lake Titicaca (Bolivia)","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-06-24T22:00:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85082709588",,"000535897200019","Sci.

However, estimates of global atmospheric Se fluxes are highly uncertain. To constrain these uncertainties, we use a global model of atmospheric Se cycling and a database of more than 600 sites where Se in aerosol has been measured. Applying Bayesian inference techniques, we determine the probability distributions of global Se emissions from the four major sources: anthropogenic activities, volcanoes, marine biosphere, and terrestrial biosphere. Between 29 and 36 Gg of Se are emitted to the atmosphere every year, doubling previous estimates of emissions. Using emission parameters optimized by aerosol network measurements, our model shows good agreement with the aerosol Se observations (R2 = 0.66), as well as with independent aerosol (0.59) and wet deposition measurements (0.57). Both model and measurements show a decline in Se over North America in the last two decades because of changes in technology and energy policy. Our results highlight the role of the ocean as a net atmospheric Se sink, with around 7 Gg yr–1 of Se transferred from land through the atmosphere. The constrained Se emissions represent a substantial step forward in understanding the global Se cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000422273",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.0c01408","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/422273","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Constraining Atmospheric Selenium Emissions Using Observations, Global Modeling, and Bayesian Inference","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-24T22:16:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85086524637",,"000542229600014","Environ.

Many processes have been proposed to explain the unexpected cooling, including increased winds or freshwater fluxes. However, these mechanisms so far failed to fully explain the surface trends and the concurrent subsurface warming (100 to 500 m). Here, we argue that these trends are predominantly caused by an increased wind‐driven northward sea‐ice transport, enhancing the extraction of freshwater near Antarctica and releasing it in the open ocean. This conclusion is based on factorial experiments with a regional ocean model. In all experiments with an enhanced northward sea‐ice transport, a strengthened salinity‐dominated stratification cools the open‐ocean surface waters between the Subantarctic Front and the sea‐ice edge. The strengthened stratification reduces the downward mixing of cold surface water and the upward heat loss of the warmer waters below, thus warming the subsurface. This sea‐ice induced subsurface warming mostly occurs around West Antarctica, where it likely enhances ice‐shelf melting. Moreover, the subsurface warming could account for about 8 ± 2% of the global ocean heat content increase between 1982 and 2011. Antarctic sea‐ice changes thereby may have contributed to the slowdown of global surface warming over this period. Our conclusions are robust across all considered sensitivity cases, although the trend magnitude is sensitive to forcing uncertainties and the model's mean state. It remains unclear whether these sea‐ice induced changes are associated with natural variability or reflect a response to anthropogenic forcing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000415934",,"2576-604X",,"10.1029/2019av000132","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/415934","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Southern Ocean||sea ice||glacial meltwater||cooling||warming||freshwater","Sea‐Ice Induced Southern Ocean Subsurface Warming and Surface Cooling in a Warming Climate","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-05-20T06:57:51Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2","AGU Advances","1","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In comparison, plastic particles <1 µm (nanoplastic) in the environment remain mostly unexplored. Adequate techniques for the enrichment, as well as the detection of nanoplastic, are lacking but are urgently needed to assess the full scope of (potential) nanoplastic pollution. Use of Pd-doped nanoplastic particles constitutes a powerful tool to develop new analytical approaches, as they can be traced accurately and with ease in a variety of complex matrices by highly sensitive, time-efficient and robust ICP-MS(/MS) techniques. In this lab-scale study, for the first time, the capability of continuous flow centrifugation to retain nanoplastic particles (∼160 nm) from ultrapure water, as well as from filtered and unfiltered water from the German Elbe River was evaluated. Depending on the pump rate, the retention efficiency for the nanoplastic particles in ultrapure water ranged from 92% ± 8% (1 L h−1) to 53% ± 5% (5 L h−1) [uc (n = 3)] and from 75% ± 5% to 65% ± 6% (uc) (2.5 L h−1) in river water. Recirculating the water through the system two and three times at the highest tested flow rate led to retention efficiencies >90%. In a proof-of-principle setup, it was demonstrated that operating two continuous flow centrifuges sequentially at different rotational speeds bears the potential to enable size- and density-selective sampling of the colloidal fraction. A significant fraction of the spiked nanoplastic particles [76% ± 5% (uc)] could be separated from a model mixture of natural particles with a well-defined mean size of approximately 3 µm. While the certified reference plankton material used here was quantitatively retained in the first centrifuge rotor together with 23.0% ± 2.2% of the effective dose of the spiked nanoplastic, the remaining fraction of the nanoplastic could be recovered in the second rotor (53% ± 5%) and the effluent [24.4% ± 2.4% (uc)]. Based on the good retention efficiencies and the demonstrated separation potential, continuous flow centrifugation has proven to be a very promising technique for nanoplastic sampling and enrichment from natural water samples.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000461628",,"2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2020.00089","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461628","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Metal-doped nanoplastic||Nanoplastic sampling||Nanoplastic separation||Nanoplastic enrichment||Submicrometer plastic||Plastic contaminants||Particulate plastic","A Nanoplastic Sampling and Enrichment Approach by Continuous Flow Centrifugation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-12T10:20:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems","168105","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,,,"Front.

This article examines the impact of nano-polystyrene (nano-PS; 159 ± 0.9 nm diameter) to ecologically relevant bacteria Shewanella oneidensis. Bacterial viability was evaluated using a growth-based assay. Riboflavin secretion is a critical cell function of S. oneidensis, serving as an electron mediator in anaerobic respiration and/or as a signaling molecule when the bacteria are under stress. Thus, changes in cellular function were monitored through riboflavin secretion in order to evaluate toxic responses that may not result in cell death. Under aerobic and anaerobic exposures (4, 8, or 12 h), the viability of the S. oneidensis was minimally changed as compared to the control, while the concentration of riboflavin secreted varied with exposure dose. In order to determine if this was a specific response to nanoplastic particles, opposed to a response to either particles or plastic more generally, we exposed the system to colloidal TiO2 nanoparticles and polystyrene and polyethylene thin films. We confirmed that riboflavin secretion trends were specific to nano-PS and not to these other materials, which showed no significant changes. We investigated the association of the nano-PS with ICP-MS using Pd that was chemically incorporated into the model nanoplastics. While 59.2% of the nano-PS were found in the non-cellular culture media, 7.0 and 6.6% was found associated with the loosely and tightly bound extracellular polymeric substance, respectively. There was significantly more nano-PS (10.9%) strongly associated with the cells. Taken together, we found that nano-PS had minimal impacts to viability but caused a significant change in the function of S. oneidensis that can be related to the nano-PS attached or in proximity to the bacterium. These trends are consistent between aerobic and anaerobic cultures, signifying that the stress response of S. oneidensis can be generalized between different environmental compartments. This work highlights that the association of nanoplastic materials with microorganisms may modify the cellular function that could ultimately be an impact to ecosystem health.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000461655",,"2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2020.00097","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461655","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nanoplastic||Viability||Functional response||Polystyrene||Association","Impacts of Nanoplastics on the Viability and Riboflavin Secretion in the Model Bacteria Shewanella oneidensis","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-12T10:54:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems","168105","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,,,"Front.

Here, we investigated the sorption of Fe2+ onto a synthetic montmorillonite (Syn-1) low in structural Fe (<0.05 mmol Fe per kg) under anoxic conditions and the effects of subsequent oxidation. Samples were prepared at two Fe-loadings (0.05 and 0.5 mol Fe added per kg clay) and equilibrated for 1 and 30 days under anoxic conditions (O2 < 0.1 ppm), followed by exposure to ambient air. Iron solid-phase speciation and mineral identity was analysed by 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Mössbauer analyses showed that Fe(ii) was partially oxidized (14-100% of total added Fe2+) upon sorption to Syn-1 under anoxic conditions. XAS results revealed that the added Fe2+ mainly formed precipitates (layered Fe minerals, Fe(iii)-bearing clay minerals, ferrihydrite, and lepidocrocite) in different quantities depending on the Fe-loading. Exposing the suspensions to ambient air resulted in rapid and complete oxidation of sorbed Fe(ii) and the formation of Fe(iii)-phases (Fe(iii)-bearing clay minerals, ferrihydrite, and lepidocrocite), demonstrating that the clay minerals were unable to protect ferrous Fe from oxidation, even when equilibrated 30 days under anoxic conditions prior to oxidation. Our findings clarify the role of clay minerals in the formation and stability of Fe-bearing solid phases during redox cycles in periodically anoxic environments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000424500",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/d0em00063a","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424500","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Interactions of ferrous iron with clay mineral surfaces during sorption and subsequent oxidation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-06T07:32:04Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Mobility of trace metals in periodically flooded soils: Influence of reduced iron, manganese, and sulfur","156392||156392||156392","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85087111215",,"000544946200003","Environ Sci Process Impacts","6","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play a key role in limiting Hg discharges from wastewaters to rivers and lakes, but large-scale studies to estimate Hg loads and discharge at national levels are scarce. We assessed the concentration, flux, speciation, and removal of Hg in municipal wastewater throughout Switzerland by investigating 64 WWTPs in a pre-study and a subset of 28 WWTPs in the main study. We also studied the behavior and pathways of Hg along the various treatment steps in a state-of-the-art WWTP. The resulting dataset, representative of industrialized countries, provides an overview of (i) current Hg concentration ranges, (ii) average per capita loads, and (iii) wastewater Hg inputs into surface waters. The results allowed estimation of a total Hg (THg) load in Swiss wastewater of 130 ± 30 kg THg/year (15.7 mg/capita/y), of which 96 ± 4% is retained in sewage sludge. About 4.7 ± 0.5 kg THg/year (0.57 mg/capita/y) is discharged with the treated wastewater into surface waters. This corresponds to only 1.5–3% of the THg load carried by the major Swiss rivers, indicating that >95% of riverine Hg originates from other sources. Extrapolation to the population of Europe would yield a total amount of 11,700 kg THg/year in raw wastewater, with some 480 kg THg/year discharged to surface waters. Monomethyl mercury on average accounted for 0.23% of THg, and its fraction remained constant along the different treatment steps.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000407132",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2020.115708","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/407132","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Mercury and methyl mercury||Discharge||Wastewater||Sewage sludge||Incineration||Surface water","Mercury loads and fluxes from wastewater: A nationwide survey in Switzerland","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-03-30T04:05:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85082122476",,"000525947900048","Water Res.",,"Water Research","175","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To mitigate this exposure, groundwater is increasingly extracted from low-As Pleistocene aquifers. This, however, disturbs groundwater flow and potentially draws high-As groundwater into low-As aquifers.  Here we report a detailed characterisation of the Van Phuc aquifer in the Red River Delta region, Vietnam, where high-As groundwater from a Holocene aquifer is being drawn into a low-As Pleistocene aquifer. This study includes data from eight years (2010–2017) of groundwater observations to develop an understanding of the spatial and temporal evolution of the redox status and groundwater hydrochemistry.  Arsenic concentrations were highly variable (0.5–510 μg/L) over spatial scales of <200 m. Five hydro(geo)chemical zones (indicated as A to E) were identified in the aquifer, each associated with specific As mobilisation and retardation processes. At the riverbank (zone A), As is mobilised from freshly deposited sediments where Fe(III)-reducing conditions occur. Arsenic is then transported across the Holocene aquifer (zone B), where the vertical intrusion of evaporative water, likely enriched in dissolved organic matter, promotes methanogenic conditions and further release of As (zone C). In the redox transition zone at the boundary of the two aquifers (zone D), groundwater arsenic concentrations decrease by sorption and incorporations onto Fe(II) carbonates and Fe(II)/Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides under reducing conditions. The sorption/incorporation of As onto Fe(III) minerals at the redox transition and in the Mn(IV)-reducing Pleistocene aquifer (zone E) has consistently kept As concentrations below 10 μg/L for the studied period of 2010–2017, and the location of the redox transition zone does not appear to have propagated significantly. Yet, the largest temporal hydrochemical changes were found in the Pleistocene aquifer caused by groundwater advection from the Holocene aquifer. This is critical and calls for detailed investigations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000399762",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137143","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/399762","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Groundwater hydrochemistry||Water isotopes||Arsenic geochemistry||Reductive dissolution||Redox transition||Methanogenic conditions","Spatial and temporal evolution of groundwater arsenic contamination in the Red River delta, Vietnam: Interplay of mobilisation and retardation processes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-02-16T03:22:54Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85079176348",,"000519994800117","Sci.

The dissolved Fe(II) catalyses iron mineral transformation to more crystalline iron phases. Silica (Si), in the form of silicic acid, is an ubiquitous component of natural soil solutions and is known to hinder the iron mineral transformation process. However, the mechanisms and the mineral phases that are formed during ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite transformation in the presence of Si remain unclear. We reacted ferrihydrite, Si-ferrihydrite co-precipitates, lepidocrocite and Si-adsorbed lepidocrocite with 0.3 mM and 3 mM isotopically labelled 57Fe(II) for four weeks. At six time points, we sampled the solid and the aqueous phase, to follow iron mineral transformation by X-ray diffraction and dissolved Fe(II) dynamics. In addition, we tracked the iron atom exchange between the aqueous and the solid phase by measuring the 57/56Fe isotope ratio in filtrates and dissolved solid phases. Our data demonstrates the hindering effect of Si on Fe(II) catalysed ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite transformation. The presence of Si decreased the initial Fe(II) adsorption and strongly slowed down the iron atom exchange, especially in the lepidocrocite treatment. Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate, how Si can impact iron mineral transformation in soils with different Fe(II) release potentials under reducing conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460012",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-22500","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460012","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"How does silica affect Fe(II)-catalysed transformation of ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite?","Conference Poster","Open access",,,,"2021-01-06T16:06:21Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2020","May 4-8, 2020","Online",,,,"Iron mineral dynamics in redox-affected soils and sediments: Pushing the frontier toward in-situ studies","788009","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The chemical forms in which P is retained in soils and sediments determine its bioavailability. Under reducing conditions, the ferrous phosphate mineral vivianite has been shown to be a major P burial phase in various environments such as coastal sediments. Depending on the local environmental geochemistry, ferrous iron (Fe2+) can be substituted by other divalent cations such as magnesium (Mg2+) and manganese (Mn2+). The substitution of Fe2+ could alter mineralogical characteristics of vivianite, which influences its further reactivity and thus the P and iron (Fe) cycle. Despite the importance of divalent cation substitution in vivianite in the environment, questions remain if certain divalent cations are preferentially incorporated and how they compete for substitution.  Here, we assessed the competitive incorporation of Mn2+ and Mg2+ into vivianite by carrying out vivianite precipitation experiments in anoxic aqueous solutions at pH 7. Additionally, we explored how varying salinity simulating an estuarine gradient influences the incorporation of Mn2+ and Mg2+. Changes in mineralogy with different degrees of Mn2+/ Mg2+ substitution were studied with X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, total elemental dissolution and other techniques.  Based on 19 different vivianites, our results demonstrate that Fe2+ is replaced by up to 50% by Mn2+/ Mg2+ in the vivianite structure, with preferential incorporation of Mn2+ over Mg2+. Increases in salinity seem to slightly enhance divalent cation incorporation. Following from our results, we will discuss the factors influencing divalent cation incorporation into vivianite, and how divalent cation substitution alters mineralogical characteristics. Finally, we will highlight how the substitution of Fe2+ by other divalent cations potentially enhances P fixation in form of vivianite under Fe-limiting conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000457056",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-20474","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/457056","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Competitive divalent cation incorporation in the ferrous phosphate mineral vivianite","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2020-12-18T08:39:52Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2020","May 4-8, 2020","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The aim of this work was to use a panel of 12 different textiles of representative fibers and textile types to investigate the source(s) of the MPF during washing. Using standardized washing tests, textile swatches tailored using five different cutting/sewing methods were washed up to 10 times. The MPF quantity and fiber length were determined using image analysis. The 12 textiles demonstrated great variability in MPF release, ranging from 210 to 72,000 MPF/g textile per wash. The median MPF length ranged from 165 to 841 μm. The number of released MPF was influenced by the cutting method, where scissor-cut samples released 3–21 times higher numbers of MPF than the laser-cut samples. The textiles with mechanically processed surfaces (i.e., fleece) released significantly more (p-value < 0.001) than the textiles with unprocessed surfaces. For all textiles, the MPF release decreased with repeated wash cycles, and a small continuous fiber release was observed after 5–6 washings, accompanied by a slight increase in the fiber length. The decrease in the number of MPF released is likely caused by depletion of the production-inherited MPFs trapped within the threads or the textile structure. The comparison of MPF release from laser-cut samples, which had sealed edges, and the other cutting methods allowed us to separate the contributions of the edge- and surface-sourced fibers from the textiles to the total release. On an average, 84% (range 49–95%) of the MPF release originated from the edges, highlighting the importance of the edge-to-surface ratio when comparing different release studies. The large contribution of the edges to the total release offers options for technical solutions which have the possibility to control MPF formation throughout the textile manufacturing chain by using cutting methods which minimize MPF formation. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.9b07395","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461622","en","American Chemical Society",,,,"Systematic Study of Microplastic Fiber Release from 12 Different Polyester Textiles during Washing","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-12T10:16:12Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems","168105","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,,,"Environ.

Strong binding of chalcophile metals like copper by NOM is expected to interfere with sulfide precipitation and is likely to affect the growth of these nanoparticles. We therefore conducted experiments on the formation of copper sulfide nanoparticles (CuxS NPs) in anoxic solutions with varying Cu (50, 500 μmol L−1) and sulfide (100, 1000 μmol L−1) concentrations in the absence and presence of Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA, 0, 5, 50 mg C L−1). The size development of the CuxS nanoparticles and their stability were tracked over 4 weeks using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and size-exclusion chromatography coupled to ICP-MS (SEC-ICP-MS). Additional dissolution experiments were performed in closed containers in the absence and presence of O2 and fulvic acid over several months providing insights into the oxidative dissolution behavior of CuxS. Our results highlight the high colloidal stability of CuxS nanoparticles in anoxic environments irrespective of the NOM concentration. Median particle diameters ranged between a few and a few tens of nanometers with larger particles forming in more concentrated suspensions. At low Cu and S concentrations, fulvic acid restricted particle growth by up to 25% compared to SRFA-free suspensions and metal sulfide clusters even smaller than 1 nm were detected. The CuxS nanoparticles exhibited a remarkable chemical stability against oxidative dissolution and were only dissolved when both fulvic acid and O2 were present.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000412668",,"2051-8153||2051-8161",,"10.1039/c9en01448a","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/412668","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Effect of NOM on copper sulfide nanoparticle growth, stability, and oxidative dissolution","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-05-01T03:30:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Mobility of trace metals in periodically flooded soils: Influence of reduced iron, manganese, and sulfur","156392","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85083739500",,"000528594100009","Environ.

Here, we review concepts of spatially linked microbial consortia in which spatial arrangement is optimized to increase control and facilitate new species combinations.

Thus, an understanding of what microorganisms are released and how they change microbial communities within natural streams is needed. To characterize the community shifts in streams receiving WWTP effluent, we sampled water-column microorganisms from upstream, downstream, and the effluent of WWTPs located on 23 headwater streams in which no other effluent was released upstream. We characterized the bacterial community by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We hypothesized that the downstream community profile would be a hydraulic mixture between the two sources (i.e., upstream and effluent). In ordination analyses, the downstream bacterial community profile was a mixture between the upstream and effluent. For 14 of the sites, the main contribution (>50%) to the downstream community originated from bacteria in the WWTP effluent and significant shifts in relative abundance of specific sequence variants were detected. These shifts in sequence variants may serve as general bioindicators of wastewater-effluent influenced streams, with a human-gut related Ruminococcus genus displaying the highest shift (30-fold higher abundances downstream). However, not all taxa composition changes were predicted based on hydraulic mixing alone. Specifically, the decrease of Cyanobacteria/Chloroplast reads was not adequately described by hydraulic mixing. The potential alteration of stream microbial communities via a high inflow of human-gut related bacteria and a decrease in autotrophic functional groups resulting from WWTP effluent creates the potential for general shifts in stream ecosystem function.",,,,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135727","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/389075","en","Elsevier",,,"Headwater streams||Wastewater treatment plant effluent||Ruminococcus||Cyanobacteria","Microbial community shifts in streams receiving treated wastewater effluent","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-01-10T04:09:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85076832026",,"000512281700018","Sci.

Yet even for standardized isolates such as those from the International Humic Substance Society (IHSS), wide-ranging values exist in the literature. In this manuscript, time-resolved 1O2 phosphorescence was used to determine the 1O2 quantum yields (ΦΔ) of a variety of dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolates and natural waters. In general, the 1O2 quantum yield values in this study are in the middle, although below the median of the range of past reported values (e.g., for Suwannee River Natural Organic Matter IHSS isolate: 1.8% vs 0.23–2.89%). Notably, hydrophobic neutral fractions of DOM isolates were found to possess the highest 1O2 quantum yields, an interesting result given that these fractions are not retained in typical humic and fulvic acid isolation procedures that use XAD resins. The excitation wavelength dependence of 1O2 generation from CDOM was also examined, and an approximate linear decrease with longer excitation wavelength was observed. This work advances the understanding of CDOM photoprocesses, especially in relation to wavelength-dependent 1O2 production, which is valuable for assessing real-world environmental behavior.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000408369",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.9b07246","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/408369","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Dissolved Organic Matter Singlet Oxygen Quantum Yields: Evaluation Using Time-Resolved Singlet Oxygen Phosphorescence","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-04-06T01:36:44Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85081603523",,"000526416600027","Environ.

Focusing on the Laurentian Great Lakes, we challenge this common assumption by showing that the thermal behaviour is diversified in time both among different lakes and within a single one. Deep regions experience a stronger warming concentrated in early summer, mainly due to anticipated stratification, while shallow parts respond more uniformly throughout the year. To perform such analysis, we use the difference between the five warmest and coldest years in a series of 20 years as a proxy of possible effects of climate alterations, and compare the warming of lake surface temperature with that of air temperature. In this way, based on past observations obtained from satellite images, we show how the warming is heterogeneously distributed in time and in space, and that the quantification of lakes' thermal response to climate change is chiefly influenced by the time window used in the analysis.

These phytotoxins often show similar properties as known aquatic micropollutants in terms of mobility, persistence, toxicity, and possibly also ecotoxicity. However, their occurrence in surface waters remains largely unknown, which is also due to unknown ability of available screening approaches to detect them. Therefore, we performed a target and suspect screening based on a persistence-mobility prioritization for phytotoxins in small Swiss creeks using high resolution mass spectrometry. In total, three of 26 targets were detected, three of 78 suspects tentatively identified, and six suspects fully confirmed by reference standards. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that three different plant secondary metabolite classes are detected in the same surface water sample. Estrogenic isoflavones were detected at 73% of the sites with formononetin as main toxin, which is in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, pyrrolizidine alkaloids and the indole alkaloid gramine were detected. Especially pyrrolizidine alkaloids might be critical due to their production by various plants including the invasive Senecio inaequidens, and their known importance in food and feed safety. Based on these first screening results, different phytotoxin classes should be assessed for their ecotoxicological effects and considered in future water monitoring.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000407110",,"0009-4293",,"10.2533/chimia.2020.129","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/407110","en","Swiss Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Environmental analytics||Isoflavones||Natural toxins||pyrrolizidine alkaloids||Suspect screening","""Is there anybody else out there?"" - First Insights from a Suspect Screening for Phytotoxins in Surface Water","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-03-30T04:03:04Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85082147643",,"000521531100005","Chimia","3","Chimia","74","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This atmospheric aging process changes the ability of organic aerosols to form cloud droplets and consequently impacts aerosol–cloud interactions. We recently reported changes in the cloud forming properties of aerosolized dissolved organic matter (DOM) due to a photomineralization mechanism, transforming high-molecular weight compounds in DOM into organic acids, CO and CO2. To strengthen the implications of this mechanism to atmospheric aerosols, we now extend our previous dataset and report identical cloud activation experiments with laboratory-generated secondary organic aerosol (SOA) extracts. The SOA was produced from the oxidation of α-pinene and naphthalene, a representative biogenic and anthropogenic source of SOA, respectively. Exposure of aqueous solutions of SOA to UVB irradiation increased the dried organic material's hygroscopicity and thus its ability to form cloud droplets, consistent with our previous observations for DOM. We propose that a photomineralization mechanism is also at play in these SOA extracts. These results help to bridge the gap between DOM and SOA photochemistry by submitting two differently-sourced organic matter materials to identical experimental conditions for optimal comparison.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000407111",,"0009-4293",,"10.2533/chimia.2020.142","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/407111","en","Swiss Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Cloud condensation nuclei||Dissolved organic matter||Photochemistry||Photomineralization||Secondary organic aerosol","UVB-irradiated Laboratory-generated Secondary Organic Aerosol Extracts Have Increased Cloud Condensation Nuclei Abilities: Comparison with Dissolved Organic Matter and Implications for the Photomineralization Mechanism","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-03-30T04:03:04Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85082146585",,"000521531100007","Chimia","3","Chimia","74","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although the Minamata Convention, established by the United Nations in 2017, addresses this challenge, the frequent use of mercury as an extractive tool for gold still persists. Among the explanations for the continuing use of mercury, the importance of trade dynamics has remained poorly researched so far. This Master’s thesis thus provides insights into power relations in ASGM supply chains in Burkina Faso by taking a political ecology perspective based on access concepts in combination with a risk framework for supply networks. A total of 64 interviews in Ouagadougou and on four ASGM sites in the North of Burkina Faso as well as 267 survey results from the same target sites have been collected for the analysis. On the one hand, the results of this mixed-methods approach shed light on the dual function of the gold collectors who are also the mercury providers. They show that the gold collectors mainly secure the mercury supply chain in order to increase their access to the gold market. On the other hand, the study discusses the distribution of capital and ASGM-typical risks along the gold and mercury supply chain and how they impact the trade dynamics on the sites, mainly via pre-financing mechanisms. These findings challenge the common perception of ASGMers as poverty-driven individual entrepreneurs and highlight the role of financially strong investors, who seek cheap labour opportunities in order to derive profits from the markets. The identification of power dynamics in different forms and at different stages of the gold and mercury supply chain fills both an empirical and a theoretical research gap. Moreover, it may contribute to finding innovative solutions to drive the transition towards a mercury-free ASGM sector.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450774",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450774","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Power Dynamics in Gold Supply Chains","Master Thesis","Open access",,,,"2020-11-11T11:03:50Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Deposition from the atmosphere, especially through precipitation, is an important source of Se to soils. However, very little is known about the atmospheric cycling of Se. It has therefore been difficult to predict how far Se travels in the atmosphere and where it deposits. To answer these questions, we have built the first global atmospheric Se model by implementing Se chemistry in an aerosol–chemistry–climate model, SOCOL-AER (modeling tools for studies of SOlar Climate Ozone Links – aerosol). In the model, we include information from the literature about the emissions, speciation, and chemical transformation of atmospheric Se. Natural processes and anthropogenic activities emit volatile Se compounds, which oxidize quickly and partition to the particulate phase. Our model tracks the transport and deposition of Se in seven gas-phase species and 41 aerosol tracers. However, there are large uncertainties associated with many of the model's input parameters. In order to identify which model uncertainties are the most important for understanding the atmospheric Se cycle, we conducted a global sensitivity analysis with 34 input parameters related to Se chemistry, Se emissions, and the interaction of Se with aerosols. In the first bottom-up estimate of its kind, we have calculated a median global atmospheric lifetime of 4.4 d (days), ranging from 2.9 to 6.4 d (2nd–98th percentile range) given the uncertainties of the input parameters. The uncertainty in the Se lifetime is mainly driven by the uncertainty in the carbonyl selenide (OCSe) oxidation rate and the lack of tropospheric aerosol species other than sulfate aerosols in SOCOL-AER. In contrast to uncertainties in Se lifetime, the uncertainty in deposition flux maps are governed by Se emission factors, with all four Se sources (volcanic, marine biosphere, terrestrial biosphere, and anthropogenic emissions) contributing equally to the uncertainty in deposition over agricultural areas. We evaluated the simulated Se wet deposition fluxes from SOCOL-AER with a compiled database of rainwater Se measurements, since wet deposition contributes around 80 % of total Se deposition. Despite difficulties in comparing a global, coarse-resolution model with local measurements from a range of time periods, past Se wet deposition measurements are within the range of the model's 2nd–98th percentiles at 79 % of background sites. This agreement validates the application of the SOCOL-AER model to identifying regions which are at risk of low atmospheric Se inputs. In order to constrain the uncertainty in Se deposition fluxes over agricultural soils, we should prioritize field campaigns measuring Se emissions, rather than laboratory measurements of Se rate constants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000401201",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-1363-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/401201","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Mapping the drivers of uncertainty in atmospheric selenium deposition with global sensitivity analysis","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-02-22T04:27:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85079430926",,"000512999100003","Atmos. chem. phys.","3","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

I took a reductionist approach using isogenic cross feeding strains grown under controlled environmental conditions. The environmental heterogeneities investigated in this research study include local nutrient availability, temporal fluctuations in environmental conditions, physical structures, and spatial distance between interacting individuals. In Chapter 1, I describe the main knowledge gaps regarding spatiotemporal heterogeneities as drivers of microbial spatial organization and community composition. In Chapter 2, I review the methods and current state of research in synthetic ecology to investigate the causes and consequences of microbial spatial self-organization. I described the properties of patterns of self-organization and propose methods to quantify them. Finally, I give an overview on the existing methods to engineer the spatial organization of microbial communities. In Chapter 3, I co-authored a research article on the influence of local nutrient concentrations on spatial organization and the maintenance of diversity during expansion of a cross-feeding community. I provided an agent-based model developed by Benedict Borer (ETHZ, STEP) that describes the influence of spatial organization on the reproductive success of lineages with consequences on the maintenance of genetic diversity during range expansion. I contributed to the experimental results, to the formulation of the main research question, and to the writing of the manuscript. In Chapter 4, I investigate patterns of spatial self-organization that emerge during range expansion of a cross feeding community under temporal fluctuations in the available electron acceptor. I used an updated version of the model presented in Chapter 3 to explain the mechanisms that enable the persistence of the community during fluctuating conditions and preserve genetic diversity. In Chapter 5, I describe how physical objects on a surface influence spatial self-organization and interspecific diversity during range expansion. I found that physical objects have differing effects depending on the types of interactions (competition and mutualism) present between genotypes. More specifically, I found that competitive interactions maintain higher diversity at the expanding edge compared to mutualistic interactions. In Chapter 6, I illustrate how the strength of a mutualistic interaction determines whether individuals are likely to develop into colonies. More specifically, I show that colony abundance, size and interspecific distance all depend on the strength of the interaction. I found that the mutualistic component of the net interaction determines the number of colonies and interspecific distances while the competitive component of the net interaction determines colony size. In Chapter 7, I discuss the main outcome of the research work and I describe new direction of future investigations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000401169",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/401169","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","SELF-ORGANIZATION (BIOLOGY)||environmental heterogeneity||pattern formation||microbial ecology||denitrification","Influence of temporal and spatial heterogeneity on microbial spatial self-organization","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2020-02-21T18:01:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"26644",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Wet chemistry experiments were carried out by using a 55Fe radiotracer while 29Si NMR and XAS spectroscopy were performed on C–S–H phases loaded with different Fe(III) concentrations. Sorption kinetics experiments indicate that equilibrium was attained within 30 days. Over the studied concentration range, Fe(III) sorption was linear, irrespective of the difference in pH of the suspension and the Ca/ Si of C–S–H. In addition, Fe(III) sorption on C–S–H phases was signiﬁcantly stronger than Al(III) sorption. The total Fe(III) uptake by C–S–H phases, however, was limited by the lower solubility of Fe(OH)3 compared to Al (OH)3; up to 1 mol Fe/kg C–S–H (molar Fe(III)/Si ~ 0.001) could be taken up. 29Si NMR and EXAFS data suggest Fe(III) uptake in octahedral coordination into the interlayer of the C–S–H phases with Ca/Si ratios 1.2 and 1.5. However, such an uptake mechanism appears unlikely in the case of the C–S–H phase with Ca/Si 0.8 because structural parameters of Fe(III) deduced from EXAFS are different.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000392188",,"0883-2927||1872-9134",,"10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.104460","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/392188","en","Elsevier BV","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","ferric iron||X-ray absorption spectroscopy||Calcium silicate hydrates||Sorption behaviour","Fe(III) uptake by calcium silicate hydrates","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-20T13:48:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85077143707",,"000514814800002","Appl. geochem.",,"Applied Geochemistry","113","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we investigate this competition using a regional physical-biogeochemical-ecological model (ROMS-BEC) configured at eddy-permitting resolution for the Southern Ocean south of 35° S. We extended ROMS-BEC by an explicit parameterization of Phaeocystis colonies, so that the model, together with the previous addition of an explicit coccolithophore type, now includes all biogeochemically relevant Southern Ocean phytoplankton types. We find that Phaeocystis contribute 46 % and 40 % to annual NPP and POC export south of 60° S, respectively, making them an important contributor to high-latitude carbon cycling. In our simulation, the relative importance of Phaeocystis and diatoms is mainly controlled by the temporal variability in temperature and iron availability. The higher light sensitivity of Phaeocystis at low irradiances promotes the succession from Phaeocystis to diatoms in more coastal areas, such as the Ross Sea. Still, differences in the biomass loss rates, such as aggregation or grazing by zooplankton, need to be considered to explain the simulated seasonal biomass evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000398131",,"1810-6277||1810-6285",,"10.5194/bg-2019-488","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/398131","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Factors controlling the competition between Phaeocystis and diatoms in the Southern Ocean","Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2020-02-10T15:16:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"SOGate: Phytoplankton ecosystem control of the Southern Ocean biogeochemical gate","153452||153452||153452||153452||153452","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,,,"Biogeosci. discuss.",,"Biogeosciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we incorporate key factors that affect soil bacterial abundance and diversity across spatial scales into a mechanistic modeling framework considering soil type, carbon inputs and climate towards predicting soil bacterial diversity. The soil aqueous-phase content and connectivity exert strong influence on bacterial diversity for each soil type and rainfall pattern. Biome-specific carbon inputs deduced from net primary productivity provide constraints on soil bacterial abundance independent from diversity. The proposed heuristic model captures observed global trends of bacterial diversity in good agreement with predictions by an individual-based mechanistic model. Bacterial diversity is highest at intermediate water contents where the aqueous phase forms numerous disconnected habitats and soil carrying capacity determines level of occupancy. The framework delineates global soil bacterial diversity hotspots; located mainly in climatic transition zones that are sensitive to potential climate and land use changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000388551",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-019-13966-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/388551","en","Springer Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Soil bacterial diversity mediated by microscale aqueous-phase processes across biomes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-08T12:43:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The Hidden Frontier: Quantitative Exploration of Physical and Ecological Origins of Microbial Diversity in Soil","320499","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,"85077585774",,"000512536000006","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, many species are often unaccounted for due to ineffective direct capture and visual surveys, especially in aquatic environments. Environmental DNA metabarcoding is an approach that overcomes low detection probabilities and should consequently enhance estimates of biodiversity and its proxy, species richness. Here, we synthesize 37 studies in natural aquatic systems to compare species richness estimates for bony fish between eDNA metabarcoding and conventional methods, such as nets, visual census, and electrofishing. In freshwater systems with fewer than 100 species, we found eDNA metabarcoding detected more species than conventional methods. Using multiple genetic markers further increased species richness estimates with eDNA metabarcoding. For more diverse freshwater systems and across marine systems, eDNA metabarcoding reported similar values of species richness to conventional methods; however, more studies are needed in these environments to better evaluate relative performance. In systems with greater biodiversity, eDNA metabarcoding will require more populated reference databases, increased sampling effort, and multi-marker assays to ensure robust species richness estimates to further validate the approach. eDNA metabarcoding is reliable and provides a path for broader biodiversity assessments that can outperform conventional methods for estimating species richness.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000441330",,"2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2020.00276","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/441330","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Calibrating Environmental DNA Metabarcoding to Conventional Surveys for Measuring Fish Species Richness","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-20T04:24:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Global measure of biodiversity by understanding biogeochemical cycling of environmental DNA in lakes","852621","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85090851013",,"000570496500001","Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This use of chlorophyll concentrations in sediments to infer historical changes in lake primary production relies heavily on the assumption that preservation is sufficient to reflect the productivity in a meaningful way. In this study, we use a series of freeze cores from a lake with annually laminated sediments to assess how reliable down-core trends in chlorophyll are, and to what extent chlorophyll is degraded in the sediment. A striking consistency in the down-core chlorophyll trends in four sediment cores collected in different years (1983, 1992, 2002 and 2010) shows that the sediment preserves a consistent chlorophyll signal over longer timescales. However, there are also clear signs that diagenetic processes within the sediment affect the chlorophyll concentration in sediment layers younger than 10–15 years. This implies that care is needed when interpreting chlorophyll trends in recent sediments. Further, our data show that high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and visible reflectance spectroscopy (VRS) detect similar chlorophyll concentrations for recently dried samples. A third analytical technique, pyrolysis–gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, which provides semi-quantitative values for chlorophyll, also produce a temporal trend that is highly correlated with data from the two quantitative techniques. For samples that have been stored dried at room temperature for several years there is, however, a large discrepancy between the two quantitative techniques. The VRS method is more robust with regards to degradation during storage, while HPLC results demonstrate clear storage effects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000446472",,"0921-2728||1573-0417",,"10.1007/s10933-020-00143-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446472","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sedimentary pigments||Chlorophyll||Degradation||Visible reflectance spectroscopy (VRS)||HPLC||Pyrolysis–GC/MS||Nylandssjön","An assessment of chlorophyll preservation in lake sediments using multiple analytical techniques applied to the annually laminated lake sediments of Nylandssjön","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-19T02:46:54Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85092275160",,"000576820500004","J. paleolimnol.","4","Journal of Paleolimnology","64","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The objective of this study was to investigate the leaching characteristics of hexavalent Cr [Cr(VI)] from two COPR samples obtained from unlined landfills in the Kanpur area of northern India. Column experiments were conducted under water‐saturated conditions to simulate Cr release from the wastes caused by tropical heavy‐rain events. Leached Cr(VI) decreased from 1,800 to 300 mg L−1 (Rania site) and 1,200 to 163 mg L−1 (Chhiwali site) during exchange of 12 pore volumes, which approximately corresponds to 2 yr of monsoon precipitation. Flow interruptions for 10, 100, and 1,000 h had little effect on Cr(VI) concentrations in the leachate, suggesting that Cr(VI) leaching was not limited by slow release kinetics. Calcium aluminum chromium oxide hydrates (CAC), and highly soluble phases such as Na2CrO4 may play a role in controlling Cr(VI) concentration in the leachates. The amount of Cr(VI) leached from the columns accounted for 16% of the total Cr(VI) present in both COPR samples. A decrease in the solid‐phase Cr(VI)/Crtotal ratio along the column was identified by X‐ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Consistently, the smallest Cr(VI)/Crtotal ratios were found in the lower column section closest to the inflow. Our results suggest that Cr(VI) leaching from the unlined COPR landfills will continue for centuries, highlighting the urgent need to remediate these dumpsites.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000418740",,"1537-2537||0047-2425",,"10.1002/jeq2.20071","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/418740","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Leaching of hexavalent chromium from young chromite ore processing residue","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-08T02:38:46Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85083775136",,"000575209200017",,"3","Journal of Environmental Quality","49","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is also relevant for marketing, which is of economic significance. Other types of food contact articles, such as storage containers, processing equipment and filling lines, are also important for food production and food supply. Food contact articles are made up of one or multiple different food contact materials and consist of food contact chemicals. However, food contact chemicals transfer from all types of food contact materials and articles into food and, consequently, are taken up by humans. Here we highlight topics of concern based on scientific findings showing that food contact materials and articles are a relevant exposure pathway for known hazardous substances as well as for a plethora of toxicologically uncharacterized chemicals, both intentionally and non-intentionally added. We describe areas of certainty, like the fact that chemicals migrate from food contact articles into food, and uncertainty, for example unidentified chemicals migrating into food. Current safety assessment of food contact chemicals is ineffective at protecting human health. In addition, society is striving for waste reduction with a focus on food packaging. As a result, solutions are being developed toward reuse, recycling or alternative (non-plastic) materials. However, the critical aspect of chemical safety is often ignored. Developing solutions for improving the safety of food contact chemicals and for tackling the circular economy must include current scientific knowledge. This cannot be done in isolation but must include all relevant experts and stakeholders. Therefore, we provide an overview of areas of concern and related activities that will improve the safety of food contact articles and support a circular economy. Our aim is to initiate a broader discussion involving scientists with relevant expertise but not currently working on food contact materials, and decision makers and influencers addressing single-use food packaging due to environmental concerns. Ultimately, we aim to support science-based decision making in the interest of improving public health. Notably, reducing exposure to hazardous food contact chemicals contributes to the prevention of associated chronic diseases in the human population.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000404936",,"1476-069X",,"10.1186/s12940-020-0572-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/404936","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Food contact material||Migration||Food packaging||Non-intentionally added substance||Chronic disease||Human health||Mixture toxicity||Endocrine disrupting chemical||Sustainable packaging||Circular economy","Impacts of food contact chemicals on human health: a consensus statement","Other Journal Item","Open access",,,,"2020-03-15T02:35:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85080927090",,"000521096400001","Environ.

These photosynthetic organisms comprise more than 4300 marine species, but their biogeographic patterns and the resulting species diversity are poorly known, mostly owing to severe data limitations. Here, we compile, synthesize, and harmonize marine phytoplankton occurrence records from the two largest biological occurrence archives (Ocean Biogeographic Information System, OBIS; and Global Biodiversity Information Facility, GBIF) and three independent recent data collections. We bring together over 1.36 million phytoplankton occurrence records (1.28 million at the level of species) for a total of 1704 species, spanning the principal groups of the diatoms, dinoflagellates, and haptophytes, as well as several other groups. This data compilation increases the amount of marine phytoplankton records available through the single largest contributing archive (OBIS) by 65 %. Data span all ocean basins, latitudes, and most seasons. Analyzing the oceanic inventory of sampled phytoplankton species richness at the broadest spatial scales possible using a resampling procedure, we find that richness tends to saturate at ∼93 % of all species in our database in the pantropics, at ∼64 % in temperate waters, and at ∼35 % in the cold Northern Hemisphere, while the Southern Hemisphere remains under-explored. We provide metadata on the cruise, research institution, depth, and date for each data record, and we include phytoplankton cell counts for 193 763 records. We strongly recommend consideration of spatiotemporal biases in sampling intensity and varying taxonomic sampling scopes between research cruises or institutions when analyzing the occurrence data spatially. Including such information into predictive tools, such as statistical species distribution models, may serve to project the diversity, niches, and distribution of species in the contemporary and future ocean, opening the door for quantitative macroecological analyses of phytoplankton.

A majority of the human population now lives in close proximity to rivers, and growing human demand for the ecological services that freshwater bodies provide has led to the widespread fragmentation, degradation, and destruction of stream habitats. The natural hydrology and morphology of rivers worldwide has been extensively altered by channelization for flood control and land reclamation, water withdrawals for irrigation, and dams constructed for energy production. Pollution from intensive agriculture and urbanization has degraded water quality, with adverse impacts on freshwater communities such as benthic macroinvertebrates and fish. Benthic macroinvertebrate communities are particularly important to stream ecosystem functioning as they exhibit a relatively high taxonomic and functional diversity (e.g., herbivory, detritivory), are a food source for amphibian, bird, and fish communities, and respond to a wide range of natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions.  	To better understand how stream communities respond to environmental conditions and inform ecosystem restoration efforts, many industrialized countries have established long-term stream biomonitoring programs that sample stream invertebrate and fish communities at selected geographic sites, in addition to data on environmental conditions. However, these programs have limited human and financial resources that constrain key aspects of biomonitoring design, such as the geographic extent and selection of sites, and the taxonomic level of identification for stream invertebrate taxa. These key aspects of biomonitoring design in turn affect our ability to quantify stream invertebrate community responses to natural and anthropogenic conditions, inform stream management, and improve existing biomonitoring efforts.  	Multivariate statistical species distribution models (SDMs) have become popular tools to predict species distributions based on environmental conditions. However they have been criticized for weak linkages to ecological theory (e.g., niche theory), limited relevance to management, and for including indirect explanatory variables that have no clear mechanistic effect on species distributions. Recent methodological advances in species distribution modelling have proposed increasingly complex models that reflect ecological hypotheses into the model structure, including hierarchical multi-species and joint SDMs.  	The key goal of this thesis is to investigate whether the calibration of recently proposed species distribution models to observational data can support inference of how stream invertebrate and fish communities respond to natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions. An additional goal is to explore how key aspects of biomonitoring design (i.e., geographic extent, selection of sites, and taxonomic resolution) affect our ability to learn about potential cause-effect relationships.  	In pursuing these goals, I began with a comparison of the performance of individual, hierarchical multi-species, and joint species distribution modelling approaches when applied to a dataset of stream invertebrate communities. The results show that, compared to stacked individual models, a relatively simple hierarchical multi-species model improves predictive performance over the whole community while also predicting richness. However, extending the hierarchical multi-species model into a joint model that includes residual correlations between taxa leads to a decline in predictive performance. In addition to improving model performance with minor increases in model complexity, I identify the analytical possibilities of increasingly complex SDMs and conclude that for stream invertebrate communities, a hierarchical multi-species modelling approach improves predictive performance for the community relative to individual models while still offering a parsimonious model.  	Based on these findings, I selected the hierarchical multi-species distribution model to quantify how stream invertebrate communities respond to natural and anthropogenic conditions. I apply the model to multiple datasets that differ in geographic extent, site selection, and taxonomic resolution to analyze how key aspects of biomonitoring design affect our ability to infer stream invertebrate responses to environmental conditions. The model results show that many stream invertebrate taxa respond to multiple anthropogenic stressors (e.g., indicators of agricultural activities, urban areas), while stream temperature emerged as the most important environmental condition across the datasets. Many genera and species showed stronger and more varied responses to environmental conditions compared to their respective families (particularly among widespread families), although the identifiability of responses among rare taxa remained difficult. Overall, the results indicate that a standardized level of taxonomic identification for taxa among multiple biomonitoring programs would allow future analyses to benefit from an increased sample size, a wider coverage of environmental conditions, and a finer taxonomic resolution.  	The aim of the third and final study in this thesis is to (i) use conceptual models to identify dominant natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions that have a direct, mechanistic effect on distributions of riverine fish, and (ii) to use the conceptual models to guide the development of statistical SDMs of fish presence-absence and density (i.e., the number of individuals per unit area) observations that incorporate the observation process into the model structures. Using environmental variables for which there is available data, I selected environmental conditions identified in the conceptual model based on the predictive performance of the statistical model. To account for habitat fragmentation by natural and artificial barriers, I developed several spatially-explicit habitat variables that consider the accessible area. The results show that the best predictive presence-absence models for all taxa often include spatially-explicit habitat variables (e.g., the mean stream temperature, morphological state) after accounting for barriers. The predictive performance of the selected presence-absence models for all taxa is reasonably good, except for the widespread Salmo spp. The predictive performance of the proposed fish density models largely exceeded their respective null models, with the model for Salmo spp. achieving the highest predictive performance relative to the models for other taxa and the model for Barbus spp. performing worse than its simpler null model due to overfitting. The differences between the environmental conditions included in the conceptual model and the statistical model can be used to identify potential improvements in the environmental data and to highlight gaps in our prior knowledge about specific taxa, potentially informing future efforts to model fish densities.  	This thesis has made contributions to the methodology and application of statistical SDMs to freshwater communities by demonstrating how some of the limitations of established species distribution modelling approaches can be overcome to allow additional analytical possibilities of ecological communities, and by applying SDMs to derive practical recommendations to improve stream biomonitoring and management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000468125",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468125","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","species distribution models||biogeography||FRESHWATER FISHES (ANIMAL ECOLOGY)||Benthic macroinvertebrates||Statistical analysis||Aquatic ecosystems","Statistical species distribution modelling of stream invertebrate and fish communities","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-02-05T14:36:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"26954",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we assess the processes controlling the removal of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) for four sites in the eutrophic Stockholm archipelago. Bottom water concentrations of oxygen (O2) and P are inversely correlated. This is attributed to the seasonal release of P from iron-oxide-bound (Fe-oxide-bound) P in surface sediments and from degrading organic matter. The abundant presence of sulfide in the pore water and its high upward flux towards the sediment surface (∼4 to 8 mmol m−2 d−1), linked to prior deposition of organic-rich sediments in a low-O2 setting (“legacy of hypoxia”), hinder the formation of a larger Fe-oxide-bound P pool in winter. This is most pronounced at sites where water column mixing is naturally relatively low and where low bottom water O2 concentrations prevail in summer. Burial rates of P are high at all sites (0.03–0.3 mol m−2 yr−1), a combined result of high sedimentation rates (0.5 to 3.5 cm yr−1) and high sedimentary P at depth (∼30 to 50 µmol g−1). Sedimentary P is dominated by Fe-bound P and organic P at the sediment surface and by organic P, authigenic Ca-P and detrital P at depth. Apart from one site in the inner archipelago, where a vivianite-type Fe(II)-P mineral is likely present at depth, there is little evidence for sink switching of organic or Fe-oxide-bound P to authigenic P minerals. Denitrification is the major benthic nitrate-reducing process at all sites (0.09 to 1.7 mmol m−2 d−1) with rates decreasing seaward from the inner to outer archipelago. Our results explain how sediments in this eutrophic coastal system can remove P through burial at a relatively high rate, regardless of whether the bottom waters are oxic or (frequently) hypoxic. Our results suggest that benthic N processes undergo annual cycles of removal and recycling in response to hypoxic conditions. Further nutrient load reductions are expected to contribute to the recovery of the eutrophic Stockholm archipelago from hypoxia. Based on the dominant pathways of P and N removal identified in this study, it is expected that the sediments will continue to remove part of the P and N loads.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000418034",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-17-2745-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/418034","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Removal of phosphorus and nitrogen in sediments of the eutrophic Stockholm archipelago, Baltic Sea","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-04T02:36:44Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85085475357",,"000537450600001",,"10","Biogeosciences","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To quantify and improve the attributability of soil aqueous-phase effects, we introduced a synthetic and traceable bacterial community to simple porous microcosms and subjected the community to constant or dynamic hydration conditions. The results were expressed in terms of absolute abundance and show species-specific responses to hydration and nutrient conditions. Hydration dynamics exerted a significant influence on the fraction of less-abundant species, especially after extended incubation periods.

The fate of OC in lake sediments depends significantly on the activities of sedimentary microorganisms which gain energy from the remineralization of OC through a complex network of catabolic reactions. The amount of OC that is deposited to sediments depends on many factors, of which nutrient inputs to overlying water, and stimulation of photosynthetic biomass production by primary production, is a key factor. Consequently, anthropogenic nutrient input, which results in strong increases in OC loading by stimulating phytoplankton growth through a process called eutrophication has a strong impact on the sources of OC and deposition rates of OC to lake sediments. Yet, the interactions between changes in OC sources and OC deposition rates and microbial communities and microbial activity are not well understood. In this doctoral project, I first investigate the mechanisms by which eutrophication drives the microbial abundance, diversity, and community structure in lake sediments. Then I compare the differences in decay rates and preservation of OC from different sources and source organisms, and also investigate the influence of eutrophication on OC decay rates in lake sediments. Furthermore, I investigate the role of eutrophication in controlling OC chemical composition, macromolecule hydrolysis, and carbohydrate degradation in lake sediments. These chapters are implemented through highly interdisciplinary approaches of organic geochemistry, biogeochemistry, microbiology, and sedimentology. In the first research chapter (Chapter 2), I investigate the impact of anthropogenic eutrophication, which affects redox chemistry and OC sources in surface sediments, on microbial community structure across five lakes from highly eutrophic to oligotrophic in central Switzerland. For each lake, I examine pore-water redox chemistries, aquatic and terrestrial OC sources based on lipid and lignin biomarkers, microbial gene abundance and community compositions determined based on bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and amplicon sequencing. Our study shows that, aquatic OC contributions and microbial activity increase strongly with increasing trophic state. Across all lakes, 16S rRNA genes analyses indicate similar depth-dependent zonations at the phylum- and class-level that follow vertical distributions of OC sources and respiration reactions. At order-level and below, changes in OC sources due to eutrophication cause permanent changes in bacterial community structure. In contrast, archaeal communities are differentiated according to trophic state in recently deposited layers, but converge in older sediments deposited under different trophic conditions. In the second research chapter (Chapter 3), we further investigate the degradation and preservation of OC from different sources and source organisms, by combining different OC pools from lipid and lignin biomarkers, macromolecules by pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (pyrolysis-GC/MS), and eukaryotic DNA analyses, in surface sediments of lake with different trophic status (the same lakes as Chapter 2). Our results show that, OC from diatoms and green algae degrades much faster than OC from terrestrial vascular plants, which is highly stable through time. Decay rates of diatom, green algal and vascular plant DNA do not differ significantly in relation to trophic state. However, decay rates of diatom DNA are significantly higher than those of diatom lipid biomarkers, consistent with the higher chemical reactivity of DNA compared to membrane lipids. Diatom DNA also degrades significantly faster than green algal DNA. More resistance of cell wall components of green algae and vascular plants to microbial degradation is likely responsible for the longer preservation of green algal and vascular plant DNA. The third research chapter (Chapter 4), we investigate the impact of eutrophication on macromolecule composition and distribution, more importantly on macromolecule hydrolysis and carbohydrate degradation across the five lakes (the same lakes as Chapter 2). Through pyrolysis-GC/MS and shotgun metagenomic sequencing, OC chemical compositions and microbial gene functions involved in metabolic pathways are examined. Macromolecule analyses show that OC is dominated by carbohydrates, proteins and lipids across five lakes and decrease through time. The four eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes are enriched in fresh carbohydrates, polysaccharides and chitin as compared to the oligotrophic lake. Monosaccharides decrease with sediment age and are dominated by neutral and amino sugars. Metagenomic analyses indicate the significant role of eutrophication in controlling carbohydrate hydrolysis and monosaccharide fermentation, which increase with increasing trophic state. Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP), Entner-Doudoroff (ED) and pentose pathways are important monomer fermentation pathways in all lakes, while EMP appears to be more important and stronger with increasing trophic state.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488233",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488233","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Influence of eutrophication on microbial community structure,  organic carbon sources, and organic carbon degradation in lake sediments through time","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-06-03T19:36:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27341",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Methane-oxidizing bacteria effectively convert this potent greenhouse gas into biomass and carbon dioxide. These bacteria are present throughout the water column, where methane concentrations can range from nanomolar to millimolar. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that methanotroph assemblages in a seasonally stratified freshwater lake are adapted to the contrasting methane concentrations in the epi- and hypolimnion. We further hypothesized that lake overturn would change the apparent methane oxidation kinetics as more methane becomes available in the epilimnion. In addition to the change in the methane oxidation kinetics, we investigated changes in the transcription of genes encoding methane monooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for the first step of methane oxidation, with metatranscriptomics. Using laboratory incubations of the natural microbial communities, we show that the half-saturation constant (Km) for methane – the methane concentration at which half the maximum methane oxidation rate is reached – was 20 times higher in the hypolimnion than in the epilimnion during stable stratification. During lake overturn, however, the kinetic constants in the epi- and hypolimnion converged along with a change in the transcriptionally active methanotroph assemblage. Conventional particulate methane monooxygenase appeared to be responsible for methane oxidation under different methane concentrations. Our results suggest that methane availability is one important factor for creating niches for methanotroph assemblages with well-adapted methane oxidation kinetics. This rapid selection and succession of adapted lacustrine methanotroph assemblages allowed the previously reported high removal efficiency of methane transported to the epilimnion to be maintained – even under rapidly changing conditions during lake overturn. Consequently, only a small fraction of methane stored in the anoxic hypolimnion is emitted to the atmosphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000441306",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-17-4247-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/441306","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Lake mixing regime selects apparent methane oxidation kinetics of the methanotroph assemblage","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-19T02:58:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85093819387",,"000566346600002",,"16","Biogeosciences","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

INPs have often been collected at the Jungfraujoch research station (at 3500 m a.s.l.) in central Switzerland; yet spatially diverse data on INP occurrence in the Swiss Alps are scarce and remain uncharacterized. We address this scarcity through our Swiss alpine snow sample study which took place during the winter of 2018. We collected a total of 88 fallen snow samples across the Alps at 17 different locations and investigated the impact of altitude, terrain, time since last snowfall and depth on freezing temperatures. The INP concentrations were measured using the homebuilt DRoplet Ice Nuclei Counter Zurich (DRINCZ) and were then compared to spatial, temporal and physiochemical parameters. Boxplots of the freezing temperatures showed large variability in INP occurrence, even for samples collected 10 m apart on a plain and 1 m apart in depth. Furthermore, undiluted samples had cumulative INP concentrations ranging between 1 and 200 INP mL-1 of snowmelt over a temperature range of -5 to -19 oC. From this field-collected dataset, we parameterized the cumulative INP concentrations per m-3 of air as a function of temperature with the following equation c_air^* (T)=e^(-0.7T-7.05), comparing well with previously reported precipitation data presented in Petters and Wright, 2015.  When assuming (1) a snow precipitation origin of the INPs, (2) a cloud water content of 0.4 g m-3 and (3) a critical INP concentration for glaciation of 10 m-3, the majority of the snow precipitated from clouds with glaciation temperatures between -5 and -20 °C. Based on the observed variability in INP concentrations, we conclude that studies conducted at the high-altitude research station Jungfraujoch are representative for INP measurements in the Swiss Alps. Furthermore, the INP concentration estimates in precipitation allow us to extrapolate the concentrations to a frozen cloud fraction. Indeed, this approach for estimating the liquid water to ice ratio in mixed phase clouds compares well with aircraft measurements, ground-based lidar and satellite retrievals of frozen cloud fractions. In all, the generated parameterization for INP concentrations in snowmelt could help estimate cloud glaciation temperatures.","application/pdf||application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","10.3929/ethz-b-000387058",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-163-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387058","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Atmospheric chemistry||Ice nucleation||Mixed-phase cloud","Spatial and temporal variability in the ice-nucleating ability of alpine snowmelt and extension to cloud frozen fraction","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-22T21:35:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Organic aerosols’ impact on aerosol-cloud interactions in mixed-phase clouds||Elucidating Ice Nucleation Mechanisms Relevant to the Atmosphere: Is deposition nucleation really immersion freezing in pores?","179703||179703||179703||156581","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","Ambizione||Projekte MINT",,,"85077907587",,"000505679400001","Atmos. chem. phys.","1","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The number of completed dam projects peaked in North America and Western Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. In the last decades, instead, the hydropower industry moved to build dams in the global south in order to serve growing industries and urban populations. The ongoing growth of the hydropower sector at low latitudes calls for an examination of the political, socio-economic and environmental effects of tropical dams. Despite the many services provided by dams, they affect the river ecosystem in many different ways. Dams disrupt the continuum of rivers by altering their natural hydrological regimes and also create new lentic systems by increasing water residence time. This has cascading effects on the morphology, biogeochemistry and ecology of downstream river environments. Concerning biogeochemistry, dams interrupt the flow of organic carbon, change the nutrient balance and alter oxygen and thermal conditions. Thus, they alter river water quality. Large reservoirs are also potential hotspots for mineralization processes. Thus, reservoirs, especially in the tropics, may be responsible for substantial amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, the scientific community started analysing the environmental impacts of large dams in a more holistic manner to better inform stakeholders and decision-makers to find a balance between tapping hydropower potential and sustaining key natural resources. This project investigates the effects of damming on water quality at low latitudes with a specific focus on three water quality parameters: water temperature, dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO2). Water temperature and dissolved oxygen are key parameters for the survival and reproduction of aquatic species. Water temperature alterations can affect community composition and even trigger the local extinction of species. Low oxygen concentrations alter lifecycle performance, growth capacity, reproductive success and disease vulnerability of fish, whilst hypoxia leads to higher fish mortality. Carbon dioxide, instead, is a greenhouse gas and most of the carbon mineralized in inland waters is released as CO2 to the atmosphere. Major uncertainties remain regarding the consequences of anthropogenic hydrological alterations, especially those stemming from large dams, on carbon emissions. This thesis considers the Zambezi River Basin (southeastern Africa) as a specific case study. The Zambezi River Basin is one of the most dammed African river basins, and many additional dams are already planned or under construction. Among others, the Zambezi River Basin hosts Kariba Dam, which forms the largest artificial lake in the world by volume. Kariba Dam and its hydropower plant are transboundary structures, with management shared between Zambia and Zimbabwe. In general, the transboundary character of water infrastructures complicates the water resources management and thus, serious omissions in the discussion of downstream water quality effects often occur. This specific case study in the Zambezi Basin serves as a starting point to shed some light on the general effects of large dams on water quality at low latitudes. The first study of this thesis presents a global review and synthesis of the effects of river damming on water quality with a special focus on low latitudes. Two physical processes were identified as drivers of most water quality changes: the trapping of sediments and nutrients and the thermal stratification in reservoirs. Analysing the mixing behaviour of the 54 largest low-latitude reservoirs revealed that most, if not all, large low-latitude reservoirs stratify on at least a seasonal basis. Stratification creates density and temperature gradients within the lake water column, facilitating the development of low-oxygen conditions in the deep colder waters. By releasing such water, low-latitude large dams have the potential to impact downstream ecosystems by altering thermal regimes or causing hypoxic stress. The second study of this thesis shows how a detailed statistical analysis of vertical profiles in reservoirs allows generating an assessment tool for water quality alterations downstream of large dams. This finding suggests that designing and maintaining an efficient water quality monitoring of reservoirs is key for their sustainable management. Due to the spatial heterogeneity of water quality in large reservoirs, water quality monitoring should be designed for capturing the temporal dynamics close to outlets of dams in order to predict downstream water quality. In the third study, the alterations of the thermal and oxygen regimes of the Zambezi River downstream of Kariba Dam were quantified by means of a one-dimensional numerical lake model. Results suggest that these alterations depend on the stratification and the water level of the reservoir but also on the management of water withdrawal, thus on the transboundary policies of the dam. Scenarios show that cooperative management of the existing infrastructure of Kariba Dam has the potential to partially mitigate the actual downstream water quality alterations. These results reveal that transboundary dams may offer additional opportunities for optimized management. Moreover, outcomes show that biogeochemical lake models are effective tools to test the effectiveness of such transboundary management scenarios to mitigate downstream water quality alterations. Finally, the last part of the thesis addresses the effects of large dams on the carbon dioxide emission dynamics of inland waters. Monitoring the seasonal and sub-daily fluctuations of water quality properties downstream of Kariba Dam revealed that atmospheric CO2 emissions from the Zambezi River surface downstream of Kariba fluctuate strongly over different timescales. Seasonal changes were driven by reservoir stratification and the accumulation of carbon dioxide in hypolimnetic waters. Sub-daily variability of CO2 emissions, instead, was linked to the hydropeaking resulting from the daily variability in electricity production. Failing to account for these fluctuations in downstream CO2 emissions could lead to errors in the carbon budgeting of hydroelectric reservoirs. Thus, it is critically important to include both limnological seasonality and dam operation at sub-daily time steps in our assessment of carbon budgeting of reservoirs and carbon cycling along the aquatic continuum. This thesis underlines potential environmental drawbacks associated with hydropower, nevertheless recognizing the many benefits of such energy source to societies worldwide. Thus, it aims at inspiring innovative strategies for more sustainable design and management of dams.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000476521",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/476521","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","hydropower||Dams and reservoirs||water quality||low latitudes","Modelling the effects of large dams on water quality in tropical rivers","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-03-26T10:21:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268||690268||690268","10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100007352","SBFI||SBFI||SBFI","H2020||H2020||H2020","27143",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Lake sediments produce large amounts of methane, which accumulate in the oxygen-depleted bottom waters of stratified lakes. Climate change and eutrophication may increase the number of lakes with methane storage in the future. Whether stored methane escapes to the atmosphere during annual lake overturn is a matter of controversy and depends critically on the response of the methanotroph assemblage. Here we show, by combining 16S rRNA gene and pmoA mRNA amplicon sequencing, qPCR, CARD-FISH and potential methane-oxidation rate measurements, that the methanotroph assemblage in a mixing lake underwent both a substantial bloom and ecological succession. As a result, methane oxidation kept pace with the methane supplied from methane-rich bottom water and most methane was oxidized. This aspect of freshwater methanotroph ecology represents an effective mechanism limiting methane transfer from lakes to the atmosphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000405674",,"2399-3642",,"10.1038/s42003-020-0838-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/405674","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Growth and rapid succession of methanotrophs effectively limit methane release during lake overturn","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-03-19T02:40:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85081380637",,"000519717500006","Commun Biol","1","Communications Biology","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we evaluated the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) POV and LRTP Screening Tool (“the Tool”) with respect to the POV and LRTP estimates that the Tool provides for organophosphate esters (OPEs). We found that the use of default parameter values could significantly underestimate POV and LRTP values of OPEs and, potentially, other Persistent Mobile Organic Compounds (PMOCs), by not accounting for episodic atmospheric transport and poleward river-based transport in the northern hemisphere. Specifically, sensitivity and Monte Carlo uncertainty analyses indicate that non-chlorinated OPEs could be subject to LRTP when uncertainties in gas-particle partitioning and its implications for atmospheric degradation are considered, and chlorinated OPEs when river-based transport is considered. Further, the analyses showed strong dependence of results on the accuracy of the environmental half-lives used as input parameters. We suggest that the Tool could be modified to include an optional “Arctic (PMOC) LRTP setting” that incorporates episodic atmospheric and river-based transport as well as decreased environmental half-lives due to cold temperatures.",,,,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/c9em00410f","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458733","en","Royal Society of Chemistry",,,,"Evaluation of the OECD POV and LRTP screening tool for estimating the long-range transport of organophosphate esters","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-12-30T10:02:45Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Environ Sci Process Impacts","1","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Besides their influence on  tropospheric chemistry, VOCs also affect air quality and climate both directly and indirectly.  Biogenic VOC (BVOCs) emissions are the predominant source on a global scale, while in  the urban areas anthropogenic VOCs are more important. Among them, traffic and solid fuel  combustion are important emission sources. After emission, they react with various oxidants,  yielding oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs). Due to the high variabilities of VOC sources and  reactivity, the determination of VOC sources remains challenging. Due to limitations in the  measurement techniques, a large fraction of OVOCs in the urban areas is still poorly  understood.   In this dissertation, we used a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass  spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) in different urban environments to investigate the VOC  emission sources and to obtain a deeper understanding of their chemical evolution with  support from the positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model. Intensive campaigns  were carried out at two sites in Delhi, India, as well as an urban site in Beijing, China, and  an urban site in Zurich, Switzerland.   The measurement campaigns in Delhi aimed at characterizing for the first time a wide  range of VOCs in this severely polluted environment. At both the urban and suburban site,  high nocturnal concentrations of VOCs were observed with strong day-night variations.  Primary emissions were predominant at both sites, mostly from traffic and solid fuel  combustion. Large amount of aromatics, furans and phenols were emitted and were  significantly elevated at night. The secondary factors, which were dominated by oxygenated  VOCs were substantially higher during daytime. A comparison between the two sites  showed that primary sources were significant at both sites, however, OVOC concentrations  were higher at the suburban site. While the urban OVOCs were tightly associated with aging  of local primary emissions, the suburban OVOCs represented both local oxidation and  regional aging.    The measurement campaign in Beijing was performed to investigate VOC evolution  during winter and the potential roles of VOCs to SOA formation under haze conditions. Ten VOC families were classified, which showed clear variation of the relative composition as a  function of the VOC concentration. The haze periods were driven by very high  concentrations of aromatics originating from traffic and solid fuel combustion. Trajectory  analysis indicated that both accumulation and regional influences were important for high  VOC concentrations during haze periods. The OVOC factor was predominant during the  clean periods, but decreased significantly during the haze periods. Meanwhile, oxygenated  organic aerosol (OOA) concentration were enhanced during high VOC concentration  periods, indicating the importance of OVOCs to secondary organic aerosol formation.   The Zurich campaign focused on the chemical evolution of VOCs and their oxidation  products in a relatively clean urban environment in summer. Traffic was the major  anthropogenic source, with an additional local source related to activities such as cigarette  smoke. Three OVOC factors were identified representing oxidation processes of different  oxidants and precursors. Two OVOC factors featured strong contributions from aromatic  oxidation and were separated by day-night chemistry. The third OVOC factor was  characterized by strong biogenic influences and exhibited similar temporal variation as  biogenic SOA. A comparison with the biogenic SOA composition showed similarities in  important organic family time series in both the gas and aerosol phase.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000475028",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/475028","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Volatile organic compounds in urban environments:  composition, source apportionment, and chemical  transformation","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2021-03-17T09:52:01Z","2023-03-17",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27105",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
