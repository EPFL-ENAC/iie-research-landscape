To better understand how to incentivize private-sector investors for LDN, we conducted an online-survey of 68 private-sector investors. Structural equation modelling based on the theory of planned behavior was performed to investigate how cognitive, social, emotional, motivational and financial determinants influence their intention and motivation to invest in LDN. Good knowledge and a positive attitude towards both LDN and investing sustainably were found to be main predictors for intention. In contrast, perceived social pressure had little effect on the intention to invest towards combating land degradation. The general motivation to invest sustainably was mainly triggered by a consciousness for sustainability and emotional attachment, less by the desire for short-term profit maximisation whilst prospects of long-term financial return are important. Overall, strong homogeneity in psychological determinants was found for both traditional and impact investors. As the determinants of the intention and the motivation to invest sustainably do not substantially differ across different investor types, our study implies that investors should be targeted as a uniform group when mobilising interest for LDN. Emphasis should be placed on the psychological determinants traditional and impact investors commonly share, rather than on the type-specific characteristics that may distinguish different investor types.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000312089",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0208813","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/312089","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Private-sector investor’s intention and motivation to invest in Land Degradation Neutrality",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-12-19T14:07:11Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85058470644",,"000453247500042","PLoS ONE","12","PLoS ONE","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Causes are integral components of the telecoupling framework, yet the rigor with which they have been identified and evaluated to date is unknown. We address this knowledge gap by systematically reviewing causal attribution in the telecoupling literature (n = 89 studies) and developing a standardized causal terminology and typology for consistent use in telecoupling research. Causes are defined based on six criteria: sector (e.g., environmental, economic), system of origin (i.e., sending, receiving, spillover), agent, distance, response time (i.e., time lapse between cause and effect), and direction (i.e., producing positive or negative effects). Using case studies from the telecoupling literature, we demonstrate the need to enhance the rigor of telecoupling causal attribution by combining qualitative and quantitative methods via process-tracing, counterfactual analysis, and related approaches. Rigorous qualitative-quantitative causal attribution is critical for accurately assessing the social-ecological causes and consequences of telecouplings and thereby identifying leverage points for informed management and governance of telecoupled systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000359681",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su10124426","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/359681","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Telecoupling||Causality||Effect||Coupled human||Natural systems","Toward Rigorous Telecoupling Causal Attribution: A Systematic Review and Typology",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-08-21T13:12:53Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,"SNF R4D","152167","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 60: Gesuch",,,,,,,,,"12","Sustainability","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While many of these processes interlink at global scales, their impacts manifest and are felt differently across locales and regions, given context-specific and diverse natural and social factors. Consequently, research that responds to these impacts, i.e. generate ‘transformation’ knowledge on policy or other options to reduce net losses experienced because of these impacts, combines diverse scientific disciplines and inputs from practice and broader society.  However, a core issue that has not yet received much research attention is whether one can infer that knowledge produced in a particular social and regional context is also applicable in another context, and if so how or under which epistemic criteria. Transferability of knowledge across cases is a critical issue for the overall quality of this research and consequently how these are viewed as evidence in assessments for action, given that inference on the application of knowledge for another case is often done on implicit assumptions. Yet, a systematic discussion of transferability across cases is missing.  A proposal to first conceptualize transferability of knowledge across cases as arguments by analogy, was presented as a contribution to advance this debate (Adler et al 2018). Arguments by analogy imply identifying explicit considerations on whether the cases in question are sufficiently similar in relevant aspects while not dissimilar in other additional relevant aspects. On the one hand, this approach calls for explicit material considerations that are needed to learn about which aspects of cases are indeed relevant. On the other hand, formal considerations on how to weigh perceived relevant similarities and dissimilarities of the cases at hand for transferability are also needed. In this panel presentation, I highlight empirical results on research currently undertaken on the questions of what and how key knowledge is considered transferable from one case to another, focusing on the epistemic criteria that applies in this judgement (Elliott & McKaughan, 2014). This presentation therefore corresponds to the proposed panel’s question that asks: For what contextual and normative conditions are the considered strategies successful, and under what conditions are they not? Overall, the foreseen contribution of this presentation is an empirically based representation on how knowledge about a problem in a specific case applies to another case, as a fundamental first step for scoping the potential for scalability for global change strategies such as climate change adaptation.

In response to these challenges, national and local governments, as well as private and non-governmental actors, have developed new forest conservation governance mechanisms. In addition to reducing deforestation for agricultural expansion, it is hoped that these policies may lead to the intensification of existing agricultural regions, thereby contributing to global food availability and continued rural development. The objective of this study is to understand the timing and spatial patterns of crop and pasture intensification in agriculture-forest frontiers in the context of changing conservation policies and rural development. We focus on Mato Grosso, the largest soy and cattle producing state in Brazil, which spans the Cerrado and Amazon biomes and has experienced among the highest levels of deforestation for agricultural expansion globally. Using econometric analysis of remotely sensed and agricultural survey data, we find that cropland and pasture intensification are both linked to increasing forest conservation restrictions and broader supply chain development. However, the effect of conservation restrictions on intensification is lower in regions where there is more forest remaining. While crop and pasture area dynamics are often coupled in agriculture-forest frontiers, crop intensification does not appear to have contributed to pasture intensification through animal feed production. Intensification of crop and pasture areas was associated with temporary, immediate reductions in local deforestation, but crop intensification was associated with increased deforestation over longer time periods. These results suggest that targeted investments in supply chain infrastructure in the Amazon frontier could promote intensification and relieve pressure to clear forests, but must be coupled with substantial, long-term negative incentives for deforestation, including more effective public forest governance and private zero-deforestation commitments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000359689",,"0959-3780||1872-9495",,"10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.09.011","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/359689","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Intensification in agriculture-forest frontiers: Land use responses to development and conservation policies in Brazil",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-08-21T13:25:52Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Glob. environ. change",,"Global Environmental Change","53","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Numerous scholars have problematized this approach. They have shown that increasing the levels of flood protection can attract more settlements and high-value assets in the areas protected by the new measures. Other studies have explored how structural measures can generate a sense of complacency, which can act to reduce preparedness. These paradoxical risk changes have been described as “levee effect”, “safe development paradox” or “safety dilemma”. In this commentary, we briefly review this phenomenon by critically analysing the intended benefits and unintended effects of structural flood protection, and then we propose an interdisciplinary research agenda to uncover these paradoxical dynamics of risk.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000291298",,"1027-5606||1607-7938","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/291298||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302382","10.5194/hess-22-5629-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302913","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Hess Opinions: An interdisciplinary research agenda to explore the unintended consequences of structural flood protection",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-09-24T12:16:47Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85056254130",,"000448693500002","Hydrol.

We focus on Germany's solar photovoltaics feed-in tariff policy between 2003 and 2011 and analyse two design features, technology specificity and application specificity. Our results show that both features are highly important in technology selection and that spillover effects between applications exist. Policies that fail to consider these effects can unintendedly lock in or lock out technologies. To avoid this, policymakers can leverage the fact that different technologies are competitive in different applications and, by designing application-specific deployment policies, effectively offer a level playing field for competing technologies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000292700",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aae161","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/292700","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Feed-in tariff||Deployment policy||Policy design||Technology specificity||Application specificity||Solar PV||Agent-based modelling||Technological lock-in","Supporting energy technology deployment while avoiding unintended technological lock-in: A policy design perspective",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-10-01T11:28:14Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,"Opening the black box of the co-evolution of policy and technology in the energy sector","166905","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Assistant Professor (AP) Energy Grants",,,,,"85055814436",,"000446692100002","Environ.

We review the literature on this topic from a global perspective. In terms of environmental and climate change effects, organic farming is less polluting than conventional farming when measured per unit of land but not when measured per unit of output. Organic farming, which currently accounts for only 1% of global agricultural land, is lower yielding on average. Due to higher knowledge requirements, observed yield gaps might further increase if a larger number of farmers would switch to organic practices. Widespread upscaling of organic agriculture would cause additional loss of natural habitats and also entail output price increases, making food less affordable for poor consumers in developing countries. Organic farming is not the paradigm for sustainable agriculture and food security, but smart combinations of organic and conventional methods could contribute toward sustainable productivity increases in global agriculture.",,,,"1941-1340||1941-1359",,"10.1146/annurev-resource-100517-023252","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539551","en","Annual Reviews",,,"Organic food||Nutrition and health effects||Environmental effects||Climate change||Technology adoption||Smallholder farmers","Organic Agriculture, Food Security, and the Environment",,"Review Article","Metadata only",,,"JEL - JEL::O - Economic Development, Innovation, Technological Change, and Growth::O1 - Economic Development::O13 - Agriculture; Natural Resources; Energy; Environment; Other Primary Products||JEL - JEL::Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics::Q0 - General::Q01 - Sustainable Development||JEL - JEL::Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics::Q5 - Environmental Economics::Q56 - Environment and Development; Environment and Trade; Sustainability; Environmental Accounts and Accounting; Environmental Equity; Population Growth||JEL - JEL::Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics::Q5 - Environmental Economics::Q57 - Ecological Economics: Ecosystem Services; Biodiversity Conservation; Bioeconomics; Industrial Ecology",,"2022-03-28T07:43:18Z",,,,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","Annual Review of Resource Economics","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The Swiss Energy Strategy 2050 aims to increase the generation of domestic non-hydropower renewable electricity from the current of 5% to about 20% of the electricity consumed nowadays. Of this 20%, the strategy foresees about a half coming from solar and wind domestic electricity, and the other half from biomass. The Swiss strategy also targets to reduce electricity demand, and to maintain existing natural gas power plants. Although gas plants would supply a small share to the total electricity demand, they would not reduce CO2 emissions in the Swiss electricity system. The successful implementation of the aforementioned energy targets may pose two challenges for the energy transition.  A first challenge that follows from the increase of solar and wind electricity production is how to maintain supply reliability with an increased variability in production. Balancing fluctuations in electricity supply and demand while eliminating CO2 emissions in the electricity system requires new solutions. Balancing electricity supply and demand is even more challenging if we want to avoid an increase in electricity production costs. A solution to maintain a reliable electricity system would include imports, although imports may be seen by the public as a dependence on foreign countries. A second challenge for the increase of domestic renewable electricity production is to reduce public opposition to the infrastructure that comes along with such projects. Public opposition to renewable energy infrastructure can delay or obstruct the implementation of renewable energy projects and therefore the fulfilment of policy targets. This thesis tackles a set of complementary but linked questions that follow from the challenges associated with the energy transition in three complementary contributions.  Contribution 1 explores what are the trade-off between electricity cost and reliability in a system with high shares of renewables. To that end, this thesis examines  the need for natural gas to balance the electricity supply in a system with high shares of renewable electricity. It also examines supply reliability and electricity costs in an electricity system with different levels of carbon emissions. I tackle these two questions using an electricity system model to analyze three policy scenarios for the Swiss electricity system: carbon-free, gas-intensive, and gas as a bridging fuel. The results show that it is possible to reliably supply electricity with a carbon-free system at a cost comparable to that of a system that uses natural gas. This is possible by building domestic renewables and up to 30% imported renewables, either offshore wind from the North Sea or Concentrated Solar Power from Morocco.  Contributions 2 and 3 explore what are the stakeholders’ reasons to accept and oppose the increase of renewables. I study stakeholders’ opinions at different levels of the government in the decision-making process of key renewable electricity projects. To tackle this question, I use Q methodology to extract perspectives on what matters to stakeholders in the implementation of the specific renewable energy project in the current situation and time. Concretely, I study drivers and barriers for the increase of renewables that could derive from stakeholders’ perspectives during the implementation of two renewables projects in rural Switzerland.  Contribution 2 studies a small hydropower plant, and reveals three major stakeholders’ perspectives. Energy policy preferences varied amongst local, cantonal and national levels in the federal system. While local stakeholders are pro production of electricity, national stakeholders are pro efficiency. The results show that there is still the risk that stakeholders divert away from the increase of renewable electricity production, because they prioritize different policy targets. I conclude that inclusive and exclusive, national and local interests must be analyzed carefully, and prioritized according to the local characteristics of the project. The barriers to the implementation are rooted in the numerous administrative bodies in the federal system, e.g. dissatisfaction with delays and complexity in decision-making process.  Contribution 3 studies a pilot photovoltaic project in the Swiss Alps, and reveals four major stakeholders’ perspectives during the implementation process. The results show that stakeholders perceive cost-benefit and technology barriers very differently (e.g. rising costs during the decision process, final project profitability, and unsuccessful funding activities). The results also show the important role of project’s initiators to maintain trust during the decision-making process. Stakeholders are more concerned about barriers during the implementation than about negative outcomes of the project. The project’s contribution to the regional and local economy was found to be the major driver for stakeholders to engage in the implementation process.  Overall I conclude, that while from a technical standpoint, a 100% renewable electricity system can indeed be reliable and cost effective, it is crucial to overcome barriers at the phase of the local implementation of projects for a successful energy transition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000296864",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/296864","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Energy Policy||Swiss Energy Strategy 2050||Energy model||Stakeholder engagement||Photovoltaic||Hydropower","Policy Analyses of Options for Implementing the Swiss Energy Strategy",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::330 - Economics",,,"2018-10-17T19:55:58Z","2019-05-26",,,,,,,"yes",,,,"Sustainable waste and resource management to support the energy turnaround (wastEturn)","154053","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 70: Gesuch","24836",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A survey of scientists from the postdoctoral to adjunct professor level (N = 82) in the Department of Environmental Systems Science (D-USYS) of ETH  Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich) was thus conducted to investigate judgements, experiences, and ideas for improvement concerning equal career opportunities. About 90% of the respondents perceived no disadvantages based on gender, ethnicity, race, or faith. However, about 30% felt disadvantaged due to their age. Comments revealed not a single case in which latter disadvantages were based on prejudice. Instead, ETH-wide or national age and time-based restrictions for certain positions caused the inequality perceptions. Furthermore, comments indicated that these restrictions can disadvantage scientists taking care of children. Some participants suggested a revision or removal of corresponding rules. Further suggestions included an improved availability of childcare places. ETH Zurich recently undertook great efforts to provide excellent and affordable childcare services, increasing the number of available places by about 30% in the year following this survey.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000292898",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su10093343","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/292898","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Equal opportunities||Academic career||Sustainable development||Gender||Age||Discrimination||Leaky pipeline","Equal Opportunities in Academic Careers?

Here we investigate the origin of such biases in the Community Earth System Model. To disentangle the contribution of dynamics and thermodynamics, we perform simulations that include nudging of horizontal wind and compare them to simulations with a free atmosphere. Prescribing the observed large‐scale circulation improves the modeled weather patterns as well as many related fields. However, the larger part of the temperature and precipitation biases of the free atmosphere configuration remains after nudging, in particular, for extremes. Our results suggest that thermodynamical processes, including land‐atmosphere coupling and atmospheric parameterizations, drive the errors present in Community Earth System Model. Our result may apply to other climate models and highlight the importance of distinguishing thermodynamic and dynamic sources of biases in present‐day global climate models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000291432",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2018gl079220","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/291432","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Climate model biases||Earth system models||Atmospheric nudging||Dynamics versus thermodynamics||Global climate models||Systematic biases","Assessing the dynamic versus thermodynamic origin of climate model biases",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-09-25T08:15:55Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,"Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate","617518","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,,"85053203133",,"000445612500066","Geophys.

Yet existing understanding of the environmental impacts of exclusively pasture-based systems is limited by a lack of clarity about cattle herd dynamics. We model a nationwide transition from grain- to grass-finishing systems using demographics of present-day beef cattle. In order to produce the same quantity of beef as the present-day system, we find that a nationwide shift to exclusively grass-fed beef would require increasing the national cattle herd from 77 to 100 million cattle, an increase of 30%. We also find that the current pastureland grass resource can support only 27% of the current beef supply (27 million cattle), an amount 30% smaller than prior estimates. If grass-fed systems include cropland-raised forage, a definition that conforms to typical grass-fed certifications, these supplemental feeds can support an additional 34 million cattle to produce up to 61% of the current beef supply. Given the potential of forage feed croplands to compete with human food crop production, more work is required to determine optimal agricultural land uses. Future US demand in an entirely grass-and forage-raised beef scenario can only be met domestically if beef consumption is reduced, due to higher prices or other factors. If beef consumption is not reduced and is instead satisfied by greater imports of grass-fed beef, a switch to purely grass-fed systems would likely result in higher environmental costs, including higher overall methane emissions. Thus, only reductions in beef consumption can guarantee reductions in the environmental impact of US food systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000359683",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aad401","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/359683","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Food security||Environmental policy||Agricultural management||Land use||Dietary transitions||Cattle","Nationwide shift to grass-fed beef requires larger cattle population",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-08-21T13:15:55Z",,,,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Environ.

Such policies need to acknowledge the importance of private forests, and importantly they need to be based on a deep understanding of how property rights held by private forest owners vary across Europe. We collected and analysed data on the content of property rights based on formal legal requirements existing in 31 European jurisdictions. To allow a comparison across jurisdictions, we constructed an original Property Rights Index for Forestry encompassing five rights domains (access, withdrawal, management, exclusion and alienation). We documented substantial variation of the private forest owners’ rights, and notably to i) make decisions in operational management and the formulation of management goals, ii) withdraw timber resources from their forest, and iii) exclude others from the use of forest resources. We identified broad relations between the scope for decision making of private forest owners and jurisdictions’ former socio-political background and geographical distribution. The variation in the content of property rights has implications for the implementation of international environmental policies, and stresses the need for tailored policy instruments, when addressing European society’s rural development, the bioeconomy, climate change mitigation measures and nature protection strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000250212",,"0264-8377||1873-5754",,"10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.02.034","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/250212","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Property rights||Index||Private forests||Europe||Comparative analysis||Forest management","How private are Europe’s private forests?

Recent advancements in stormwater best management practices aim to push urban water social-ecological systems into a more sustainable regime that reconnects the hydrologic cycle and utilizes ecosystem services, such as inﬁltration and evapotranspiration, to improve the quality of urban and suburban water bodies. Collectively, these approaches are termed green infrastructure. As a decentralized approach, green infrastructure requires implementation on, as well as access to, property throughout a watershed, which poses particular governance challenges for watersheds where most land is held privately. We argue that green infrastructure on private property has a strong potential for creating a more sustainable regime through Citizen Stormwater Management, a participatory form of governance with strong citizen inﬂuence and engagement. We develop a classiﬁcation scheme to assess policy instruments’ degree of government intervention, citizen participation, and engagement. The paper explores how various policy instruments encourage Citizen Stormwater Management across the United States on both public and private property. We then conduct a textual analysis of ten years of publicly available data from Onondaga County, New York (USA) to assess the implementation of applicable policy instruments. Findings indicate that incentive-based (carrots) along with outreach (sermon) policies can play an important role when regulatory instruments (sticks) are lacking.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000273161",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su10062099","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/273161","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Green infrastructure||urban water management||policy instruments||participation||engagement||Citizen Stormwater Management","Green infrastructure through Citizen Stormwater Management: Policy instruments, participation and engagement",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-06-30T05:41:24Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85048928242",,"000436570100411",,"6","Sustainability","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, different interventions aimed at the intensification of livestock systems in Brazil may involve substantial social and environmental tradeoffs. Here we examine these tradeoffs using a whole-farm model calibrated for the Brazilian agricultural frontier state of Mato Grosso, one of the largest soybean and beef cattle production regions in the world. Specifically, we compare the costs and benefits of a typical extensive, continuously grazed cattle system relative to a specialized soybean production system and two improved cattle management strategies (rotational grazing and integrated soybean-cattle) under different climate scenarios. We found clear tradeoffs in GHG and nitrogen emissions, climate resilience, and water and energy use across these systems. Relative to continuously grazed or rotationally grazed cattle systems, the integreated soybean-cattle system showed higher food production and lower GHG emissions per unit of human digestible protein, as well as increased resilience under climate change (both in terms of productivity and financial returns). All systems suffered productivity and profitability losses under severe climate change, highlighting the need for climate smart agricultural development strategies in the region. By underscoring the economic feasibility of improving the performance of cattle systems, and by quantifying the tradeoffs of each option, our results are useful for directing agricultural and climate policy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000359684",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aac4d1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/359684","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Integrated crop-livestock systems||Climate scenarios||Pasture intensification||Low carbon agriculture||Sustainability","Tradeoffs in the quest for climate smart agricultural intensification in Mato Grosso, Brazil",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-08-21T13:17:44Z",,,,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Environ.

The new functionality enables model users to assess direct tropical cyclone risk of distinct sectors of the global economy separately. Furthermore and most importantly, it allows the analysis of indirect tropical cyclone risk arising from sector-sector interdependencies nationally, regionally and globally. For indirect risk estimation we implemented the Leontief and the Ghosh input-output models as well as an adapted version of the environmentally extended input-output analysis approach. Key strengths of the resulting model framework include its flexibility to cater to different user needs and its extendability with respect to future model development. Results at this stage require further testing and several key limitations have been identified which need be addressed in upcoming development stages. Nevertheless, a solid and fully functional foundation has been laid, providing previously not existing possibilities for global sectoral direct and indirect tropical cyclone risk estimation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543287",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543287","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Assessing Tropical Cyclone Risk along Global Value Chains",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,,,"2022-04-22T09:39:33Z","2023-04-22",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In an increasingly interconnected world, this represents a growing risk to businesses, ultimately affecting people and the long-term development of a region. The presented risk assessment method provides a multi-hazard risk assessment that helps to obtain a more comprehensive insight into such hazards and ripple effects, illustrated by the example of TCs. As a further benefit, the model is implemented as an extension of the open-source and open-access risk modeling platform CLIMADA and integrates only freely available input data. Thus, the model provides a valuable resource to the community studying the sectorial impacts of natural catastrophes. The findings of this study could aid in sector-specific measures to address the unequal impacts and will enable businesses to evaluate and better manage risk exposure and they can help to raise awareness among the public authorities responsible for import, export and trade.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000536071",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/536071","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Disasters, Risk Management, Business Interruption, Input-Output Economics, Decision-making","Assessing tropical cyclone weather and climate risk affecting global businesses",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,,,"2022-03-08T10:55:35Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We provide new comparisons of changes in climate at 1.5°C versus 2°C based on empirical sampling analyses of transient simulations versus simulations from the ‘Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts’ (HAPPI) multi-model experiment. The two approaches yield similar overall results regarding changes in climate extremes on land, and reveal a substantial difference in the occurrence of regional extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C. Land processes mediated through soil moisture feedbacks and land-use forcing play a major role for projected changes in extremes at 1.5°C in most mid-latitude regions, including densely populated areas in North America, Europe and Asia. This has important implications for low-emissions scenarios derived from integrated assessment models (IAMs), which include major LUCs in ambitious mitigation pathways (e.g. associated with increased bioenergy use), but are also shown to differ in the simulated LUC patterns. Biogeophysical effects from LUCs are not considered in the development of IAM scenarios, but play an important role for projected regional changes in climate extremes, and are thus of high relevance for sustainable development pathways.

Interest is growing in the protective role that coastal nature-based measures (or green infrastructure), such as reefs and wetlands, can play in adapting to these risks. However, a lack of quantitative information on their relative costs and benefits is one principal factor limiting their use more broadly. Here, we apply a quantitative risk assessment framework to assess coastal flood risk (from climate change and economic exposure growth) across the United States Gulf of Mexico coast to compare the cost effectiveness of different adaptation measures. These include nature-based (e.g. oyster reef restoration), structural or grey (e.g., seawalls) and policy measures (e.g. home elevation). We first find that coastal development will be a critical driver of risk, particularly for major disasters, but climate change will cause more recurrent losses through changes in storms and relative sea level rise. By 2030, flooding will cost Dollar 134–176.6 billion (for different economic growth scenarios), but as the effects of climate change, land subsidence and concentration of assets in the coastal zone increase, annualized risk will more than double by 2050 with respect to 2030. However, from the portfolio we studied, the set of cost-effective adaptation measures (with benefit to cost ratios above 1) could prevent up to Dollar 57–101 billion in losses, which represents 42.8–57.2% of the total risk. Nature-based adaptation options could avert more than Dollar 50 billion of these costs, and do so cost effectively with average benefit to cost ratios above 3.5. Wetland and oyster reef restoration are found to be particularly cost-effective. This study demonstrates that the cost effectiveness of nature-based, grey and policy measures can be compared quantitatively with one another, and that the cost effectiveness of adaptation becomes more attractive as climate change and coastal development intensifies in the future. It also shows that investments in nature-based adaptation could meet multiple objectives for environmental restoration, adaptation and flood risk reduction.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000261041",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0192132","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/261041","en","PLOS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Comparing the cost effectiveness of nature-based and coastal adaptation: A case study from the Gulf Coast of the United States",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-04-27T05:18:47Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85045193624",,"000429742900005","PLoS ONE","4","PLoS ONE","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Many municipal governments have joined two different global city networks that aim to promote climate policy development at the urban scale, and there is qualitative evidence that such networks play an important role in motivating cities to adopt climate policies and helping them to implement them. Our study objective is to test this proposition quantitatively, making use of a global database on cities’ environmental policy adoption, and also taking into account a large number of other factors that could play a role in climate policy adoption. Controlling for these other factors, we find that network membership does make a significant difference in the number of different measures that city governments adopt. We also find that there are significant differences between the two different networks, suggesting that the nature of the services that such networks offer their members can play an important role. Our findings lead to the provision of a set of global mitigation strategies: First of all, joining the city networks can lead to a generation of global strategies which can result into climate mitigation benefits. However, cities are required to select the network which provides proper tailor made policies. Second, in the absence of concrete international commitments at the local level, city networks lay the ground for global governance and enable cities to adopt policies independently and proactively. Third, consideration of co-benefits of climate policies can optimize the development of global strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000225158",,"1381-2386||1573-1596","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/213941||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/192190","10.1007/s11027-017-9747-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/225158","en","Springer Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate mitigation policies||Networks||Policy diffusion||Cities||Climate change","Subsistence over symbolism: the role of transnational municipal networks on cities’ climate policy innovation and adoption",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2017-10-06T04:41:42Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85020251058",,"000427993900003","Mitig. adapt. strategies glob. chang.","4","Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We present the results of an international expert elicitation (n = 14) on EGS induced seismicity hazard and risk. Using a hypothetical scenario of an EGS plant and its geological context, we show that expert best-guess estimates of annualized exceedance probabilities of an M ≥ 3 event range from 0.2%–95% during reservoir stimulation and 0.2%–100% during operation. Best-guess annualized exceedance probabilities of M ≥ 5 event span from 0.002%–2% during stimulation and 0.003%–3% during operation. Assuming that tectonic M7 events could occur, some experts do not exclude induced (triggered) events of up to M7 too. If an induced M = 3 event happens at 5 km depth beneath a town with 10 000 inhabitants, most experts estimate a 50% probability that the loss is contained within 500 000 USD without any injuries or fatalities. In the case of an induced M = 5 event, there is 50% chance that the loss is below 50 million USD with the most-likely outcome of 50 injuries and one fatality or none. As we observe a vast diversity in quantitative expert judgements and underlying mental models, we conclude with implications for induced seismicity risk governance. That is, we suggest documenting individual expert judgements in induced seismicity elicitations before proceeding to consensual judgements, to convene larger expert panels in order not to cherry-pick the experts, and to aim for multi-organization multi-model assessments of EGS induced seismicity hazard and risk.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000247409",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aa9eb2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/247409","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","enhanced geothermal systems||induced seismicity||expert elicitation||risk assessment||risk governance","Induced seismicity hazard and risk by enhanced geothermal systems: an expert elicitation approach",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-03-08T02:26:16Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,"Risk governance of electricity portfolios (RIGOROuS): Cross-technology and spatial tradeoffs of multiple risks","160563","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione Energie",,,,,"85048266598",,"000425435300004","Environ.

With the recent international commitment to limit global warming to well below 2°C, emission reductions need to be ambitious and could involve major land‐use change (LUC). Land‐based mitigation efforts to curb emissions growth include increasing terrestrial carbon sequestration through reforestation, or the adoption of bioenergy crops. These activities influence local climate through biogeophysical feedbacks, however, it is uncertain how important they are for a 1.5° climate target. This was the motivation for HAPPI‐Land: the half a degree additional warming, prognosis, and projected impacts—land‐use scenario experiment. Using four Earth system models, we present the first multimodel results from HAPPI‐Land and demonstrate the critical role of land use for understanding the characteristics of regional climate extremes in low‐emission scenarios. In particular, our results show that changes in temperature extremes due to LUC are comparable in magnitude to changes arising from half a degree of global warming. We also demonstrate that LUC contributes to more than 20% of the change in temperature extremes for large land areas concentrated over the Northern Hemisphere. However, we also identify sources of uncertainty that influence the multimodel consensus of our results including how LUC is implemented and the corresponding biogeophysical feedbacks that perturb climate. Therefore, our results highlight the urgent need to resolve the challenges in implementing LUC across models to quantify the impacts and consider how LUC contributes to regional changes in extremes associated with sustainable development pathways.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000260991",,"2328-4277",,"10.1002/2017EF000744","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/260991","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Biogeophysical Impacts of Land-Use Change on Climate Extremes in Low-Emission Scenarios: Results From HAPPI-Land",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-04-27T05:12:07Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,"Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach","641816","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,,,"85045531364",,"000430171600008",,"3","Earth's Future","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, this cost‐benefit approach may not guarantee robustness under uncertain future conditions, for instance under climatic changes. In this paper, we expand risk‐based decision analysis to explore possible ways of enhancing robustness in engineered water resources systems under different risk attitudes. Risk is measured as the expected annual cost of water use restrictions, while robustness is interpreted in the decision‐theoretic sense as the ability of a water resource system to maintain performance—expressed as a tolerable risk of water use restrictions—under a wide range of possible future conditions. Linking risk attitudes with robustness allows stakeholders to explicitly trade‐off incremental increases in robustness with investment costs for a given level of risk. We illustrate the framework through a case study of London's water supply system using state‐of‐the ‐art regional climate simulations to inform the estimation of risk and robustness.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000260988",,"2328-4277",,"10.1002/2017EF000730","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/260988","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Risk, Robustness and Water Resources Planning Under Uncertainty",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-04-27T05:10:33Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85043469539",,"000430171600013",,"3","Earth's Future","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It was the strongest winter storm since Lothar in 1999 and brought exceptionally strong winds, especially in the Jura mountains and on the Swiss Plateau. Wind gusts of 90-130 km/h have been recorded on the Plateau, gusts of 140-170 km/h in mountain areas and up to 200 km/h in some exposed places. The Rhone valley, the northern and central Grisons have been affected only moderately by the storm. The southern slopes of the Alps have been mostly untroubled by the storm. The weather model predictions have shown signals of an upcoming storm already four days before the event. The evidence was confirmed later on and MeteoSwiss issued a “heavy storm” warning (warning level 3, serious danger) timely with wind gusts of 80-110 km/h on the Plateau, 100-130 km/h in slightly elevated areas and 130-160 km/h in higher elevations of the Jura mountains and the Alps. The warning was broadly correct. On the southern slopes of the Jura mountains, in the Jura around Neuchâtel, along the central Prealps, in the Toggenburg and in the north-easterly parts of the Plateau, wind gusts of warning level 4 (serious danger) have been reached.  The numerical weather models COSMO-1 and COSMO-E from MeteoSwiss underestimated the wind gusts in the predictions in the beginning. The underestimation decreased clearly with increasing proximity to the event. The COSMO-1 model provided the best short-term forecasts and averaged over the whole of Switzerland. However, there was no additional benefit of the COSMO-1 model with respect to the other models on the Plateau north of the Alps.  Burglind/Eleanor is the strongest winter storm in Switzerland since Lothar in 1999 and is one of the four strongest winter storms since 1981. In some places, record breaking wind gusts have been registered. In most regions however, the wind gusts of Lothar and Vivian were clearly stronger. A winter storm like Burglind/Eleanor is expected about every 5-20 years for most places on the Swiss Plateau.  Burglind/Eleanor caused the largest infrastructure and forest damage from a winter storm since Lothar in 1999. The estimated infrastructure damage was around 165 Mio CHF (as of February 2018). There have been impairments in road- and rail-traffic and some interruptions in the power supply system. The storm felled around 1.3 million cubic metres of wood in Swiss forests.  MeteoSwiss informed the authorities and the general public well and fact based. The most important means of communication were the MeteoSwiss website and the MeteoSwiss App. A climatological classification of the event was quickly provided. MeteoSwiss was positively mentioned on all media channels.",,,,"2296-0058",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/269845","de","MeteoSchweiz",,,,"Der Wintersturm Burglind/Eleanor in der Schweiz",,"Report","Metadata only",,,,,"2018-06-13T16:17:35Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/home/service-und-publikationen/publikationen.subpage.html/de/data/publications/2018/6/der-wintersturm-burglind-eleanor-in-der-schweiz.html",,,,"Fachbericht MeteoSchweiz","268","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While data on observed cyclones tracks (location of the center) and wind speeds are publicly available, these data sets do not contain information about the spatial extent of the storm and people or assets exposed. Based on available spatially explicit data on population densities and gross domestic product (GDP) we estimate (1) the number of people and (2) the sum of assets exposed to wind speeds above these thresholds accounting for temporal changes in historical distribution of population and assets (TCE-hist) and assuming fixed 2015 patterns (TCE-2015). The associated spatially explicit and aggregated country-event-level exposure data (TCE-DAT) cover the period 1950 to 2015 and are freely available at https://doi.org/10.5880/pik.2017.01. This way, we are happy to provide key information to (1) assess the contribution of climatological versus socioeconomic drivers of changes in exposure to tropical cyclones, (2) estimate changes in vulnerability from the difference in exposure and reported damages and calibrate associated damage functions, and (3) build improved exposure- based predictors to estimate higher-level societal impacts such as long-term effects on GDP, employment, or migration. We expect that the free availability of the underlying model and TCE-DAT will make research on tropical cyclone risks more accessible to non-experts and stakeholders","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000235235",,"1866-3516||1866-3508",,"10.5194/essd-10-185-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/235235","en","Copernicus Publ.","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A global historical data set of tropical cyclone exposure (TCE-DAT)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-01-26T13:01:35Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000423406000001","Earth syst. sci. data","1","Earth System Science Data","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In contrast to research striving for generalizable findings, TD research produces insights for a particular case and context. TD researchers, who build on other TD projects’ results, need to know under what conditions knowledge gained from their case can be transferred to and applied in another case and context. Knowledge transfer between researchers and stakeholders is extensively discussed in the literature. However, a more profound understanding and management of the challenges related to knowledge transfer across cases, as it applies to TD research, are missing. We specify the challenges of knowledge transfer in TD research by distinguishing TD research for policy from conventional evidence-based policy, which relies on generalizing findings, such as randomized controlled trials. We also compare the functions that cases fulfil in other types of research that include basic, applied and ideographic research. We propose to conceptualize transferability of knowledge across cases as arguments by analogy. Methodologically, this would imply explicit consideration on whether the cases in question are sufficiently similar in relevant aspects while not dissimilar in other additional relevant aspects. On the one hand, this approach calls for explicit material considerations that are needed to learn about which aspects of cases are relevant. On the other hand, formal considerations on how to weigh perceived relevant similarities and dissimilarities of the cases at hand for transferability of knowledge, are needed. Empirical research on how projects in TD research deal with this problem is called for.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000240539",,"1862-4065||1862-4057","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/192179||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/213282","10.1007/s11625-017-0444-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/240539","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Case study||Evidence-based policy||Transferability||Transdisciplinary research||Quality||Scalability","Conceptualizing the transfer of knowledge across cases in transdisciplinary research",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2017-10-06T04:41:07Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85020697300",,"000419612300015","Sustain Sci","1","Sustainability Science","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We address this by introducing a prototype of a sustainability learning lab (SLL) in the global South using a case study of the Seychelles as an example. In 2015 the Transdisciplinarity Lab (TdLab) of ETH Zurich initiated a long-term collaboration with the University of Seychelles (UniSey) and the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change (MEECC). Teaching activities include transdisciplinary case studies (tdCS) for students from UniSey and ETH, alternated with courses for UniSey only. BSc and MSc theses as well as internships complement these. In 2016 the TdLab, UniSey and MEECC jointly decided to focus on solid waste in a tdCS that engaged 18 ETH and 18 UniSey students with diverse backgrounds. This collaborative approach in a real-world setting with students from different cultures and engaging with a broad range of stakeholders is promising. Students managed to bring novel observations and insights to the surface. Thus, students both profit from this learning platform and also contribute substantially to the further development of the SLL.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000292870",,"0940-5550",,"10.14512/gaia.27.S1.11","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/292870","en","Oekom Verlag","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","real-world laboratory||Small Island Developing States||sustainability learning lab||teaching formats||transdisciplinarity","Sustainability Learning Labs in Small Island Developing States: A Case Study of the Seychelles",,"Journal Article","Open access","Labs in the Real World",,,,"2018-10-02T11:40:57Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gaia","Supplement 1","GAIA - Ecological Perspectives for Science and Society","27","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While the north is home to a variety of climate models, data infrastructures and climate experts, the south often lacks these attributes. We use a unique global dataset, the UNFCCC National Communications, to perform a global documentary analysis of scientific submissions from individual countries (n=189). Focusing on the production and use of climate projections, our research both supports, and importantly, challenges such a clear-cut north-south divide. For instance, the global north in general uses more complex climate modelling techniques, yet numerous countries in the global south have a higher scientific capacity than some northern ones. Beyond scientific capacities, the south emphasises mid-term timeframes (before 2060) more relevant for their adaptation decisions whereas the north prefers a long-term view and is generally more optimistic of global mitigation efforts. While the use of Global Climate Model (GCM) ensembles is widespread in the global north and south, the south’s access to climate models is restricted to mobile climate projection tools. Although modelling tools such as PRECIS enable countries with little scientific capacity to produce reliable climate risk assessments, these tools may hide a new divide between the global north and global south. Unable to customise inputs, such as country-specific observations or modelling information, the global south might become dependent upon the climate modelling tools circulated by the global north. Our research calls for a more nuanced and critical use of the north-south divide, and highlights that well-intended modelling and training efforts may unwittingly restrict, rather than foster, scientific capacities in the global south.","text/csv||application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000286411",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/286411","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","climate projections||climate scenarios||climate information||adaptation||North-South divide||role and use of climate science","Dataset for ""A new north-south divide for climate knowledge?

We highlight a need for greater recognition, particularly by disaster management and response agencies, of uncertainty as a subjective experience for those living at risk. Embodied uncertainty is distinguished from objective uncertainty by the nature of its internalisation at the individual level, where it is subjective, felt and directly experienced. This approach provides a conceptual pathway that sharpens knowledge of the processes that shape how individuals and communities interpret and contextualise risk. The ways in which individual characteristics, social identities and lived experiences shape interpretations of risk are explored by considering embodied uncertainty in four contexts: social identities and trauma, the co-production of knowledge, institutional structures and policy and long-term lived experiences. We conclude by outlining the opportunities that this approach presents, and provide recommendations for further research on how the concept of embodied uncertainty can aid decision-making and the management of risks in the context of extreme natural hazards.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-a-010677852",,"1366-9877||1466-4461","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/155749||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117903","10.1080/13669877.2016.1200659","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/183216","en","Routledge","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Disaster||Embodied uncertainty||Emergency management||Knowledge co-production||Risk interpretation","Embodied uncertainty: living with complexity and natural hazards",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,,"2017-06-12T08:21:57Z",,,,,,"pub:179833","eth:49347","yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59366b944625439394||imp593654827734b31368",,,"84978087258",,"000427729500002","J.

The risk of induced seismicity includes extreme events as well as uncertainty. Risk appraisal is a method to enhance information for decisions that involve negative impacts. It combines both the technical dimensions of risk as well as the societal response to it, where risk communication plays a central role. By including benefits, the present thesis expands such risk appraisal at first. It then investigates communication of extreme events and uncertainty to facilitate future appraisal.  Discussion emerges about where to ideally site deep geothermal energy projects: rural areas minimize potential damage due to induced seismicity but residual heat cannot be purposefully used in many cases; whereas urban areas with many residential buildings and infrastructure imply high potential damage due to induced seismicity but effective use of residual heat. The first study monetizes 12 deep geothermal energy siting scenarios using cost-benefit analysis from the private and social perspective. The scenarios that are different in siting and capacity are coupled to purposefully modelled induced seismicity risk. Monte Carlo and sensitivity analyses account for uncertainties. The second study appraises societal response to such siting scenarios and explores how well the public accepts four different deep geothermal energy siting scenarios within an online survey (N = 814). The study contrasts acceptance ratings of the four different scenarios (within-subjects design) with ratings between Switzerland and Germany (between-subject design). Results from the technical appraisal suggest to site deep geothermal energy where considerable heat can be sold but damage due to IS remains limited but not necessarily zero thus towns. In contrast, the societal appraisal suggests that the public prefers projects sited in remote areas while ideally, using residual heat. The results in Switzerland and Germany were rather similar, but the Swiss public was generally more positive. Importantly, induced seismic risks affected acceptance ratings most. Thus, policies to reduce the risk of induced seismicity must be given the highest priority to gain public acceptance. In face of extreme events and uncertainty, the third study tests three incrementally different risk communication formats (qualitative, qualitative and quantitative, qualitative and quantitative with risk comparisons) for low-probability high-consequence seismic events. It also tests how the public reacts to disclosing uncertainty and whether reactions are different for identical induced seismicity risks from deep geothermal energy and shale gas. Respondents found formats with quantitative information the most exact and liked them the most. Disclosing uncertainty made the risk communication less clear, less easy to understand and increased concern but did not affect trust in scientists. Above all, the technology for which risks are communicated and its acceptance mattered strongly: respondents in the shale gas condition found the identical risk communication less trustworthy and more concerning than in the DGE conditions. They also liked the risk communication overall less.  The present thesis’ results add to timely discussion about the emerging technology of deep geothermal energy in research and science. Within the thesis’ conclusion, their implications are discussed and suggestions for further scientific investigations are derived.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000273923",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/273923","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Appraisal of deep geothermal energy siting options and related risk communication",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::0 - Computer science, information & general works::0 - Computer science, information & general works||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,,"2018-07-04T20:06:23Z","2021-07-05",,,,,,,"yes",,,,"Risk Governance of Deep Geothermal and Hydro Energy","153931","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 70: Gesuch","25098",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Based on a household survey, conducted ten months after the 2015 South Indian floods in two affected constituencies (Mylapore and Velachery) of Chennai, residents were asked how long they took to recover from the floods and whether they took actively part in the recovery process. The results highlight that residents from the more affected constituency (Velachery) took significantly longer to restore physical aspects (e.g. energy, water, roads, etc.), but only partially longer for social and economic aspects. Aspects of social capital (leadership, communication, ownership and trust) were rated equally low in both communities. However, individual actions to help others or participate in volunteer groups increased more significantly in the constituency that was more affected. The findings from this case study point-out that flood disaster events trigger residents to become more solidary and active to help others, but have little impact on triggering a more active interplay between communities and authorities. This highlights that flood disaster events do not change inherent structural and institutional relationships between key actors (local government, communities, private sector, academia and NGOs) involved in disaster recovery processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000291427",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/211514||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/291308","10.1016/j.proeng.2018.01.083","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/291427","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","disaster recovery process||community-authority interplay||floods||Chennai","Disaster recovery processes: Analysing the interplay between communities and authorities in Chennai, India",,"Conference Paper","Open access","7th International Conference on Building Resilience: Using scientific knowledge to inform policy and practice in disaster risk reduction",,,,"2017-11-21T14:29:13Z",,,,,,,,"yes","7th International Conference on Building Resilience; Using scientific knowledge to inform policy and practice in disaster risk reduction (ICBR 2017)","November 27-29, 2017","Bangkok, Thailand",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Procedia Engineering","212","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

With potentially increasing risks associated with such events due to climate change, properly assessing the associated impacts and uncertainties is critical for adequate adaptation. However, the application of risk-based approaches often requires large sets of extreme events, which are not commonly available. Here, we present such a large set of hydro-meteorological time series for recent past and future conditions for the United Kingdom based on weather@home 2, a modelling framework consisting of a global climate model (GCM) driven by observed or projected sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice which is downscaled to 25 km over the European domain by a regional climate model (RCM). Sets of 100 time series are generated for each of (i) a historical baseline (1900–2006), (ii) five near-future scenarios (2020–2049) and (iii) five far-future scenarios (2070–2099). The five scenarios in each future time slice all follow the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) and sample the range of sea surface temperature and sea ice changes from CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) models. Validation of the historical baseline highlights good performance for temperature and potential evaporation, but substantial seasonal biases in mean precipitation, which are corrected using a linear approach. For extremes in low precipitation over a long accumulation period ( > 3 months) and shorter-duration high precipitation (1–30 days), the time series generally represents past statistics well. Future projections show small precipitation increases in winter but large decreases in summer on average, leading to an overall drying, consistently with the most recent UK Climate Projections (UKCP09) but larger in magnitude than the latter. Both drought and high-precipitation events are projected to increase in frequency and intensity in most regions, highlighting the need for appropriate adaptation measures. Overall, the presented dataset is a useful tool for assessing the risk associated with drought and more generally with hydro-meteorological extremes in the UK.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000239029",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-22-611-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/239029","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"A large set of potential past, present and future hydro-meteorological time series for the UK",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-02-07T03:08:10Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85041190268",,"000423407600001","Hydrol.

In a similar manner to most previous studies, the thesis attempted to answer this question by examining how farmers are currently responding to climate change and the factors influencing the process or its determinants. Earlier studies have produced a long list of farm-level adaptations to climate change and their socio-economic determinants. However, the adjustments identified by the studies along with their determinants are not unique to climate change, and therefore do not indicate the importance of new interventions. For example, the commonly identified adjustments such as soil conservation and irrigation are already at the center of existing policies in agriculture. Like wise the importance of determinants such as access to credit and education which are singled out by the studies as key variables for adaptation are already at the hub of the literature on agricultural development.   Studies in the past have failed in suggesting distinct interventions, which are necessitated by climate change. I attribute this shortcoming to weak methodological approach in disentangling adjustments strongly motivated by climate change and to lack of appropriate typologies with implications on resource needs. Studies in the past often used an enquiry method that directly asks farmers to list their adaptation strategies. Such approach is susceptible to response biases, and does not also put non-climatic drivers in perspective. Farmers normally make adjustments simultaneously addressing multiple drivers. Therefore for an adjustment to be identified as an adaptation strategy, it should be shown that it is strongly liked to climate change than other drivers. This is particularly true for contemporary farmers who are responding for a number of drivers including market and technological dynamics.   Previous studies also treated all farm-level adaptations as one homogenous group of adjustments that are influenced by one set of determinants.  This study, however, argues that adaptations that use traditionally used inputs, here called non-technological adaptation, should be separately examined, as they are likely to have distinctive resource needs. Examples could be changing planting date and crop diversification. While technological adaptations can benefit from the extensive literature on agricultural technology adoption in the last decades, non-technological adaptations can greatly benefit from further study as one distinct group of adjustments. In this Doctoral study, I employed a household survey of farm households in a district in central Ethiopia and attempted to address the existing flaws in the literature on farm-level adaptation in agriculture.   The first paper was aimed at identifying farm adjustments that are primarily motivated by climate change. A new methodological approach that puts non-climatic drivers in perspective while reducing the likelihood of response biases was applied along commonly used methods. It was shown that in the study area three adjustments are strongly associated to climate change: changing planting date, crop switching (changing crop type) and crop diversification. In the second paper, a second-round survey was carried out to closely examine crop switching as an adaptation strategy. I examined the permanent adoption and abandonment of crops by farmers in the last two decades. It was found that crop adoption is primarily induced by price changes while crop abandonment is strongly motivated by climate change. The trend of crop abandonment is also inline with predictions by studies on ecological change in climate change. In the third paper, I showed that non-technological adaptations are likely to be more dependent on accumulated farm experience than level of schooling and availability of finance. The major implication of this study, for our study area, is that non-technological adaptations such as changing planting date and crop switching are adjustments that are primarily induced by climate change.   The broader implication of my findings is that non-technological adaptations should be the primary focus of adaptation policies in agriculture. The findings implied that adaptation in agriculture is essentially the reallocation of resources accessible to a community. For which reason, accumulated experience of farmers on the broader community context like farming conditions could be instrumental. Since climate change just contracts or expands existing agro-ecologies without creating unique conditions, it is unlikely that new technological adoptions are necessitated by climate change. Therefore, mechanisms that facilitate non-technological adaptations such as experience-sharing sessions composed of farmers from diverse agro-ecologies and farming conditions can be vital for adaptation in agriculture. Our study also highlighted that mainstreaming climate change in farm adjustments primarily induced by non-climatic drivers can be crucial.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000273328",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/273328","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","climate change||adaptation||agriculture||Adjustment||Ethiopia||determinants||crop switching||non-technological adaptations","Drivers of Climate Sensitive Farm Level Adjustments: Climate Change, Economic and Technical Factors, and Resource Availability",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,,"2018-07-02T09:55:12Z",,,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"25173",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
