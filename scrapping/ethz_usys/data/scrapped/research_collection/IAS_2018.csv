The environmental performance of FS can be evaluated using Life Cycle Assessment. However, research on the impact that FS activities, e.g. crop production have on the capacity of farm-based agroecosystems to provide goods and services to humans is still incipient. Our underlying aim was to understand how FS impact on the provision of agroecosystem services and how this relates to the environmental performance of FS, as a basis for supporting decision-making on how to make FS more sustainable. We propose the Agroecosystem Service Capacity (ASC) as a method for assessing farmbased agroecosystem services, it builds on the Ecosystem Service Matrix by Burkhard et al. (2009) and assesses land cover classes against 20 agroecosystem services. The method was applied to eighteen farmbased agroecosystems in Bolivia and Kenya. Here we present two examples for exploring its potentials and limitations. The ASC operates on the basis of land cover class units and permits the calculation of an aggregate ASC-index for farm-based agroecosystems forming part of a specific FS.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507627",,"1865-1542",,"10.3097/lo.201864","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507627","en","Landscape Online","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Agroecosystem Service Capacity Index – A methodological approach",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-09-29T11:30:35Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"LO",,"Landscape Online","64","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While the response of soil respiration to abiotic drivers like soil temperature and moisture is fairly well understood, less is known about the effects of biotic drivers, such as plant above- and belowground productivity or plant diversity, and their interactions with abiotic drivers on soil respiration. Thus, current predictions of soil respiration to summer droughts might miss relevant biological drivers and their interactions with abiotic drivers. Since drought events are expected to increase in Central Europe in the future, we simulated early summer drought using rainout shelters at 19 grassland sites, which differed in plant productivity and species richness in central Germany in 2002 and 2003. We tested the potentially interacting effects of drought with biotic drivers, i.e. annual above-ground productivity, species richness and root biomass, on the drought response of soil respiration in temperate grasslands. In both years, drought led to a significant reduction in soil respiration. The drought-induced reduction in soil respiration was largely driven by the reduction in above-ground productivity in response to drought. The extent of the drought response of soil respiration was dependent on the species richness level of the site and this interacting effect was explainable by the variation in root biomass (root biomass and species richness were positively correlated). Our findings highlight the importance of biotic drivers for the quantification of the drought response of soil respiration in grasslands.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000314988",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0209031","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/314988","en","PLoS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Effects of plant productivity and species richness on the drought response of soil respiration in temperate grasslands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-01-10T15:47:20Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85058918435",,,"000454149400023","PLoS ONE","12","PLoS ONE","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Today, the bottleneck does not lie in the ability to fly a drone anymore, but rather in the appropriate flight planning to capture images with sufficient quality. Proper flight preparation for photography with digital frame cameras should include relevant concepts such as view, sharpness and exposure calculations. Additionally, if mapping areas with UASs, one has to consider concepts related to ground control points (GCPs), viewing geometry and way-point flights. Unfortunately, non of the available flight planning tools covers all these aspects.  Results We give an overview of concepts related to flight preparation, present the newly developed open source software PhenoFly Planning Tool, and evaluate other recent flight planning tools. We find that current flight planning and mapping tools strongly focus on vendor-specific solutions and mostly ignore basic photographic properties—our comparison shows, for example, that only two out of thirteen evaluated tools consider motion blur restrictions, and none of them depth of field limits. In contrast, PhenoFly Planning Tool enhances recent sophisticated UAS and autopilot systems with an optical remote sensing workflow that respects photographic concepts. The tool can assist in selecting the right equipment for your needs, experimenting with different flight settings to test the performance of the resulting imagery, preparing the field and GCP setup, and generating a flight path that can be exported as waypoints to be uploaded to an UAS.  Conclusion By considering the introduced concepts, uncertainty in UAS-based remote sensing and high-throughput phenotyping may be considerably reduced. The presented software PhenoFly Planning Tool (https://shiny.usys.ethz.ch/PhenoFlyPlanningTool) helps users to comprehend and apply these concepts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000313403",,"1746-4811",,"10.1186/s13007-018-0376-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/313403","en","Biomed Central","CC0 1.0 Universal","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","High-throughput phenotyping||Flight planning||Low-altitude remote sensing||Mapping from imagery||Viewing geometry||Ground control point (GCP)","PhenoFly Planning Tool: Flight planning for high-resolution optical remote sensing with unmanned areal systems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-12-31T03:26:24Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85059036559",,,"000454257100002","Plant methods","1","Plant Methods","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The ecosystem component of Integrated Carbon Observation System consists of a multitude of stations where the net greenhouse gas exchange is monitored continuously by eddy covariance measurements while, in addition many other measurements are carried out that are a key to an understanding of the greenhouse gas balance. Amongst them are the continuous meteorological measurements and a set of non-continuous measurements related to vegetation.The latter include Green Area Index, aboveground biomass andlitter biomass. The standardized methodology that is used at the Integrated Carbon Observation System ecosystem stations to monitor these vegetation related variables differs between the ecosystem types that are represented within the network, whereby in this paper we focus on forests, grasslands, croplands and mires. For each of the variables and ecosystems a spatial and temporal sampling design was developed so that the variables can be monitored in a consistent way within the ICOS network. The standardisation of the methodology to collect Green Area Index, above ground biomass and litter biomass and the methods to evaluate the quality of the collected data ensures that all stations within the ICOS ecosystem network produce data sets with small and similar errors, which allows for inter-comparison comparisons across the Integrated Carbon Observation System ecosystem network.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000312013",,"0236-8722||2300-8725",,"10.1515/intag-2017-0048","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/312013","en","De Gruyter Open","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/","ICOS||Protocol||Green Area Index||Aboveground biomass||Litter biomass","Ancillary vegetation measurements at ICOS ecosystem stations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-12-19T11:46:42Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85059565013",,,"000453410400012","Int.

The EC method is central to the ecosystem component of the Integrated Carbon Observation System, a monitoring network for greenhouse gases across the European Continent. The data processing sequence applied to the collected raw data is complex, and multiple robust options for the different steps are often available. For Integrated Carbon Observation System and similar networks, the standardisation of methods is essential to avoid methodological biases and improve comparability of the results. We introduce here the steps of the processing chain applied to the eddy covariance data of Integrated Carbon Observation System stations for the estimation of final CO2, water and energy fluxes, including the calculation of their uncertainties. The selected methods are discussed against valid alternative options in terms of suitability and respective drawbacks and advantages. The main challenge is to warrant standardised processing for all stations in spite of the large differences in e.g. ecosystem traits and site conditions. The main achievement of the Integrated Carbon Observation System eddy covariance data processing is making CO2 and energy flux results as comparable and reliable as possible, given the current micrometeorological understanding and the generally accepted state-of-the-art processing methods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000313355",,"0236-8722||2300-8725",,"10.1515/intag-2017-0043","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/313355","en","de Gruyter","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/","ICOS||method standardisation||biosphere-atmosphere exchange||turbulent fluxes||protocol","Eddy covariance raw data processing for CO2 and energy fluxes calculation at ICOS ecosystem stations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-12-29T03:40:26Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"ICOS-CH: Integrated Carbon Observation System in Switzerland||ICOS-CH Phase 2","148992||173691","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,,,,"85059551336",,,"000453410400004","Int.

In the long term, the net carbon flux between forests and the atmosphere has been significantly impacted by changes in forest cover area and structure due to ecological disturbances and management activities. Current empirical approaches for estimating net ecosystem productivity (NEP) rarely consider forest age as a predictor, which represents variation in physiological processes that can respond differently to environmental drivers, and regrowth following disturbance. Here, we conduct an observational synthesis to empirically determine to what extent climate, soil properties, nitrogen deposition, forest age and management influence the spatial and interannual variability of forest NEP across 126 forest eddy-covariance flux sites worldwide. The empirical models explained up to 62% and 71% of spatio-temporal and across-site variability of annual NEP, respectively. An investigation of model structures revealed that forest age was a dominant factor of NEP spatio-temporal variability in both space and time at the global scale as compared to abiotic factors, such as nutrient availability, soil characteristics and climate. These findings emphasize the importance of forest age in quantifying spatio-temporal variation in NEP using empirical approaches.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000311571",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aaeaeb","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/311571","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","carbon cycle||eddy covariance||net ecosystem production||empirical modelling||forest age||climate||soil properties","Quantifying the effect of forest age in annual net forest carbon balance",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-12-18T10:33:19Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060122829",,,"000452527200001","Environ.

However, no genetic marker gives sufficient performance across all the biological kingdoms, hampering studies of taxonomic diversity in many groups of organisms. This has led to the adoption of a range of genetic markers for DNA metabarcoding. While many taxonomic classification software tools can be re-trained on these genetic markers, they are often designed with assumptions that impair their utility on genes other than the SSU and LSU rRNA. Here, we present an update to Metaxa2 that enables the use of any genetic marker for taxonomic classification of metagenome and amplicon sequence data.  Results We evaluated the Metaxa2 Database Builder on 11 commonly used barcoding regions and found that while there are wide differences in performance between different genetic markers, our software performs satisfactorily provided that the input taxonomy and sequence data are of high quality.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000307969",,"1367-4803||1460-2059",,"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty482","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/307969","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Metaxa2 Database Builder: enabling taxonomic identification from metagenomic or metabarcoding data using any genetic marker",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-12-02T05:33:13Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85057144938",,,"000453453300009","Bioinformatics","23","Bioinformatics","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The capacity of farm systems to recover, reorganize, and evolve following external shocks and stresses is analysed within the framework of resilience theory. The SHARP (self-evaluation and holistic assessment of climate resilience of farmers and pastoralists) tool was developed to assess the resilience of farm systems to climate change in a participatory way. The SHARP was originally designed for developing countries. This paper outlines the process and changes made to adapt the tool for use in the Swiss farming context, including the challenges and trade-offs of the adaptation. Its first application in the Canton of Vaud provides insights on the levels of resilience to climate change for farmers in Switzerland. The results showed that of twenty-five farmers, “environment” and “market” are two groups of farm-system components where the farm systems are least resilient.

Conversion to organic management and linking farmers to fair trade markets could offer an alternative. Engaging in certified cash-crop value chains could thereby provide an entry path to simultaneously reduce poverty and improve environmental sustainability. Based on comprehensive data from a representative sample of approximately 80 organic and 80 conventional farms in northern India, we compared yield and profitability of the main rotation crops over a period of five years. Contrary to the widespread belief that yields in organic farming are inevitably lower, our study shows that organic farmers achieved the same yields in cereals and pulses as conventional farmers, with considerably lower external inputs. Due to 45% lower production costs and higher sales prices, organic basmati cultivation was 105% more profitable than cultivating ordinary rice under conventional management. However, since holdings are small and the share of agricultural income of total household income is declining, conversion to organic basmati farming alone will not provide households a sufficiently attractive perspective into the future. We propose that future efforts to enhance the long-term viability of rice-based organic farming systems in this region focus on diversification involving higher value crops","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000307993",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su10124424","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/307993","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","farming systems||sustainable development||rural livelihoods||traditional varieties||system of rice intensification||contract farming","Does organic farming provide a viable alternative for smallholder rice farmers in India?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-12-03T06:16:31Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85057282999",,,"000455338100090",,"12","Sustainability","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of the various steps of the measurements and discusses aspects such as instrument selection, setup and maintenance, data processing as well as the additional measurements needed to aid interpretation and gap-filling. It presents the methodological protocol for eddy covariance measurements of CH4 and N2O fluxes as agreed for the ecosystem station network of the pan-European Research Infrastructure Integrated Carbon Observation System and provides a first international standard that is suggested to be adopted more widely. Fluxes can be episodic and the processes controlling the fluxes are complex, preventing simple mechanistic gap-filling strategies. Fluxes are often near or below the detection limit, requiring additional care during data processing. The protocol sets out the best practice for these conditions to avoid biasing the results and long-term budgets. It summarises the current approach to gap-filling.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000313354",,"0236-8722||2300-8725",,"10.1515/intag-2017-0042","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/313354","en","De Gruyter Open","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","ICOS||protocol||micrometeorology||greenhouse gas exchange||standardisation","Standardisation of eddy-covariance flux measurements of methane and nitrous oxide",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-12-29T03:40:26Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Readiness of ICOS for Necessities of integrated Global Observations","730944","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,"85059583051",,,"000453410400005","Int.

Identifying key changes in the timing of leaf elongation and senescence during the year can help to understand the sensitivity of different plant functional types to changes in temperature. When recorded over many years these data can provide information on the response of ecosystems to long-term changes in climate. The installation of digital cameras that take images at regular intervals of plant canopies across the Integrated Carbon Observation System ecosystem stations will provide a re- liable and important record of variations in canopy state, colour and the timing of key phenological events. Here, we detail the procedure for the implementation of cameras on Integrated Carbon Observation System flux towers and how these images will help us understand the impact of leaf phenology and ecosystem function, distinguish changes in canopy structure from leaf physiology and at larger scales will assist in the validation of (future) remote sensing products. These data will help us improve the representation of phenological responses to climatic variability across Integrated Carbon Observation System stations and the terrestrial biosphere through the improvement of model algorithms and the provision of validation datasets.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000312102",,"0236-8722||2300-8725",,"10.1515/intag-2017-0050","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/312102","en","De Gruyter Open","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/","ICOS||near-surface remote sensing||proximal sensing||digital repeat photography||phenology||protocol","Assimilating phenology datasets automatically across ICOS ecosystem stations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-12-19T14:32:45Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85059558493",,,"000453410400014","Int.

But how can this understanding of resilience be applied to food systems? We operationalized the concept by subdividing it into different resilience dimensions, namely: buffer capacity, self-organization, and capacity for learning and adaptation. Specific indicators were defined for each dimension: (1) agrobiodiversity and livelihood assets for buffer capacity; (2) decentralization and independence, local consumption of production, interest groups, ecological self-regulation, and connectivity for self-organization; and (3) knowledge of threats and opportunities, reflective and shared learning, feedback mechanisms, existence and use of local-traditional knowledge, and a shared food system vision for capacity for learning and adaptation. Next, we applied the resilience indicators to different food systems (agroindustrial, local, and agroecological) in Kenya and Bolivia, including assessment of the interaction and coexistence of food systems. While the contexts in the two countries differ greatly, we identified several common trends that appear to be undermining food system resilience in both settings. These trends include low ecological buffer capacity and self-regulation in agroindustrial food systems; strong disparities in income and access to productive resources; competition for water, land, and labor; exclusion from markets; and low human capital and feedback mechanisms in locally based, traditional food systems. Taken together, these trends cast doubt on food system coexistence narratives. Finally, the results enable us to identify leverage points in the food systems – e.g., regarding learning and feedback mechanisms – that could be used to foster food system transformations linked to goals of sustainability and justice.",,,,"0264-8377||1873-5754",,"10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.08.044","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516293","en","Elsevier Science",,,"Food systems||Resilience||Buffer capacity||Self-organization||Capacity for learning and adaptation||Social-ecological systems","Operationalizing food system resilience: An indicator-based assessment in agroindustrial, smallholder farming, and agroecological contexts in Bolivia and Kenya",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-11-22T10:36:07Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Land Use Policy",,"Land Use Policy","79","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Seasonal vegetation trends are commonly estimated from high temporal resolution but coarse spatial resolution satellite imagery, e.g., from MODIS-NDVI (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer—Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time-series, which has usually limited their application to scenarios with few land uses or crops covering areas larger than actual parcel sizes. As an alternative, this paper proposes a general and robust procedure to map crop phenology at the level of individual crop parcels, and validates its feasibility in a complex and diverse cropland area located in central California. A first calibration phase consisted of evaluating the three curve-fitting models implemented in the TIMESAT software (i.e., asymmetric Gaussian (AG), double logistic (DL), and adaptive Savitzky–Golay (SG) filtering) and reporting the model and its settings that best adjusted to the MODIS-NDVI profile of each crop studied. Next, based on the selected crop-specific models and with a crop map previously obtained from ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) multi-temporal images, the procedure mapped four crop calendar events (i.e., start, end, middle, and length of the season) and five phenology-related metrics (i.e., base, maximum, amplitude, derivatives, and integrals of the NDVI values) of the study region by object-based image analysis (OBIA) of the MODIS-NDVI time-series. To mitigate the impact of mixed pixels, the OBIA procedure was designed to automatically apply a restrictive criterion based on the coverage of MODIS-NDVI pixels in each crop parcel: (1) using only the MODIS-NDVI pixels that were placed 100% within each crop parcel (i.e., “pure” pixels); or (2) if no “pure” pixels exist in any crop parcel, using only pixels with coverage percentages greater than 50%, and in such cases, reporting the mixing percentage in the output file. The calibration phase showed that the performance of the SG filtering was superior in most crops, with the exception of rice, while the AG model was intermediate in all of the cases. Differences between the dates of the start and end of the season that were observed in 120 ground-truth fields and the ones estimated by the crop-specific models were in a range of 11 days (for the corn fields) and 22 days (for the vineyard fields) on average. The OBIA procedure was also validated in 240 independent parcels with “pure” MODIS-NDVI pixels, reporting 89% and 82% of accuracy when mapping the start and end of the season, respectively. Our results revealed different growth patterns of the studied crops, especially of the crop calendar events of herbaceous (i.e., corn, rice, sunflower, and tomato) and woody crops (i.e., almond, walnut, and vineyard), of the NDVI derivatives of rice and the other studied herbaceous crops, and of the NDVI integrals of vineyard and the other studied woody crops. The resulting maps and tables provide valuable geospatial information for every parcel over time with several applications in cropland management, irrigation scheduling, and ecosystem modeling.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000307958",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs10111745","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/307958","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","crop phenology||cropland data layer||curve-fitting models||TIMESAT||seasonality imagery","Mapping crop calendar events and phenology-related metrics at the parcel level by object-based image analysis (OBIA) of MODIS-NDVI time-series: A case study in central California",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-12-02T05:31:49Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85057103756",,,"000451733800076","Remote Sens.","11","Remote Sensing","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A systematic analysis of power imbalances in food systems is required if we are to meet the 2030 Agenda vision of promoting sustainable production and consumption patterns and ending hunger and poverty. Such an analysis, with a view to a transformation to more sustainable and just food systems, requires tools to be developed and tested in real-life case studies of food systems. To better understand the structures and mechanisms around power in food systems, this study applies a political ecology lens. We adapted the “power cube” analysis framework that was proposed by the Institute of Development Studies for the analysis of spaces, forms, and levels of power. We apply the analysis of these three dimensions of power to two food systems in the tropical lowlands of Bolivia: one agroindustrial and one indigenous. After identifying food system actors, the food system spaces in which they interact, and what forms of power they use at what levels, we discuss some implications for an emerging scientific culture of power analyses in critical sustainability assessments.

Conventional methods used for canopy sampling are typically time consuming and costly, while the very canopy tops are still out of reach unless a canopy crane is used. Thus, we developed a novel twig sampling method using a device attached to a drone that allows to grasp and cut small twigs and bring them to the ground for immediate analysis. This “Flying Tree Top Sampler” (FTTS) complements existing methods used in tree canopy research. This paper describes the method to make it openly available to interested users, provides the necessary technical details, and reports on a proof-of-concept application by probing a single tree during senescence. In this demonstration example we show that the ability to investigate the top part of the tree leads to the clear finding that chlorophyll content of the top leaves is significantly lower than that of leaves in the lower canopy. Without the samples collected by the FTTS, the decrease of chlorophyll content with height would not have been of statistical significance using a p = 0.05 significance threshold. Besides its advantages, the existing limitations of the FTTS are discussed, and suggestions for future developments are provided.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000299733",,"2624-893X",,"10.3389/ffgc.2018.00002","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/299733","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Tree canopy sampling||Leaf sample collection||Ground truthing||Leaf physiological measurements||Leaf chlorophyll||Tree senescence||Unmanned aerial vehicle","Novel twig sampling method by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-10-30T13:16:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"ICOS-CH: Integrated Carbon Observation System in Switzerland||ICOS-CH Phase 2","148992||173691","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,,,,,,,,,,"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","1","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Among these risks are making healthy diets exclusive, or ignoring externalities like biodiversity loss, land concentration, and encroachment on commons. Case studies from Bolivia and Kenya show how marked shifts from traditional to more uniform diets rich in sugar, salt, and fatty acids come with a radical transformation of food systems. Systems formerly based on local knowledge, local inputs, and local labor relations become dependent on external inputs, heavy mechanization, and productive specialization. Making diets more sustainable requires policies that protect existing and strengthen new forms of family and community farming. We discuss critical links between sustainable diets and sustainable food systems with reference to five principles of food sustainability: food security, the right to food, reduction of poverty and inequality, environmental performance, and resilience. Our analysis provides a basis for more comprehensive research and policies that minimize trade-offs and maximize synergies between sustainable diets and food systems.",,,,"2197-411X",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507659","de","University of Kassel",,,"Sustainable diets||Food sustainability||Transdisciplinary research project||Globaliziation of diets","Linking sustainable diets to the concept of food system sustainability",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-09-29T15:55:06Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"nbn:de:hebis:34-2018062655731",,,"1","Future of Food","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To investigate the temporal pattern of behavioural changes in relation to concomitant metabolic alterations, we subjected 15 multiparous early lactating Holstein dairy cows (24 (SD 7.4) days in milk) to a short‐term metabolic challenge, which we provoked by abruptly withdrawing concentrate for 1 week. Cows grazed full‐time and were supplemented with concentrate in experimental week (EW) 1 and EW 3, whereas concentrate was withdrawn in EW 2. We analysed milk and blood samples to characterise the metabolic changes and found that the total yield of milk and protein decreased (p < 0.05) and fat yield, fat‐to‐protein ratio and acetone content increased (p < 0.05) from EW 1 to EW 2. Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were lower (p < 0.05), and concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids and beta‐hydroxybutyrate were higher (p < 0.05) in EW 2 compared with EW 1. Apart from ingestive and rumination behaviour and activity, we also monitored the use of an automated brush on pasture. While time spent eating and ruminating increased (p < 0.05) in EW 2 compared with EW 1, time spent idling decreased (p < 0.05). Concomitantly, while time standing and moving increased (p < 0.05) from EW 1 to EW 2, walking time decreased (p < 0.05). The daily proportion of cows using the automated brush decreased (p < 0.05) in EW 2 compared with EW 1, as did the duration of brushing per day. In conclusion, grazing cows experiencing a metabolic challenge try to compensate for the nutrient deficiency by increasing eating time, a behavioural element important for short‐term survival. Due to the strong impact of weather conditions, we cannot currently recommend observation of outdoor brushing activity to address short‐term alterations in the metabolic state of grazing cows.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000285376",,"0931-2439||1439-0396",,"10.1111/jpn.12931","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/285376","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","automated brush||Dairy cow||Grazing||Ingestive behaviour||Metabolic load||Well-being","Physiological and behavioural responses of grazing dairy cows to an acute metabolic challenge",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-08-29T10:52:11Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85052830870",,,"000444076500002","J.

However, several studies indicate a strong variability of the genetic contribution across locations that further varies with experimental design and variety selection. It is therefore still unclear to which extent management conditions have promoted the realization of the breeding progress in Germany over the last 100+ years. We established a side-by-side cultivation experiment over two seasons (2014/2015 and 2015/2016) including 16 winter wheat varieties released in Germany between 1895 and 2007. The varieties were grown using 24 different long-term fertilization treatments established since 1904 (Dikopshof, Germany). Averaged over all cultivars and treatments mean yields of 6.88 t ha−1 and 5.15 t ha−1 were estimated in 2015 and 2016, respectively. A linear mixed effects analysis was performed to study the treatment-specific relation between grain yields and year of variety release. Results indicate a linear increase in grain yields ranging from 0.025 to 0.032 t ha−1 yr−1 (0.304 to 0.387% yr−1) in plots that were treated with combined synthetic-organic fertilizers without signs of a leveling-off. Yields from low or unfertilized plots do not show a significant progress in yield. Responsiveness of mean yields to fertilizer management increases with year of release and indicates small yield penalties under very low nutrient supply. Results highlight the need to consider the importance of  long-term soil fertilization management for the realization of genetic gains and the value of long-term fertilization experiments to study interactions between genetic potential and management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302313",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aade12","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302313","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","winter wheat||nutrient supply||grain yield||breeding||fertilization||genetic gain","Genetic yield gains of winter wheat in Germany over more than 100 years (1895-2007) under contrasting fertilizer applications",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-11-09T05:13:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85055841514",,,"000445933400001","Environ.

However, traditional, morphology-based methods to assess biodiversity are labor intensive and not suitable for large-scale assessments.  How are my results improving/affecting future agriculture? Our central vision is to develop a tool that enables regular and less expensive genetic diversity assessments over large grassland extensions. We also anticipate that our tool will be useful for forage breeders that want to quantify genetic diversity in germplasm, and overall in contexts where plant genetic diversity assessments are needed.  Genomic tools based on high-throughput DNA sequencing have the potential to resolve this limitation. Our goal is to develop a high-throughput amplicon-based method, which allows us to measure both species-richness and genetic diversity in mixed samples. As a first step, genomic loci that are semi-conserved in forage grasses and legumes were identified. Then, we designed RNA baits to target 611 loci and used them to capture those loci from Illumina libraries of genomic DNA from multiple genotypes of 16 forage grasses and legumes. We shortlisted 50 loci after quality control and several filtering steps of the ~14.5 million raw reads (2 x 300 bp) that we obtained with Illumina MiSeq.   A preliminary sequence distance analysis showed that the 50 candidate loci were able to assign correctly all the analyzed legume species and most grasses to their respective species. Furthermore, these loci showed the highest within-species sequence diversity among all the rest, as measured by the kmer-richness of the reads that mapped within each locus. Currently, primers are being designed to target the candidate loci in mixed samples. After validation, the five best performing loci will be selected for larger scale tests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000309649",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/309649","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Genomic tools to assess plant genetic diversity in grasslands",,"Conference Poster","Open access",,,,,"2018-12-10T10:52:22Z",,,,,"yes","Agroscope PhD Students' Symposium (2018)","September 13, 2018","Reckenholz, Switzerland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Cassava is one such crop. Grown for its large starch-rich storage roots, it serves as a staple food and a commodity in the multibillion-dollar starch industry. Starch is composed of the glucose polymers amylopectin and amylose, with the latter strongly influencing the physicochemical properties of starch during cooking and processing. We demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9)–mediated targeted mutagenesis of two genes involved in amylose biosynthesis, PROTEIN TARGETING TO STARCH (PTST1) or GRANULE BOUND STARCH SYNTHASE (GBSS), can reduce or eliminate amylose content in root starch. Integration of the Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T gene in the genome-editing cassette allowed us to accelerate flowering—an event seldom seen under glasshouse conditions. Germinated seeds yielded S1, a transgene-free progeny that inherited edited genes. This attractive new plant breeding technique for modified cassava could be extended to other crops to provide a suite of novel varieties with useful traits for food and industrial applications.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000289809",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.aat6086","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/289809","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Accelerated ex situ breeding of GBSS- and PTST1-edited cassava for modified starch",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-09-15T07:08:39Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85052993984",,,"000449224000031","Sci Adv","9","Science Advances","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Precise, high-resolution monitoring is a key prerequisite for targeted intervention and the selective application of agro-chemicals. The main goal of this paper is developing a novel crop/weed segmentation and mapping framework that processes multispectral images obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a deep neural network (DNN). Most studies on crop/weed semantic segmentation only consider single images for processing and classification. Images taken by UAVs often cover only a few hundred square meters with either color only or color and near-infrared (NIR) channels. Although a map can be generated by processing single segmented images incrementally, this requires additional complex information fusion techniques which struggle to handle high fidelity maps due to their computational costs and problems in ensuring global consistency. Moreover, computing a single large and accurate vegetation map (e.g., crop/weed) using a DNN is non-trivial due to difficulties arising from: (1) limited ground sample distances (GSDs) in high-altitude datasets, (2) sacrificed resolution resulting from downsampling high-fidelity images, and (3) multispectral image alignment. To address these issues, we adopt a stand sliding window approach that operates on only small portions of multispectral orthomosaic maps (tiles), which are channel-wise aligned and calibrated radiometrically across the entire map. We define the tile size to be the same as that of the DNN input to avoid resolution loss. Compared to our baseline model (i.e., SegNet with 3 channel RGB (red, green, and blue) inputs) yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of [background=0.607, crop=0.681, weed=0.576], our proposed model with 9 input channels achieves [0.839, 0.863, 0.782]. Additionally, we provide an extensive analysis of 20 trained models, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in order to evaluate the effects of varying input channels and tunable network hyperparameters. Furthermore, we release a large sugar beet/weed aerial dataset with expertly guided annotations for further research in the fields of remote sensing, precision agriculture, and agricultural robotics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000295660",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs10091423","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/295660","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","precision farming||weed management||multispectral imaging||semantic segmentation||deep neural network||unmanned aerial vehicle||remote sensing","WeedMap: A large-scale semantic weed mapping framework using aerial multispectral imaging and deep neural network for precision farming",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-10-13T08:41:11Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85053609099",,,"000449993800103","Remote Sens.","9","Remote Sensing","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Hoy en día, en su mayoría se planta en monocultivos y muchas veces en laderas inestables. El monocultivo de coca degrada los suelos, causa deslizamientos de terrenos, pérdida de biodiversidad y se desarrolla con el uso de agroquímicos potencialmente dañinos para la salud humana, los suelos y los cuerpos de agua. Sin embargo, en los Yungas persiste también un conocimiento ancestral sobre formas más sustentables de producción de coca con cultivos diversificados con árboles, arbustos y hierbas de diferentes usos. En este estudio se identificaron iniciativas y experiencias de recuperación de conocimientos ancestrales del cultivo sostenible de la coca, que integran técnicas de la agroforestería dinámica. La creciente demanda para coca orgánica puede ser una oportunidad para incentivar cultivos más sustentables y adaptados al cambio climático, que al mismo tiempo contribuyan a la seguridad alimentaria de las familias. Actualmente, el cultivo de coca con certificación orgánica en agroforestería dinámica ya representa una vía para más de 300 familias cocaleras en las Yungas de La Paz, y en miras de la degradación de suelos y la alta demanda de nuevas tierras para cultivar coca que está amenazando las áreas protegidas, es un potencial económico y ecológico para las más de 13 500 familias cocaleras de los Yungas paceños. Sin embargo, el cultivo de la coca en agroforestales dinámicos necesita apoyo técnico e institucional en el manejo de los sistemas agroforestales, en la investigación y en la comercialización tanto de la coca agroecológica como otros productos agroforestales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507658",,"1683-0768",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507658","es","Universidad Católica Boliviana","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","Erythroxylum coca||agricultura orgánica||agroforestería dinámica||Yungas de La Paz||Bolivia||organic agriculture||dynamic agroforestry","El cultivo de la hoja de coca en sistemas agroforestales dinámicos en los Yungas de La Paz",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-09-29T15:44:49Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"RevActaNova","4","Acta Nova","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Those changes that can be perceived by conspecifics have the potential to also affect other's emotional states, a process labeled as “emotional contagion.” Especially in the case of gregarious species, such as livestock, emotional contagion can have an impact on the whole group by, for instance, improving group coordination and strengthening social bonds. We noticed that the current trend of research on emotions in livestock, i.e., investigating affective states as a tool to assess and improve animal welfare, appears to be unbalanced. A majority of studies focuses on the individual rather than the social component of emotions. In this paper, we highlight current limitations in the latter line of research and suggest a stronger emphasis on the mechanisms of how emotions in livestock are transmitted and shared, which could serve as a promising tool to synergistically enhance the welfare of all individuals within a group.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000289138",,"2297-1769",,"10.3389/fvets.2018.00218","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/289138","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","affective states||emotions||emotional contagion||farm animals||wellbeing","Looking on the Bright Side of Livestock Emotions—the Potential of Their Transmission to Promote Positive Welfare",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-09-12T19:46:33Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85053731479",,,"000452134600001","Front.

Hyperspectral remote sensing has shown potential for the detection of plant diseases, but its utility for phenotyping large and diverse populations of plants under field conditions requires further evaluation. In this study, we collected canopy hyperspectral data from 335 wheat varieties using a spectroradiometer, and we investigated the use of canopy reflectance for detecting the Septoria tritici blotch (STB) disease and for quantifying the severity of infection. Canopy- and leaf-level infection metrics of STB based on traditional visual assessments and automated analyses of leaf images were used as ground truth data. Results showed (i) that canopy reflectance and the selected spectral indices show promise for quantifying STB infections, and (ii) that the normalized difference water index (NDWI) showed the best performance in detecting STB compared to other spectral indices. Moreover, partial least squares (PLS) regression models allowed for an improvement in the prediction of STB metrics. The PLS discriminant analysis (PLSDA) model calibrated based on the spectral data of four reference varieties was able to discriminate between the diseased and healthy canopies among the 335 varieties with an accuracy of 93% (Kappa = 0.60). Finally, the PLSDA model predictions allowed for the identification of wheat genotypes that are potentially more susceptible to STB, which was confirmed by the STB visual assessment. This study demonstrates the great potential of using canopy hyperspectral remote sensing to improve foliar disease assessment and to facilitate plant breeding for disease resistance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000289616",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2018.01195","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/289616","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Field-based phenotyping||Hyperspectral remote sensing||Partial least squares discriminant analysis||Plant phenotyping||Plant spectroscopy||Resistance breeding||Septoria tritici blotch||Wheat disease","Hyperspectral Canopy Sensing of Wheat Septoria Tritici Blotch Disease",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-09-14T05:35:04Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85054505567",,,"000441883600001","Front.

Here, we combine sequential extraction with P K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and isotopic methods (33P and 18O in phosphate) to characterize P cycling on a climatic gradient in Hawaii. We link P pools to P species and estimate the turnover times for commonly considered P pools. Dissolved P turned over in seconds, resin-extractable P in minutes, NaOH-extractable inorganic P in weeks to months, and HCl-extractable P in years to millennia. Furthermore, we show that in arid-zone soils, some primary mineral P remains even after 150 ky of soil development, whereas in humid-zone soils of the same age, all P in all pools has been biologically cycled. The integrative information we provide makes possible a more dynamic, process-oriented conceptual model of P cycling in soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000283995",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-018-05731-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/283995","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Combining spectroscopic and isotopic techniques gives a dynamic view of phosphorus cycling in soil",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-08-23T08:04:37Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Forms and dynamics of soil phosphorus along a climosequence on basalt-derived soils (CLIMP)","162422","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,,"85051663673",,,"000441382000004","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, little work has examined how different trichome types influence herbivory by herbivores at different stages of development. We examined whether caterpillar instar and trichome type (glandular or non-glandular) affected the ability of the specialist herbivore caterpillar Manduca sexta to initiate feeding on 11 Solanaceous species exhibiting variation in the density and type of leaf trichomes. Our results suggest that non-glandular trichomes are far more effective than glandular trichomes in deterring the initiation of feeding by first- and second-instar caterpillars. Meanwhile, neither glandular nor non-glandular trichomes significantly affected the ability of third-instar caterpillars to commence feeding. These findings suggest that while non-glandular trichomes deter feeding initiation by early instar caterpillars, the contribution of both trichomes on later instars may depend on effects after feeding initiation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000289903",,"1942-0889",,"10.1080/19420889.2018.1486653","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/289903","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Glandular trichomes||larval instar||Manduca sexta||non-glandular trichomes||Solanaceae","Leaf trichomes affect caterpillar feeding in an instar-specific manner",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-09-17T08:22:14Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85051834314",,,,"Commun Integr Biol","3","Communicative & Integrative Biology","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Based on CH4 reference measurements obtained with the SF6 tracer technique to determine ruminal CH4 production, a current equation permits evaluation of individual daily CH4 emissions of dairy cows based on milk Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) spectra. However, the respiration chamber (RC) technique is considered to be more accurate than SF6 to measure CH4 production from cattle. This study aimed to develop an equation that allows estimating CH4 emissions of lactating cows recorded in an RC from corresponding milk FT-MIR spectra and to challenge its robustness and relevance through validation processes and its application on a milk spectral database. This would permit confirming the conclusions drawn with the existing equation based on SF6 reference measurements regarding the potential to estimate daily CH4 emissions of dairy cows from milk FT-MIR spectra. A total of 584 RC reference CH4 measurements (mean ± standard deviation of 400 ± 72 g of CH4/d) and corresponding standardized milk mid-infrared spectra were obtained from 148 individual lactating cows between 7 and 321 d in milk in 5 European countries (Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, France, and Northern Ireland). The developed equation based on RC measurements showed calibration and cross-validation coefficients of determination of 0.65 and 0.57, respectively, which is lower than those obtained earlier by the equation based on 532 SF6 measurements (0.74 and 0.70, respectively). This means that the RC-based model is unable to explain the variability observed in the corresponding reference data as well as the SF6-based model. The standard errors of calibration and cross-validation were lower for the RC model (43 and 47 g/d vs. 66 and 70 g/d for the SF6 version, respectively), indicating that the model based on RC data was closer to actual values. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of calibration of 42 g/d represents only 10% of the overall daily CH4 production, which is 23 g/d lower than the RMSE for the SF6-based equation. During the external validation step an RMSE of 62 g/d was observed. When the RC equation was applied to a standardized spectral database of milk recordings collected in the Walloon region of Belgium between January 2012 and December 2017 (1,515,137 spectra from 132,658 lactating cows in 1,176 different herds), an average ± standard deviation of 446 ± 51 g of CH4/d was estimated, which is consistent with the range of the values measured using both RC and SF6 techniques. This study confirmed that milk FT-MIR spectra could be used as a potential proxy to estimate daily CH4 emissions from dairy cows provided that the variability to predict is covered by the model.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000277048",,"0022-0302||1525-3198",,"10.3168/jds.2018-14472","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/277048","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/","cattle||greenhouse gas||spectroscopy||proxy","Short communication: Development of an equation for estimating methane emissions of dairy cows from milk Fourier transform mid-infrared spectra by using reference data obtained exclusively from respiration chambers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-07-20T07:06:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85046647547",,,"000439134700083","J.

Measurement of enteric CH4 is complex, expensive, and impractical at large scales; therefore, models are commonly used to predict CH4 production. However, building robust prediction models requires extensive data from animals under different management systems worldwide. The objectives of this study were to (1) collate a global database of enteric CH4 production from individual lactating dairy cattle; (2) determine the availability of key variables for predicting enteric CH4 production (g/day per cow), yield [g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)], and intensity (g/kg energy corrected milk) and their respective relationships; (3) develop intercontinental and regional models and cross‐validate their performance; and (4) assess the trade‐off between availability of on‐farm inputs and CH4 prediction accuracy. The intercontinental database covered Europe (EU), the United States (US), and Australia (AU). A sequential approach was taken by incrementally adding key variables to develop models with increasing complexity. Methane emissions were predicted by fitting linear mixed models. Within model categories, an intercontinental model with the most available independent variables performed best with root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) as a percentage of mean observed value of 16.6%, 14.7%, and 19.8% for intercontinental, EU, and United States regions, respectively. Less complex models requiring only DMI had predictive ability comparable to complex models. Enteric CH4 production, yield, and intensity prediction models developed on an intercontinental basis had similar performance across regions, however, intercepts and slopes were different with implications for prediction. Revised CH4 emission conversion factors for specific regions are required to improve CH4 production estimates in national inventories. In conclusion, information on DMI is required for good prediction, and other factors such as dietary neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration, improve the prediction. For enteric CH4 yield and intensity prediction, information on milk yield and composition is required for better estimation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000275147",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.14094","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/275147","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","dairy cows||Dry matter intake||enteric methane emissions||methane intensity||methane yield||prediction models","Prediction of enteric methane production, yield, and intensity in dairy cattle using an intercontinental database",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-07-11T11:29:45Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85043383290",,,"000437284700011","Glob.

This development has led to a revolution in geospatial data collection in which not only few specialist data providers collect and deliver remotely sensed data, but a whole diverse community is potentially able to gather geospatial data that fit their needs. However, the diversification of sensing systems and user applications challenges the common application of good practice procedures that ensure the quality of the data. This challenge can only be met by establishing and communicating common procedures that have had demonstrated success in scientific experiments and operational demonstrations. In this review, we evaluate the state-of-the-art methods in UAV spectral remote sensing and discuss sensor technology, measurement procedures, geometric processing, and radiometric calibration based on the literature and more than a decade of experimentation. We follow the ‘journey’ of the reflected energy from the particle in the environment to its representation as a pixel in a 2D or 2.5D map, or 3D spectral point cloud. Additionally, we reflect on the current revolution in remote sensing, and identify trends, potential opportunities, and limitations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000277023",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs10071091","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/277023","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Imaging spectroscopy||spectral||Unmanned aerial vehicles||unmanned aerial systems (UAS)||Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS)||Drone||calibration||Hyperspectral||Multispectral||low-altitude||remote sensing||sensors||2D imager||pushbroom||snapshot||spectroradiometers","Quantitative Remote Sensing at Ultra-High Resolution with UAV Spectroscopy: A Review of Sensor Technology, Measurement Procedures, and Data Correction Workflows",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-07-19T17:39:10Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85050500948",,,"000440332500114","Remote Sens.","7","Remote Sensing","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Since this increase changes diffusion gradients between chamber air and soil air, a nonlinear increase is expected. Lateral gas flow and leakages also contribute to non linearity. Several models have been suggested to account for this non linearity, the most recent being the Hutchinson–Mosier regression model (hmr). However, the practical application of these models is challenging because the researcher needs to decide for each flux whether a nonlinear fit is appropriate or exaggerates flux estimates due to measurement artifacts. In the latter case, a flux estimate from the linear model is a more robust solution and introduces less arbitrary uncertainty to the data. We present the new, dynamic and reproducible flux calculation scheme, kappa.max, for an improved trade-off between bias and uncertainty (i.e. accuracy and precision). We develop a tool to simulate, visualise and optimise the flux calculation scheme for any specific static N2O chamber measurement system. The decision procedure and visualisation tools are implemented in a package for the R software. Finally, we demonstrate with this approach the performance of the applied flux calculation scheme for a measured flux dataset to estimate the actual bias and uncertainty. The kappa.max method effectively improved the decision between linear and nonlinear flux estimates reducing the bias at a minimal cost of uncertainty.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000280268",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0200876","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/280268","en","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Restricting the nonlinearity parameter in soil greenhouse gas flux calculation for more reliable flux estimates",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-08-03T09:05:28Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85050635440",,,"000439952400025","PLoS ONE","7","PLoS ONE","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Sources of uncertainty in enteric CH4 emissions include animal inventories, feed dry matter intake (DMI), ingredient and chemical composition of the diets, and CH4 emission factors. There is also significant uncertainty associated with enteric CH4 measurements. The most widely used techniques are respiration chambers, the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer technique, and the automated head-chamber system (GreenFeed; C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD). All 3 methods have been successfully used in a large number of experiments with dairy or beef cattle in various environmental conditions, although studies that compare techniques have reported inconsistent results. Although different types of models have been developed to predict enteric CH4 emissions, relatively simple empirical (statistical) models have been commonly used for inventory purposes because of their broad applicability and ease of use compared with more detailed empirical and process-based mechanistic models. However, extant empirical models used to predict enteric CH4 emissions suffer from narrow spatial focus, limited observations, and limitations of the statistical technique used. Therefore, prediction models must be developed from robust data sets that can only be generated through collaboration of scientists across the world. To achieve high prediction accuracy, these data sets should encompass a wide range of diets and production systems within regions and globally. Overall, enteric CH4 prediction models are based on various animal or feed characteristic inputs but are dominated by DMI in one form or another. As a result, accurate prediction of DMI is essential for accurate prediction of livestock CH4 emissions. Analysis of a large data set of individual dairy cattle data showed that simplified enteric CH4 prediction models based on DMI alone or DMI and limited feed- or animal-related inputs can predict average CH4 emission with a similar accuracy to more complex empirical models. These simplified models can be reliably used for emission inventory purposes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000272817",,"0022-0302||1525-3198","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/275066||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/272817","10.3168/jds.2017-13536","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/275211","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/","enteric methane||uncertainty||prediction model||livestock","Symposium review: Uncertainties in enteric methane inventories, measurement techniques, and prediction models",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,,"2018-06-28T05:37:02Z",,,,,"yes","2017 ADSA Annual Meeting","June 25-28, 2018","Pittsburgh, PA, USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85045579060",,,"000436481500089","J.

Walp.) is an important African food legume suitable for dry regions. It is the main legume in two contrasting agro-ecological regions of Kenya as an important component of crop rotations because of its relative tolerance to unpredictable drought events. This study was carried out in an effort to establish a collection of bacterial root nodule symbionts and determine their relationship to physicochemical soil parameters as well as any geographical distributional patterns. Bradyrhizobium spp. were found to be widespread in this study and several different types could be identified at each site. Unique but rare symbionts were recovered from the nodules of plants sampled in a drier in-land region, where there were also overall more different bradyrhizobia found. Plants raised in soil from uncultivated sites with a natural vegetation cover tended to also associate with more different bradyrizobia. The occurrence and abundance of different bradyrhizobia correlated with differences in soil texture and pH, but did neither with the agro-ecological origin, nor the origin from cultivated (n = 15) or uncultivated (n = 5) sites. The analytical method, protein profiling of isolated strains by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), provided higher resolution than 16S rRNA gene sequencing and was applied in this study for the first time to isolates recovered directly from field-collected cowpea root nodules. The method thus seems suitable for screening isolate collections on the presence of different groups, which, provided an appropriate reference database, can also be assigned to known species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000267644",,"0167-8809||1873-2305",,"10.1016/j.agee.2017.12.014","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/267644","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bradyrhizobium distribution||Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L Walp)||MALDI-TOF MS||Agro-ecology","Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.

Endometrial secretions driven by ovarian progesterone and conceptus signals are essential for conceptus growth and development. Results of transcriptome analyses of whole endometrial tissue samples in the pig indicated the need for cell type-specific endometrial gene expression analysis for a better understanding of transcriptome changes associated with establishment of pregnancy. Results: The most distinct transcriptome profile and the majority of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in luminal epithelium (LE). Many DEGs were found only in the cell type-specific analysis. The functional classification of DEGs identified in specific endometrial cell types revealed various distinct functions and pathways. Genes related to immune activation, estrogen signaling pathway, embryo development, and cell proliferation were upregulated in LE of pregnant gilts. Genes involved in sterol biosynthetic and metabolic processes and extracellular matrix were upregulated in stroma. Genes associated with cell communication such as via exosomes and vesicles were found as differential in LE, glandular epithelium (GE), and stroma (S). Conclusions: This study revealed that conceptus signals induce different transcriptomic regulations in the endometrial compartments/cell types related to their specific function during recognition and establishment of pregnancy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000271850",,"1471-2164","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/278103||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/271850","10.1186/s12864-018-4855-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/278250","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Pig||Pregnancy||Estrous cycle||Uterus||Endometrium||Transcriptomics||RNA-Seq","Cell type-specific analysis of transcriptome changes in the porcine endometrium on Day 12 of pregnancy",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-06-23T06:07:12Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85048547816",,,"000435377300003","BMC Genomics",,"BMC Genomics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Such androgenic production of doubled haploids is particularly useful for species where inbreeding is hampered by effective self-incompatibility systems. Therefore, increasing the generally low androgenic capacity of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) germplasm would enable the efficient production of homozygous plant material, so that a more effective exploitation of heterosis through hybrid breeding schemes can be realized. Here, we present the results of a genome-wide association study in a heterozygous, multiparental population of perennial ryegrass (n = 391) segregating for androgenic capacity. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to interrogate gene- dense genomic regions and revealed over 1,100 polymorphic sites. Between one and 10 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for anther response, embryo and total plant production, green and albino plant production and regeneration. Most traits were under polygenic control, although a major QTL on linkage group 5 was associated with green plant regeneration. Distinct genetic factors seem to affect green and albino plant recovery. Two intriguing candidate genes, encoding chromatin binding domains of the developmental phase transition regulator, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, were identified. Our results shed the first light on the molecular mechanisms behind perennial ryegrass microspore embryogenesis and enable marker-assisted introgression of androgenic capacity into recalcitrant germplasm of this forage crop of global significance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000265925",,"2160-1836","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/353903||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/265925","10.1534/g3.117.300550","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/354800","en","Genetics Society of America","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Anther culture (AC)||Doubled haploid (DH)||Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)||Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)||Microspore embryogenesis (ME)||Multipareental populations","Genetic Loci Governing Androgenic Capacity in Perennial Ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-05-24T14:42:23Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS OF GRASS REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS","138983||138983","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,,"29626084","85047859969",,,"000433900500005","G3 (Bethesda Md.)","6","G3","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As animals are not able to verbally report how they feel, we need to find reliable indicators to assess their emotional state. Emotions can be described using two key dimensions: valence (negative or positive) and arousal (bodily activation or excitation). In this study, we investigated vocal expression of emotional valence in wild boars (Sus scrofa). The animals were observed in three naturally occurring situations: anticipation of a food reward (positive), affiliative interactions (positive), and agonistic interactions (negative). Body movement was used as an indicator of emotional arousal to control for the effect of this dimension. We found that screams and squeals were mostly produced during negative situations, and grunts during positive situations. Additionally, the energy quartiles, duration, formants, and harmonicity indicated valence across call types and situations. The mean of the first and second formants also indicated valence, but varied according to the call type. Our results suggest that wild boars can vocally express their emotional states. Some of these indicators could allow us to identify the emotional valence that wild boars are experiencing during vocal production and thus inform us about their welfare.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000267584",,"2076-2615",,"10.3390/ani8060085","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/267584","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Acoustic analysis||Emotions||Vocalizations||Welfare indicators||Evolution","Encoding of Emotional Valence in Wild Boar (Sus scrofa) Calls",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-06-05T13:45:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85048258526",,,"000436270600007",,"6","Animals","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Key indicator of cleaning quality is residual soiling mass, i.e. the manure remaining on the floor after dung removal. The aim of this study was to show the effects of scraping tool, rubber mat type, solid floor type, dung removal frequency and season on residual soiling mass. The comparison two scraping tools and two rubber mat types in winter showed that the rubber mat type (p = 0.001) and the scraping tool (p = 0.001) influenced the residual soiling mass. The cleaning quality was better on the common than on the soft rubber mat and the hard rubber lip left less residual soiling mass versus the metal blade (means: 174 vs. 230 g m−2 on common; 230 vs. 243 g m−2 on soft rubber mat). Further two floor types (with and without 3% slope) and two dung removal frequencies (three and 12 times per day) were investigated in three seasons. The statistical analysis proved the season as significant (p < 0.001). Residual soiling mass in winter was smaller than in warmer seasons regardless of floor type and dung removal frequency. Within the summer dataset the floor type was significant (p = 0.037): the floor without slope showed less residual soiling mass in average 218 resp. 234 g m−2 with three resp. 12 dung removal events per day than the sloped floor with 280 resp. 303 g m−2.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000264999",,"1537-5129||1537-5110",,"10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2018.04.006","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/264999","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cleaning quality||Sloped floor||Water vacuum cleaner||Rubber mat||Quantification method","Residual soiling mass after dung removal in dairy loose housings: Effect of scraping tool, floor type, dung removal frequency and season",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-05-18T06:40:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85046134201",,,"000433653700012",,,"Biosystems Engineering","170","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Research on humans and in animal models has shown that infection by malaria parasites elicits changes in host odors that influence vector attraction, suggesting that such changes might yield robust biomarkers of infection status. Here we present findings based on extensive collections of skin volatiles from human populations with high rates of malaria infection in Kenya. We report broad and consistent effects of malaria infection on human volatile profiles, as well as significant divergence in the effects of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Furthermore, predictive models based on machine learning algorithms reliably determined infection status based on volatile biomarkers. Critically, our models identified asymptomatic infections with 100% sensitivity, even in the case of low-level infections not detectable by microscopy, far exceeding the performance of currently available rapid diagnostic tests in this regard. We also identified a set of individual compounds that emerged as consistently important predictors of infection status. These findings suggest that volatile biomarkers may have significant potential for the development of a robust, noninvasive screening method for detecting malaria infections under field conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000268864",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.1801512115","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268864","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","malaria||disease biomarkers||diagnostics||volatiles||asymptomatic infection","Volatile biomarkers of symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria infection in humans",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-06-09T05:02:13Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85047919026",,,"000433283700068","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","22","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","115","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In a first trial (infection model), 32 Swiss Large White piglets (age: 24 days; average BW: 7.8 ± 0.8 kg) were randomly assigned to two experimental groups (infected [INF], noninfected [NINF]). In a subsequent trial, 72 Swiss Large White piglets (age: 26 days; average BW: 7.4 ± 1.5 kg) were blocked by BW and assigned within block to four experimental groups: NINF-CO: not infected and fed a standard control starter diet (CO); INF-CO: infected and fed the CO diet; NINF-TA: not infected and fed the CO diet supplemented with 1% chestnut extract containing 54% of hydrolysable tannins (TA); and INF-TA: infected and fed the TA diet. Both diets (TA and CO) were formulated to be isocaloric and isoproteic and to meet or surpass the nutritional requirements. In both trials, four days after weaning, piglets assigned to the INF group received an oral suspension of ETEC F4.

Furthermore, soil carbon (C) stocks play an important role in soil fertility. It is thus of great interest to know whether intensively managed croplands act as a net source or sink of atmospheric CO2 and if soil C stocks are preserved over long timescales. The FluxNet site CH-Oe2 in Oensingen, Switzerland, has been operational since the end of 2003. This cropland is managed under the Swiss framework of the Proof of Ecological Performance (PEP, a variant of integrated management) with a crop rotation centred on winter wheat, which also includes winter barley, winter rapeseed, peas, potato and intermediate cover crops. In addition to eddy covariance measurements, meteorological and soil measurements were available along with information on C imports and exports from organic fertilisation, sowing and harvesting. This study investigates cropland C budgets over 13 years and assesses whether the PEP regulations resulted in a balanced C budget. The strongest CO2 uptake was observed during cereal seasons. C export through harvest, however, offset the strong uptake of the cereal crops. The largest net CO2 emissions to the atmosphere were observed during pea and cover crop seasons. Net biome production, representing the overall C budget (assuming carbon leaching to groundwater to be negligible), typically ranged between close to C neutral to C losses of up to 407gCm−2 per season, with peas being the largest source. Overall, the field lost 1674gCm−2 over 13 years (129gCm-2yr−1), which was confirmed by soil C stock measurements at the beginning and the end of the study period. Although managing the field under the regulations of PEP did not result in an overall C sink, model simulations showed that the use of cover crops reduced the C losses compared to leaving the field bare. The use of solid manure improved the C budget by importing substantial amounts of C into the soil, while liquid manure had only a small effect. We thus conclude that additional efforts are needed to bring Swiss management practices closer to the goal of preserving soil C in the long term.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000311661",,"1810-6277||1810-6285",,"10.5194/bg-2018-205","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/311661","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Integrated management of Swiss cropland is not sufficient to preserve its soil carbon pool in the long-term",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,,"2018-12-18T12:44:52Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The role of diffuse radiation for a long-term arable crop rotation at Oensingen, Switzerland (Acronym: DiRad Oensingen)","146373||146373||146373","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,,,,,,,"Biogeosci. discuss.",,"Biogeosciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we evaluated the light-induced fluorescence transient (LIFT) method for its capacity to yield rapidly fluorometric parameters from 0.6 m distance. The close approximation of LIFT to conventional chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) parameters is shown under controlled conditions in spinach leaves and isolated thylakoids when electron transport was impaired by anoxic conditions or chemical inhibitors. The ChlF rise from minimum fluorescence (Fo) to maximum fluorescence induced by fast repetition rate (Fm−FRR) flashes was dominated by reduction of the primary electron acceptor in photosystem II (QA). The subsequent reoxidation of QA− was quantified using the relaxation of ChlF in 0.65 ms (Fr1) and 120 ms (Fr2) phases. Reoxidation efficiency of QA− (Fr1/Fv, where Fv = Fm−FRR − Fo) decreased when electron transport was impaired, while quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) showed often no significant effect. ChlF relaxations of the LIFT were similar to an independent other method. Under increasing light intensities, Fr2′/Fq′ (where Fr2′ and Fq′ represent Fr2 and Fv in the light-adapted state, respectively) was hardly affected, whereas the operating efficiency of photosystem II (Fq′/Fm′) decreased due to non-photochemical quenching. Fm−FRR was significantly lower than the ChlF maximum induced by multiple turnover (Fm−MT) flashes. However, the resulting Fv/Fm and Fq′/Fm′ from both flashes were highly correlated. The LIFT method complements Fv/Fm with information about efficiency of electron transport. Measurements in situ and from a distance facilitate application in high-throughput and automated phenotyping.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000303639",,"0166-8595||1573-5079",,"10.1007/s11120-018-0594-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/303639","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Fluorescence transient||Photosynthesis||Fast repetition rate||Electron transport kinetics","Maximum fluorescence and electron transport kinetics determined by light-induced fluorescence transients (LIFT) for photosynthesis phenotyping",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-11-14T11:42:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85055717823",,,"000466916000008","Photosynth. res.","2","Photosynthesis Research","140","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This increase in crop production is necessary to feed a growing population and to mitigate the conversion of wild lands to crop lands.  However, in parallel with increased N application and crop yields, N pollution has also increased rapidly. The ease of access and price of N fertilizers in many parts of the world, as well as the expense or time involved in the implementation of improved practices, results in over application of N in relation to plant demand.  Excess N is highly susceptible to loss and contributes to a host of environmental problems such as eutrophication of water bodies, contamination of drinking water, loss of biodiversity and global warming.  N pollution largely contributes to global warming through the production of nitrous oxide (N2O), since approximately   60% of global N2O emissions come from agriculture.  N2O is a powerful greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential 280 times that of CO2. N2O emissions are difficult to manage because they represent a small fraction of applied N, are produced by multiple pathways and are highly heterogeneous in space and time. The case of irrigated rice production exemplifies well the challenges and trade-offs of managing for N2O emissions.  For example, the efforts made with alternate water management strategies, aimed at mitigating methane emissions (10% of global emissions) and reducing water consumption (40% of global irrigation water consumption), can also lead to higher N2O emissions, thereby negating any net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This thesis has three foci: a) to evaluate agricultural management strategies to mitigate N2O emissions across different scales; b) to improve our mechanistic understanding of the processes underlying N2O emissions or more general N cycling under alternative water management in irrigated rice production and c) to advance natural abundance N2O isotopocule methodologies used to identify the processes involved in N2O production, N2O consumption and their relative contribution to total N2O emissions.   In the first study (Chapter 2), I performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of biochar to mitigate N2O emissions at the field scale in different cropping systems. Biochar is a carbon (C) rich, charcoal-like product formed during the pyrolysis of organic matter.  In this meta-analysis, I found that biochar did decrease N2O emissions by 9.2 to 12.4% across cropping systems.  However, the magnitude and significance of this reduction was affected by the weighting function (either by variance or by number of observations).  Indeed, currently available field data is biased by a disproportionate number of studies in flooded rice systems (41% of observations), a low number of studies with a comparatively high number of treatments, and an uneven representation of biochars and N fertilizers used.   My second, third and fourth studies (Chapters 3-5) were conducted over the course of two growing seasons in the Northern Italian rice-growing region.  These studies set out to improve our understanding of how N cycling, N2O production and consumption processes change along a soil profile in relation to flooding and drainage events and ultimately how surface emissions are affected.  To this end, I utilized an experimental platform with three water management treatments: water-seeded + conventional flooding (WS-FLD), water-seeded + alternate wetting and drying (WS-AWD), and direct dry seeding (DS-AWD).  Soil environmental parameters as well as N and carbon (C) substrates were measured in parallel with N2O concentrations and isotopocule signatures of emitted N2O and pore air N2O.  N2O emissions in both years were higher in the AWD treatments.  These emissions were more affected by the mineralization of native soil N or availability or pre-season fertilizer N in the top soil rather than by fertilizer applied within the growing season.  N2O production was most likely limited by nitrification and the production of NO3- or NO2-, but was ultimately derived from coupled nitrification-denitrification, from denitrification or from nitrifier-denitrification.  Results of a dual isotope mapping and mixing model approach with site preference (SP) and δ18O-N2O ratios showed extensive N2O reduction in all treatments regardless of more aerobic conditions in the DS-AWD treatment.  The isotope modeling approach allowed me to estimate N2O reduction to N2, a notoriously unconstrained aspect of the N cycle.  Mean N2 emissions ranged from 245-333 g N ha-1d-1 (~ 29-40 kg N ha-1 per 120d season), thus representing a considerable loss relative to applied N.  My final study (Chapter 5), evaluated the role of interactions between iron (Fe) and N reduction-oxidation reactions on NH4+ availability.  NH4+ fixation was highest in the WS-FLD but more dynamic in the WS-AWD treatment, demonstrating an influential role of water management.  Fe reduction and the likelihood of Fe-N redox reactions clearly increased in the WS treatments but I could not directly relate these processes to NH4+ concentrations. In summary, this thesis demonstrates the ability to detect significant impacts of management practices such as biochar additions or AWD irrigation on N2O emissions.  I also showed that there is a real potential to use the SP-N2O and δ18O-N2O to source-partition N2O production and estimate N2 emissions, thereby better constraining N2O emissions and N2 losses. In irrigated rice systems, nitrification in the top soil appears to be a bottleneck for N2O production and N2 losses. Therefore, management to reduce nitrification such as delaying pre-plant fertilizer application or the use of slow release fertilizers may help to reduce N losses.  Future work should investigate if processes such as NH4+ fixation can be beneficially manipulated to further regulate NH4+ availability in relation to plant demand, thereby mitigating N2O emissions and improving the nitrogen use efficiency of cropping systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000263994",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/263994","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","nitrogen cycle||nitrous oxide||Paddy soil||greenhouse gas emissions||Soil profiles||iron redox reactions","Agricultural Management Effects on Nitrogen Cycling and Nitrous Oxide Emissions Across the Soil Profile",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,,"2018-05-14T07:47:44Z","2020-05-14",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"24886",,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A field site infested with beet cyst nematode (BCN) and planted with four nematode susceptible cultivars and five tolerant cultivars was investigated at different times during the growing season. We compared the ability of spectral, hyperspectral, canopy height- and temperature information derived from handheld and UAV-borne sensors to discriminate susceptible and tolerant cultivars and to predict the final sugar beet yield. Spectral indices (SIs) related to chlorophyll, nitrogen or water allowed differentiating nematode susceptible and tolerant cultivars (cultivar type) from the same genetic background (breeder). Discrimination between the cultivar types was easier at advanced stages when the nematode pressure was stronger and the plants and canopies further developed. The canopy height (CH) allowed differentiating cultivar type as well but was much more efficient from the UAV compared to manual field assessment. Canopy temperatures also allowed ranking cultivars according to their nematode tolerance level. Combinations of SIs in multivariate analysis and decision trees improved differentiation of cultivar type and classification of genetic background. Thereby, SIs and canopy temperature proved to be suitable proxies for sugar yield prediction. The spectral information derived from handheld and the UAV-borne sensor did not match perfectly, but both analysis procedures allowed for discrimination between susceptible and tolerant cultivars. This was possible due to successful detection of traits related to BCN tolerance like chlorophyll, nitrogen and water content, which were reduced in cultivars with a low tolerance to BCN. The high correlation between SIs and final sugar beet yield makes the UAV hyperspectral imaging approach very suitable to improve farming practice via maps of yield potential or diseases. Moreover, the study shows the high potential of multi- sensor and parameter combinations for plant phenotyping purposes, in particular for data from UAV-borne sensors that allow for standardized and automated high-throughput data extraction procedures.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000268547",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs10050787","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268547","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","hyperspectral images||spectrometry||canopy height||thermography||UAV||Heterodera schachtii||root||field","Aerial and ground based sensing of tolerance to beet cyst nematode in sugar beet",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-06-08T07:09:18Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85047556650",,,"000435198400129","Remote Sens.","5","Remote Sensing","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Like many other forage legumes, it lacks the energy content to maximize productivity of modern ruminant livestock breeds. White clover produces water-soluble carbohydrates and starch in its leaves as a diurnal product of photosynthesis. However, little is known about the genetically encoded variability of diel changes in carbohydrate content. We assessed the amount of glucose, fructose, sucrose, and starch in the leaves of 185 plants of a genetically diverse white clover population. Water-soluble carbohydrates only provided on average 10.6% of dry weight (DW) of the total analyzed non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) content at the end of the day (ED), while starch supplied 89.4% of the NSC content. The top 5% of individuals accumulated over 25% of their DW as starch at ED. The leaf starch content at ED showed up to a threefold difference between genotypes, with a repeatability value of 0.95. Our experiments illustrate both the physical potential of white clover to serve as a competitive energy source to meet the demand of modern ruminant livestock production and the genetic potential to improve this trait by breeding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000259472",,"2073-4395",,"10.3390/agronomy8040047","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/259472","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Legumes||White clover (Trifolium repens L.)||Non-structural carbohydrates||Water-soluble carbohydrate||Starch||Photosynthesis||Pasture energy content||Breeding","Genetic Diversity of Diurnal Carbohydrate Accumulation in White Clover (Trifolium repens L.)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-04-20T11:07:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000430889500015",,"4","Agronomy","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02030 - Dep.

Despite the recognised importance of biotic factors in determining the invasiveness of microbial communities, the success and impact of multiple concurrent invaders on the resident community has not been examined. Simultaneous invasions might have synergistic effects, for example if resident species need to exhibit divergent phenotypes to compete with the invasive populations. We used three phylogenetically diverse bacterial species to invade two compositionally distinct communities in a controlled, naturalised in vitro system. By initiating the invader introductions at different stages of succession, we could disentangle the relative importance of resident community structure, invader diversity and time pre-invasion. Our results indicate that multiple invaders increase overall invasion success, but do not alter the successional trajectory of the whole community.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000250486",,"1461-023X||1461-0248",,"10.1111/ele.12916","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/250486","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bacteria||community assembly||community stability||invasion||next generation sequencing||species sorting||timing","Elevated success of multispecies bacterial invasions impacts community composition during ecological succession",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-03-16T04:11:39Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85042117942",,,"000427007400005","Ecol. lett.","4","Ecology Letters","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These changes might influence microbial P concentrations (Pmic) in soil representing an important component of the P cycle. Our objectives were to elucidate whether abiotic and biotic variables controlling Pmic concentrations in soil are the same for forests and grasslands, and to assess the effect of region and management on Pmic concentrations in forest and grassland soils as mediated by the controlling variables. In three regions of Germany, Schwäbische Alb, Hanich-Dün, and Schorfheide-Chorin, we studied forest and grassland plots (each n = 150) differing in plant diversity and land-use intensity. In contrast to controls of microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), Pmic was strongly influenced by soil pH, which in turn affected phosphorus (P) availability and thus microbial P uptake in forest and grassland soils. Furthermore, Pmic concentrations in forest and grassland soils increased with increasing plant diversity. Using structural equation models, we could show that soil Corg is the profound driver of plant diversity effects on Pmic in grasslands. For both forest and grassland, we found regional differences in Pmic attributable to differing environmental conditions (pH, soil moisture). Forest management and tree species showed no effect on Pmic due to a lack of effects on controlling variables (e.g., Corg). We also did not find management effects in grassland soils which might be caused by either compensation of differently directed effects across sites or by legacy effects of former fertilization constraining the relevance of actual practices. We conclude that variables controlling Pmic or Cmic in soil differ in part and that regional differences in controlling variables are more important for Pmic in soil than those induced by management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507655",,"1436-8730||0044-3263||1522-2624",,"10.1002/jpln.201700082","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507655","en","Wiley-VCH","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Age class forest||Land-use intensity||Meadow||Microbes||Pasture||Unmanaged forest","The role of soil chemical properties, land use and plant diversity for microbial phosphorus in forest and grassland soils",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-09-29T14:53:27Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85036583934",,,"000430180500005","J.

Here, we use a comprehensive dataset of floral traits and a novel dynamic data-pooling methodology to explore the impacts of floral sensory diversity on the structure of a pollination network in a Mediterranean scrubland. Our approach tracks transitions in the network behaviour of each plant species throughout its flowering period and, despite dynamism in visitor composition, reveals significant links to floral scent, and/or colour as perceived by pollinators. Having accounted for floral phenology, abundance and phylogeny, the persistent association between floral sensory traits and visitor guilds supports a deeper role for sensory bias and diffuse coevolution in structuring plant–pollinator networks. This knowledge of floral sensory diversity, by identifying the most influential phenotypes, could help prioritize efforts for plant–pollinator community restoration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000253158",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-018-03448-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/253158","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Community ecology||Ecological networks||Plant ecology","Disentangling the role of floral sensory stimuli in pollination networks",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-03-27T01:38:13Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85044185373",,,"000427122100005","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, despite our increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms, the magnitudes of the impacts of different types of extremes on GPP and Reco within and between ecosystems remain poorly predicted.  Here we aim to identify the major factors controlling the amplitude of extreme-event impacts on GPP, Reco, and the resulting net ecosystem production (NEP). We focus on the impacts of heat and drought and their combination. We identified hydrometeorological extreme events in consistently downscaled water availability and temperature measurements over a 30-year time period. We then used FLUXNET eddy covariance flux measurements to estimate the CO2 flux anomalies during these extreme events across dominant vegetation types and climate zones.  Overall, our results indicate that short-term heat extremes increased respiration more strongly than they downregulated GPP, resulting in a moderate reduction in the ecosystem's carbon sink potential. In the absence of heat stress, droughts tended to have smaller and similarly dampening effects on both GPP and Reco and, hence, often resulted in neutral NEP responses. The combination of drought and heat typically led to a strong decrease in GPP, whereas heat and drought impacts on respiration partially offset each other. Taken together, compound heat and drought events led to the strongest C sink reduction compared to any single-factor extreme. A key insight of this paper, however, is that duration matters most: for heat stress during droughts, the magnitude of impacts systematically increased with duration, whereas under heat stress without drought, the response of Reco over time turned from an initial increase to a downregulation after about 2 weeks. This confirms earlier theories that not only the magnitude but also the duration of an extreme event determines its impact.  Our study corroborates the results of several local site-level case studies but as a novelty generalizes these findings on the global scale. Specifically, we find that the different response functions of the two antipodal land–atmosphere fluxes GPP and Reco can also result in increasing NEP during certain extreme conditions. Apparently counterintuitive findings of this kind bear great potential for scrutinizing the mechanisms implemented in state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere models and provide a benchmark for future model development and testing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000224136",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-15-1293-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/253686","en","Copernicus Publ.","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Impacts of droughts and extreme temperature events on gross primary production and ecosystem respiration: a systematic assessment across ecosystems and climate zones",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2017-12-21T18:07:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85042916984",,,"000426750400002",,"5","Biogeosciences","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study assessed the status of P on organic farms in Europe using soil test results for extractable P. Data was obtained from published literature, unpublished theses, and various national and regional databases of soil test values. Most of the data (15,506 observations) came from field scale soil tests, but in some cases (1272 observations) values had been averaged across a farm. Farm scale and field scale data were analysed separately and the impact of farm type (arable, dairy, grassland, horticulture, mixed, poultry, unknown) was assessed. Soil test results were assigned to P classes from very low (P class 1) to very high (P class 5). The farm scale data came primarily from Norway, Sweden and Switzerland and did not indicate deficiencies in extractable P; 93% of farms fell into class 3 or above. The majority of the field scale data came from Germany and indicated sufficient or higher levels of P availability for arable and grassland systems on 60% of fields; the remaining fields had low or very low available P. Adaptations in organic systems may improve P uptake and utilization efficiency allowing yields to be maintained in the short-term, nevertheless there is cause for concern about the long-term P sustainability of some organic farming systems in Europe. This highlights the need to reassess allowable P inputs in organic farming systems to improve overall sustainability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000222908",,"1385-1314||1573-0867",,"10.1007/s10705-017-9894-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/222908","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Soil test P||Organic agriculture||Ecological agriculture||Agroecology||Phosphorous||Agricultural sustainability","Phosphorus availability on many organically managed farms in Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2017-12-19T14:55:31Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85037715305",,,"000424460800002","Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst","2","Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems","110","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is a key species in mesic forests that is commonly expected to suffer in a future climate with more intense and frequent droughts. Here, we assessed the seasonal response of leaf physiological characteristics of beech saplings to drought and drought release to investigate their potential to recover from the imposed stress and overcome previous limitations. Saplings were transplanted to model ecosystems and exposed to a simulated summer drought. Pre-dawn water potentials (ψpd), stomatal conductance (gS), intercellular CO2 concentration (ci), net-photosynthesis (AN), PSII chlorophyll fluorescence (PItot), non-structural carbohydrate concentrations (NSC; soluble sugars, starch) and carbon isotope signatures were measured in leaves throughout the growing season. Pre-dawn water potentials (ψpd), gS, ci, AN, and PItot decreased as drought progressed, and the concentration of soluble sugars increased at the expense of starch. Carbon isotopes in soluble sugars (δ13CS) showed a distinct increase under drought, suggesting, together with decreased ci, stomatal limitation of AN. Drought effects on ψpd, ci, and NSC disappeared shortly after re-watering, while full recovery of gS, AN, and PItot was delayed by 1 week. The fast recovery of NSC was reflected by a rapid decay of the drought signal in δ13C values, indicating a rapid turnover of assimilates and a reactivation of carbon metabolism. After recovery, the previously drought-exposed saplings showed a stimulation of AN and a trend toward elevated starch concentrations, which counteracted the previous drought limitations. Overall, our results suggest that the internal water relations of beech saplings and the physiological activity of leaves are restored rapidly after drought release. In the case of AN, stimulation after drought may partially compensate for limitations on photosynthetic activity during drought. Our observations suggest high resilience of beech to drought, contradicting the general belief that beech is particularly sensitive to environmental stressors.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000292966",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2018.00187","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/292966","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","δ13C||non-structural carbohydrates||photosynthesis||recovery||water shortage","Resilient Leaf Physiological Response of European Beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) to Summer Drought and Drought Release",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-10-03T06:47:32Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85043401283",,,"000425387500001","Front.

In a confined region in eastern Switzerland attitude, knowledge and behaviour towards S. aureus und S. aureus control was assessed in 90 dairy farmers with communal alpine pasturing including raw milk cheese production with the aid of a questionnaire.  Results Forty-three out of 90 questionnaires were returned (48% return rate). Farmers perceived reproductive problems as most important in their dairy herds followed by respiratory disease and diarrhoea in young stock. Most frequently stated as important motivating factors to participate in S. aureus control were “avoiding negative news about cheese quality in the press” followed by “I want to be proud of my somatic cell counts again”. Most frequently chosen and identified as important constraining factors were “I fear that the authorities dictate and the farmers are not heard” followed by “costs to control S. aureus are too high because of premature culling” and “I am afraid to be forced to cull genetically valuable cows”. Farmers with an experience of a S. aureus problem in their dairy herds had a significantly better knowledge about contagiosity and clinical manifestation of different S. aureus genotypes than farmers with no self-reported experience of a S. aureus problem. Veterinarians were indicated as the most important experts, farmers seek advice in case of mastitis and most farmers suggested subsidising bacteriological milk analysis as an incentive to motivate farmers towards S. aureus control.  Conclusion According to the results an improved knowledge transfer on S. aureus to dairy producers and an integrative approach to a S. aureus control program with subsidising milk analysis will be most promising to improve the S. aureus situation in this confinded region of eastern Switzerland. Veterinarians should cover a key role in consulting farmers during the control program.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000245161",,"1746-6148",,"10.1186/s12917-018-1352-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/245161","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","S. aureus||Control-program||Attitude||Behaviour||Raw milk cheese quality","Control of Staphylococcus aureus in dairy herds in a region with raw milk cheese production: farmers' attitudes, knowledge, behaviour and belief in self-efficacy",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-03-01T02:28:58Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85041821477",,,"000424983200001","BMC vet. res.","1","BMC Veterinary Research","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While soil solution P turnover (Km) can be determined by tracing radioisotopes in a soil–solution system, few studies have done so. We believe that this is due to a lack of understanding on how to derive Km from isotopic exchange kinetic (IEK) experiments, a common form of radioisotope dilution study. Here, we provide a derivation of calculating Km using parameters obtained from IEK experiments. We then calculated Km for 217 soils from published IEK experiments in terrestrial ecosystems, and also that of 18 long-term P fertilizer field experiments. Analysis of the global compilation data set revealed a negative relationship between concentrations of soil solution P and Km. Furthermore, Km buffered isotopically exchangeable P in soils with low concentrations of soil solution P. This finding was supported by an analysis of long-term P fertilizer field experiments, which revealed a negative relationship between Km and phosphate-buffering capacity. Our study highlights the importance of calculating Km for understanding the kinetics of P between the soil solid and solution phases where it is bioavailable. We argue that our derivation can also be used to calculate soil solution turnover of other environmentally relevant and strongly sorbing elements that can be traced with radioisotopes, such as zinc, cadmium, nickel, arsenic, and uranium.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000222179",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-15-105-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/222179","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Soil solution phosphorus turnover: derivation, interpretation, and insights from a global compilation of isotope exchange kinetic studies",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2017-12-18T13:58:07Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85040319023",,,"000419548300001",,"1","Biogeosciences","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We investigated the temporal patterns of two major crops, sugar beet, and winter wheat. The observations were conducted using both optical and SAR data in relation to temporal availability and potential agricultural applications. The combined use of both remote sensing methods is strongly emphasized reflecting the timely need of the information by farmers and the restrictions of the remote sensing data mainly due to weather conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000306058","978-1-5386-7150-4||978-1-5386-7149-8||978-1-5386-7151-1",,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/313451||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/306058","10.1109/igarss.2018.8517298","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/329951","en","IEEE","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Agriculture||Polarimetric SAR||Multispectral||Copernicus Mission||Temporal Analysis","Observing Crop Growth and Vitality with the Copernicus Mission",,"Conference Paper","Open access","IGARSS 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium",,,,"2018-11-26T13:36:59Z",,,,,"yes","38th IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2018)","July 22-27, 2018","Valencia, Spain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85063166216",,,"000451039806102",,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While current literature provides evidence for an N2O emission reduction effect due to reduced fertiliser input, little is known about the effect of increased legume proportions potentially offsetting these reductions, i.e. by increased N2O emissions from plant residues and root exudates. In order to assess the overall effect of this mitigation strategy on permanent grassland, we performed an in situ experiment and quantified net N2O fluxes and biomass yields in two differently managed grass–clover mixtures. We measured N2O fluxes in an unfertilised parcel with high clover proportions vs. an organically fertilised control parcel with low clover proportions using the eddy covariance (EC) technique over 2 years. Furthermore, we related the measured N2O fluxes to management and environmental drivers. To assess the effect of the mitigation strategy, we measured biomass yields and quantified biologically fixed nitrogen using the 15N natural abundance method.  The amount of BFN was similar in both parcels in 2015 (control: 55±5kgNha−1yr−1; clover parcel: 72±5kgNha−1yr−1) due to similar clover proportions (control: 15% and clover parcel: 21%), whereas in 2016 BFN was substantially higher in the clover parcel compared to the much lower control (control: 14±2kgNha−1yr−1 with 4% clover in DM; clover parcel: 130±8kgNha−1yr−1 and 44% clover). The mitigation management effectively reduced N2O emissions by 54% and 39% in 2015 and 2016, respectively, corresponding to 1.0 and 1.6tha−1yr−1CO2 equivalents. These reductions in N2O emissions can be attributed to the absence of fertilisation on the clover parcel. Differences in clover proportions during periods with no recent management showed no measurable effect on N2O emissions, indicating that the decomposition of plant residues and rhizodeposition did not compensate for the effect of fertiliser reduction on N2O emissions. Annual biomass yields were similar under mitigation management, resulting in a reduction of N2O emission intensities from 0.42gN2O-Nkg−1DM (control) to 0.28gN2O-Nkg−1DM (clover parcel) over the 2-year observation period. We conclude that N2O emissions from fertilised grasslands can be effectively reduced without losses in yield by increasing the clover proportion and reducing fertilisation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000293184",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-15-5519-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/293184","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Management matters: testing a mitigation strategy for nitrous oxide emissions using legumes on intensively managed grassland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-10-04T05:53:18Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Robust models for assessing the effectiveness of technologies and managements to reduce N2O emissions from grazed pastures (Models4Pastures)","154245","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","FACCE-JPI",,,,,,"85053690291",,,"000444986100001",,"18","Biogeosciences","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Nevertheless, embryonic losses occur in every second cow during the first three weeks of gestation. The comprehension of key factors involved in the reproduction events is thus a prerequisite to reveal dysregulations. The protein Interferon tau (IFN tau) is the major pregnancy recognition signal in ruminants. It is not only responsible to extend the luteal life span but also involved in establishment of uterine receptivity, embryo elongation, nutrient supply and antiviral protection. While IFN tau mainly acts in a paracrine manner via interferon receptor signalling on endometrial cells, endocrine actions in peripheral blood cells, corpus luteum and liver have also been described. As IFN tau is solely produced in trophoblast tissue during the critical pregnancy recognition phase and as its production is influenced by embryo characteristics and culture conditions, it may be an interesting molecular marker for pregnancy and embryo monitoring. Deeper understanding of paracrine and endocrine actions of IFN tau may therefore not only help to understand its influence in embryo-maternal crosstalk but also its potential as a biomarker. Therefore, the objective of this thesis was to provide the prerequisite for an in-depth investigation of IFN tau and its effects. For this purpose, a highly sensitive enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for IFN tau quantification was developed and validated as well as a system to sense minute IFN activity. To monitor endocrine IFN tau or pregnancy induced effects, miRNA expression in milk was analysed and evaluated regarding its use for a bovine pregnancy detection system. The ELISA was established with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. They were generated in rabbits and rodents, respectively. Recombinantly produced IFN tau and IFN tau specific peptides were used as antigens. For IFN tau activity determination endometrial stroma cells (SC) were isolated, and cellular response to IFN tau exposure was determined via mRNA expression changes of ISG15, MX2 and OAS1. Both assays were biologically validated in a SC-blastocyst co-culture by determination of sex-dependent IFN tau production. The miRNA expression profiles of milk cells, skim milk and whole milk of pregnant and non-pregnant cows were determined using high-throughput sequencing and validated by RT-qPCR.  The limit of detection of the IFN tau-ELISA was as low as 7 pg/ml in uterine flushings and embryo culture supernatants, which is lower than in any reported assay. The SC reacted to actions of only 0.4 pg/ml IFN tau. We thereby evidenced five times higher IFN tau production in female than in male blastocysts. Furthermore, the IFN tau activity, mRNA and protein expression were significantly correlated. The indirect analysis of endocrine IFN tau action, using miRNA expression changes in milk, on the other hand only displayed minor miRNA regulations with high variances that could not be validated in biological replicates. In conclusion, the miRNA analysis in milk lagged behind expectations, while the ELISA and SC culture form an excellent fundament for in-depth investigation of IFN tau and embryo development.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000310749",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/310749","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","bovine pregnancy||milk miRNA||ELISA||interferon tau||miRNA sequencing||embryo coculture","Developement of Diagnostic Tools to Decipher Para- and Endocrine Effects of IFN Tau",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::590 - Zoological sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,,"2018-12-13T19:43:49Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25262",,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Legumes in mixture with grass constitutes an important component of cropping systems of crop-livestock farms. In recent years, these mixtures became an interesting alternative in stockless farms as feedstock for biogas production. Clover growing in association with grass receives 80% of its N from symbiotic N2 fixation. Estimations of fixed N have usually considered neither belowground clover N nor clover N transferred to the associated grass. One reason might be that the assessment of belowground N is laborious, since roots have to be recovered from the soil and N derived from rhizodeposition has to be estimated. Rhizodeposition N, composed of particulate and non-particulate compounds, is released into the soil from living roots via exudation and root turnover. Rhizodeposition has been studied by stable isotope 15N enrichment techniques. Likewise, N transfer from clover to grass has been assessed with 15N techniques using both the 15N enrichment and 15N natural abundance method. Fixed N contained in above- and belowground N of clover-grass swards potentially presents a significant N input in both conventional and organic cropping systems. These systems differ in fertilisation and crop protection strategies. The amount and the quality of applied fertilisers result in differences in soil nutrientavailability. Organically cropped soils often have a greater soil microbial biomass both in size and in activity compared to conventionally cropped ones. There is a lack of understanding on how these factors affect the input of symbiotically fixed N and on the fate of legume N remaining in the soil. To examine these relations, a microplot study was conducted in the DOK long-term field experiment, since 33 years of organic vs. conventional cropping with respective fertilisation and plant protection strategies resulted in soils with a gradient in nutrient-availability, soil microbial biomass both in size and in activity, and 15N natural abundance of soil N. Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) above- and belowground N was quantified in model clover-grass swards. Swards were cultivated in microplots over two consecutive years. Microplots were located in DOK field plots with different fertilisation strategies. In general, the fertilisation increased in the order zero-fertilisation control (NOFERT), organic cropping system with half dose fertilisation (BIOORG1), organic cropping system with regular dose fertilisation (BIOORG2), and conventional cropping system (CONMIN2) with regular dose fertilisation. The organic cropping system at level 1 and 2 was fertilised with farmyard manure (manure and slurry) while the conventional cropping system was supplied by mineral fertiliser exclusively. Red clover rhizodeposition N was determined by 15N multiple-pulse leaf labelling (chapter 1). All roots were carefully removed from the soil. Subsequently, the fate of N derived from rhizodeposition being still present in the soil was investigated at different points of time using a sequential extraction. This procedure allows to extract soluble N and microbial biomass N from the soil. The remaining soil organic matter pools were separated in low and high density occluded particulate organic matter and silicate and quartz mineral-organic associations using a sequential density fractionation. Cropping system related effects from the size and activity of the microbial biomass on the General introduction 4 incorporation of N derived from rhizodeposition in soil pools and soil organic matter pools were assessed (chapter 2). Furthermore, different 15N natural abundance and 15N enrichment procedures were compared to determine the transfer from red clover N to perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Subsequently, the 15N natural abundance method was verified with cropping systems under identical environmental and management conditions but differing in 15N natural abundance of the applied N fertilisers. One 15N natural abundance procedure was selected to quantify red clover N and symbiotically fixed red clover N being transferred to perennial ryegrass (chapter 3). Finally, the results from chapter 1 to 3 were scaled up from the microplot level to the field plot level of the DOK experiment. For this, N yields and clover proportions of clover-grass swards of field plots were used. Results were synthesised to present an overall picture on symbiotically fixed N in the plant-soil system of clover-grass swards under different cropping systems (general discussion). Red clover belowground N developed proportional to aboveground N at a ratio of 0.4 to 1 irrespective of the fertilisation strategy and the time of cultivation. However, the ratio N derived from rhizodeposition to root N changed with time. More than 90% of rhizodeposition N was incorporated into soil organic matter pools. Thereof, about 40% was found in silicate mineral-organic associations, 40% to 50% in both occluded particulate organic matter fractions, and the remainder in quartz mineralorganic associations irrespective of the fertilisation strategy related organic matter input. The proportions of grass N transferred from red clover N being estimated by 15N natural abundance procedures were within the range of that being estimated by 15N enrichment based procedures. About 40% of perennial ryegrass N was transferred from red clover in the low N fertilised swards (< 50 kg mineral N ha-1 a-1) NOFERT, BIOORG1 and BIOORG2. This corresponds to more than one third of perennial ryegrass N if related to symbiotically fixed red clover N. Up scaled from the microplot level to the field plot level of the DOK experiment, the sward plant-soil system obtained 300 to more than 400 kg N ha-1 from the symbiotic N2 fixation of clover after two years of cultivation. From that symbiotically fixed clover N, nearly 50% was present in the clover yield, about one third was transferred to grass, nearly 15% was accumulated in soil organic matter pools, 5% remained in the stubble and the root, and less than 1% was found in the both soil pools soluble N and microbial biomass N. Subsequent to the last harvest at the end of the 2nd year, on average 100 kg ha-1 symbiotically fixed clover derived N remained in the stubble and the roots of clover and grass and in the soil pools. Remaining N increased in the order NOFERT, CONMIN2, BIOORG2, and BIOORG1 at a ratio of 0.9 to 0.9 to 1.1 to 1.2 related to the average of the four cropping systems. In conclusion, red clover belowground N could be estimated from aboveground N by a factor of 0.4 irrespective of the fertilisation strategy and the cultivation time. Allocation of red clover rhizodeposition N to the silicate mineral-organic association was the dominant process N derived from rhizodeposition remaining in the soil was exposed. This process proceeded within months, but remained unaffected by the cropping system related microbial size and activity. 15N natural abundance procedures resulted in somewhat less variable estimates of N transfer from red clover to perennial ryegrass than 15N enrichment General introduction 5 procedures. Cropping systems affected the amount of red clover and perennial ryegrass N accumulation, red clover N derived from rhizodeposition, and N transfer to grass, but hardly affected the partitioning of N derived from rhizodeposition to soil pools. The partitioning of red clover N between above- and belowground and the partitioning within soil organic matter pools was not affected by cropping systems in the studied plant-soil system. Up scaled from the microplot to the field plot level of the DOK experiment, about 50% of symbiotically fixed clover N was deposited into the soil (≈15%) or transferred to grass (≈35%) at the end of the 2nd cultivation year. Hence, clover belowground N and N transfer to grass may represent important and considerable N inputs to agricultural systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000340284",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340284","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Rhizodeposition||Cropping systems||15N leaf labelling||N2 fixation||Fertilisation strategy||Microbial biomass||Nitrogen protection||Swards||Belowground to aboveground N ratio||Soil density fractions","Red clover belowground N input affected by the nutrient availability and its fate during two years of clover-grass sward cultivation",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","::JEL - JEL::Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics",,"2019-05-01T18:48:13Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25503",,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We found that pre-inhabitation by R. padi on plants facilitates the subsequent foraging of conspecifics and R. maidis. Without the virus, the occurrence of facilitation is asymmetric because it depends on the order of species arrival. However, with virus we found facilitation irrespective of the order of species arrival. Furthermore, the virus also boosted the fecundity of both aphids. Analyses of nutrient content of virus-free and virus-infected plants show significant increases of essential amino acids, sterols, and carbohydrates. Such nutrient increases appear to underlie the facilitative interactions and fecundity of aphids on virus-infected plants. Our experiments demonstrate that the virus dramatically increases the food consumption and fecundity of aphids through intra and interspecific trophic facilitation, resulting in processes that could affect community organization.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000282080",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-018-30023-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/282080","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A plant virus (BYDV) promotes trophic facilitation in aphids on wheat",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-08-13T08:05:49Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85051091622",,,"000440670200072","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They allow the detection of directional changes in community dynamics and ecosystemic processes, being an additional tool to assess biodiversity than species richness. Analysis of functional patterns in plant communities provides mechanistic insight into biodiversity alterations due to anthropogenic activity. Although studies have considered of either anthropogenic management or nutrient availability on functional traits in temperate grasslands, studies combining effects of both drivers are scarce. Here, we assessed the impacts of management intensity (fertilization, mowing, grazing), nutrient stoichiometry (C, N, P, K), and vegetation composition on community-weighted means (CWMs) and functional diversity (Rao’s Q) from seven plant traits in 150 grasslands in three regions in Germany, using data of 6 years. Land use and nutrient stoichiometry accounted for larger proportions of model variance of CWM and Rao’s Q than species richness and productivity. Grazing affected all analyzed trait groups; fertilization and mowing only impacted generative traits. Grazing was clearly associated with nutrient retention strategies, that is, investing in durable structures and production of fewer, less variable seed. Phenological variability was increased. Fertilization and mowing decreased seed number/mass variability, indicating competition-related effects. Impacts of nutrient stoichiometry on trait syndromes varied. Nutrient limitation (large N:P, C:N ratios) promoted species with conservative strategies, that is, investment in durable plant structures rather than fast growth, fewer seed, and delayed flowering onset. In contrast to seed mass, leaf-economics variability was reduced under P shortage. Species diversity was positively associated with the variability of generative traits. Synthesis. Here, land use, nutrient availability, species richness, and plant functional strategies have been shown to interact complexly, driving community composition, and vegetation responses to management intensity. We suggest that deeper understanding of underlying mechanisms shaping community assembly and biodiversity will require analyzing all these parameters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000285016",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.3609","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/285016","en","John Wiley & Sons","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Nutrient stoichiometry and land use rather than species richness determine plant functional diversity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-08-28T08:07:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecol Evol","1","Ecology and Evolution","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In Petunia hybrida, SL transport within the plant and towards the rhizosphere is driven by the ABCG‐class protein PDR1. PDR1 expression is regulated by phytohormones and by the soil phosphate abundance, and thus SL transport integrates plant development with nutrient conditions. We overexpressed PDR1 (PDR1 OE) to investigate whether increased endogenous SL transport is sufficient to improve plant nutrition and productivity. Phosphorus quantification and nondestructive X‐ray computed tomography were applied. Morphological and gene expression changes were quantified at cellular and whole tissue levels via time‐lapse microscopy and quantitative PCR. PDR1 OE significantly enhanced phosphate uptake and plant biomass production on phosphate‐poor soils. PDR1 OE plants showed increased lateral root formation, extended root hair elongation, faster mycorrhization and reduced leaf senescence. PDR1 overexpression allowed considerable SL biosynthesis by releasing SL biosynthetic genes from an SL‐dependent negative feedback. The increased endogenous SL transport/biosynthesis in PDR1 OE plants is a powerful tool to improve plant growth on phosphate‐poor soils. We propose PDR1 as an as yet unexplored trait to be investigated for crop production. The overexpression of PDR1 is a valuable strategy to investigate SL functions and transport routes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000226180",,"0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.14847","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/226180","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","auxin||mycorrhization||petunia||phosphate uptake||plant biomass||PLEIOTROPIC DRUG RESISTANCE1 (PDR1)||strigolactone||strigolactone transport","Changes in the allocation of endogenous strigolactone improve plant biomass production on phosphate-poor soils",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-01-08T03:49:31Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85039855289",,,"000419324000029","New Phytol.","2","New Phytologist","217","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Four experimental pellets were produced with 0, 30% and 60% hazel leaves, the latter also with 4% polyethylene glycol. Hazel leaves gradually replaced lucerne. The diet was composed of the pellets and grass hay (80%: 20%). Six adult sheep were allocated to all four treatments in a 6 × 4 crossover design. Including hazel leaves did not affect the feed intake, but it decreased the apparent digestibility of organic matter and fibre, especially at the high level. Methane emission was reduced by up to 25 to 33% per day, per unit of intake and per unit of organic matter digested. Urinary nitrogen excretion decreased by 33 to 72% with increasing levels of hazel leaves. The treatment with polyethylene glycol demonstrated that tannins in hazel leaves caused significant shares of the effects. In conclusion, the current results indicated a significant potential of hazel leaves as forage for ruminants to mitigate methane and urinary nitrogen emissions. Even high dietary hazel leaf proportions were palatable. The lower digestibility needs to be compensated with easily digestible diet ingredients.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000254685",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-018-23572-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/254685","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Supplementation of Pelleted Hazel (Corylus avellana) Leaves Decreases Methane and Urinary Nitrogen Emissions by Sheep at Unchanged Forage Intake",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-04-04T07:05:29Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85044940262",,,"000428994100020","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Furthermore, soil carbon (C) stocks play an important role in soil fertility. It is thus of great interest to know whether intensively managed croplands act as a net source or sink of atmospheric CO2 and if soil C stocks are preserved over long timescales. The FluxNet site CH-Oe2 in Oensingen, Switzerland, has been operational since the end of 2003. This cropland is managed under the Swiss framework of the Proof of Ecological Performance (PEP, a variant of integrated management) with a crop rotation centred on winter wheat, which also includes winter barley, winter rapeseed, peas, potato and intermediate cover crops. In addition to eddy covariance measurements, meteorological and soil measurements were available along with information on C imports and exports from organic fertilisation, sowing and harvesting. This study investigates cropland C budgets over 13 years and assesses whether the PEP regulations resulted in a balanced C budget. The strongest CO2 uptake was observed during cereal seasons. C export through harvest, however, offset the strong uptake of the cereal crops. The largest net CO2 emissions to the atmosphere were observed during pea and cover crop seasons. Net biome production, representing the overall C budget (assuming carbon leaching to groundwater to be negligible), typically ranged between close to C neutral to C losses of up to 407gCm−2 per season, with peas being the largest source. Overall, the field lost 1674gCm−2 over 13 years (129gCm−2yr−1), which was confirmed by soil C stock measurements at the beginning and the end of the study period. Although managing the field under the regulations of PEP did not result in an overall C sink, model simulations showed that the use of cover crops reduced the C losses compared to leaving the field bare. The use of solid manure improved the C budget by importing substantial amounts of C into the soil, while liquid manure had only a small effect. We thus conclude that additional efforts are needed to bring Swiss management practices closer to the goal of preserving soil C in the long term.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000289808",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-15-5377-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/289808","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Integrated management of a Swiss cropland is not sufficient to preserve its soil carbon pool in the long term",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-09-15T07:08:39Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The role of diffuse radiation for a long-term arable crop rotation at Oensingen, Switzerland (Acronym: DiRad Oensingen)","146373","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,,,"85053009001",,,"000443863200001",,"17","Biogeosciences","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Direct measurement of individual CH4 emissions is logistically demanding and expensive, and correlated traits (proxies) or models can be used instead as a means to predict emissions. However, most predictive models tend to be specific and are valid mainly within the circumstances under which they were developed. Robust prediction models that work across countries and production environments may be built by combining heterogeneous data from several sources. However, combining heterogeneous individual animal observations on CH4 proxies from several sources is challenging and reports are scant in literature. The main objective of this study was to combine heterogeneous individual animal observations on CH4 proxies to develop robust enteric CH4 prediction models. Data on dairy cattle CH4 emissions and related proxies from 16 herds were made available by 13 research centers across 9 European countries within the Methagene EU COST Action FA1302 consortium on “Large-scale methane measurements on individual ruminants for genetic evaluations”. After a through edition and harmonization, the final dataset comprised 48,804 observations from 2,391 cows. Random Forest (RF) models were used to predict CH4 emissions and to estimate the relative importance of proxies for across-country predictions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to detect potential data stratifications. Milk yield, milk fat, DIM, BW, herd and country of origin appeared to be the most relevant proxies in the prediction model. An overall prediction accuracy of 0.81 was estimated from the combined heterogeneous data. This study is a first attempt to develop methods and approaches to combine heterogeneous individual animal data on proxies for CH4 to build robust models for prediction of CH4 emissions across diverse production systems and environments. The methodology outlined here can be extended to combining heterogeneous data, pedigree information and genome-wide dense marker information for estimation of genetic parameters and prediction of breeding values for traits related to dairy system CH4 emissions.

The introducing overview article summarizes major published scientific findings in the time period from IPW7 (2015) until recently, including presentations from IPW8. The P issue was subdivided into four themes along the logical sequence of P utilization in production, environmental, and societal systems: (1) Sufficiency and efficiency of P utilization, especially in animal husbandry and crop production; (2) P recycling: technologies and product applications; (3) P fluxes and cycling in the environment; and (4) P governance. The latter two themes had separate sessions for the first time in the International Phosphorus Workshops series; thus, this overview presents a scene-setting rather than an overview of the latest research for these themes. In summary, this paper details new findings in agricultural and environmental P research, which indicate reduced P inputs, improved management options, and provide translations into governance options for a more sustainable P use.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000217046",,"0044-7447||1654-7209",,"10.1007/s13280-017-0968-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/217046","en","Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Cropping system||Eutrophication||Fertilizer||Governance||P efficiency||Plant nutrition","Handling the phosphorus paradox in agriculture and natural ecosystems: Scarcity, necessity, and burden of P",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2017-12-05T05:39:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85034593434",,,,"Ambio",,"Ambio","47","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This thesis is part of a larger project aiming at revising the feeding recommendations for modern Swiss Large White pigs. Targeted nutrition of the current genotypes is also necessary for the improvement of nutrient use efficiency which is one of the most important criteria in environmentally sound pig production systems. In order to find the minimum dietary crude protein (CP) content below which deficiency symptoms arise, the impact of a strong dietary protein restriction was assessed on performance and body composition of 66 entire male (EM), 58 castrate (CA) and 66 female (FE) Swiss Large White pigs. From 20 kg body weight (BW) onwards, pigs had either ad libitum access to a control diet (C), formulated according to unrevised Swiss feeding recommendations for pigs, or to a low CP diet (LP), with only 80% of C of CP, lysine, methione+cystine, threonine and tryptophan. Individual FI was monitored and pigs were weighed weekly. The serial slaughter technique was used to determine body composition at different BW categories, from new born to 140 kg BW. The weight of each carcass component and nutrient amounts in the empty body (EB) were related to EB weight (EBW) using allometric regressions. Besides, N-efficiency was calculated by using the 20 kg BW pigs as reference. One aspect of the present study was to monitor the changes of carcass cuts weights, of great interest for the meat industry, and the organ weights involved in nutrient metabolism of growing finishing pigs and to assess whether gender or CP restriction have an impact on the carcass cuts or organ growth. Differences in kidneys weight suggested a greater N clearance needed in C-pigs. Overall, diet and gender did not affect all body parts to the same extent. Growth rate of LP-FE lean cuts overpassed the one of C-pigs, leading to heavier lean cuts in the finisher period in LP-FE than C-FE. This was not true for CA and EM pigs. Shoulder and loin weights and growth rates were reduced in LP-compared to C-pigs. Ham growth rate was faster in LP- than C-FE whereas in LP-EM and LP-CA it was lower than their C-counterparts. Total amounts of subcutaneous fat, backfat, ham fat and shoulder fat were lower in C- than LP-pigs. Back fat and shoulder fat weights were greater in CA than FE, regardless of the diet. This difference was more pronounced in LP diets. However, the amount of deposited ham fat was greater in LP-CA than LP-FE but not in C-CA than in C-FE. These differences are to be taken in account by meat industry. The LP-diet was hypothesised to negatively impact growth performance parameters, decrease protein deposition rates and increase fat deposition rates of growing-finishing pigs. Indeed, daily gain and feed efficiency were lower in the LP-pigs compared to C-pigs from 20 to 100 kg BW, despite similar FI. Castrates had the greatest FI but the lowest feed efficiency, together with FE. Daily fat and protein deposition rates (using the 20 kg BW pigs as reference) in the EB were increased and reduced, respectively, with the LP diets until 100 kg BW. Nitrogen efficiency improved by 10% with the LP diet from 100 to 140 kg. The lowest and highest relative deposition rates (g/kg EBW gain) of fat and protein, respectively, were found in the EB of C-pigs. The LP-CA and LP-FE had greater relative protein and amino acid (AA) deposition rates than their C-counterparts in the finisher I and II periods, whereas relative fat deposition rate of LP-CA and LP-FE was lower than C-CA and FE in the finisher I period. Phenylalanine and threonine-to-lysine ratios decreased with increasing EBW. Valine- and threonine-to-lysine ratios in C-CA and C-FE were 3 and 2 units greater than values adopted by the most recent National Research Council standards whereas cystine-, methionine- and tyrosine-to-lysine ratios were lower by 5, 7 and 4 units, respectively.  Another objective of thesis was the study of the dynamics with age of macro and trace mineral amounts and calculate their relative deposition rates in order to fine tune mineral net requirements and to provide data for mineral import-export balances. Since CP supply had showed to influence body composition in the present study, it was hypothesised that body mineral composition could have also been modified, similarly to the studies where pig genetic lines differing in body leanness had different mineral composition. The diet only affected potassium (K) amount in the EB which was greater when the LP diet was fed. The gender only affected K and sodium (Na) EB amounts which were greater in EM. Except for zinc, all mineral relative deposition rates decreased with increasing EBW. The present results suggest that there is a potential to reduce CP and AA supply in FE and CA, but not in EM, without compromising performance and body composition. Discrepancies found in the AA profile questioned the steadiness of the ideal protein across growth. Estimations of growth parameters, feed efficiency, nutrient deposition rates and the relative growth of the different carcass cuts in this study can be used to predict changes in the entire body, calculate nutrient requirements and mineral and nitrogen import-export balances. All of that can be used to refine recommendations and thus result in a more efficient pig production.   ","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000310428",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/310428","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Changes of the Body Composition of Modern Pig Genotypes During Growth as Depending on the Dietary Protein Supply",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::590 - Zoological sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,,"2018-12-12T20:07:14Z","2021-12-13",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25167",,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Intensively managed meadows and pastures are rich in crude protein. The contents of crude protein of forage are often higher than required by ruminants for ideal ruminal conditions. Excess of crude protein increases the excretion of nitrogen and reduces the nitrogen use efficiency. The supply of protein to the animal may however be limited even under conditions of excessive supply of crude protein due to the high ruminal degradability of the forage protein. A high ruminal protein degradability is challenging for the metabolism of the animal and may contribute to environmental pollution. When compared to grasses, herbs often contain higher amounts of phenolic compounds (plant secondary metabolites). A major group of phenolic compounds consists of tannins with its two subclasses of condensed (CT) and hydrolysable tannins (HT). Some condensed tannins can reduce the ruminal degradability of the forage protein, while HT are often related to reduced palatability and forage digestibility. Tannins, both CT and HT may have a beneficial impact on the milk fatty acid profile. In this dissertation, specific herbs or grassland swards rich in herbs were evaluated for their suitability in ruminant nutrition with respect to feed value, nitrogen use efficiency, yield and composition of milk and milk fatty acid profile. In a first experiment (Chapter 2), swards rich in herbs were analyzed for their feed value and the content and composition of phenols. Over a period of two years, forage samples were obtained from swards of three long-term mineral fertilization field experiments. The experimental fields were located in the mountain area of Switzerland: Bremgarten, two cuts per year, 930 m a.s.l., Canton Solothurn, established in 1972; Orsière, 2 cuts per year, 1‘190 m a.s.l., Canton Valais, established in 1984 and Eggenalp, 3 cuts per year, 1‘340 m a.s.l., Canton Berne, established in 1956. At each of the three experimental sites, three different treatments of fertilization were investigated including unfertilized swards, those fertilized with phosphorus and potassium (PK) and swards fertilized with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK). A variety of species rich swards have been established due to the differences of the long-term mineral fertilization treatments with respect to geographical location, site, altitude and cutting frequency. Forages samples were analyzed for their chemical and mineral composition. During the first year of sampling (2015), the species composition of each sward was determined, and samples were analyzed for the content and composition of phenolic compounds and the in vitro assessed digestibility, the content of energy (net-energy for lactation, NEL) and protein (utilizable crude protein) with the modified version of the Hohenheim gas test.  Based on the investigation of the mountain grassland swards with proportions of herbs between 18.4 to 451. % of the long-term mineral fertilization field experiments, a high forage quality can be achieved depending on fertilization and cutting intensity of the swards. Species rich mountain swards contained elevated contents of phenolic compounds. At site Bremgarten, the content of phenolic compounds and those of HT were particularly elevated due to the high proportion of Geranium sylvaticum L. present in these swards. The proportion of legumes was increased when fertilizing phosphorus and potassium. Legumes species such as those of Lotus corniculatus L. and the one of Lathyrus pratensis L. probably increased the content of CT in the forage, respectively.  Based on the experiments conducted with swards obtained from the three long-term mineral fertilizer experiments, effects of swards rich in herbal species obtained from mountain meadows (Chapter 3) or an artificially established sward containing high proportions of plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.), a herb described for its elevated tannin content (Chapter 4) were evaluated in vivo with lactating dairy cows. In two separate feeding experiments with complete collection of feces and urine respectively, the effects of these swards were evaluated with respect to the digestibility, nitrogen turnover, the milk yield and composition as well as the milk fatty acid profile. In each of the two experiments, four distinct diets were created, and each diet was fed to six cows. In the first feeding experiment (Chapter 3), swards conserved as hay were fed to lactating dairy cows with supplementation of concentrates. Two hay swards differing in their proportion of herbs were obtained from mountain meadows and compared to two grass dominated hay swards from the lowland area. A higher proportion of herbs in the swards obtained from mountain meadows was related to higher contents of phenolic compounds and CT. Two reference diets based on ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) with low contents of phenols and CT were created. While one of the reference diets had a similar content of crude protein as the two diets containing the hay swards from mountain meadows, the other reference diet was characterized by a distinct excess of crude protein. In a second feeding experiment (Chapter 4), the effects of herbs were investigated in intensely managed production systems with the example of plantain. Therefore, three diets with ensiled forage from artificially established swards related to increasing contents of phenolic compounds were designed: Ryegrass; ryegrass and red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and ryegrass-red clover and plantain. These three diets were fed ad libitum and supplemented with 3 kg of wheat per day and cow each and compared to a reference diet based on corn silage and soybean meal. In both feeding experiments, it could be shown that feeding diets containing herbs increased the intake of phenolic compounds. The contents of CT of swards which were fed within the experiments of this thesis were unable to improve the nitrogen use efficiency in dairy cows. However, in the case of the diet with the sward obtain from the mountain meadow with the highest proportion of herbs; the excretion of nitrogen could be displaced from urine to feces, which was related to the intake of CT. This finding indicates potential to feed swards rich in herbs to reduce the metabolic load of nitrogen for the animal as well as the environmental pollution of nitrogen. The feeding of diets rich in herbs did not result in increased milk yield or excretion of milk fat or protein. The diets containing hay from mountain meadows increased the transfer of α-linolenic acid to the milk fat. Feeding a diet containing plantain resulted in a milk fatty acid profile with increased contents of vaccenic acids, conjugated linoleic acids and overall higher contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In this sense, feeding of diets containing herbs increased the content of fatty acids related to potentially beneficial health effects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000304897",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/304897","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Suitability of Forage Stands with Contrasting Species Richness to Improve the Nitrogen Use Efficiency and the Milk Fatty Acid Profile of Dairy Cows",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,,"2018-11-20T14:27:29Z","2021-11-20",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25143",,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It includes moving dairy cows from lowland (LO) to highland (HI) pastures during summer. It is known that high genetic merit cows are susceptible to the HI conditions, but it is unclear if this also applies to more adapted, regional cow types. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of HI sojourn on cheese-making properties of Aosta Red Pied cows, a dual purpose cattle type. Milk coagulation properties were measured in the milk of 47 cows before and after transhumance. Sources of variation were investigated using linear mixed models, including parity, site, milking time, the interaction parity × site, milking time × site and milking time × parity. Cow was nested within site, and used as subject for repetition, and sampling date was included as repeated factor. Curd-firming time and curd firmness did not vary between LO and HI, whereas rennet coagulation time was prolonged in HI compared to LO in both primiparous (16.4 vs. 18.5 min) and multiparous cows (17.5 vs. 21.1 min, respectively). The percentage of non-coagulating samples was greater in HI (15.0%) compared to LO (8.5%). The lower milk reactivity to rennet addition in HI seems to be mostly related to the simultaneously increasing somatic cell score. Morning and evening milk were similar in coagulation properties. In conclusion, even indigenous dual purpose cows were affected by HI conditions and the experience the multiparous cows had with the transhumance was not helpful either.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000254378",,"1594-4077||1828-051X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316767||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/254378","10.1080/1828051X.2018.1443289","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/317176","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Pasture||grazing system||milk coagulation||dual  purpose cattle","Are cheese-making properties of dual purpose cattle impaired by highland grazing?

A common problem experienced with captive foregut-fermenting primate (colobine) diets is that they are deficient in fiber and therefore highly digestible. This may contribute to gastrointestinal disorders often observed in zoos. An approach to obtain information relevant for the improvement of diets is to compare the nutrient composition of feces from free-ranging and captive individuals. In theory, fecal material can be considered a proxy for diet intake integrated over a certain period of time. We collected fecal samples from eight free-ranging proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus, a highly endangered colobine species) groups from a secondary forest along the Kinabatangan River and four from a mixed mangrove-riverine forest along the Garama River, Sabah, Borneo, Malaysia. We also collected fecal samples from 12 individual captive adult/sub-adult proboscis monkeys from three different zoos. We confirmed that feces from free-ranging monkeys contained more fiber and less metabolic fecal nitrogen than those from captive specimens, indicating a less digestible diet in the wild. Modifying the diets of captive colobines to include more fiber, comparable to those of free-ranging ones, may contribute to their health and survival.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000239910",,"2297-1769","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/239910||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/242526","10.3389/fvets.2017.00246","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/253164","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Colobine||fecal nutrient||captivity||folivore||foregut fermentation","Fecal nutrients suggest diets of higher fiber levels in free-ranging than in captive proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-02-11T04:17:20Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85041338523",,,"000451815900001","Front.

To understand the inhibitory mechanism of C12, a transcriptome analysis was performed in M. ruminantium strain M1 (DSM 1093) using RNA-Seq.  Results  Pure cell cultures in the exponential growth phase were treated with 0.4 mg/ml C12, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), for 1 h and transcriptomic changes were compared to DMSO-only treated cells (final DMSO concentration 0.2%). Exposure to C12 resulted in differential expression of 163 of the 2280 genes in the M1 genome (maximum log2-fold change 6.6). Remarkably, C12 hardly affected the expression of genes involved in methanogenesis. Instead, most affected genes encode cell-surface associated proteins (adhesion-like proteins, membrane-associated transporters and hydrogenases), and proteins involved in detoxification or DNA-repair processes. Enrichment analysis on the genes regulated in the C12-treated group showed a significant enrichment for categories ‘cell surface’ and ‘mobile elements’ (activated by C12), and for the categories ‘regulation’ and ‘protein fate’ (represssed). These results are useful to generate and test specific hypotheses on the mechanism how C12 affects rumen methanogens.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000244475",,"1756-0500","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/244475||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/242519","10.1186/s13104-018-3242-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/255738","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Methanobrevibacter ruminantium||Methanogenesis||Fatty acid||Rumen||Gene expression||Lauric acid","The transcriptome response of the ruminal methanogen Methanobrevibacter ruminantium strain M1 to the inhibitor lauric acid",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-02-20T15:01:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85042160197",,,,,"135","BMC Research Notes","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02070 - Dep.

It is also considered as a sustainable source of biomass for energy production. However, improvement in biomass yield has been limited by comparison with other major crops. More efficient utilisation of genetic resources and improved breeding schemes are required to advance L. perenne breeding. In an attempt to elucidate the extent of genetic diversity in L. perenne, 1384 DArT, 182 SNP and 48 SSR markers were applied to 297 accessions (Set I) contributed by three German breeding companies and the IPK Genebank. Due to the heterogeneous nature of Lolium accessions, bulk samples were used. Apart from germplasm set I, additional set II and set III was used to determine the reproducibility of marker system and judge the feasibility of bulk strategy in this study.  Results  By assessing different bulk sizes, 24 individuals per sample were shown to be a representative number of plants to discriminate different accessions. Among the 297 accessions, all marker types revealed a high polymorphism rate; 1.99, 2.00 and 8.19 alleles, were obtained per locus on average using DArTs, SNPs and SSRs, respectively. The Jaccard distance for DArT markers ranged from 0.00 to 0.73, the Modified Roger’s distance (MRD) for SNP markers ranged from 0.03 to 0.52, and for SSR markers from 0.26 to 0.76. Gene diversity for dominant DArT and co-dominant SNP and SSR markers was found to be 0.26, 0.32 and 0.45, respectively. DArT markers showed the highest consistency and reproducibility.  Conclusion  The resulting data were evaluated using a number of different classification methods, but none of the methods showed a clear differentiation into distinct genetic pools. With regard to hybrid breeding, this will possibly impede substantial progress towards increased biomass yields of L. perenne by utilising heterosis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000237424",,"1471-2156",,"10.1186/s12863-017-0589-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/237424","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Perennial ryegrass||Genetic diversity||Genetic resources||Genetic pools||Genotyping||Hybrid breeding","DArT, SNP, and SSR analyses of genetic diversity in Lolium perenne L. using bulk sampling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-01-31T03:56:29Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85040866203",,,"000423174400002","BMC Genet",,"BMC Genetics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
