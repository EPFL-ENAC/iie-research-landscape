Pyricularia oryzae has a worldwide distribution as a rice pathogen and in the last 30 years emerged as an important wheat pathogen in southern Brazil. We conducted phylogenetic analyses using 10 housekeeping loci for 128 isolates of P. oryzae sampled from sympatric populations of wheat, rice, and grasses growing in or near wheat fields. Phylogenetic analyses grouped the isolates into three major clades. Clade 1 comprised isolates associated only with rice and corresponds to the previously described rice blast pathogen P. oryzae pathotype Oryza (PoO). Clade 2 comprised isolates associated almost exclusively with wheat and corresponds to the previously described wheat blast pathogen P. oryzae pathotype Triticum (PoT). Clade 3 contained isolates obtained from wheat as well as other Poaceae hosts. We found that Clade 3 is distinct from P. oryzae and represents a new species, Pyricularia graminis-tritici (Pgt). No morphological differences were observed among these species, but a distinctive pathogenicity spectrum was observed. Pgt and PoT were pathogenic and highly aggressive on Triticum aestivum (wheat), Hordeum vulgare (barley), Urochloa brizantha (signal grass), and Avena sativa (oats). PoO was highly virulent on the original rice host (Oryza sativa), and also on wheat, barley, and oats, but not on signal grass. We conclude that blast disease on wheat and its associated Poaceae hosts in Brazil is caused by multiple Pyricularia species. Pyricularia graminis-tritici was recently found causing wheat blast in Bangladesh. This indicates that P. graminis-tritici represents a serious threat to wheat cultivation globally.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000216111",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/121273||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/215736","10.3767/003158516x692149","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/216111","en","Naturalis Biodiversity Center","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/","Triticum aestivum||Cryptic species||Host adaptation||Phylogenetics||Systematics","Pyricularia graminis-tritici, a new Pyricularia species causing wheat blast",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T13:54:25Z",,"pub:183367",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654c3a48bf43803","010636982",,"85009822926","000391598000010",,,"Persoonia - Molecular Phylogeny and Evolution of Fungi","37","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Outdoor cultivation in raceway ponds is estimated to provide a better return on energy invested than closed photobioreactor systems. However, in these open systems, algal crops are subjected to environmental variation in temperature and irradiance, as well as biotic invasions which can cause costly crop instabilities. In this paper, we used an experimental approach to investigate the ability of species richness to maximize and stabilize biocrude production in the face of weekly temperature fluctuations between 17 and 27 °C, relative to a constant-temperature control. We hypothesized that species richness would lead to higher mean biocrude production and greater stability of biocrude production over time in the variable temperature environment. Counter to our hypothesis, species richness tended to cause a decline in mean biocrude production, regardless of environmental temperature variation. However, biodiversity did have stabilizing effects on biocrude production over time in the variable temperature environment and not in the constant temperature environment. Altogether, our results suggest that when the most productive and stable monoculture is unknown, inoculating raceway ponds with a diverse mixture of algae will tend to ensure stable harvests over time.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000125388",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.6b03256","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/125388","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Power of Plankton: Effects of Algal Biodiversity on Biocrude Production and Stability",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T18:04:26Z",,"pub:187988",,"no",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936550f4c69940582",,,,,"Environ.

In aphids, resistance to parasitoids is largely determined by the presence or absence of protective endosymbionts such as Hamiltonella defensa. Hence, parasitoids may become locally adapted to the prevalence of this endosymbiont in their host populations. To address this, we collected isofemale lines of the aphid parasitoid Lysiphlebus fabarum from 17 sites in Switzerland and France, at which we also estimated the frequency of infection with H. defensa as well as other bacterial endosymbionts in five important aphid host species. The parasitoids’ ability to overcome H. defensa-mediated resistance was then quantified by estimating their parasitism success on a single aphid clone (Aphis fabae fabae) that was either uninfected or experimentally infected with one of three different isolates of H. defensa.  Results The five aphid species (Aphis fabae fabae, A. f. cirsiiacanthoides, A. hederae, A. ruborum, A. urticata) differed strongly in the relative frequencies of infection with different bacterial endosymbionts, but there was also geographic variation in symbiont prevalence. Specifically, the frequency of infection with H. defensa ranged from 22 to 47 % when averaged across species. Parasitoids from sites with a high prevalence of H. defensa tended to be more infective on aphids possessing H. defensa, but this relationship was not significant, thus providing no conclusive evidence that L. fabarum is locally adapted to the occurrence of H. defensa. On the other hand, we observed a strong interaction between parasitoid line and H. defensa isolate on parasitism success, indicative of a high specificity of symbiont-conferred resistance.  Conclusions This study is the first, to our knowledge, to test for local adaptation of parasitoids to the frequency of defensive symbionts in their hosts. While it yielded useful information on the occurrence of facultative endosymbionts in several important host species of L. fabarum, it provided no clear evidence that parasitoids from sites with a high prevalence of H. defensa are better able to overcome H. defensa-conferred resistance. The strong genetic specificity in their interaction suggests that it may be more important for parasitoids to adapt to the particular strains of H. defensa in their host populations than to the general prevalence of this symbiont, and it highlights the important role symbionts can play in mediating host-parasitoid coevolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000125396",,"1471-2148",,"10.1186/s12862-016-0811-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/125396","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Aphis||Bacterial endosymbionts||Defensive symbiosis||Hamiltonella||Local adaptation||Lysiphlebus||Parasitoids||Resistance","Are aphid parasitoids locally adapted to the prevalence of defensive symbionts in their hosts?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T18:04:26Z",,"pub:187997",,"yes",,,,"Symbiont-mediated coevolution in an insect host-parasitoid system","146341","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,"imp5936550f78adb96121",,,,"000389956900001","BMC evol. biol.",,"BMC Evolutionary Biology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The epidemic spread to an estimated 15,000 hectares, about 16 % of the cultivated wheat area in Bangladesh, with yield losses reaching up to 100 %. Within weeks of the onset of the epidemic, we performed transcriptome sequencing of symptomatic leaf samples collected directly from Bangladeshi fields.  Results Reinoculation of seedlings with strains isolated from infected wheat grains showed wheat blast symptoms on leaves of wheat but not rice. Our phylogenomic and population genomic analyses revealed that the wheat blast outbreak in Bangladesh was most likely caused by a wheat-infecting South American lineage of the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.  Conclusion Our findings suggest that genomic surveillance can be rapidly applied to monitor plant disease outbreaks and provide valuable information regarding the identity and origin of the infectious agent.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000121234",,"1741-7007",,"10.1186/s12915-016-0309-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/121234","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Field pathogenomics||Wheat blast||Phylogenomic analysis||Eleusine indica||Oryza sativa","Emergence of wheat blast in Bangladesh was caused by a South American lineage of Magnaporthe oryzae",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T13:45:00Z",,"pub:183328",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654c2d275939896",,,"84989315832","000384374900001","BMC Biol",,"BMC Biology","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the nature of these changes and the importance of population-specific environmental constraints in shaping their expression are difficult to predict and, as a consequence, poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether and how life-history traits vary between reproductive events and whether this variation is population-dependent in the European earwig Forficula auricularia. In this insect species, females produce up to two clutches during their lifetime and express extensive forms of maternal care. We conducted a common garden experiment, in which we measured 11 life-history traits of the first and second clutches of 132 females originating from three populations. Our results showed that clutch size was higher and the level of care expressed towards juveniles lower in second as compared to the first clutches in all three populations. In contrast, we found a population-specific effect on whether and how the reproductive event shaped juvenile quality and a trade-off between egg developmental time and female weight at hatching. Overall, these findings emphasise that the last reproductive event of a female entails both positive and negative effects on various life-history traits of the female herself and her clutch of juveniles. Moreover, our study stresses the importance of population idiosyncrasies on the expression and nature of such cohort-specific effects.",,,,"0029-8549||1432-1939",,"10.1007/s00442-016-3685-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551344","en","Springer",,,"Senescence||Terminal investment||Parental care||Family life||Semelparity||Insect","The population determines whether and how life-history traits vary between reproductive events in an insect with maternal care",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-06-08T11:05:29Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,"84945218928","000383669300011","Oecologia","2","Oecologia","182","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we ask whether and how thermal reaction norms in a key calcifying species, the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, change as a result of 2.5 years of experimental evolution to a temperature ≈2°C below its upper thermal limit. Replicate experimental populations derived from a single genotype isolated from Norwegian coastal waters were grown at two temperatures for 2.5 years before assessing thermal responses at 6 temperatures ranging from 15 to 26°C, with pCO2 (400/1100/2200 μatm) as a fully factorial additional factor. The two selection temperatures (15°/26.3°C) led to a marked divergence of thermal reaction norms. Optimal growth temperatures were 0.7°C higher in experimental populations selected at 26.3°C than those selected at 15.0°C. An additional negative effect of high pCO2 on maximal growth rate (8% decrease relative to lowest level) was observed. Finally, the maximum persistence temperature (Tmax) differed by 1–3°C between experimental treatments, as a result of an interaction between pCO2 and the temperature selection. Taken together, we demonstrate that several attributes of thermal reaction norms in phytoplankton may change faster than the predicted progression of ocean warming.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000125373",,"1752-4571||1752-4563",,"10.1111/eva.12362","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/125373","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","adaptation||coccolithophores||experimental evolution||global warming||phytoplankton||reaction norm||temperature","Swift thermal reaction norm evolution in a key marine phytoplankton species",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T18:04:26Z",,"pub:187969",,"no",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936550eec0ce90477","006994734",,,,"Evol.

Using Escherichia coli, we examined how bacteria exposed to sublethal concentrations of ampicillin adjust gene expression patterns and metabolism to simultaneously deal with the antibiotic-induced damage and maintain rapid growth. We found that the treated cells increased energy production, as well as translation and macromolecular repair and protection. These responses are adaptive, because they confer increased survival not only to lethal ampicillin treatment but also to non-antibiotic lethal stresses. This robustness is modulated by nutrient availability. Because different antibiotics and other stressors induce the same set of responses, we propose that it constitutes a general core hormetic stress response. It is plausible that this response plays an important role in the robustness of bacteria exposed to antibiotic treatments and constant environmental fluctuations in natural environments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000125266",,"2666-3864||2211-1247",,"10.1016/j.celrep.2016.09.001","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/125266","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Antibiotics||Sublethal stress||Hormetic stress response||General stress response||RpoS||Stringent response||PpGpp||Energy metabolism||Translation||Escherichia coli","Discovery and Function of a General Core Hormetic Stress Response in E. coli Induced by Sublethal Concentrations of Antibiotics",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T18:02:07Z",,"pub:187853",,"no",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936550d03aaa78470","007612702",,,,"Cell Rep","1","Cell Reports","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The nearby origins of the Rhine, Rhone, Danube and Po rivers in the Swiss Alps allow the examination of historical and human-influenced patterns in fish genetic structure over a small geographic scale. We investigated these patterns in the widespread European chub (Squalius cephalus) from the Rhone, Rhine and Danube catchments and its proposed southern sister species Italian chub (Squalius squalus) from the Po catchment.  Results A phylogenetic tree constructed from mitochondrial Cytochrome b and COI sequences was consistent with earlier work in that it showed a separation of European chub and Italian chub, which was also reflected in microsatellite allele frequencies, morphological traits and shape differences quantified by geometric morphometrics. A new finding was that the predominant mitochondrial haplotype of European chub from the Rhine and Rhone catchments was also discovered in some individuals from Swiss populations of the Italian chub, presumably as a result of human translocation. Consistent with postglacial recolonizations from multiple refugia along the major rivers, the nuclear genetic structure of the European chub largely reflected drainage structure, but it was modified by watershed crossings between Rhine and Rhone near Lake Geneva as well as between Danube and Rhine near Lake Constance.  Conclusion Our study adds new insights into the cyprinid colonization history of central Europe by showing that multiple processes shaped the distribution of different chub lineages around the Swiss Alps. Interestingly, we find evidence that cross-catchment migration has been mediated by unusual geological events such as drainage captures or watershed crossings facilitated by retreating glaciers, as well as evidence that human transport has interfered with the historical distribution of these fish (European chub haplotypes present in the Italian chub). The desirable preservation of evolutionarily distinct lineages will thus require the prevention of further translocations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120302",,"1471-2148",,"10.1186/s12862-016-0750-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120302","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Chub||Drainage capture||Human translocations||Phylogeography||Pleistocene glaciations||Squalius","Postglacial recolonizations, watershed crossings and human translocations shape the distribution of chub lineages around the Swiss Alps",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T12:24:46Z",,"pub:182367",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654b22b30368367",,,"84986918001","000383147600001","BMC evol. biol.",,"BMC Evolutionary Biology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study developed an analytical method based on Fourier analysis to estimate seasonal and diel periodicities, as well as irregularities in stream temperature, at data-poor sites. The method extrapolates thermal attributes from highly resolved temperature data at a reference site to the data-poor sites on the assumption of spatial autocorrelation. We first quantified the thermal attributes of a glacier-fed stream in the Swiss Alps using 2 years of hourly recorded temperature. Our approach decomposed stream temperature into its average temperature of 3.8°C, a diel periodicity of 4.9°C, seasonal periodicity spanning 7.5°C, and the remaining irregularity (variance) with an average of 0.0°C but spanning 9.7°C. These attributes were used to estimate thermal characteristics at upstream sites where temperatures were measured monthly, and we found that a diel periodicity and the variance strongly contributed to the variability at the sites. We evaluated the performance of our predictive mechanism and found that our approach can reasonably estimate periodic components and extremes. We could also estimate the variability in irregularity, which cannot be represented by other techniques that assume a linear relationship in temperature variabilities between sites. The results confirm that spatially extrapolating thermal attributes based on Fourier analysis can predict thermal characteristics at a data-poor site. The R scripts used in this study are available in the Supplement.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120167",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-20-3411-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120167","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Technical note: Fourier approach for estimating the thermal attributes of streams",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T12:07:02Z",,"pub:182220",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654af8931012320",,,"84984788031","000383801000001","Hydrol.

However, also non-genetic maternal effects can contribute to phenotypic variation, thus being an alternative target for natural selection. We investigated the role of individuals’ genetic background and maternal effects in determining immune defense traits (phenoloxidase and antibacterial activity of hemolymph), as well as in survival and growth, in the simultaneously hermaphroditic snail Lymnaea stagnalis. We utilized the mixed mating system of this species by producing full-sib families in which each parental snail had produced offspring as both a dam and as a sire, and tested whether genetic background (family) and non-genetic maternal effects (dam nested within family) explain trait variation. Immune defense traits and growth were affected solely by individuals’ genetic background. Survival of snails did not show family-level variation. Additionally, some snails were produced through self-fertilization. They showed reduced growth and survival suggesting recessive load or overdominance. Immune defense traits did not respond to inbreeding. Our results suggest that the variation in snail immune function and growth was due to genetic differences. Since immune traits did not respond to inbreeding, this variation is most likely due to additive or epistatic genetic variance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120004",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0161584","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120004","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Estimating Genetic and Maternal Effects Determining Variation in Immune Function of a Mixed-Mating Snail",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T11:55:59Z",,"pub:182053",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654ac4035423829","000037526",,"84984781487","000381768800053","PLoS ONE","8","PLoS ONE","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Sex chromosomes (especially the non-recombining and repeat-dense Y, W, U, and V) are notoriously difficult to sequence. Strategies have been developed to obtain partially assembled sex chromosome sequences. Most of them remain difficult to apply to numerous non-model organisms, either because they require a reference genome, or because they are designed for evolutionarily old systems. Sequencing a cross (parents and progeny) by RNA-seq to study the segregation of alleles and infer sex-linked genes is a cost-efficient strategy, which also provides expression level estimates. However, the lack of a proper statistical framework has limited a broader application of this approach. Tests on empirical Silene data show that our method identifies 20–35% more sex-linked genes than existing pipelines, while making reliable inferences for downstream analyses. Approximately 12 individuals are needed for optimal results based on simulations. For species with an unknown sex-determination system, the method can assess the presence and type (XY vs. ZW) of sex chromosomes through a model comparison strategy. The method is particularly well optimized for sex chromosomes of young or intermediate age, which are expected in thousands of yet unstudied lineages. Any organisms, including non-model ones for which nothing is known a priori, that can be bred in the lab, are suitable for our method.

Depending on the time and mode of introduction, each regional outbreak can have its own epidemic dynamics. The migration and phylodynamic processes are often intertwined and need to be taken into account when analyzing temporally and spatially structured virus data. In this article, we present a fully probabilistic approach for the joint reconstruction of phylodynamic history in structured populations (such as geographic structure) based on a multitype birth–death process. This approach can be used to quantify the spread of a pathogen in a structured population. Changes in epidemic dynamics through time within subpopulations are incorporated through piecewise constant changes in transmission parameters.  We analyze a global human influenza H3N2 virus data set from a geographically structured host population to demonstrate how seasonal dynamics can be inferred simultaneously with the phylogeny and migration process. Our results suggest that the main migration path among the northern, tropical, and southern region represented in the sample analyzed here is the one leading from the tropics to the northern region. Furthermore, the time-dependent transmission dynamics between and within two HIV risk groups, heterosexuals and injecting drug users, in the Latvian HIV epidemic are investigated. Our analyses confirm that the Latvian HIV epidemic peaking around 2001 was mainly driven by the injecting drug user risk group.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000119183",,"0737-4038||1537-1719",,"10.1093/molbev/msw064","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/119183","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Phylogeography||Bayesian inference||Infectious diseases||Birth-death model||Biogeography||Epidemiology","Phylodynamics with Migration: A Computational Framework to Quantify Population Structure from Genomic Data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T10:28:50Z",,"pub:181184",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936549be18f583054","000025306",,"84982993520","000380105900017","Mol Biol Evol","8","Molecular Biology and Evolution","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02060 - Dep.

The reported numbers are somewhat apocalyptic, as they are based on crude projections of current trends and presume the failure of anti-malarial drugs and antiretroviral therapy as well as antibiotics. Nor do they account for the possible entry of new drugs onto the market. There is huge uncertainty associated with the human burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in general and antibiotic resistance in particular (for the purpose of this article the widely used term antimicrobial resistance [AMR] is retained, though the emphasis here is on antibiotic resistance). The precision of the estimates does not really matter much: the point is that the problem is already immense and is growing rapidly. We have been squandering our antibiotic resources for far too long and immediate action is needed on a very large scale if we are to reverse current trends.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000119576",,"0035-9203",,"10.1093/trstmh/trw048","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/119576","en","Oxford University Press","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Antibiotics||Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)||Environment||Health||Livestock||One Health","Antibiotic resistance is the quintessential One Health issue",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T11:06:25Z",,"pub:181595",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654a3ec27c72481","004719497",,,"000381194900001","Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg","7","Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene","110","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot and home to some of the world’s most sought after tropical timber species. Malagasy rosewoods belong to the genus Dalbergia (Fabaceae), which is highly diverse and has a pantropical distribution, but these timber species are among the most threatened as a consequence of intensive illegal selective logging and deforestation. Reliable identification of Dalbergia species from Madagascar is important for law enforcement but is almost impossible without fertile plant material, which is often unavailable during forest inventories or when attempting to identify logged trees of cut wood. DNA barcoding has been promoted as a promising tool for species identification in such cases. In this study we tested whether DNA barcoding with partial sequences of three plastid markers (matK, rbcL and trnL (UAA)) can distinguish between Dalbergia from Madagascar and from other areas of its distributional range, and whether Malagasy species can be distinguished from one another. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the Malagasy Dalbergia species studied form two monophyletic groups, each containing two subgroups, only one of which corresponds to a single species. We characterized diagnostic polymorphisms in the three DNA barcoding markers that allow rapid discrimination between Dalbergia from Madagascar and from other areas of its distribution range. Species identification success based on individual barcoding markers or combinations was poor, whereas subgroup identification success was much higher (up to 98%), revealing both the value and limitations of a DNA barcoding approach for the identification of closely related Malagasy rosewoods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000118068",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0157881","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/118068","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"DNA barcoding of Malagasy rosewoods: Towards a molecular identification of CITES-listed dalbergia species",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T08:39:16Z",,"pub:180008",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654858c9d712897","006206116",,"84977138122","000378865200027","PLoS ONE","6","PLoS ONE","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, there is limited understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms that confer such impressive plasticity. Here, we use high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to compare the transcriptomes and metabolomes of D. melanogaster acclimated as adults to warm (rearing) (21.5 °C) or cold conditions (6 °C). Cold acclimation improved cold tolerance and led to extensive biological reorganization: almost one third of the transcriptome and nearly half of the metabolome were differentially regulated. There was overlap in the metabolic pathways identified via transcriptomics and metabolomics, with proline and glutathione metabolism being the most strongly-supported metabolic pathways associated with increased cold tolerance. We discuss several new targets in the study of insect cold tolerance (e.g. dopamine signaling and Na+-driven transport), but many previously identified candidate genes and pathways (e.g. heat shock proteins, Ca2+ signaling, and ROS detoxification) were also identified in the present study, and our results are thus consistent with and extend the current understanding of the mechanisms of insect chilling tolerance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000118081",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/srep28999","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/118081","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","RNA||Animal physiology||Metabolomics","Cold acclimation wholly reorganizes the Drosophila melanogaster transcriptome and metabolome",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T08:39:16Z",,"pub:180021",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365485cfb6934140","006751867",,"84977106943","000378798900001","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we employ de novo transcriptome analysis to identify genes with primary functions related to female odour reception, digestion, and male sexual traits in the New Zealand common stick insect Clitarchus hookeri (White). The female olfactory gene repertoire revealed ten odorant binding proteins with three recently duplicated, 12 chemosensory proteins, 16 odorant receptors, and 17 ionotropic receptors. The majority of these olfactory genes were over-expressed in female antennae and have the inferred function of odorant reception. Others that were predominantly expressed in male terminalia (n = 3) and female midgut (n = 1) suggest they have a role in sexual reproduction and digestion, respectively. Over-represented transcripts in the midgut were enriched with digestive enzyme gene families. Clitarchus hookeri is likely to harbour nine members of an endogenous cellulase family (glycoside hydrolase family 9), two of which appear to be specific to the C. hookeri lineage. All of these cellulase sequences fall into four main phasmid clades and show gene duplication events occurred early in the diversification of Phasmatodea. In addition, C. hookeri genome is likely to express γ-proteobacteria pectinase transcripts that have recently been shown to be the result of horizontal transfer. We also predicted 711 male terminalia-enriched transcripts that are candidate accessory gland proteins, 28 of which were annotated to have molecular functions of peptidase activity and peptidase inhibitor activity, two groups being widely reported to regulate female reproduction through proteolytic cascades. Our study has yielded new insights into the genetic basis of odour detection, nutrient digestion, and male sexual traits in stick insects. The C. hookeri reference transcriptome, together with identified gene families, provides a comprehensive resource for studying the evolution of sensory perception, digestive systems, and reproductive success in phasmids.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000118133",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0157783","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/118133","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"De Novo Transcriptome Analysis of the Common New Zealand Stick Insect Clitarchus hookeri (Phasmatodea) Reveals Genes Involved in Olfaction, Digestion and Sexual Reproduction",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T08:49:16Z",,"pub:180075",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365486efeab77821","006206116",,"84976583532","000378389200042","PLoS ONE","6","PLoS ONE","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We hypothesized that an obligate and mutual exchange of metabolites, as is very common among bacterial cells, could stabilize different genotypes within microbial communities. To test this, we developed a cellular automaton to model interactions among six empirically characterized genotypes that differ in their ability and propensity to produce amino acids. By systematically varying intrinsic (i.e. benefit-to-cost ratio) and extrinsic parameters (i.e. metabolite diffusion level, environmental amino acid availability), we show that obligate cross-feeding of essential metabolites is selected for under a broad range of conditions. In spatially structured environments, positive assortment among cross-feeders resulted in the formation of cooperative clusters, which limited exploitation by non-producing auxotrophs, yet allowed them to persist at the clusters’ periphery. Strikingly, cross-feeding helped to maintain genotypic diversity within populations, while amino acid supplementation to the environment decoupled obligate interactions and favored auxotrophic cells that saved amino acid production costs over metabolically autonomous prototrophs. Together, our results suggest that spatially structured environments and limited nutrient availabilities should facilitate the evolution of metabolic interactions, which can help to maintain genotypic diversity within natural microbial populations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117248",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004986","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117248","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Pervasive Selection for Cooperative Cross-Feeding in Bacterial Communities",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T07:22:15Z",,"pub:179149",,"no",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654751039417595","005410277",,,"000379349700054","PLOS comput. biol.","6","PLoS Computational Biology","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To overcome this limitation, we adopted a time-efficient flow-cytometric (FCM) counting method involving cell detachment and separation from matrix particles by centrifugation in tubes receiving sample suspensions and Histodenz® solution. We used this approach to assess bacterial abundances in diverse soils (natural and agricultural), sediments (streams and lakes) and sludge from sand-filters in a drinking water treatment plant and compared the results to bacterial abundances determined by two established methods, epifluorescence microscopy (EM) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification. Cell abundances determined by FCM and EM correlated fairly well, although absolute cell abundances were generally lower when determined by FCM. FCM also showed significant relations with cell counts converted from ATP concentrations, although estimates derived from ATP determinations were typically higher, indicating the presence of ATP sources other than bacteria. Soil and sediment organic matter (OM) content influenced the goodness of fit between counts obtained with EM and FCM. In particular, bacterial abundance determined by FCM in samples containing less than 10% OM, such as stream sediment, was particularly well correlated with the cell counts assessed by EM. Overall, these results suggest that FCM following cell detachment and purification is a useful approach to increase sample throughput for determining bacterial abundances in soils, sediments and sludge. However, notable scatter and only partial concordance among the FCM and reference methods suggests that protocols require further improvement for assessments requiring high precision, especially when OM contents in samples are high.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117610",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2016.00903","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117610","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Flow cytometry||Epifluorescence microscopy||ATP||Bacterial abundance||Sediment||Soil||Drinking water treatment plant sand-filters","Flow Cytometric Assessment of Bacterial Abundance in Soils, Sediments and Sludge",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T07:52:57Z",,"pub:179525",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936547c4f02f13517","010181524",,"84980043567","000377656500001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Understanding how biological communities respond to multiple drivers of human‐induced environmental change is fundamental for conserving ecosystems and remediating degraded habitats. Here, we used a replicated ‘real‐world experiment’ to study the responses of invertebrate communities to wastewater perturbations across a land‐use intensity gradient in 12 Swiss streams. We used different taxonomy and trait‐based community descriptors to establish the most sensitive indicators detecting impacts and to help elucidate potential causal mechanisms of change. First, we predicted that streams in catchments adversely impacted by human land‐uses would be less impaired by wastewater inputs because their invertebrate communities should be dominated by pollution‐tolerant taxa (‘environmental context’). Second, we predicted that the negative effects of wastewater on stream invertebrate communities should be larger in streams that receive proportionally more wastewater (‘magnitude of disturbance’). In support of the ‘environmental context’ hypothesis, we found that change in the Saprobic Index (a trait‐based indicator of tolerance to organic pollution) was associated with upstream community composition; communities in catchments with intensive agricultural land uses (e.g., arable cropping and pasture) were generally more resistant to eutrophication associated with wastewater inputs. We also found support for the ‘magnitude of disturbance’ hypothesis. The SPEAR Index (a trait‐based indicator of sensitivity to pesticides) was more sensitive to the relative input of effluent, suggesting that toxic influences of wastewater scale with dilution. Whilst freshwater pollution continues to be a major environmental problem, our findings highlight that the same anthropogenic pressure (i.e., inputs of wastewater) may induce different ecological responses depending on the environmental context and community metrics used. Thus, remediation strategies aiming to improve stream ecological status (e.g., rehabilitating degraded reaches) need to consider upstream anthropogenic influences and the most appropriate indicators of restoration success.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117095",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.2165","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117095","en","John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Land use||Macroinvertebrates||Multiple stressors||Pollution||Resistance||Sensitivity","Environmental context and magnitude of disturbance influence trait-mediated community responses to wastewater in streams",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T07:02:10Z",,"pub:178993",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654721cf4284169","007041168",,"84969949605","000379342900007","Ecol Evol","12","Ecology and Evolution","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In land birds, ketocarotenoids such as astaxanthin are usually metabolically derived via ketolation of dietary yellow carotenoids [9, 10]. However, the molecular basis of this gene-environment mechanism has remained obscure. Here we use the yellowbeak mutation in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) to investigate the genetic basis of red coloration. Wild-type ketocarotenoids were absent in the beak and tarsus of yellowbeak birds. The yellowbeak mutation mapped to chromosome 8, close to a cluster of cytochrome P450 loci (CYP2J2-like) that are candidates for carotenoid ketolases. The wild-type zebra finch genome was found to have three intact genes in this cluster: CYP2J19A, CYP2J19B, and CYP2J40. In yellowbeak, there are multiple mutations: loss of a complete CYP2J19 gene, a modified remaining CYP2J19 gene (CYP2J19(yb)), and a non-synonymous SNP in CYP2J40. In wild-type birds, CYP2J19 loci are expressed in ketocarotenoid-containing tissues: CYP2J19A only in the retina and CYP2J19B in the beak and tarsus and to a variable extent in the retina. In contrast, expression of CYP2J19(yb) is barely detectable in the beak of yellowbeak birds. CYP2J40 has broad tissue expression and shows no differences between wild-type and yellowbeak. Our results indicate that CYP2J19 genes are strong candidates for the carotenoid ketolase and imply that ketolation occurs in the integument in zebra finches. Since cytochrome P450 enzymes include key detoxification enzymes, our results raise the intriguing possibility that red coloration may be an honest signal of detoxification ability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000214194",,"0960-9822||1879-0445",,"10.1016/j.cub.2016.04.047","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/214194","en","Cell Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Red Carotenoid Coloration in the Zebra Finch Is Controlled by a Cytochrome P450 Gene Cluster",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-11-27T15:32:57Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Curr Biol","11","Current Biology","26","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The analysis of triclosan resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates had previously shown that in about half of the strains, the mechanism of triclosan resistance consists on the heterologous duplication of the triclosan target gene due to the acquisition of an additional fabI allele derived from Staphylococcus haemolyticus (sh-fabI). In the current work, the genomic sequencing of 10 of these strains allowed the characterization of two novel composite transposons TnSha1 and TnSha2 involved in the spread of sh-fabI. TnSha1 harbors one copy of IS1272, whereas TnSha2 is a 11.7 kb plasmid carrying TnSha1 present either as plasmid or in an integrated form generally flanked by two IS1272 elements. The target and mechanism of integration for IS1272 and TnSha1 are novel and include targeting of DNA secondary structures, generation of blunt-end deletions of the stem-loop and absence of target duplication. Database analyses showed widespread occurrence of these two elements in chromosomes and plasmids, with TnSha1 mainly in S. aureus and with TnSha2 mainly in S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis. The acquisition of resistance by means of an insertion sequence-based mobilization and consequent duplication of drug-target metabolic genes, as observed here for sh-fabI, is highly reminiscent of the situation with the ileS2 gene conferring mupirocin resistance, and the dfrA and dfrG genes conferring trimethoprim resistance both of which are mobilized by IS257. These three examples, which show similar mechanisms and levels of spread of metabolic genes linked to IS elements, highlight the importance of this genetic strategy for recruitment and rapid distribution of novel resistance mechanisms in staphylococci.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000473466",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2016.01008","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473466","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Insertion sequence||Transposon||Antimicrobial drug resistance||Metabolism||Resistance risk||FabI||IS5 family||IS1182 family","Dissemination of Novel Antimicrobial Resistance Mechanisms through the Insertion Sequence Mediated Spread of Metabolic Genes",,"Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-03-08T15:50:38Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,"35435295","2-s2.0-84980332305",,"Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This may have important implications for ecosystem services and conservation of biodiversity. We investigated whether two ecologically important cryptic species of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus fossarum (types A and B) are associated with different habitats. We collected data on their occurrence at both the landscape scale (large watersheds) and at the local scale (river reach) to compare macro‐ and microscale environmental parameters associated with their presence. Analysis of the landscape scale data showed that occurrence of types A and B differ with respect to watershed and river size and, interestingly, human impact on river ecomorphology. Whereas type B was mainly found in less forested areas with higher human impact, type A showed the opposite occurrence pattern. Analyses of the local scale data suggested that habitats occupied by type A were characterized by larger gravel, larger stones and less macrophytes than habitats occupied by type B. The landscape and local data set showed contradicting patterns with regard to stream size. Overall, the observed differences between the two types of G. fossarum most likely reflect ecological differences between them, but alternative explanations (e.g., historical colonization processes) cannot be completely ruled out. Our study underlines that common cryptic species can differ in their ecology and response to anthropogenic influence. Such differences in habitat requirements among difficult‐to‐identify taxa present a challenge for biodiversity and ecosystem management. Our results emphasize the importance of conservative and precautionary approaches in maintenance of habitat diversity and environmental heterogeneity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117330",,"2150-8925",,"10.1002/ecs2.1319","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117330","en","ESA","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Cryptic species||Ecological niche||Environmental correlates||Gammarus fossarum","Habitat requirements and ecological niche of two cryptic amphipod species at landscape and local scales",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T07:33:20Z",,"pub:179232",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365476d94aa57666","006204548",,"84971659474","000377215200028",,"5","Ecosphere","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Understanding dynamics and drivers of resistance spread can provide an improved rationale for antibiotic management. In our study, we first used antibiotic resistance surveillance data to estimate the rates at which antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae spread in two host populations, heterosexual men (HetM) and men who have sex with men (MSM). We found higher rates of spread for MSM (0.86 to 2.38 y−1, mean doubling time: 6 months) compared to HetM (0.24 to 0.86 y−1, mean doubling time: 16 months). We then developed a dynamic transmission model to reproduce the observed dynamics of N. gonorrhoeae transmission in populations of heterosexual men and women (HMW) and MSM. We parameterized the model using sexual behavior data and calibrated it to N. gonorrhoeae prevalence and incidence data. In the model, antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae spread with a median rate of 0.88 y−1 in HMW and 3.12 y−1 in MSM. These rates correspond to median doubling times of 9 (HMW) and 3 (MSM) months. Assuming no fitness costs, the model shows the difference in the host population’s treatment rate rather than the difference in the number of sexual partners explains the differential spread of resistance. As higher treatment rates result in faster spread of antibiotic resistance, treatment recommendations for N. gonorrhoeae should carefully balance prevention of infection and avoidance of resistance spread.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000121060",,"1553-7374||1553-7366",,"10.1371/journal.ppat.1005611","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/121060","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Antibiotic-Resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae Spread Faster with More Treatment, Not More Sexual Partners",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T13:27:28Z",,"pub:183144",,"yes",,,,"The population biology of drug resistance: Key principles for a more sustainable use of drugs","268540","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,"imp593654bf7cebb55250","005409548",,"84973320242",,"PLoS Pathog","5","PLoS Pathogens","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

By constructing sequence similarity networks from uncultured environmental samples, we show that microbial gene pool distributions are not influenced nearly as much by geography as ecology, thus extending the Bass Becking hypothesis from whole organisms to microbial genes. We find that gene pools are shaped by their broad ecological niche (such as sea water, fresh water, host, and airborne). We find that freshwater habitats act as a gene exchange bridge between otherwise disconnected habitats. Finally, certain antibiotic resistance genes deviate from the general trend of habitat specificity by exhibiting a high degree of cross-habitat mobility. The strong cross-habitat mobility of antibiotic resistance genes is a cause for concern and provides a paradigmatic example of the rate by which genes colonize new habitats when new selective forces emerge.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000125387",,"1759-6653",,"10.1093/gbe/evw077","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/125387","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","biogeography||horizontal gene transfer||antibiotic resistance","Every gene is everywhere but the environment selects: Global geo-localization of gene sharing in environmental samples through network analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T18:04:26Z",,"pub:187987",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936550f4701786935","010180519",,"85015598926",,"Genome Biol Evol","5","Genome Biology and Evolution","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we address this problem by using experimental evolution to study bacterial innovation in real time. We allowed 380 populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to adapt to 95 different carbon sources that challenged bacteria with either evolving novel metabolic traits or optimizing existing traits. Whole genome sequencing of more than 80 clones revealed profound differences in the genetic basis of innovation and optimization. Innovation was associated with the rapid acquisition of mutations in genes involved in transcription and metabolism. Mutations in pre-existing duplicate genes in the P. aeruginosa genome were common during innovation, but not optimization. These duplicate genes may have been acquired by P. aeruginosa due to either spontaneous gene amplification or horizontal gene transfer. High throughput phenotype assays revealed that novelty was associated with increased pleiotropic costs that are likely to constrain innovation. However, mutations in duplicate genes with close homologs in the P. aeruginosa genome were associated with low pleiotropic costs compared to mutations in duplicate genes with distant homologs in the P. aeruginosa genome, suggesting that functional redundancy between duplicates facilitates innovation by buffering pleiotropic costs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000469301",,"1553-7390||1553-7404",,"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006005","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/469301","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The Genomic Basis of Evolutionary Innovation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-02-12T15:07:56Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"PLoS Genet","5","PLoS Genetics","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

During such conflicts, breeders might use aggressive behavior to enforce contributions of helpers to offspring care, especially if helpers are not related to the breeders and their offspring and thus do not stand to gain indirect fitness benefits by helping. Using a combination of behavioral and genetic data, we investigated in the cooperatively breeding El Oro parakeet Pyrrhura orcesi (i) whether breeders are commonly dominant over helpers, (ii) whether they use aggressive behavior toward helpers to enforce offspring provisioning, and (iii) whether the relatedness of helpers to the nestlings affects the frequency of—or the reaction of helpers to—such aggressions. Even though breeders were generally dominant over helpers, we found no evidence for the enforcement of alloparental care. This finding was independent of the relatedness between helpers and nestlings, even though distantly related helpers overall contributed little to offspring care. We suggest that the inability of breeders to properly assess the work rates of their helpers at least partly explains the absence of enforcement. More generally, our results add to a body of evidence suggesting that enforcement might be an exceptional rather than a general mechanism underlying the expression of alloparental care in cooperatively breeding species.",,,,"0179-1613||1439-0310",,"10.1111/eth.12486","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551333","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,,"pay-to-stay||punishment||sanction||fitness benefits of helping||Cooperative breeding","No Evidence for Enforced Alloparental Care in a Cooperatively Breeding Parrot",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-06-08T10:52:08Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,"84959533582","000373906100004","Ethology","5","Ethology","122","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the relationship between these two theories has been plagued by controversy for almost half a century and debates about their relevance and usefulness in explaining social evolution seem to rekindle at regular intervals. Here, we first provide a concise introduction into the kin selection and multilevel selection theories and shed light onto the roots of the controversy surrounding them. We then review two major aspects of the current debate: the presumed formal equivalency of the two theories and the question whether group selection can lead to group adaptation. We conclude by arguing that the two theories can offer complementary approaches to the study of social evolution: kin selection approaches usually focus on the identification of optimal phenotypes and thus on the endresult of a selection process, whereas multilevel selection approaches focus on the ongoing selection process itself. The two theories thus provide different perspectives that might be fruitfully combined to promote our understanding of the evolution in group-structured populations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000551356",,"2046-1402",,"10.12688/f1000research.8018.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551356","en","F1000 Research Ltd","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","cooperation||altruism||sociobiology||group selection||levels of selection||inclusive fitness","Kin and multilevel selection in social evolution: a never-ending controversy?",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2022-06-08T11:11:10Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85010908761",,,,"F1000Research","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Data from multiple taxa indicate that they are more likely to be infected with parasites, and are less “tolerant,” or less able to mitigate the fitness costs of a given infection, than females. One cost of infection for many animals is an increased probability of being captured by a predator. A clear, hitherto untested, prediction is therefore that this parasite‐induced vulnerability to predation is more pronounced among males than females. We tested this prediction in the sexually size dimorphic guppy, Poecilia reticulata, in which females are typically larger than males. We either sham or experimentally infected guppies with Gyrodactylus turnbulli, elicited their escape response using an established protocol and measured the distance they covered during 60 ms. To discriminate between the effects of body size and those of other inherent sex differences, we size‐matched fish across treatment groups. Infection with G. turnbulli reduced the distance covered during the escape response of small adults by 20.1%, whereas that of large fish was unaffected. This result implies that parasite‐induced vulnerability to predation is male‐biased in the wild: although there was no difference in escape response between our experimentally size‐matched groups of males and females, males are significantly smaller across natural guppy populations. These results are consistent with Bateman's principle for immunity: Natural selection for larger body sizes and longevity in females seems to have resulted in the evolution of increased infection tolerance. We discuss the potential implications of sex‐ and size‐biased parasite‐induced vulnerability to predation for the evolutionary ecology of this host–parasite interaction in natural communities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-a-010817233",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.2049","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114529","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Poecilia reticulata||Bateman's principle for immunity||HOST-PARASITE INTERACTION (PARASITOLOGY)||Gyrodactylus||Infection tolerance||MONOGENEA (ZOOLOGY)||POECILIDAE (ZOOLOGY)||GENDER DIFFERENCES CONCERNING HEALTH AND HYGIENE||MONOGENEA (ZOOLOGIE)||IMMUNITY (IMMUNOLOGY)||Sex-biased parasitism||POECILIDAE (ZOOLOGIE)||GESCHLECHTSSPEZIFISCHE UNTERSCHIEDE BETREFFEND HYGIENE UND GESUNDHEIT||WIRT-PARASIT BEZIEHUNG (PARASITOLOGIE)||Parasite-induced vulnerability to predation||IMMUNITÄT (IMMUNOLOGIE)","A further cost for the sicker sex?

One of the most promising is the employment of bacteriophages (phages), which may be highly specific and evolve to counter antiphage resistance. Despite an increased understanding of how phages interact with bacteria, we know very little about how their interactions may be modified in antibiotic environments and, reciprocally, how phage may affect the evolution of antibiotic resistance. We experimentally evaluated the impacts of single and combined applications of antibiotics (different doses and different types) and phages on in vitro evolving populations of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We also assessed the effects of past treatments on bacterial virulence in vivo, employing larvae of Galleria mellonella to survey the treatment consequences for the pathogen. We find a strong synergistic effect of combining antibiotics and phages on bacterial population density and in limiting their recovery rate. Our long‐term study establishes that antibiotic dose is important, but that effects are relatively insensitive to antibiotic type. From an applied perspective, our results indicate that phages can contribute to managing antibiotic resistance levels, with limited consequences for the evolution of bacterial virulence.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000123010",,"1752-4571||1752-4563",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/123010","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","antibiotics||bacteriophage||combination therapies||evolution||Pseudomonas aeruginosa||resistance||virulence","Long-term effects of single and combined introductions of antibiotics and bacteriophages on populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T16:30:48Z",,"pub:185351",,"no",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654e52933313732",,,,,"Evol.

The presence of cryptic species poses significant challenges for the accurate assessment of biodiversity and, if unrecognized, may lead to erroneous inferences in many fields of biological research and conservation.  Results We tested for cryptic genetic variation within the broadly distributed alpine mayfly Baetis alpinus across several major European drainages in the central Alps. Bayesian clustering and multivariate analyses of nuclear microsatellite loci, combined with phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA, were used to assess population genetic structure and diversity. We identified two genetically highly differentiated lineages (A and B) that had no obvious differences in regional distribution patterns, and occurred in local sympatry. Furthermore, the two lineages differed in relative abundance, overall levels of genetic diversity as well as patterns of population structure: lineage A was abundant, widely distributed and had a higher level of genetic variation, whereas lineage B was less abundant, more prevalent in spring-fed tributaries than glacier-fed streams and restricted to high elevations. Subsequent morphological analyses revealed that traits previously acknowledged as intraspecific variation of B. alpinus in fact segregated these two lineages.  Conclusions Taken together, our findings indicate that even common and apparently ecologically well-studied species may consist of reproductively isolated units, with distinct evolutionary histories and likely different ecology and evolutionary potential. These findings emphasize the need to investigate hidden diversity even in well-known species to allow for appropriate assessment of biological diversity and conservation measures.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000115836",,"1471-2148",,"10.1186/s12862-016-0643-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/115836","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Alpine biodiversity||Cryptic species||Nuclear microsatellites||Mitochondrial DNA||Sympatry","Distribution and population genetic variation of cryptic species of the Alpine mayfly Baetis alpinus (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae) in the Central Alps",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T05:15:17Z",,"pub:177673",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936545ad054950163",,,"84964982854","000374128700002","BMC evol. biol.",,"BMC Evolutionary Biology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We addressed this question using a two-step evolution experiment. First, replicate populations of Escherichia coli were propagated in four different environmental conditions for 1000 generations. Then, all replicate populations were transferred and propagated for further 1000 generations to a single new environment.  Results Using this two-step experimental evolution strategy, we investigated, at both the phenotypic and genomic levels, whether and how adaptation in the initial historical environments impacted evolutionary trajectories in a new environment. We showed that both the growth rate and fitness of the evolved populations obtained after the second step of evolution were contingent upon past evolutionary history. In contrast however, the genes that were modified during the second step of evolution were independent from the previous history of the populations.  Conclusions Our work suggests that historical contingency affects phenotypic adaptation to a new environment.

We seek to explore possible causes why MDR-TB has been found to occur much more often in patients with a history of previous treatment. We develop a mathematical model of the replication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within a patient reflecting the compartments of macrophages, granulomas, and open cavities as well as parameterizing the effects of drugs on the pathogen dynamics in these compartments. We use this model to study the influence of patient adherence to therapy and of common retreatment regimens on treatment outcome. As expected, the simulations show that treatment success increases with increasing adherence. However, treatment occasionally fails even under perfect adherence due to interpatient variability in pharmacological parameters. The risk of generating MDR de novo is highest between 40% and 80% adherence. Importantly, our simulations highlight the double-edged effect of retreatment: On the one hand, the recommended retreatment regimen increases the overall success rate compared to re-treating with the initial regimen. On the other hand, it increases the probability to accumulate more resistant genotypes. We conclude that treatment adherence is a key factor for a positive outcome, and that screening for resistant strains is advisable after treatment failure or relapse.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000114928",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004749","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114928","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The Role of Adherence and Retreatment in De Novo Emergence of MDR-TB",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T03:59:11Z",,"pub:176737",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365449415a520283","001888782",,"84962088901","000376583800048","PLOS comput. biol.","3","PLoS Computational Biology","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Juxtaposition of wild-type and aberrantly specified cells induces enrichment of actomyosin at their entire shared interface, both at adherens junctions as well as along basolateral interfaces. Experimental validation of 3D vertex model simulations demonstrates that enhanced interface contractility is sufficient to explain many morphogenetic behaviors, which depend on cell cluster size. These range from cyst formation by intermediate-sized clusters to segregation of large cell populations by formation of smooth boundaries or apical constriction in small groups of cells. In addition, we find that single cells experiencing lateral interface contractility are eliminated from tissues by apoptosis. Cysts, which disrupt epithelial continuity, form when elimination of single, aberrantly specified cells fails and cells proliferate to intermediate cell cluster sizes. Thus, increased interface contractility functions as error correction mechanism eliminating single aberrant cells from tissues, but failure leads to the formation of large, potentially disease-promoting cysts. Our results provide a novel perspective on morphogenetic mechanisms, which arise from cell-fate heterogeneities within tissues and maintain or disrupt epithelial homeostasis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000231533",,"0960-9822||1879-0445",,"10.1016/j.cub.2015.12.063","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/231533","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","epithelium||actomyosin contractility||epithelial cyst||cell elimination||tissue patterning||physical modeling||Continuum mechanics||vertex model","Interface Contractility between Differently Fated Cells Drives Cell Elimination and Cyst Formation.",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-19T13:14:12Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Curr Biol","5","Current Biology","26","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It also reverts mutations associated with epitopes targeted in the transmitting host but not in the new host. Moreover, escape mutations are often associated with additional compensatory mutations that partially recover fitness costs. It is unclear whether recombination expedites this process of multi-locus adaptation. To elucidate the role of recombination, we constructed a detailed population dynamics model that integrates viral dynamics, host immune response at multiple epitopes through cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and viral evolution driven by mutation, recombination, and selection. Using this model, we compute the expected waiting time until the emergence of the strain that has gained escape and compensatory mutations against the new host's immune response, and reverted these mutations at epitopes no longer targeted. We find that depending on the underlying fitness landscape, shaped by both costs and benefits of mutations, adaptation proceeds via distinct dominant pathways with different effects of recombination, in particular distinguishing escape and reversion. When adaptation at a single epitope is involved, recombination can substantially accelerate immune escape but minimally affects reversion. When multiple epitopes are involved, recombination can accelerate or inhibit adaptation depending on the fitness landscape. Specifically, recombination tends to delay adaptation when a purely uphill fitness landscape is accessible at each epitope, and accelerate it when a fitness valley is associated with each epitope. Our study points to the importance of recombination in shaping the adaptation of HIV-1 following its transmission to new hosts, a process central to T cell-based vaccine strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000109198",,"1878-0067||1755-4365",,"10.1016/j.epidem.2015.09.001","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/109198","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Cytotoxic T lymphocytes||Fitness landscape||Immune escape||Multi-locus adaptation||Waiting time||Fitness landscape","Influence of recombination on acquisition and reversion of immune escape and compensatory mutations in HIV-1",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T22:21:08Z",,"pub:170252",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653ddb2de125770","010242500",,"84949681075","000371176500002",,,"Epidemics","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We also examined 610 isolates of Enterococcus (from 10 countries, 1987 to 2010) for the presence of this and other known CTn-tet(M) elements due to the scarcity of data about Tn5801 among enterococci. Genome location (by ICeu-I–pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] hybridization/integration site identification), conjugation and fitness (by standard methods), Tn5801 characterization (by long-PCR mapping/sequencing), and clonality (by PFGE/multilocus sequence typing [MLST]) were studied. Twenty-three Tn5801 variants (17 unpublished) clustered in two groups, designated “A” (25 kb; n = 14; predominant in Staphylococcus aureus) and “B” (20 kb; n = 9; predominant in Streptococcus agalactiae). The percent GC content of the common backbone suggests a streptococcal origin of Tn5801 group B, with further acquisition of a 5-kb fragment that resulted in group A. Deep sequence analysis allowed identification of variants associated with clonal lineages of S. aureus (clonal complex 8 [CC8], sequence type 239 [ST239]), S. agalactiae (CC17), Enterococcus faecium (ST17/ST18), or Enterococcus faecalis (ST8), local variants, or variants located in different species and geographical areas. All Tn5801 elements were chromosomally located upstream of the guaA gene, which serves as an integration hot spot. Transferability was demonstrated only for Tn5801 type B among E. faecalis clonal backgrounds, which eventually harbored another Tn5801 copy. The study documents early acquisition of Tn5801 by Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus. Clonal waves of these pathogens seem to have contributed to the geographical spread and local evolution of the transposon. Horizontal transfer, also demonstrated, could explain the variability observed, with the isolates often containing sequences of different origins.",,,,"0066-4804||1098-6596",,"10.1128/AAC.01864-15","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473465","en","American Society for Microbiology",,,,"Diversity and evolution of the Tn5801-tet(M)-like integrative and conjugative elements among Enterococcus, streptococcus, and Staphylococcus",,"Journal Article||Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-03-08T15:47:51Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,"35435296","84960154902",,"Antimicrob Agents Chemother","3","Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy","60","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the influence of these traits on host evolution when parasites are no longer present is unclear. We used experimental evolution and whole-genome sequencing of Escherichia coli to determine the effects of past and present exposure to parasitic viruses (phages) on the spread of mutator alleles, resistance, and bacterial competitive fitness. We found that mutator alleles spread rapidly during adaptation to any of four different phage species, and this pattern was even more pronounced with multiple phages present simultaneously. However, hypermutability did not detectably accelerate adaptation in the absence of phages and recovery of fitness costs associated with resistance. Several lineages evolved phage resistance through elevated mucoidy, and during subsequent evolution in phage-free conditions they rapidly reverted to nonmucoid, phage-susceptible phenotypes. Genome sequencing revealed that this phenotypic reversion was achieved by additional genetic changes rather than by genotypic reversion of the initial resistance mutations. Insertion sequence (IS) elements played a key role in both the acquisition of resistance and adaptation in the absence of parasites; unlike single nucleotide polymorphisms, IS insertions were not more frequent in mutator lineages. Our results provide a genetic explanation for rapid reversion of mucoidy, a phenotype observed in other bacterial species including human pathogens. Moreover, this demonstrates that the types of genetic change underlying adaptation to fitness costs, and consequently the impact of evolvability mechanisms such as increased point-mutation rates, depend critically on the mechanism of resistance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000108038",,"0737-4038||1537-1719",,"10.1093/molbev/msv270","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/108038","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","experimental evolution||coevolution||mutation rate||bacteriophages","Adaptation to parasites and costs of parasite resistance in mutator and non-mutator bacteria",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T21:45:10Z",,"pub:168814",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653c742b0d39072","000025306",,"84964478549","000371219500015","Mol Biol Evol","3","Molecular Biology and Evolution","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These responses exert strong selective pressures on different parts of HIV’s genome, and select for mutations that escape recognition and are thus beneficial to the virus. Some studies reveal that the later these escape mutations emerge, the more slowly they go to fixation. This pattern of escape rate decrease(ERD) can arise by distinct mechanisms. In particular, in large populations with high beneficial mutation rates interference among different escape strains –an effect that can emerge in evolution with asexual reproduction and results in delayed fixation times of beneficial mutations compared to sexual reproduction– could significantly impact the escape rates of mutations. In this paper, we investigated how interference between these concurrent escape mutations affects their escape rates in systems with multiple epitopes, and whether it could be a source of the ERD pattern. To address these issues, we developed a multilocus Wright-Fisher model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation and recombination, serving as a null-model for interference. We also derived an interference-free null model assuming initial neutral evolution before immune response elicitation. We found that interference between several equally selectively advantageous mutations can generate the observed ERD pattern. We also found that the number of loci, as well as recombination rates substantially affect ERD. These effects can be explained by the underexponential decline of escape rates over time. Lastly, we found that the observed ERD pattern in HIV infected individuals is consistent with both independent, interference-free mutations as well as interference effects. Our results confirm that interference effects should be considered when analyzing HIV escape mutations. The challenge in estimating escape rates and mutation-associated selective coefficients posed by interference effects cannot simply be overcome by improved sampling frequencies or sizes. This problem is a consequence of the fundamental shortcomings of current estimation techniques under interference regimes. Hence, accounting for the stochastic nature of competition between mutations demands novel estimation methodologies based on the analysis of HIV strains, rather than mutation frequencies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000114030",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004721","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114030","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Investigating the Consequences of Interference between Multiple CD8+ T Cell Escape Mutations in Early HIV Infection",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T02:26:51Z",,"pub:175800",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365435a183739916","005410277",,"84959538059","000376582900002","PLOS comput. biol.","2","PLoS Computational Biology","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Different karyotypes often reflect speciation events within phylogenies as they can establish crossing barriers between species. Hence, evolution of karyotypes often is congruent with splits and differentiation of clades within phylogenies of angiosperm genera. Here we study karyotype evolution in the big cosmopolitan genus Ranunculus and in related genera to test the hypothesis that karyotypes are congruent with major clades. We investigated karyotypes on mitoses of 36 species, evaluated literature records for additional 87 species, and reconstructed ancestral states by mapping karyotypes onto a published molecular phylogenetic tree. Altogether ten karyotypes can be discriminated as character states, eight based on the base number x = 8, and two on the base number x = 7. The ancestral type within Ranunculus is characterized by four metacentric and four submetacentric/subtelocentric chromosomes, and dominates in five major basal clades of Ranunculus (R. subg. Auricomus) and in four of the related genera (Coptidium, Halerpestes, Kumlienia, and Trautvetteria). Another four karyotypes are ancestral and predominant in two major clades within Ranunculus (R. subg. Ranunculus), while three further ones occur only on terminal branches of the buttercup phylogeny. Among related genera, Ficaria and Ceratocephala also show derived karyotypes. Karyotype morphology thus supports generic and infrageneric classifications based on molecular and morphological data. Karyotype evolution drives in general to increasing number of chromosomes with asymmetric arms, and to a reduction from x = 8 to x = 7 chromosomes. A review of interspecific homoploid hybridization in sympatric species, and of crossing experiments suggests enhanced crossability of species with the same karyotype and strong crossing barriers between those with different karyotypes. We conclude that karyotype evolution is a major driver of speciation and differentiation of clades within Ranunculus.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000113789",,"1433-8319||1618-0437",,"10.1016/j.ppees.2015.11.001","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/113789","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Chromosome numbers||Hybridization||Karyotype evolution||Phylogenetic relevance||Ranunculus","Karyotype evolution supports the molecular phylogeny in the genus Ranunculus (Ranunculaceae)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T02:09:45Z",,"pub:175523",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936542f2295e51113","001976957",,"84958176343","000384272600001",,,"Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We addressed the impact of fragmentation on the genetic structure of fish populations by focusing on the European chub (Squalius cephalus). This fish species is not stocked and copes well with altered habitats, enabling an assessment of the effects of fragmentation per se. Using microsatellites, we genotyped 2133 chub from 47 sites within the catchment fragmented by 37 hydroelectric power stations, two weirs and the Rhine Falls. The shallow genetic population structure reflected drainage topology and was affected significantly by barriers to migration. The effect of power stations equipped with fishpasses on genetic differentiation was detectable, albeit weaker than that of man-made barriers without fishpasses. The Rhine Falls as the only long-standing natural obstacle (formed 14 000 to 17 000 years ago) also had a strong effect. Man-made barriers also exacerbated the upstream decrease in allelic diversity in the catchment, particularly when lacking fishpasses. Thus, existing fishpasses do have the desired effect of mitigating fragmentation, but barriers still reduce population connectivity in a fish that traverses fishpasses better than many other species. Less mobile species are likely to be affected more severely.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000109378",,"1752-4571||1752-4563",,"10.1111/eva.12339","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/109378","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Conservation||Fragmentation||Population genetics||Squalius cephalus","Fish population genetic structure shaped by hydroelectric power plants in the upper Rhine catchment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2017-06-11T22:38:26Z",,"pub:170463",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653e11f5fd28024","006994734",,"84953449473","000368841800007","Evol.

Compensatory mutations that recover the functional defects associated with resistance mutations have been argued to play a key role in overcoming the cost of resistance, but compensatory mutations are expected to be rare relative to generally beneficial mutations that increase fitness, irrespective of antibiotic resistance. Given this asymmetry, population genetics theory predicts that populations should adapt by compensatory mutations when the cost of resistance is large, whereas generally beneficial mutations should drive adaptation when the cost of resistance is small. We tested this prediction by determining the genomic mechanisms underpinning adaptation to antibiotic-free conditions in populations of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa that carry costly antibiotic resistance mutations. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that populations founded by high-cost rifampicin-resistant mutants adapted via compensatory mutations in three genes of the RNA polymerase core enzyme, whereas populations founded by low-cost mutants adapted by generally beneficial mutations, predominantly in the quorum-sensing transcriptional regulator gene lasR. Even though the importance of compensatory evolution in maintaining resistance has been widely recognized, our study shows that the roles of general adaptation in maintaining resistance should not be underestimated and highlights the need to understand how selection at other sites in the genome influences the dynamics of resistance alleles in clinical settings.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000469303",,"0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2015.2452","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/469303","en","The Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Experimental evolution||Whole-genome sequencing||Rifampicin resistance||Compensatory adaptation||General adaptation","The genomic basis of adaptation to the fitness cost of rifampicin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-02-12T15:11:11Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1822","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","283","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

M. xanthus strains isolated from a 16 × 16-cm-scale patch of soil were previously shown to have diversified into many distinct compatibility types that are distinguished by the failure of swarming colonies to merge upon encounter. We sequenced the genomes of 22 isolates from this population belonging to the two most frequently occurring multilocus sequence type (MLST) clades to trace patterns of incipient genomic divergence, specifically related to social divergence. Although homologous recombination occurs frequently within the two MLST clades, we find an almost complete absence of recombination events between them. As the two clades are very closely related and live in sympatry, either ecological or genetic barriers must reduce genetic exchange between them. We find that the rate of change in the accessory genome is greater than the rate of amino-acid substitution in the core genome. We identify a large genomic tract that consistently differs between isolates that do not freely merge and therefore is a candidate region for harbouring gene(s) responsible for self/non-self discrimination.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000115180",,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/ismej.2016.34","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/115180","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bacterial evolution||bacterial genomics||Microbial ecology||Molecular evolution","A barrier to homologous recombination between sympatric strains of the cooperative soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T04:17:33Z",,"pub:176998",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936544e8860192579","005502685",,"84962651623","000387035400011","ISME J","10","The ISME Journal","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The mutational spectrum likely includes chromosomal rearrangements responsible for gains or losses of entire genes. However, the mechanisms creating adaptive structural variation in fungal pathogen populations are poorly understood. We used complete genome assemblies to quantify structural variants segregating in the highly polymorphic fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. The genetic basis of virulence in Z. tritici is complex, and populations harbor significant genetic variation for virulence; hence, we aimed to identify whether structural variation led to functional differences. We combined single-molecule real-time sequencing, genetic maps, and transcriptomics data to generate a fully assembled and annotated genome of the highly virulent field isolate 3D7. Comparative genomics analyses against the complete reference genome IPO323 identified large chromosomal inversions and the complete gain or loss of transposable-element clusters, explaining the extensive chromosomal-length polymorphisms found in this species. Both the 3D7 and IPO323 genomes harbored long tracts of sequences exclusive to one of the two genomes. These orphan regions contained 296 genes unique to the 3D7 genome and not previously known for this species. These orphan genes tended to be organized in clusters and showed evidence of mutational decay. Moreover, the orphan genes were enriched in genes encoding putative effectors and included a gene that is one of the most upregulated putative effector genes during wheat infection. Our study showed that this pathogen species harbored extensive chromosomal structure polymorphism that may drive the evolution of virulence.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000121278",,"2150-7511||2161-2129",,"10.1128/mBio.01231-16","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/121278","en","American Society for Microbiology","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The Evolution of Orphan Regions in Genomes of a Fungal Pathogen of Wheat",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T13:54:25Z",,"pub:183372",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654c3c203228707","006164914",,"84994469211","000390132900057",,"5","mBio","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Their efficacy over evolutionary time has been largely attributed to their mechanisms of killing. Yet, the understanding of their pharmacodynamics both in vivo and in vitro is very limited. This is, however, crucial for applications of AMPs as drugs and also informs the understanding of the action of AMPs in natural immune systems. Here, we selected six different AMPs from different organisms to test their individual and combined effects in vitro. We analyzed their pharmacodynamics based on the Hill function and evaluated the interaction of combinations of two and three AMPs. Interactions of AMPs in our study were mostly synergistic, and three-AMP combinations displayed stronger synergism than two-AMP combinations. This suggests synergism to be a common phenomenon in AMP interaction. Additionally, AMPs displayed a sharp increase in killing within a narrow dose range, contrasting with those of antibiotics.

This special issue brings together some of the most interesting contributions presented at the First Island Biology Symposium hosted in Honolulu on 7–11 July 2014. We compiled a total of 18 contributions that present data from multiple archipelagos across the world and from different disciplines within the plant sciences. In this introductory paper, we first provide a short overview of Carlquist's life and work and then summarize the main findings of the collated papers. A first group of papers deals with issues to which Carlquist notably contributed: long-distance dispersal, adaptive radiation and plant reproductive biology. The findings of such studies demonstrate the extent to which the field has advanced thanks to (i) the increasing availability and richness of island data, covering many taxonomic groups and islands; (ii) new information from the geosciences, phylogenetics and palaeoecology, which allows us a more realistic understanding of the geological and biological development of islands and their biotas; and (iii) the new theoretical and methodological advances that allow us to assess patterns of abundance, diversity and distribution of island biota over large spatial scales. Most other papers in the issue cover a range of topics related to plant conservation on islands, such as causes and consequences of mutualistic disruptions (due to pollinator or disperser losses, introduction of alien predators, etc.). Island biologists are increasingly considering reintroducing ecologically important species to suitable habitats within their historic range and to neighbouring islands with depauperate communities of vertebrate seed dispersers, and an instructive example is given here. Finally, contributions on ecological networks demonstrate the usefulness of this methodological tool to advancing conservation management and better predicting the consequences of disturbances on species and interactions in the fragile insular ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000113677",,"2041-2851",,"10.1093/aobpla/plv148","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/113677","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biogeography||Island ecology and conservation||Oceanic islands||Palaeoecology||Phylogeography","Introduction to the Special Issue: Advances in island plant biology since Sherwin Carlquist's Island Biology",,"Other Journal Item","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T02:00:31Z",,"pub:175402",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936542cc11f313297","006564904",,"85010685367","000370243700001",,,"AoB Plants","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The expression of virulence factors, including capsule and melanin, is in part regulated by the cyclic-AMP/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signal transduction pathway. In this study, we investigated the influence of PKA on the composi-tion of the intracellular proteome to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the regulation that underpins virulence. Throughquantitative proteomics, enrichment and bioinformatic analyses, and an interactome study, we uncovered a pattern of PKA reg-ulation for proteins associated with translation, the proteasome, metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and virulence-relatedfunctions. PKA regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway inC. neoformansshowed a striking parallel with connectionsbetween PKA and protein degradation in chronic neurodegenerative disorders and other human diseases. Further investigationof proteasome function with the inhibitor bortezomib revealed an impact on capsule production as well as hypersusceptibilityfor strains with altered expression or activity of PKA. Parallel studies with tunicamycin also linked endoplasmic reticulum stresswith capsule production and PKA. Taken together, the data suggest a model whereby expression of PKA regulatory and catalyticsubunits and the activation of PKA influence proteostasis and the function of the endoplasmic reticulum to control the elabora-tion of the polysaccharide capsule. Overall, this study revealed both broad and conserved influences of the cAMP/PKA pathwayon the proteome and identified proteostasis as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cryptococcosis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000114318",,"2150-7511||2161-2129",,"10.1128/mBio.01862-15","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114318","en","American Society for Microbiology","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/",,"Analysis of the Protein Kinase A-Regulated Proteome of Cryptococcus neoformans Identifies a Role for the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway in Capsule Formation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T02:53:50Z",,"pub:176096",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936543c2ef9418638","006164914",,"84960146476","000373933100027",,"1","mBio","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

PCR-based diagnosis using conserved primers for X. fastidiosa strains (RST31/33) and also specific to X. fastidiaosa subsp. pauca (CVC1/272-2 int) were positive for all symptomatic tested samples (n = 8 of 9), but no template was obtained using twigs from asymptomatic trees (n = 20). Bacterial colonies were isolated from symptomatic tissues on culture medium and confirmed by PCR using the set of primers specific to X. fastidiosa subsp. pauca. Comparative sequence analyses of seven MLST loci amplified from one tripled passaged colony (MFG01) perfectly matched with sequences of alleles leuA #7, petC #6, malF#8, cysG#10, holC#11, nuoL#8, and gltT#8, the allelic profile of Sequence Type-ST16, which is represented by the strain COF0238 isolated from Coffea arabica (L.) in Brazil (http://pubmlst.org/xfastidiosa/). Phylogenetic analysis placed the ST16 into subspecies pauca, but genetically closer to ST11 and ST13, both obtained from Citrus sinensis (L.) trees with citrus variegated chlorosis. The results confirm the association of olive plants showing leaf scorching with the presence of X. fastidiosa subsp. pauca , and represent the first report of this bacterium in Brazilian olive orchards.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000126899",,"0031-9465||1593-2095",,"10.14601/Phytopathol_Mediterr-17259","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/126899","en","Mediterranean Phytopathological Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Olive dieback||bacteria||Natural infection","First report of olive leaf scorch in Brazil, associated with Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca.",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T19:06:12Z",,"pub:189692",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365527aa31439921","000008197",,,,"Phytopathol.

This in turn gives rise to colony-level phenotypes. However, empirical studies quantifying colony-level signal-response dynamics are lacking. Here, we make use of the unusual biology and experimental amenability of the queenless clonal raider ant Cerapachys biroi to jointly quantify the behavioral and physiological responses of workers to a social signal emitted by larvae. Using automated behavioral quantification and oocyte size measurements in colonies of different sizes and with different worker-to-larvae ratios, we show that the workers in a colony respond to larvae by increasing foraging activity and inhibiting ovarian activation in a progressive manner and that these responses are stronger in smaller colonies. This work adds to our knowledge of the processes that link plastic individual behavioral/physiological responses to colony-level phenotypes in social insect colonies.",,,,"0340-5443||1432-0762",,"10.1007/s00265-015-2046-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/447996","en","Springer",,,"Division of labor||Ovarian development||Automated behavioral analysis||Larvae||Social behavior||Social communication","Ant larvae regulate worker foraging behavior and ovarian activity in a dose-dependent manner",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-10-26T15:52:56Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Behav.

Ideally, morphological traits to distinguish species are robust to environmental variation. In taxonomically difficult groups of insects such as aphid parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae), wing shape quantified by geometric morphometrics is increasingly used to distinguish cryptic species that are difficult to separate with other morphological characters. However, aphid parasitoids may use multiple host species; the validity of this approach thus hinges on wing shape being a genetically hard-wired trait that is not strongly moulded by the host in which the parasitoid develops. The occurrence of asexual lines in the aphid parasitoid Lysiphlebus fabarum (Marshall) provides an opportunity to test this assumption by rearing genetically identical individuals in different environments. We reared five asexual lines of L. fabarum in four different aphid species to quantify the relative importance of these factors on parasitoid wing shape. We found that the parasitoid genotype explains a much larger proportion of the observed variation in wing shape than the host species. The host also significantly affected wing shape, but to a lesser extent, and largely via an effect on size (allometry), which can be corrected for. Our study shows that even at the level of lineages within a single species, the influence of the host environment is small relative to the genetic determination of wing shape, thus validating the use of this trait for taxonomic purposes.",,,,"0024-4082||1096-3642","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/121639||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/233126","10.1111/zoj.12490","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/234275","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,,"allometry||geometric morphometrics||phenotypic plasticity||taxonomy","Wing shape as a taxonomic trait: separating genetic variation from host-induced plasticity in aphid parasitoids",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2017-06-12T14:27:18Z",,"pub:183754",,"yes",,,,"Symbiont-mediated coevolution in an insect host-parasitoid system","146341","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,"imp593654ca91b9061770",,,"84990931493","000405326700003","Zool. j.

To date, however, statistical tools to incorporate species age into likelihood-based phylogenetic inference have been lacking. We present here a computational framework to quantify age-dependent extinction through maximum likelihood parameter estimation based on phylogenetic trees, assuming species lifetimes are gamma distributed. Testing on simulated trees shows that neglecting age dependence can lead to biased estimates of key macroevolutionary parameters. We then apply this method to two real data sets, namely a complete phylogeny of birds (class Aves) and a clade of self-compatible and -incompatible nightshades (Solanaceae), gaining initial insights into the extent to which age-dependent extinction may help explain macroevolutionary patterns.

These costs often depend on parental condition, which is thus considered as a key determinant of the level of parental care expressed during family life. However, how parental condition affects the behaviors that juveniles express toward their siblings and parents remains poorly explored. Here, we investigated these questions in the European earwig Forficula auricularia, an insect in which mothers provide extensive forms of care to their juveniles. We measured maternal body condition at egg hatching, subsequently manipulated maternal nutritional state, and finally assessed both food transfer among siblings and the nature of mother–offspring interactions. We also considered variation in brood size, an important parameter in family interactions. We found that food transfer among siblings increased with brood size when the tending mothers were in a deteriorated nutritional state. This effect was masked when the nutritional state of mothers was enhanced. The frequency of care-related behaviors that juveniles expressed toward their mother was higher when she was in a deteriorated rather than an enhanced nutritional state, while it overall increased with brood size. Finally, increasing values of maternal body condition entailed a shift from a positive to a negative association between maternal care behaviors and brood size, but only when the mothers’ nutritional state was deteriorated. Overall, our results demonstrate that parental condition and brood size do not only affect parental behaviors but can also be important and entangled drivers of offspring behaviors during family life.",,,,"1045-2249||1465-7279",,"10.1093/beheco/arv181","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551336","en","Oxford University Press",,,,"Maternal condition determines offspring behavior toward family members in the European earwig",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-06-08T10:57:53Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85032869064","000375398800021","Behav Ecol","2","Behavioral Ecology","27","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The effect of such compounds on Salmonella enterica, a major food-borne and zoonotic pathogen, has been analysed in different studies, but only few works evaluated its biological cost, and the overall effects at the genomic and transcriptomic levels associated with diverse phenotypes resulting from biocide exposure, which was the aim of this work.  Results Exposure to triclosan, clorhexidine, benzalkonium, (but not to hypochlorite) resulted in mutants with different phenotypes to a wide range of antimicrobials even unrelated to the selective agent. Most biocide-resistant mutants showed increased susceptibility to compounds acting on the cell wall (β-lactams) or the cell membranes (poly-L-lysine, polymyxin B, colistin or toxic anions). Mutations (SNPs) were found in three intergenic regions and nine genes, which have a role in energy production, amino acids, carbohydrates or lipids metabolism, some of them involved in membrane transport and pathogenicity. Comparative transcriptomics of biocide-resistant mutants showed over-expression of genes encoding efflux pumps (sugE), ribosomal and transcription-related proteins, cold-shock response (cpeE) and enzymes of microaerobic metabolism including those of the phosphotransferase system. Mainly ribosomal, metabolic and pathogenicity-related genes had affected expression in both in vitro-selected biocide mutants and field Salmonella isolates with reduced biocide susceptibility.  Conclusions Multiple pathways can be involved in the adaptation of Salmonella to biocides, mainly related with global stress, or involving metabolic and membrane alterations, and eventually causing “collateral sensitivity” to other antimicrobials. These changes might impact the bacterial-environment interaction, imposing significant bacterial fitness costs which may reduce the chances of fixation and spread of biocide resistant mutants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000473467",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-016-2778-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473467","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biocide resistance||Antimicrobial susceptibility||WGS||Transcriptomics||Collateral sensitivity","Multiple adaptive routes of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium to biocide and antibiotic exposure",,"Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-03-08T15:52:15Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,"35435294","2-s2.0-84979665824",,"BMC Genomics","1","BMC Genomics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
