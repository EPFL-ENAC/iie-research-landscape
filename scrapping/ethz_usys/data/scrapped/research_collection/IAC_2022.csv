While a slightly smaller fraction of atmospheric shortwave absorption of 0.6 % is unexpectedly estimated, possibly related to the lower water vapor content effects due to the thinner air over the TP to overcompensate for the aerosoland cloud effects over East Asian land. The weaker greenhouse effect andfewer low clouds due to the TP are very likely the causes of the smaller fraction of East Asian land surface downward longwave radiation. Hence, highaerosol loadings, clouds, and the TP over East Asia play vital roles in theshortwave budgets, while the TP is responsible for the longwave budgetsduring this regional energy budget assessment. The further obtained cloudradiative effects suggest that the presence of clouds results in a largercooling effect on the climate system over East Asian land than that over the globe.

However, even km-scale models need to parameterize some physical processes and are thus subject to the corresponding parameter uncertainty. Systematic calibration has the advantage of improving model performance with transparency and reproducibility, thus benefiting model intercomparison projects, process studies, and climate-change scenario simulations. In this paper, the regional atmospheric climate model COSMO v6 is systematically calibrated over the Tropical South Atlantic. First, the parameters' sensitivities are evaluated with respect to a set of validation fields. Five of the most sensitive parameters are chosen for calibration. The objective calibration then closely follows a methodology previously used for regional climate simulations. This includes simulations considering the interaction of all pairs of parameters, and the exploitation of a quadratic-form metamodel to emulate the simulations. In the current set-up with 5 parameters, 51 simulations are required to build the metamodel. The model is calibrated for the year 2016 and validated in two different years using slightly different model setups (domain and resolution). Both years demonstrate significant improvements, in particular for outgoing shortwave radiation, with reductions of the bias by a factor of 3–4. The results thus show that parameter calibration is a useful and efficient tool for model improvement. Calibrating over a larger domain might help to further improve the overall performance, but could potentially also lead to compromises among different regions and variables, and require more computational resources.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000584399",,"0148-0227||2169-897X","10.1029/2022jd037303","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/584399","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Systematic Calibration of a Convection‐Resolving Model: Application over Tropical Atlantic","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-01T18:45:19Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85144490666",,"000924277100001","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","23","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","127","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Subsequently, we test the reconstruction on independent satellite data and reanalyzed precipitation, and find a large fraction of historical zonal mean precipitation (ZMP) variability is recovered, in particular over the Northern hemisphere and in parts of the tropics. Finally, we demonstrate that the reconstructed ZMP trends are outside the variability of pre-industrial control simulations, and are largely consistent with the range of historical simulations driven by external forcing. Overall, we illustrate a novel way of estimating seasonally averaged zonal precipitation from gauge data, and trends therein that show a signal very likely caused by human influence.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000589564",,"0094-8276||1944-8007","10.1029/2022GL099826","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589564","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","precipitation||reconstruction||statistical learning||infilling||large ensemble||hydrological cycle","Reconstruction of Zonal Precipitation From Sparse Historical Observations Using Climate Model Information and Statistical Learning","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-01T04:59:40Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Combining theory with Big Data?

Chemical transport models show a large-scale dipolar dust response to SSWs, with the burden in the Eastern Mediterranean enhanced up to 30% and a corresponding reduction in West Africa. Observations of inhalable particulate (PM10) concentrations and aerosol optical depth confirm this dipole. On average, a single SSW causes 680–2460 additional premature deaths in the Eastern Mediterranean and prevents 1180–2040 premature deaths in West Africa from exposure to dust-source fine particulate (PM2.5). Currently, SSWs are predictable 1–2 weeks in advance.

We propose a direct D&A approach based on supervised learning to extract fingerprints that lead to robust predictions under relevant interventions on exogenous variables, i.e., climate drivers other than the target. We employ anchor regression, a distributionally-robust statistical learning method inspired by causal inference that extrapolates well to perturbed data under the interventions considered. The residuals from the prediction achieve either uncorrelatedness or mean independence with the exogenous variables, thus guaranteeing robustness. We define D&A as a unified hypothesis testing framework that relies on the same statistical model but uses different targets and test statistics. In the experiments, we first show that the CO2 forcing can be robustly predicted from temperature spatial patterns under strong interventions on the solar forcing. Second, we illustrate attribution to the greenhouse gases and aerosols while protecting against interventions on the aerosols and CO2 forcing, respectively. Our study shows that incorporating robustness constraints against relevant interventions may significantly benefit detection and attribution of climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590369",,,"10.48550/ARXIV.2212.04905","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590369","en","Cornell University","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Detection and attribution||Distributional robustness||Anchor regression||Interventions||Mean independence","Robust detection and attribution of climate change under interventions","Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2023-01-05T08:48:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"2212.04905",,,,,,,,"arXiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we present a multi-model, multi-method attribution analysis to investigate the extent to which human-induced climate change has influenced the probability and intensity of extreme heat waves in this region. Based on observations, modelling and a classical statistical approach, the occurrence of a heat wave defined as the maximum daily temperature (TXx) observed in the area 45-52 degrees N, 119-123 degrees W, was found to be virtually impossible without human-caused climate change. The observed temperatures were so extreme that they lay far outside the range of historical temperature observations. This makes it hard to state with confidence how rare the event was. Using a statistical analysis that assumes that the heat wave is part of the same distribution as previous heat waves in this region led to a first-order estimation of the event frequency of the order of once in 1000 years under current climate conditions. Using this assumption and combining the results from the analysis of climate models and weather observations, we found that such a heat wave event would be at least 150 times less common without human-induced climate change. Also, this heat wave was about 2 degrees C hotter than a 1-in-1000-year heat wave would have been in 1850-1900, when global mean temperatures were 1.2 degrees C cooler than today. Looking into the future, in a world with 2 degrees C of global warming (0.8 degrees C warmer than today), a 1000-year event would be another degree hotter. Our results provide a strong warning: our rapidly warming climate is bringing us into uncharted territory with significant consequences for health, well-being and livelihoods. Adaptation and mitigation are urgently needed to prepare societies for a very different future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000589198",,"2190-4987||2190-4979","10.5194/esd-13-1689-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589198","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Rapid attribution analysis of the extraordinary heat wave on the Pacific coast of the US and Canada in June 2021","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-26T05:57:59Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85145581169",,"000895078400001",,"4","Earth System Dynamics","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The processes intensifying the precipitation in synoptic situations with Vb-cyclones in the Danube, Elbe, and Odra catchments are only partially understood. Our study aims to investigate these processes with Lagrangian moisture-source diagnostics for 16 selected Vb-events. Moreover, we analyse the characteristics of typical moisture source regions during 1107 Vb-events from 1901 to 2010 based on ERA-20C reanalysis dynamically downscaled with COSMO-CLM+NEMO. We observe moisture contributions by various source regions highlighting the complex dynamical interplay of different air masses leading to moisture convergence in synoptic situations with Vb-cyclones. Overall, up to 80% of the precipitation originates from the European continent, indicating the importance of continental moisture recycling, especially within the respective river catchment. Other major moisture uptake regions are the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, the North Atlantic, and for a few events the Black Sea. Remarkably, anomalies in these oceanic source regions show no connection to precipitation amounts in synoptic situations with Vb-cyclones. In contrast, the Vb-cyclones with the highest precipitation are associated with anomalously high evaporation in the Mediterranean Sea, even though the Mediterranean Sea is only a minor moisture source region on average. Interestingly, the evaporation anomalies are not connected with sea-surface temperature but with wind-speed anomalies (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient R ≈ 0.7, significant with p < 0.01) indicating mainly dynamically driven evaporation. The particular role of the Mediterranean Sea hints towards possible importance of Mediterranean moisture for the early-stage intensification of Vb-cyclones and the pre-moistening of the continental uptake regions upstream of the target catchments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000546446",,"0930-7575||1432-0894","10.1007/s00382-022-06256-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/546446","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Vb-cyclones||Heavy precipitation events||Danube||Elbe||Odra||Marginal seas||Twentieth century reanalysis","Moisture sources of heavy precipitation in Central Europe in synoptic situations with Vb-cyclones","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-11T05:42:02Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85128852873",,"000788037800001","Clim Dyn","11-12","Climate Dynamics","59","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This phenomenon is known as the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect and has several adverse implications. Studies have shown that the SUHI effect tends to be weaker if urban form is characterized by sprawl or polycentrism. These findings suggest that urban heat could be mitigated if a city is less compact. By analyzing high-resolution remote-sensing land surface temperature (LST) and land-cover data for 293 European cities, this study shows that — contrary to many previous findings — sprawling or polycentric urban forms do not necessarily lead to a decrease of LSTs over urban areas. In southern European cities, sprawl could even lead to the warming of urban areas during specific daytimes, highlighting the importance of considering environmental and regional contexts when determining the role of urban form in heat mitigation. It is also crucial to consider the predominant type of land cover surrounding a city since sprawl into forested areas could have a very different effect than sprawl into agricultural areas. These results illustrate the complexity of urban form related heat mitigation and that policy- and decision-makers have to consider local and regional contexts when steering urban form.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000584177",,"2590-2520","10.1016/j.cacint.2022.100091","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/584177","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Sprawl or compactness?

Our variance-partitioning analysis identifies vegetation type as an important predictor for SEB-components during Arctic summer (June-August), compared to other SEB-drivers including climate, latitude and permafrost characteristics. Differences among vegetation types can be of similar magnitude as between vegetation and glacier surfaces and are especially high for summer sensible and latent heat fluxes. The timing of SEB-flux summer-regimes (when daily mean values exceed 0 Wm−2) relative to snow-free and -onset dates varies substantially depending on vegetation type, implying vegetation controls on snow-cover and SEB-flux seasonality.

However, little is known about their environmental impacts in the atmosphere. MnPs could act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) or ice-nucleating particles (INPs), affecting cloud formation processes. In sufficient quantities, they could change the cloud albedo, precipitation and lifetime, collectively impacting the Earth’s radiation balance and climate. In this Perspective, we evaluate the potential impact of MnPs on cloud formation by assessing their ability to act as CCN or INPs. Based on an analysis of their physicochemical properties, we propose that MnPs can act as INPs and potentially as CCN after environmental aging processes such as photochemical weathering and the sorption of macromolecules or trace soluble species onto the particle surface. The actual climate impact(s) of MnPs depend on their abundance relative to other aerosols. The concentration of MnPs in the atmosphere is currently low, so they are unlikely to make a substantial contribution to radiative forcing in regions exposed to other aerosols, either from natural sources or anthropogenic pollution. Nevertheless, MnPs will potentially cause non-negligible perturbations in unpolluted remote or marine clouds and generate local climate impacts, particularly in view of an increase in the release of MnPs to the environment in the future. Further measurements, coupled with better characterization of the physiochemical properties of MnPs, will enable a more accurate assessment of the climate impacts of MnPs acting as INPs and CCN.",,,,"1752-0908||1752-0894","10.1038/s41561-022-01051-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580671","en","Nature",,,"Atmospheric science||Environmental sciences","Potential impacts of atmospheric microplastics and nanoplastics on cloud formation processes","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-11-15T07:25:16Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)","186856","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Eccellenza",,,,"85141958889",,"000883294100004","Nat.

Due to the high spatial variability and complexity of droughts, it is important to complement station-based drought indices with gridded information and to couple multiple drought indicators within the monitoring system. Here, long-term satellite-based drought parameters from the EUMETSAT SAF network are analyzed in terms of dry anomalies within their climatology’s, namely ASCAT soil water index (SWI), CM SAF land surface temperature (LST), complemented with NOAA vegetation data, and LSA SAF Meteosat evapotranspiration data. The upcoming EUMETSAT SAF climate data records on land surface temperature and evapotranspiration will cover for the first time the WMO climatological 30-year reference period. This study is the first study investigating the potential of those long-term data records for climate monitoring of droughts in Europe. The satellite datasets are compared with the standardized precipitation index (SPI), soil moisture observations from the SwissSMEX measurement network, with a modelled soil moisture index (SMI) based on observations, and with evapotranspiration measurements, focusing on the temporal dynamics of the anomalies. For vegetation and surface temperature, the dry years of 2003, 2015, and 2018 are clearly visible in the satellite data. CM SAF LSTs show strong anomalies at the beginning of the drought period. The comparison of in situ and modelled soil moisture and evapotranspiration measurements with the satellite parameters shows strong agreement in terms of anomalies. The SWI indicates high anomaly correlations of 0.56 to 0.83 with measurements and 0.63 to 0.76 with the SMI at grassland sites. The Meteosat evapotranspiration data strongly agree with the measurements, with anomaly correlations of 0.63 and 0.67 for potential and actual evapotranspiration, respectively. Due to the prevailing humid climate conditions at the considered sites, evapotranspiration anomalies during the investigated dry periods were mostly positive and thus not water limited, but were also a driver for soil moisture drought. The results indicate that EUMETSAT SAF satellite data can well complement the station-based drought monitoring in Switzerland with spatial information.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000588272",,"2072-4292","10.3390/rs14235961","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588272","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","spatial drought monitoring||severe drought events||drought climatology","Climatological Drought Monitoring in Switzerland Using EUMETSAT SAF Satellite Data","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-20T04:35:29Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85138804337",,"000897338100001","Remote Sens.","23","Remote Sensing","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To increase resilience and develop adaptation strategies to such extreme droughts, it is important to understand how dry a worst-case drought would be and how long it would take to recover from it. This study introduces and evaluates a methodological framework to generate coherent climate model-based drought storylines of different severities and for different locations. The so-called iterative ensemble resampling method repeatedly runs large ensembles and only keeps those ensemble members, which minimize local precipitation. The drought storylines are developed with the fully coupled global climate model CESM1. The first part of the analysis demonstrates the feasibility of the framework by generating some of the most extreme droughts possible. Using stringent precipitation criteria, accumulated precipitation is reduced by 80% relative to the long-term average in western Europe and by 77% in central North America, respectively, over multiple years. The number of dry days in the Western European storyline corresponds to estimates in the reconstructed drought 1540 in Central Europe. The low precipitation induces soil moisture deficit storylines that are physically consistent but beyond high return levels estimated based on purely statistically fitted generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions. In the second part, the drought storylines are used as a setup to assess the recovery time of such extreme soil moisture deficits. Over the driest regions in central and western Europe as well as central and eastern North America, the soil moisture recovers over a period of a few months up to more than five years, depending on the mean atmospheric circulation rather than on the strength of the soil moisture deficit. The framework of iterative ensemble resampling can generate up to very rare physically consistent storylines to conduct idealized experiments. When lowering the selection criteria for precipitation, the framework can be used to generate less extreme drought storylines that are more likely to occur in the real world. This approach can help to stress test the socio-economic system and adaptation strategies for potential long-lasting drought periods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576108",,"2212-0947","10.1016/j.wace.2022.100512","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576108","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate extremes||Droughts||Storylines||Large ensembles||Soil moisture recovery","Multi-year drought storylines for Europe and North America from an iteratively perturbed global climate model","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-16T02:59:35Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Understanding and quantifying the occurrence of  very rare climate extremes in a changing climate","178778","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85139367507",,,,,"Weather and Climate Extremes","38","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it is yet unclear how the importance of these flood drivers and their interplay differs between local and regional events. Therefore, we assess differences in the compounding drivers of local and regional floods in the United States using newly developed classification schemes for storm types and antecedent conditions. Our results show that the dominant storm type triggering floods is frontal events, in particular those related to mesoscale convective systems. The importance of different storm types varies by season, with frontal mesoscale convective systems being most important in summer, nonfrontal, and extratropical cyclone-related storms in winter and spring, and tropical cyclones in fall. Our comparison of the drivers of local and regional events shows that the relative importance of different storm types only weakly differs between local and regional floods, while antecedent conditions are clearly distinct. Regional events are in 75% of the cases related to wet antecedent conditions in some cases combined with snowmelt, while local events are more likely to also develop under dry conditions. Over all regions and seasons, regional events are most often the result of a frontal storm combined with wet antecedent conditions, which highlights the important role of compounding flood drivers. This finding suggests that regional flood risk and change assessments should account for the compounding nature of atmospheric and land-surface flood drivers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590604",,"0043-1397||1944-7973","10.1029/2022WR033249","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590604","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Varying Importance of Storm Types and Antecedent Conditions for Local and Regional Floods","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-06T06:21:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85145182323",,"000929798400035","Water Resour.

Using a blend of reanalysis data and Earth System Model (ESM) simulations, we disentangle the physical drivers underlying this exceptional event. Our analysis highlights the role of the anticyclonic circulation aloft, which converted previously gained potential energy—some of which by intense latent heating thousands of kilometers upwind over the North Pacific—back into sensible heat through subsidence. We demonstrate that this upwind latent heat release did not only result in a hot troposphere above the heatwave region, but also contributed directly to escalating near-surface temperatures. Facilitated by the mountainous terrain and dry soils in the region, deep atmospheric boundary layers were established over the course of several days, connecting the air close to Earth's surface to a massive heat reservoir many kilometers above. Anomalous soil moisture acted to raise the heatwave temperatures by 3°C in a large region during the peak of the event, with local anomalies exceeding 5°C. Overall, we conclude that this heatwave was the outcome of an intricate interplay between dynamic and thermodynamic processes. ESM experiments suggest that the same large-scale atmospheric circulation fueled by enhanced thermodynamic drivers, such as more available moisture for condensation upwind, could enable even more extreme near-surface temperatures, in particular in a warmer climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590331",,"2328-4277","10.1029/2022EF002967","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590331","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Drivers and Mechanisms of the 2021 Pacific Northwest Heatwave","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-05T05:16:49Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Extreme Events: Artificial Intelligence for Detection and Attribution","101003469","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85145034300",,"000941683500005",,"12","Earth's Future","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The investigation of atmospheric aerosol oxidation processes is complicated by low oxidant concentrations and long timescales, which are difficult to represent in laboratory studies. Experimental work often attempts to compensate for short timescales with elevated concentrations of oxidative agents, assuming that the ageing progress depends only on the oxidant exposure, i.e. on the product of oxidant concentration and time, [Ox] x t, and not on [Ox] or t independently. The application of electrodynamic balance-mass spectrometry of single particles allows the validity of this assumption to be investigated, since it provides information on the molecular composition of aerosol particles for a wide range of reaction durations under well-defined oxidation conditions. Here, we demonstrate the capabilities of a new setup on levitated oleic acid droplets reacting with ozone at mixing ratios of 0.2 and 15 ppm, i.e. spanning almost two orders of magnitude in [Ox]. We show that the reactive removal of oleic acid can be accurately expressed as a function of ozone exposure [Ox] x t, whereas the product concentrations depend on [Ox] and t independently. As the underlying reason for the breakdown of the exposure metric, we suggest a competition between evaporation of volatile first-generation products and their accretion reactions with reactive Criegee intermediates, converting them into low-volatility dimers and oligomers. This hypothesis is supported by kinetic model simulations using the aerosol process model KM-SUB, which explicitly resolves the competition between evaporation and secondary chemistry as a function of the experimental timescale and ozone mixing ratio. The model successfully reproduces final product distributions. The findings are further supported by the recorded changes of droplet sizes during oxidation. As a heuristic, the breakdown of the exposure metric in a chemical reaction system is possible, when competition between first- and second-order processes of reactive intermediates determines important system properties.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000580980",,"1463-9084||1463-9076","10.1039/d2cp03289a","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580980","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Electrodynamic balance-mass spectrometry reveals impact of oxidant concentration on product composition in the ozonolysis of oleic acid","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-16T09:09:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Electrodynamic balance-mass spectrometry of single particles as a new platform for atmospheric chemistry research","ETH-03 17-2","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,,,,"000878222400001","Phys.

The underlying physical processes involved in the isotope-temperature relation, however, unfold at much shorter timescales. Here, we study the temporary archival of frontal passages in the seasonal Alpine snow cover. We combine five snow profiles sampled in winter 2017 at the Weissfluhjoch with a quantitative snow layer age reconstruction and atmospheric reanalysis data to characterize the circulation and clouds associated with the precipitation producing synoptic-scale cold and warm fronts. We find that the vertical cloud structure and the air parcels' net cooling during transport leave a distinct imprint in the δ18O and δD vertical profile in the snow. The near-surface humidity gradient at the moisture source is reflected in the second order isotope parameter deuterium excess. In the cold season, these environmental conditions during cloud formation and at the moisture source are preserved in the snow. In the melt season, significant post-depositional effects due to wet snow metamorphism, however, leads to an enrichment in heavy isotopes in the snow and a strong smoothing of the initial atmospheric imprint. These findings show that the isotope signal archived in the dry snow cover is strongly modulated by individual weather systems prior to deposition. Major shifts in the upper-level jet stream and cyclone tracks likely leading to changes in moisture source regions and conditions, could therefore be detectable in the isotope composition of Alpine ice.",,,,"0148-0227||2169-897X","10.1029/2022JD037469","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/585427","en","American Geophysical Union",,,"atmospheric water cycle||midlatitude meteorology||Alpine snow||stable water isotopes||fronts||clouds","Fingerprints of Frontal Passages and Post-Depositional Effects in the Stable Water Isotope Signal of Seasonal Alpine Snow","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-12-07T07:33:22Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85142878275",,"000888569300001","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","22","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","127","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

At the same time, strong positive trends in ERA5 reanalysis surface solar radiation downward for all-sky and clear-sky conditions (SSRD and SSRDc, respectively) and temperature at 2 m are found for Europe in summer during the period 1979–2020. The GEBA observations show as well strong increases in SSRD during the latest four decades. Estimations of changes in SSRDc, using the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model, show similarly strong increases when fed by MERRA-2 AOT. The estimates of warming in this study, caused by increases in SSRD and SSRDc, are based on energy budget approximations and the Stefan Boltzmann law. The increases in near surface temperature, estimated both for clear-sky and all-sky conditions, are up to about 1°C for Central and Eastern Europe. The total warming over large parts of this region for clear-sky conditions is however nearly double the global mean temperature increase of 1.1°C, while somewhat less for all-sky conditions. The effects of aerosols on warming over the southerly Iberian Peninsula are weaker compared to countries further north. The rapid total warming over the Iberian Peninsula is probably caused by greenhouse warming, drier surface conditions, and to some degree decline in aerosols.

Amplified waves with preferred longitudinal locations lead to concurrent extremes in specific locations. It is therefore important to identify the essential components in the climate system that contribute to phase-locking of wave patterns. Here, we investigate the role of dry atmospheric dynamics and topography in causing concurrent heatwaves by using an idealized general circulation model. Topography is included in the model experiments as a Gaussian mountain.

Atmospheric components affect SSR, including aerosols and clouds, though studies disagree somewhat about the relative effect of each component in different regions. Current Earth system models (ESMs) are unable to simulate observed trends in SSR. This study includes an investigation into observed SSR variations between 1961 and 2014 and an evaluation of the effects of cloud cover variations and impacts of aerosol extinction, using timeseries of SSR and cloud cover from in-situ measurements. Historical simulations by 42 ESMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) have also been studied and compared to observations. The observational study indicates that cloud cover has had a dampening effect on the variations of SSR and that emissions of aerosol and aerosol precursors are the main cause of the general trends in observed SSR in four regions-China, Japan, Europe, and the United States-during 1961-2014. The study of simulated SSR in CMIP6 yields the conclusion that current ESMs remain unable to simulate the magnitude of observed dimming and brightening in China, Japan, and the United States, but that the European SSR trends between 1961 and 2014 are fairly well reproduced in the ESMs. A rough quantification of the regional surface radiation extinction efficiency of aerosol and precursor emissions in the simulations is found to agree with observed values in Europe, but not in the other three regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000580986",,"0148-0227||2169-897X","10.1029/2021JD035476","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580986","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","global dimming||brightening||aerosol emissions||cloud cover||CMIP6||observations","Disentangling Aerosol and Cloud Effects on Dimming and Brightening in Observations and CMIP6","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-16T09:09:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: causes of decadal changes of solar radiation||LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constrained aerosol forcing for improved climate projections","188601||821205","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","Projekte MINT||H2020",,,,"85141878510",,"000878221600001","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","21","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","127","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, using a cloud-resolving model and a climate model we show that INPs could decrease the heat-trapping effect of mixed-phase regime clouds over the polar oceans during winter, slowing down sea-ice melting and partially offsetting the ice-albedo feedback. We refer to this concept as mixed-phase regime cloud thinning (MCT). We estimate that MCT could offset about 25% of the expected increase in polar sea-surface temperature due to the doubling of CO2.

The 2003 European summer heat wave sparked high attention towards such events in Switzerland, where ecosystems were largely affected again by summer dry periods in 2015 and 2018. With a newly applied processing scheme of calculating fluxes of net ecosystem exchange of CO2, latent and sensible heat from eddy-covariance measurements, the impact of droughts on GPP and exchange of energy between land and atmosphere are investigated at a managed grassland site in Switzerland. The rate of primary production is considerably reduced under the influence of dry conditions. This effect is further intensified by grassland management. Evapotranspiration, on the other hand, seems to be unaffected by the lack of precipitation at the site.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000572786",,"0168-1923||1873-2240","10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109166","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572786","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Drought monitoring||Gross primary production||Evapotranspiration||Water use efficiency","Multi-year eddy-covariance measurements at a pre-alpine humid grassland site: Dataset overview, drought responses, and effects of land management","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-26T19:10:48Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85138833777",,"000868689200002","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","326","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They have received considerable attention due to high spatial coverage and occurrence frequency in the Arctic. To initiate ice formation in MPCs at temperatures above −38 °C, ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are required, which therefore have important implications on the radiative properties of MPCs by altering the ice-to-liquid ratio of hydrometeors. As a result, constraining ambient INP concentrations could promote accurate representation of cloud microphysical processes and reduce the uncertainties in estimating the cloud-phase-related climate feedback in climate models. Currently, INP parameterizations are lacking for remote Arctic environments. Here we present INP number concentrations and their variability measured in Ny-Ålesund (Svalbard) at temperatures between 0 and −30 °C. No distinguishable seasonal difference was observed from 12 weeks of field measurements during October and November 2019 and March and April 2020. Compared to existing studies, the absence of a seasonal difference is not surprising, as most seasonal differences are reported for summer versus winter time INP concentrations. In addition, correlating INP concentrations to aerosol physical properties was not successful. Therefore, we propose a lognormal-distribution-based parameterization to predict Arctic INP concentration solely as a function of temperature, specifically for the transition seasons autumn and spring to fill in the data gap in the literature pertaining to these seasons. In practice, the parameterized variables allow for (i) the prediction of the most likely INP concentrations and (ii) the retrieval of the governing distribution of INP concentrations at given temperatures in the Arctic.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000581874",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-14441-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/581874","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Predicting atmospheric background number concentration of ice-nucleating particles in the Arctic","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-21T05:59:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Exploiting orographic clouds for constraining the sources of ice crystals||LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constrained aerosol forcing for improved climate projections","175824||821205","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","Projekte MINT||H2020",,,,"85143439016",,"000881697300001","Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This variability is mainly driven by variations in the local climatic drivers of terrestrial ecosystem activity, which in turn are controlled by large-scale modes of atmospheric variability. Here, we quantify the fraction of global C-cycle IAV that is explained by large-scale atmospheric circulation variability, which is quantified by spatiotemporal sea level pressure (SLP) fields. C-cycle variability is diagnosed from the global detrended atmospheric CO2 growth rate and the land CO2 sink from 16 dynamic global vegetation models and two atmospheric inversions in the Global Carbon Budget 2018. We use a regularized linear regression model, which represents a statistical learning technique apt to deal with the large number of atmospheric circulation predictors (p >= 800, each representing one pixel-based time series of SLP anomalies) in a relatively short observed record (n < 60 years). We show that boreal winter and spring SLP anomalies allow predicting IAV in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate and the global land sink, with Pearson correlations between reference and predicted values between 0.70 and 0.84 for boreal winter SLP anomalies. This is comparable to or higher than that of a similar model using 15 traditional teleconnection indices as predictors. The spatial patterns of regression coefficients of the model based on SLP fields show a predominant role of the tropical Pacific and over Southeast Asia extending to Australia, corresponding to the regions associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability. We also identify another important region in the western Pacific, roughly corresponding to the West Pacific pattern.||We further evaluate the influence of the time series length on the predictability of IAV and find that reliable estimates of global C-cycle IAV can be obtained from records of 30-54 years. For shorter time series (n < 30 years), however, our results show that conclusions about CO2 IAV patterns and drivers need to be evaluated with caution. Overall, our study illustrates a new data-driven and flexible approach to model the relationship between large-scale atmospheric circulation variations and C-cycle variability at global and regional scales, complementing the traditional use of teleconnection indices.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000581803",,"2190-4987||2190-4979","10.5194/esd-13-1505-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/581803","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Interannual global carbon cycle variations linked to atmospheric circulation variability","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-19T03:59:22Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85142643512",,"000879457300001",,"4","Earth System Dynamics","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Anomalies in Arctic stratospheric ozone become particularly important in spring, when returning sunlight allows them to alter stratospheric temperatures via shortwave heating, thus modifying atmospheric dynamics. At the same time, the stratospheric circulation undergoes a transition in spring with the final stratospheric warming (FSW), which marks the end of winter. A causal link between stratospheric ozone anomalies and FSWs is plausible and might increase the predictability of stratospheric and tropospheric responses on sub-seasonal to seasonal timescales. However, it remains to be fully understood how ozone influences the timing and evolution of the springtime vortex breakdown. Here, we contrast results from chemistry climate models with and without interactive ozone chemistry to quantify the impact of ozone anomalies on the timing of the FSW and its effects on surface climate. We find that ozone feedbacks increase the variability in the timing of the FSW, especially in the lower stratosphere. In ozone-deficient springs, a persistent strong polar vortex and a delayed FSW in the lower stratosphere are partly due to the lack of heating by ozone in that region. High-ozone anomalies, on the other hand, result in additional shortwave heating in the lower stratosphere, where the FSW therefore occurs earlier. We further show that FSWs in high-ozone springs are predominantly followed by a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) with positive sea level pressure anomalies over the Arctic and cold anomalies over Eurasia and Europe. These conditions are to a significant extent (at least 50 %) driven by ozone. In contrast, FSWs in low-ozone springs are not associated with a discernible surface climate response. These results highlight the importance of ozone-circulation coupling in the climate system and the potential value of interactive ozone chemistry for sub-seasonal to seasonal predictability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000584639",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-13997-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/584639","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Effects of Arctic ozone on the stratospheric spring onset and its surface impact","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-03T05:37:46Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"The Overlooked Role of Stratospheric Ozone in forcing Northern Hemispheric climate (TORSO)||Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events","180043||198896","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Ambizione||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,,"85142607516",,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Airborne dust originating fromsuch soils can create health and environmental issues due to their high saltcontent and the presence of toxic elements. The aim of the present study istwofold, namely to investigate the newly emerged playa surfaces ofwestern Lake Urmia (LU) in Iran and their contribution to aerosol in theregion by means of physicochemical, mineralogical, and elemental analysesand to study the ice nucleation (IN) activity of both surface-collected soiland airborne dust samples. The playa surfaces created by desiccation of LUon the western shores were mapped and sampled at 130 locations. Soil sampleswere subjected to physicochemical analyses, and their erodible fraction wasdetermined. Based on these analyses, four highly erodible playa surfacesfrom the northwest to the south of LU were selected as sites for collection ofdust by impaction and soil samples from the uppermost surface. Theirparticle physicochemical properties (size distribution, elemental andmineralogical composition) were compared with their IN activity determinedby emulsion freezing experiments in a differential scanning calorimeter(DSC) in two suspension concentrations of 2 wt % and 5 wt %. Thephysicochemical soil properties differed significantly between the differentplaya surfaces, which affects their susceptibility to wind erosion. Sandsheets and sandy salt crusts were the most erodible playa surfaces due totheir high sand fraction and low organic matter and clay content, favouring thepresence of small aggregates. Mineralogical analyses document the prevalenceof quartz, carbonates, and clay minerals, such as kaolinite, palygorskite, andchlorite in all of the samples. The predominant elements in the samples areCa, Fe, Al, Si, and Na (and in some cases Ba, Sr, and Zn). The correlationbetween soil and dust samples based on mineralogical composition, elementalenrichment factors, and physicochemical properties confirm that the playasurfaces are the major contributors to dust in the region. IN activity withonset temperatures ranging from 245 to 250 K demonstrates the high potentialof dust blown from Urmia playa surfaces to affect cloud properties andprecipitation. Freezing onset temperatures and the fraction ofheterogeneously frozen droplets in the emulsions reveal variations in INactivity depending on the mineralogical composition of the samples but which are alsoinfluenced by organic matter, salinity, and pH. Specifically, IN activitycorrelates positively with organic matter and clay minerals and negativelywith pH, salinity, and (surprisingly) K-feldspar andquartz content. The high wind erodibility and dust production of the LUplaya surfaces together with their high IN activity can play an importantrole in the climate of the region and thus needs careful monitoring andspecific attention.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000585031",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-14905-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/585031","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Measurement report: The Urmia playa as a source of airborne dust and ice-nucleating particles - Part 1: Correlation between soils and airborne samples","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-06T03:51:40Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Immersion and adhesion freezing influenced by charge and solutes","175716","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85144247501",,"000888536100001","Atmos. chem. phys.","22","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we augment the description of the “climatic impact-driver” (CID) approach adopted in the Working Group I (WGI) contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report. CIDs are broadly defined as “physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events, and extremes) that affect an element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and their changes can be detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system elements and regions.” We give background information on the IPCC Report process that led to the development of the 7 CID types (heat and cold, wet and dry, wind, snow and ice, coastal, open ocean, and other) and 33 distinct CID categories, each of which may be evaluated using a variety of CID indices. This inventory of CIDs was co-developed with WGII to provide a useful collaboration point between physical climate scientists and impacts/risk experts to assess the specific climatic phenomena driving sectoral responses and identify relevant CID indices within each sector. The CID Framework ensures that a comprehensive set of climatic conditions informs adaptation planning and risk management and may also help prioritize improvements in modeling sectoral dynamics that depend on climatic conditions. CIDs contribute to climate services by increasing coherence and neutrality when identifying and communicating relevant findings from physical climate research to risk assessment and planning activities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000586180",,"2328-4277","10.1029/2022EF002803","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/586180","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"The Climatic Impact-Driver Framework for Assessment of Risk-Relevant Climate Information","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-11T18:07:33Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85143224761",,"000889477500001",,"11","Earth's Future","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This warming is influenced by clouds, which modulate the solar and terrestrial radiative fluxes and, thus, determine the surface energy budget. However, the interactions among clouds, aerosols, and radiative fluxes in the Arctic are still poorly understood. To address these uncertainties, the Ny-Ålesund Aerosol Cloud Experiment (NASCENT) study was conducted from September 2019 to August 2020 in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. The campaign's primary goal was to elucidate the life cycle of aerosols in the Arctic and to determine how they modulate cloud properties throughout the year. In situ and remote sensing observations were taken on the ground at sea level, at a mountaintop station, and with a tethered balloon system. An overview of the meteorological and the main aerosol seasonality encountered during the NASCENT year is introduced, followed by a presentation of first scientific highlights. In particular, we present new findings on aerosol physicochemical and molecular properties. Further, the role of cloud droplet activation and ice crystal nucleation in the formation and persistence of mixed-phase clouds, and the occurrence of secondary ice processes, are discussed and compared to the representation of cloud processes within the regional Weather Research and Forecasting Model.

A product of incomplete combustion, soot particles, are fractal and hydrophobic aggregates comprising carbonaceous spheres with complex physicochemical properties. In the cirrus cloud regime, the surface wettability and pore abundance of soot particles are important determinants for their ice nucleation ability via pore condensation and freezing. In the atmosphere, soot particles can undergo various ageing processes which modify their surface chemistry and porosity, thus acting as ice nucleating particles with varying abilities as a function of ageing. In this study, size-selected soot particles were treated by thermal denuding at 573 K in a pure nitrogen (N2) or synthetic air (N2 + O2) flow and then exposed to varying relative humidity conditions at a fixed temperature in the range from 218 to 243 K, to investigate the role of volatile content in the ice nucleation ability. Both organic-lean and organic-rich propane (C3H8) flame soot particles, as well as two types of commercially available carbon black soot particles with high and low surface wettability, were tested. The size and mass distribution of soot aerosol were monitored during the ice nucleation experiments. Bulk soot samples also prepared in pure N2 or synthetic air environments at 573 K were characterised by thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and dynamic vapour sorption measurements, to reveal the relation between denuding volatile content, associated soot particle property modifications and the ice nucleation ability. Our study shows that thermal denuding induces a change in soot particle porosity playing a dominant role in regulating its ice nucleation via the pore condensation and freezing mechanism. The enrichment in mesopore (2–50 nm) availability may enhance soot ice nucleation. The presence of O2 in the thermal denuding process may introduce new active sites on soot particles for water interaction and increase soot surface wettability. However, these active sites only facilitate soot ice nucleation when mesopore structures are available. We conclude that a change in volatile content modifies both morphological properties and surface chemistry for soot particles, but porosity change plays the dominant role in regulating soot particle ice nucleation ability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000580897",,"2050-7887||2050-7895","10.1039/d2em00158f","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580897","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"The dependence of soot particle ice nucleation ability on its volatile content","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-15T16:41:28Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85138193819",,,"Environ Sci Process Impacts","11","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We find that the high emission scenario will substantially damage China's PV potential, resulting in a reduction of 314 TWh/year in electricity generation by the planned installed capacity in 2100, with a corresponding loss of US Dollar 25 billion/year. However, the low emission scenario will enhance the PV potential, yielding an additional electricity generation of 226 TWh/year and a corresponding bonus of US Dollar 18 billion/year in 2100.

While tropospheric circulation anomalies accompanying anomalous vortex states display substantial case-by-case variability, understanding the full diversity of the surface signatures requires larger sample sizes than those available from reanalyses. Here, we first show that a large ensemble of seasonal hindcasts realistically reproduces the observed average surface signatures for weak and strong vortex winters and produces sufficient spread for single ensemble members to be considered as alternative realizations. We then use the ensemble to analyze the diversity of surface signatures during weak and strong vortex winters. Over Eurasia, relatively few weak vortex winters are associated with large-scale cold conditions, suggesting that the strength of the observed cold signature could be inflated due to insufficient sampling. For both weak and strong vortex winters, the canonical temperature pattern in Eurasia only clearly arises when North Atlantic sea surface temperatures are in phase with the NAO. Over North America, while the main driver of interannual winter temperature variability is the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the stratosphere can modulate ENSO teleconnections, affecting temperature and circulation anomalies over North America and downstream. These findings confirm that anomalous vortex states are associated with a broad spectrum of surface climate anomalies on the seasonal scale, which may not be fully captured by the small observational sample size.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576922",,"0148-0227||2169-897X","10.1029/2022jd037422","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576922","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ENSO||stratosphere||NAO","Diverse Surface Signatures of Stratospheric Polar Vortex Anomalies","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-19T15:33:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85141703159",,"000871714700001","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","20","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","127","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Current global models have great difficulty matching observed aerosol optical depth (AOD) over BB regions. A common solution to address modelled AOD biases is scaling BB emissions. Using the relationship from an ensemble of aerosol models and satellite observations, we show that the bias in aerosol modelling results primarily from incorrect lifetimes and underestimated mass extinction coefficients. In turn, these biases seem to be related to incorrect precipitation and underestimated particle sizes. We further show that boosting BB emissions to correct AOD biases over the source region causes an overestimation of AOD in the outflow from Africa by 48%, leading to a double warming effect compared with when biases are simultaneously addressed for both aforementioned factors. Such deviations are particularly concerning in a warming future with increasing emissions from fires.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576147",,"2041-1723","10.1038/s41467-022-33680-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576147","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Using modelled relationships and satellite observations to attribute modelled aerosol biases over biomass burning regions","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-17T03:09:34Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85139485973",,"000865117600024","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Massive tree planting is thus sometimes portrayed as a panacea to mitigate climate change and related impacts. Recent controversies about the potential benefits and drawbacks of forestation have centered on the carbon storage potential of forests and the local or global thermodynamic impacts. Here we discuss how global-scale forestation and deforestation change the Earth’s energy balance, thereby affect the global atmospheric circulation and even have profound effects on the ocean circulation. We perform multicentury coupled climate model simulations in which preindustrial vegetation cover is either completely forested or deforested and carbon dioxide mixing ratio is kept constant. We show that global-scale forestation leads to a weakening and poleward shift of the Northern mid-latitude circulation, slows-down the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and affects the strength of the Hadley cell, whereas deforestation leads to reversed changes. Consequently, both land surface changes substantially affect regional precipitation, temperature, clouds, and surface wind patterns across the globe. The design process of large-scale forestation projects thus needs to take into account global circulation adjustments and their influence on remote climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000574342",,"2041-1723","10.1038/s41467-022-33279-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/574342","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Global forestation and deforestation affect remote climate via adjusted atmosphere and ocean circulation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-04T18:49:05Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons||Global Lagrangian Cloud Dynamics","787652||848698","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC","H2020||H2020",,,,"85139403814",,"000863903100002","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, a certain degree of uncertainty still exists in current studies of long-term SSR changes due to the lack of a state-of-the-art benchmark observational dataset. To understand this issue, we present a systematic comparison of SSR from in-situ observations, the Fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA5), and the The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 6 (CMIP6) in this paper. Our results show that: (1) The reverse interpolated station SSR series based on the ERA5 and the CMIP6 multi-models ensemble (MME) reflects the observed SSR values at the local/station scale to a certain degree. Although the underestimation/overestimation varies slightly in different regions/stations, the overall Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are about 15% and 21%, respectively of the observations. (2) Both the ERA5 SSR and the CMIP6 MME roughly reflect the seasonal variability and the spatial distributions of the SSR's climatological means (1971-2000) from gridded in-situ observations. (3) The SSR from the ERA5 is more consistent with observations than the CMIP6 MME in the temporal variations, long-term trend, and the uncertainties at global and continental scales. The latter has insignificant fluctuations in interannual variability, consistent with the trend in-situ observations only from 1950 to 1990, but fails the significant test (at 5% level) after that except for some regions. Therefore, developing a higher quality global long-term SSR benchmark climatic dataset with more complete coverage is still of great significance for optimizing surface energy balance estimates and studies of the impact of human activities on climate change.",,,,"0930-7575||1432-0894","10.1007/s00382-022-06222-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539482","en","Springer",,,"Surface solar radiation (SSR)||ERA5||CMIP6||Uncertainty||Global and continental scales","Uncertainties in the global and continental surface solar radiation variations: inter-comparison of in-situ observations, reanalyses, and model simulations","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-03-27T03:54:37Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85126109112",,"000768091300001","Clim Dyn","7","Climate Dynamics","59","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is however not resolved which drivers lead to the large inter-event variability in the surface impact. Using an intermediate complexity atmospheric model, we analyze the contribution of different factors to the downward response: polar cap geopotential height anomalies in the lower stratosphere, downstream influence from the northeastern Pacific, and local tropospheric conditions in the North Atlantic at the time of the initial response. As in reanalysis, an equatorward shift of the North Atlantic jet is found to occur for two-thirds of SSWs in the model. We find that around 40% of the variance of the tropospheric jet response after SSW events can be explained by the lower stratosphere geopotential height anomalies, while around 25% can be explained by zonal wind anomalies over the northeastern Pacific region. Local Atlantic conditions at the time of the SSW onset are also found to contribute to the surface response. To isolate the role of the stratosphere from tropospheric variability, we use model experiments where the zonal mean stratospheric winds are nudged toward climatology. When stratospheric variability is suppressed, the Pacific influence is found to be weaker. These findings shed light on the contribution of the stratosphere to the diverse downward impacts of SSW events, and may help to improve the predictability of tropospheric jet variability in the North Atlantic.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000573242",,"0894-8755||1520-0442","10.1175/jcli-d-21-0680.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/573242","en","American Meteorological Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"On the Relative Importance of Stratospheric and Tropospheric Drivers for the North Atlantic Jet Response to Sudden Stratospheric Warming Events","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-29T08:24:21Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85141509672",,"000860956000013","J. climate","19","Journal of Climate","35","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this work, aerosol particles in the ATAL were collected with a balloon-borne impactor near the tropopause region over India, using extended-duration balloon flights, in summer 2017 and winter 2018. The chemical composition of these particles was further investigated by quantitative analysis using offline ion chromatography. Nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) were found to be the dominant ions in the collected aerosols with values ranging between 87 and 343 ng M-3 at STP (standard temperature and pressure) during the summer campaign. In contrast, sulfate (SO42-) levels were found to be above the detection limit (> 10 ng m(-3) at STP) only in winter. In addition, we determined the origin of the air masses sampled during the flights using the analysis of back trajectories as well as a convective proxy from cloud-top temperature fields derived from a geostationary satellite. The results obtained from this analysis were put into the context of large-scale transport and aerosol distribution using GEOS-Chem chemical transport model simulations. The first flight in summer 2017 which sampled an air mass within the Asian monsoon anticyclone (AMA), influenced by convection over Western China, was associated with particle size diameters from 0.05 to 0.15 pm. In contrast, the second flight sampled air masses at the edge of the AMA associated with a larger particle size radius (> 2 mu m) with a higher NO2- concentration. The sampled air masses in winter 2018 were likely affected by smoke from the Pacific Northwest fire event in Canada, which occurred 7 months before our campaign, associated with concentration enhancements of SO42- and Ca2+. Overall, our results suggest that nitrogen-containing particles represent a large fraction of cloud-free and in-cloud aerosols populating the ATAL, which is partially in agreement with the results from aircraft measurements during the StratoClim (Stratospheric and upper tropospheric processes for better climate predictions) campaign. The exact nature of those particles is still unknown, but their coincidences with subvisible cirrus clouds and their sizes suggest nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) as a possible candidate, as NAT has already been observed in the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere in other studies. Furthermore, GEOS-Chem model simulations indicate that lightning NOx emissions could have significantly impacted the production of nitrate aerosols sampled during the summer of 2017.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000575027",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-12675-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575027","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Exploring the inorganic composition of the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer using medium-duration balloon flights","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-10T11:30:07Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85140598529",,"000861375100001","Atmos. chem. phys.","18","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The large-scale circulation during this period was remarkably persistent, with an extremely meridionally amplified flow over Europe. Recurrent blocking over the Baltic and Rossby wave breaking in the North Atlantic led to frequent heavy precipitation in Western Europe and the Black Sea and to warm and dry conditions over Eastern Europe. These conditions persisted for a month as the blocks and wave breaking episodes strengthened one another, while three closely spaced extratropical transitions of tropical cyclones in the eastern North Atlantic led to recurrent amplification of the jet.

Previous studies showed that projections of the wintertime zonally averaged polar vortex strength diverge widely between climate models with no agreement on the sign of change, and that this uncertainty contributes to the regional climate change uncertainty. Here, we show that there remains large uncertainty in the projected strength of the polar vortex in experiments with global warming levels ranging from moderate (SSP245 runs) to large (Abrupt-4xCO2 runs), and that the uncertainty maximizes in winter. Partitioning of the uncertainty in wintertime polar vortex strength projections reveals that, by the end of the 21st century, model uncertainty contributes half of the total uncertainty, with scenario uncertainty contributing only 10%. Regression analysis shows that up to 20% of the intermodel spread in projected precipitation over the Iberian Peninsula and northwestern US, and 20%–30% in near-surface temperature over western US and northern Eurasian, can be associated with the spread in vortex strength projections after accounting for global warming. While changes in the magnitude and sign of the zonally averaged vortex strength are uncertain, most models (>95%) predict an eastward shift of the vortex by 8°–20° degrees in longitude relative to its historical location with the magnitude of the shift increasing for larger global warming levels. There is less agreement across models on a latitudinal shift, whose direction and magnitude correlate with changes in the zonally averaged vortex strength so that vortex weakening/strengthening corresponds to a southward/poleward shift.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000572588",,"0148-0227||2169-897X","10.1029/2022JD036992","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572588","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","stratospheric polar vortex||climate models||climate uncertainty||regional climate change","Northern Hemisphere Stratosphere-Troposphere Circulation Change in CMIP6 Models: 1.

This study presents a systematic 5-year climatology of different foehn types. The classification relies on 2329 foehn hours, which are diagnosed using a station-based foehn index for Altdorf in the Swiss Reuss Valley. Operational analyses at 1km horizontal resolution are employed to classify foehn hours with a decision tree that is based on foehn forecasting experience. Mean wind direction and speed in a circle with 100km radius centred around Altdorf are considered to differentiate between three main foehn types (deep foehn, shallow foehn, gegenstrom foehn). In addition, upstream precipitation and its extent beyond the Alpine crest are used to distinguish three deep-foehn subtypes (dry foehn, moist foehn, dimmer foehn). The main foehn types differ distinctively in the synoptic conditions over the Alps. During deep foehn, pronounced southwesterlies ahead of an upper-level trough induce upstream orographic precipitation. Shallow foehn, in turn, is associated with cross-Alpine temperature differences that provoke a gap flow. The gegenstrom-foehn type is also restricted to major gaps, but a strong westerly flow prevails above crest level. The deep-foehn subtypes primarily differ in terms of the upper-level trough. While a weaker trough and the influence of an upper-level ridge over the Mediterranean inhibit precipitation (dry foehn), a deeper trough which is closer to the Alps induces stronger crest-level winds and intense precipitation on the Alpine south side (dimmer foehn). The different foehn types are found to strongly affect the local characteristics at Altdorf, which are investigated using station measurements. Backward trajectories from Altdorf are calculated for each of the foehn hours and used to define three clusters of air parcels depending upon their upstream thermodynamic evolution. Trajectories in cluster 1 are diabatically heated and transported within a low-level easterly barrier jet in the Po Valley prior to their ascent to crest level. They constitute the main precipitating airstream and, hence, are of key importance for moist foehn and dimmer foehn. Cluster-2 and cluster-3 trajectories are subject to weak diabatic heating or even diabatic cooling. They originate from southerly to southwesterly regions and from either slightly below or above crest level. Accordingly, these air parcels are associated with little to no precipitation, and as such, they take a key role for dry foehn, shallow foehn and gegenstrom foehn. Furthermore, these three foehn types feature a pronounced stable layer over the Po Valley, which, to some extent, inhibits air parcels to ascend from lower levels. In summary, the study introduces a systematic classification of south foehn using state-of-the-art data sets. It concludes by setting the new classification into a historic context and revisiting the rich body of literature with respect to different Alpine south-foehn types. In particular, analogies to and discrepancies with the existing conceptual models of ""Swiss foehn""and ""Austrian foehn""are discussed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000579147",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-3-1113-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/579147","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Classification of Alpine south foehn based on 5 years of kilometre-scale analysis data","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-03T04:42:54Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Foehn Dynamics - Lagrangian Analysis and Large-Eddy Simulation","181992","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85140653766",,,"Weather Clim.

Yet, the climate effect of individual LCLMC options, their dependence on the background climate, and the local vs. non-local responses are still poorly understood across different Earth system models (ESMs). Here we simulate the climatic effects of LCLMC using three state-of-the-art ESMs, including the Community Earth System Model (CESM), the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM), and the European Consortium Earth System Model (EC-EARTH). We assess the LCLMC effects using four idealized experiments: (i) a fully afforested world, (ii) a world fully covered by cropland, (iii) a fully afforested world with extensive wood harvesting, and (iv) a full cropland world with extensive irrigation. In these idealized sensitivity experiments performed under present-day climate conditions, the effects of the different LCLMC strategies represent an upper bound for the potential of global mitigation and local adaptation. To disentangle the local and non-local effects from the LCLMC, a checkerboard-like LCLMC perturbation, i.e. alternating grid boxes with and without LCLMC, is applied. The local effects of deforestation on surface temperature are largely consistent across the ESMs and the observations, with a cooling in boreal latitudes and a warming in the tropics. However, the energy balance components driving the change in surface temperature show less consistency across the ESMs and the observations. Additionally, some biases exist in specific ESMs, such as a strong albedo response in CESM mid-latitudes and a soil-thawing-driven warming in boreal latitudes in EC-EARTH. The non-local effects on surface temperature are broadly consistent across ESMs for afforestation, though larger model uncertainty exists for cropland expansion. Irrigation clearly induces a cooling effect; however, the ESMs disagree regarding whether these are mainly local or non-local effects. Wood harvesting is found to have no discernible biogeophysical effects on climate. Our results overall underline the potential of ensemble simulations to inform decision-making regarding future climate consequences of land-based mitigation and adaptation strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000572587",,"2190-4987||2190-4979","10.5194/esd-13-1305-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572587","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The biogeophysical effects of idealized land cover and land management changes in Earth system models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-26T04:26:03Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85140386453",,"000855755700001",,"3","Earth System Dynamics","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We test different emulator configurations and find that driving the emulations with global mean surface temperature offers an optimal compromise between model complexity and performance.

In atmospheric and climate modelling, such parameters are utilised to parameterise the effect of terrain geometry on radiation exchanges between the surface and the atmosphere. Ideally, these parameters are derived from a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) because inferring them from coarser elevation data induces a smoothing effect. Computing topographic horizon with conventional algorithms, however, is slow because large amounts of non-local terrain data have to be processed. We propose a new and more efficient method, which is based on a high-performance ray-tracing library. The new algorithm can speed up horizon calculation by 2 orders of magnitude relative to a conventional approach. By applying terrain simplification to remote topography, the ray-tracing-based algorithm can also be applied with very high-resolution (< 5 m) DEM data, which would otherwise induce an excessive memory footprint. The topographic horizon algorithm is accompanied by an SVF algorithm, which was verified to work accurately for all terrain - even very steep and complex terrain. We compare the computational performance and accuracy of the new horizon algorithm with two reference methods from the literature and illustrate its benefits. Finally, we illustrate how sub-grid SVF values can be efficiently computed with the newly derived horizon algorithm for a wide range of target grid resolutions (1-25 km).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000570469",,"1991-9603||1991-959X","10.5194/gmd-15-6817-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/570469","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"HORAYZON v1.2: an efficient and flexible ray-tracing algorithm to compute horizon and sky view factor","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-14T03:20:52Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Dependable and Data-Driven Intelligent Networks","ETH-03 19-2","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,,"85140410867",,"000850933500001","Geosci. model dev.","17","Geoscientific Model Development","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The efficacy of this method was presented in several general circulation model (GCM) studies that showed widely varied radiative responses, originating in part from the differences in the representation of cirrus ice microphysics between the different GCMs. The recent implementation of a new, more physically based ice microphysics scheme (Predicted Particle Properties, P3) that abandons ice hydrometeor size class separation into the ECHAM-HAM GCM, coupled to a new approach for calculating cloud fractions that increases the relative humidity (RH) thresholds for cirrus cloud formation, motivated a reassessment of CCT efficacy. In this study, we first compared CCT sensitivity between the new cloud fraction approach and the original ECHAM-HAM cloud fraction approach. Consistent with previous approaches using ECHAM-HAM, with the P3 scheme and the higher RH thresholds for cirrus cloud formation, we do not find a significant cooling response in any of our simulations. The most notable response from our extreme case is the reduction in the maximum global-mean net top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative anomalies from overseeding by about 50 %, from 9.9 W m−2 with the original cloud fraction approach down to 4.9 W m−2 using the new cloud fraction RH thresholds that allow partial grid-box coverage of cirrus clouds above ice saturation, unlike the original approach. Even with this reduction with the updated cloud fraction approach, the TOA anomalies from overseeding far exceed those reported in previous studies. We attribute the large positive TOA anomalies to seeding particles overtaking both homogeneous nucleation and heterogeneous nucleation on mineral dust particles within cirrus clouds to produce more numerous and smaller ice crystals. This effect is amplified by longer ice residence times in clouds due to the slower removal of ice via sedimentation in the P3 scheme. In an effort to avoid this overtaking effect of seeding particles, we increased the default critical ice saturation ratio (Si,seed) for ice nucleation on seeding particles from the default value of 1.05 to 1.35 in a second sensitivity test. With the higher Si,seed we drastically reduce overseeding, which suggests that Si,seed is a key factor to consider for future CCT studies. However, the global-mean TOA anomalies contain high uncertainty. In response, we examined the TOA anomalies regionally and found that specific regions only show a small potential for targeted CCT, which is partially enhanced by using the larger Si,seed. Finally, in a seasonal analysis of TOA responses to CCT, we find that our results do not confirm the previous finding that high-latitude wintertime seeding is a feasible strategy to enhance CCT efficacy, as seeding in our model enhances the already positive cirrus longwave cloud radiative effect for most of our simulations. Our results also show feedbacks on lower-lying mixed-phase and liquid clouds through the reduction in ice crystal sedimentation that reduces cloud droplet depletion and results in stronger cloud albedo effects. However, this is outweighed by stronger longwave trapping from cirrus clouds with more numerous and smaller ice crystals. Therefore, we conclude that CCT is unlikely to act as a feasible climate intervention strategy on a global scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000570245",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-11455-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/570245","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Cirrus cloud thinning using a more physically based ice microphysics scheme in the ECHAM-HAM general circulation model","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-13T06:18:41Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Advancing the Science for Aviation and ClimAte","875036","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85140306413",,"000850452400001","Atmos. chem. phys.","17","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The consecutive occurrence of HDs and HNs (COHs) is often used as a measure of the persistence of an extremely hot spell. Nonetheless, the combined effect of air temperature and relative humidity on the changing COHs has never been studied. In this paper, we use an ensemble of global climate models and multiple thermal indices to robustly examine the combined effect of air temperature and relative humidity on COHs globally on an hourly basis. Our findings reveal that COHs show an increasing trend in the future and a strong latitudinal gradient increasing from high latitudes to the equator. Compared to COHs based on air temperature, the frequency of COHs based on perceived temperature is amplified by the combined effects of high temperature and humidity for both boreal and austral summers. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we examine two different diurnal temperature ranges (DTRs), derived from air temperature and perceived temperature, for their corresponding types of COHs. Both DTRs are projected to increase in the future relative to the historical period from 1980 to 2004, but the DTR changes derived from perceived temperature are consistently larger than those derived from air temperature. Due to the nonlinearity in thermal indices, the perceived temperature in HDs and HNs rising faster than air temperature leads to a larger increase in perceived COHs.

Sites for next-generation telescopes are chosen decades before the first light of a telescope. Site selection is usually based on recent measurements over a period that is too short to account for long-term changes in observing conditions such as those arising from anthropogenic climate change. For astronomical facilities with a typical lifetime of 30 yr, it is therefore essential to be aware of climate evolution to optimise observing time. Aims. In this study, we analyse trends in astronomical observing conditions for eight sites. Most sites either already host telescopes that provide in situ measurements of weather parameters or are candidates for hosting next-generation telescopes. For a fine representation of orography, we use the highest resolution global climate model (GCM) ensemble available provided by the high-resolution model intercomparison project and developed as part of the European Union Horizon 2020 PRIMAVERA project. Methods. We evaluate atmosphere-only and coupled PRIMAVERA GCM historical simulations against in situ measurements and the fifth generation atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) of the European centre for medium-range weather forecasts for the period 1979-2014. The projections of changes in current site conditions are then analysed for the period 2015-2050 using PRIMAVERA future climate simulations. Results. Over most sites, we find that PRIMAVERA GCMs show a good agreement in temperature, specific humidity, and precipitable water vapour compared to in situ observations and ERA5. The ability of PRIMAVERA to simulate those variables increases confidence in their projections. For those variables, the model ensemble projects an increasing trend for all sites, which will result in progressively poorer astronomical observing conditions compared to current conditions. On the other hand, no significant trends are projected for relative humidity, cloud cover, or astronomical seeing and PRIMAVERA does not simulate these variables well compared to observations and reanalyses. Therefore, there is little confidence in these projections. Conclusions. Our results show that climate change will negatively impact the quality of astronomical observations and is likely to increase time lost due to bad site conditions. We stress that it is essential for astronomers to include long-term climate projections in their process for site selection and monitoring. We show that high-resolution GCMs can be used to analyse the effect of climate change on site characteristics of next-generation telescopes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000575939",,"0004-6361||1432-0746","10.1051/0004-6361/202142493","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575939","en","EDP Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","site testing||telescopes||Earth||methods: data analysis||astronomical databases: miscellaneous","Impact of climate change on site characteristics of eight major astronomical observatories using high-resolution global climate projections until 2050","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-14T06:12:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"NCCR PlanetS: 3rd funding phase||NCCR PlanetS – Funding of Equipment for the LIFE project","205606||182901","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","NCCR (NFS)||NCCR (NFS)",,,,"85140138241",,"000857191500005","Astron.

The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) has been actively grappling with how to build such trust: provision of demonstrably independent assessments of the quality of products, which was deemed an important element in such trust-building processes. C3S provides access to essential climate variables (ECVs) from multiple sources to a broad set of users ranging from scientists to private companies and decision-makers. Here we outline the approach undertaken to coherently assess the quality of a suite of observation- and reanalysis-based ECV products covering the atmosphere, ocean, land, and cryosphere. The assessment is based on four pillars: basic data checks, maturity of the datasets, fitness for purpose (scientific use cases and climate studies), and guidance to users. It is undertaken independently by scientific experts and presented alongside the datasets in a fully traceable, replicable, and transparent manner. The methodology deployed is detailed, and example assessments are given. These independent scientific quality assessments are intended to guide users to ensure they use tools and datasets that are fit for purpose to answer their specific needs rather than simply use the first product they alight on. This is the first such effort to develop and apply an assessment framework consistently to all ECVs. Lessons learned and future perspectives are outlined to potentially improve future assessment activities and thus climate services.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000579746",,"0003-0007||1520-0477","10.1175/BAMS-D-21-0109.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/579746","en","American Meteorological Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Climate records||Quality assurance/control||Satellite observations||Reanalysis data||Climate services","Independent Quality Assessment of Essential Climate Variables: Lessons Learned from the Copernicus Climate Change Service","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-07T09:29:11Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85140885236",,"000886046300004","BAMS","9","Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society","103","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Nonetheless, the attribution of observed permafrost warming to anthropogenic climate change has relied mostly on qualitative evidence. Here, we compare long permafrost temperature records from 15 boreholes in the northern hemisphere to simulated ground temperatures from Earth system models contributing to CMIP6 using a climate change detection and attribution approach. We show that neither pre-industrial climate variability nor natural drivers of climate change suffice to explain the observed warming in permafrost temperature averaged over all boreholes. However, simulations are consistent with observations if the effects of human emissions on the global climate system are considered. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the effect of anthropogenic climate change on permafrost temperature is detectable at some of the boreholes. Thus, the presented evidence supports the conclusion that anthropogenic climate change is the key driver of northern hemisphere permafrost warming.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000572444",,"1748-9326||1748-9318","10.1088/1748-9326/ac8ec2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572444","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","permafrost||global warming||detection and attribution","Attributing observed permafrost warming in the northern hemisphere to anthropogenic climate change","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-23T03:03:41Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Paris Agreement Overshooting - Reversibility, Climate Impacts and Adaptation Needs","101003687","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85138605352",,"000854076200001","Environ.

This study simulates a typical cloud-processing condition (at 228 K) for size-selected (200 and 400 nm) aviation soot proxies with different organic contents. Based on the particle size, mass and morphology changes, as well as the findings from parallel studies on similar soot samples, we demonstrate that cloud-processing increases the particle compactness and water-interaction ability. However, the pore availability change resulting from above property changes dominates the IN ability of cloud-processed particles via PCF. Even originally organic-rich and hydrophobic soot particles can nucleate ice via PCF if suitable pores can be generated after organic removal and cloud-processing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000569861",,"0094-8276||1944-8007","10.1029/2022GL099869","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/569861","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ice nucleation||cloud processing||soot||volatile content||thermal denuding||pore condensation and freezing","Impacts of Simulated Contrail Processing and Organic Content Change on the Ice Nucleation of Soot Particles","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-09T18:12:57Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85137698314",,"000848219000001","Geophys.

They generally encompass a combination of dynamic and thermodynamic processes, as well as drivers external to the climate system, such as anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and land use change. Here we present the ExtremeX multi-model intercomparison experiment, which was designed to investigate the contribution of dynamic and thermodynamic processes to recent weather and climate extremes. The numerical experiments are performed with three Earth system models: CESM, MIROC, and EC-Earth. They include control experiments with interactive atmosphere and land surface conditions, as well as experiments wherein the atmospheric circulation, soil moisture, or both are constrained using observation-based data. The temporal evolution and magnitude of temperature anomalies during heatwaves are well represented in the experiments with a constrained atmosphere. However, the magnitude of mean climatological biases in temperature and precipitation are not greatly reduced in any of the constrained experiments due to persistent or newly introduced biases. This highlights the importance of error compensations and tuning in the standard model versions. To show one possible application, ExtremeX is used to identify the main drivers of heatwaves and warm spells. The results reveal that both atmospheric circulation patterns and soil moisture conditions substantially contribute to the occurrence of these events. Soil moisture effects are particularly important in the tropics, the monsoon areas, and the Great Plains of the United States, whereas atmospheric circulation effects are major drivers in other midlatitude and high-latitude regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000568695",,"2190-4987||2190-4979","10.5194/esd-13-1167-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/568695","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The ExtremeX global climate model experiment: investigating thermodynamic and dynamic processes contributing to weather and climate extremes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-04T05:24:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate","617518","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,"85137843320",,"000844113900001",,"3","Earth System Dynamics","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

R-d, the direct beam from the sun, is essential for concentrated solar power generation. R-f, scattered by atmospheric molecules, aerosols, or cloud droplets, has a fertilization effect on plant photosynthesis. But how R-d and R-f change diurnally is largely unknown owing to the lack of long-term measurements. Taking advantage of 22 years of homogeneous hourly surface observations over China, this study documents the climatological means and evolutions in the diurnal cycles of R-d and R-f since 1993, with an emphasis on their implications for solar power and agricultural production. Over the solar energy resource region, we observe a loss of R-d which is relatively large near sunrise and sunset at low solar elevation angles when the sunrays pass through the atmosphere on a longer pathway. However, the concentrated R-d energy covering an average 10-hr period around noon during a day is relatively unaffected. Over the agricultural crop resource region, the large amounts of clouds and aerosols scattering more of the incoming light result in R-f taking the main proportion of R-s during the whole day.

Air-sea fluxes in the extratropics are modulated by the large-scale atmospheric flow, for instance by the advection of warm and moist air masses in the warm sector of extratropical cyclones. A distinct isotopic composition of the water vapour in the latter environment has been observed over the Southern Ocean during the 2016/2017 Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). Most prominently, the secondary isotope variable deuterium excess (d =delta H-2-8 center dot delta O-18) shows negative values in the cyclones' warm sector. In this study, three mechanisms are proposed and evaluated to explain these observed negative d values. We present three single-process air parcel models, which simulate the evolution of delta H-2, delta O-18, d and specific humidity in an air parcel induced by decreasing ocean evaporation, dew deposition and upstream cloud formation. Simulations with the isotope-enabled numerical weather prediction model COSMOiso, which have previously been validated using observations from the ACE campaign, are used to (i) validate the air parcel models, (ii) quantify the relevance of the three processes for stable water isotopes in the warm sector of the investigated extratropical cyclone and (iii) study the extent of non-linear interactions between the different processes. This analysis shows that we are able to simulate the evolution of d during the air parcel's transport in a realistic way with the mechanistic approach of using single-process air parcel models. Most importantly, we find that decreasing ocean evaporation and dew deposition lead to the strongest d decrease in near-surface water vapour in the warm sector and that upstream cloud formation plays a minor role. By analysing COSMOiso backward trajectories we show that the persistent low d values observed in the warm sector of extratropical cyclones are not a result of material conservation of low d. Instead, the latter Eulerian feature is sustained by the continuous production of low d values due to air-sea interactions in new air parcels entering the warm sector. These results improve our understanding of the relative importance of air-sea interaction and boundary layer cloud formation on the stable water isotope variability of near-surface marine boundary layer water vapour. To elucidate the role of hydrometeor-vapour interactions for the stable water isotope variability in the upper parts of the marine boundary layer, future studies should focus on high-resolution vertical isotope profiles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000565383",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","c","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/565383","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Disentangling the impact of air-sea interaction and boundary layer cloud formation on stable water isotope signals in the warm sector of a Southern Ocean cyclone","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-23T05:00:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000839609800001","Atmos. chem. phys.","15","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The predominant moisture contribution comes from the mid-latitude regions, including the Mediterranean/Caspian Seas and Mediterranean land. Second, we establish that several tropical and extratropical forcings display a sub-seasonally fluctuating influence on precipitation distribution over the region during the cold season. Many of them varyingly interact, so their impacts cannot be explained independently or at seasonal timescales.

The impacts derived from climate models are poorly constrained by observations because retrieving robust large-scale signals of aerosol–cloud interactions is frequently hampered by the considerable noise associated with meteorological co-variability. The 2014 Holuhraun effusive eruption in Iceland resulted in a massive aerosol plume in an otherwise near-pristine environment and thus provided an ideal natural experiment to quantify cloud responses to aerosol perturbations. Here we disentangle significant signals from the noise of meteorological co-variability using a satellite-based machine-learning approach. Our analysis shows that aerosols from the eruption increased cloud cover by approximately 10%, and this appears to be the leading cause of climate forcing, rather than cloud brightening as previously thought. We find that volcanic aerosols do brighten clouds by reducing droplet size, but this has a notably smaller radiative impact than changes in cloud fraction. These results add substantial observational constraints on the cooling impact of aerosols. Such constraints are critical for improving climate models, which still inadequately represent the complex macro-physical and microphysical impacts of aerosol–cloud interactions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000561341",,"1752-0908||1752-0894","10.1038/s41561-022-00991-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/561341","en","Nature","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Aerosol-cloud interactions||Climate change||Machine learning||Aerosol's fingerprint on clouds","Machine learning reveals climate forcing from aerosols is dominated by increased cloud cover","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-02T09:52:41Z","2023-01-31",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85135278243",,"000834732800002","Nat.

Clear-sky data is usually derived from all-sky irradiances using one of several clear-sky methods proposed in the literature. However, most of the available clear-sky methods require additional in situ measurements and/or high temporal resolution (sub-daily), which restricts the derivation of clear-sky time series to a few well equipped stations. Here we propose a new clear-sky identification method that aims to overcome this problem, with the ultimate goal of deriving multidecadal clear-sky trends for many sites globally. The method uses site specific monthly transmittance thresholds to derive long term clear-sky time series for any station worldwide that has daily mean irradiance data. We exemplify the method for 24 stations. Transmittance thresholds are derived by combining 29 years (1990-2018) of satellite cloud cover data with in situ irradiance measurements. The thresholds are then applied to the whole time series (independent of satellite data availability) to screen out cloudy days. Comparison of our results with reference data derived using Long and Ackerman's (2000, https://doi. org/10.1029/2000jd900077) method shows good agreement after bias correction, especially for decadal trends. While limitations of the method, such as anomalies representation, are highlighted and discussed, validation results encourage its use to derive long term clear-sky time series and associated decadal-scale trends around the globe.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000566947",,"2333-5084","10.1029/2021EA002197","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566947","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"A Method for Clear-Sky Identification and Lone-Term Trends Assessment Using Daily Surface Solar Radiation Records","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-28T05:28:58Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: causes of decadal changes of solar radiation","188601","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85136889703",,"000842423100001",,"8","Earth and Space Science","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Both primary ice formation via ice-nucleating particles (INPs) and secondary ice production (SIP) within MPCs are unconstrained, not least because of the lack of atmospheric observations. In the past decades, advanced remote sensing methods have emerged which provide high-resolution data of aerosol and cloud properties and could be key in understanding microphysical processes on a global scale. In this study, we retrieved INP concentrations and ice multiplication factors (IMFs) in wintertime orographic clouds using active remote sensing and in situ observations obtained during the RACLETS campaign in the Swiss Alps. INP concentrations in air masses dominated by Saharan dust and continental aerosol were retrieved from a polarization Raman lidar and validated with aerosol and INP in situ observations on a mountaintop. A calibration factor of 0.0204 for the global INP parameterization by DeMott et al. (2010) is derived by comparing in situ aerosol and INP measurements, improving the INP concentration retrieval for continental aerosols. Based on combined lidar and radar measurements, the ice crystal number concentration and ice water content were retrieved and validated with balloon-borne in situ observations, which agreed with the balloon-borne in situ observations within an order of magnitude. For seven cloud cases the ice multiplication factors (IMFs), defined as the quotient of the ice crystal number concentration to the INP concentration, were calculated. The median IMF was around 80, and SIP was active (defined as IMFs > 1) nearly 85 % of the time. SIP was found to be active at all observed temperatures (−30 to −5 °C), with the highest IMFs between −20 and −5 °C. The introduced methodology could be extended to larger datasets to better understand the impact of SIP not only over the Alps but also at other locations and for other cloud types.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000563308",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-9767-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563308","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Retrieving ice-nucleating particle concentration and ice multiplication factors using active remote sensing validated by in situ observations","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-12T03:22:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Exploiting orographic clouds for constraining the sources of ice crystals","175824","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85136219099",,"000835525000001","Atmos. chem. phys.","15","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we track blocks as upper-level negative potential vorticity (PV) anomalies and apply a Lagrangian analysis to 100 years of present-day (∼2000) and future (∼2100, under the RCP8.5 scenario) climate simulations restarted from the Community Earth System Model–Large Ensemble Project runs (CESM-LENS) to identify different physical processes and quantify how their relative importance changes in a warmer and more humid climate. The trajectories reveal two contrasting airstreams that both contribute to the formation and maintenance of blocking: latent heating in strongly ascending airstreams (moist processes) and quasi-adiabatic flow near the tropopause with weak radiative cooling (dry processes). Both are reproduced remarkably well when compared against ERA-Interim reanalysis, and their relative importance varies regionally and seasonally. The response of blocks to climate change is complex and differs regionally, with a general increase in the importance of moist processes due to stronger latent heating (+1 K in the median over the Northern Hemisphere) and a larger fraction (+15%) of strongly heated warm conveyor belt air masses, most pronounced over the storm tracks. Future blocks become larger (+7%) and their negative PV anomaly slightly intensifies (+0.8%). Using a Theil–Sen regression model, we propose that the increase in size and intensity is related to the increase in latent heating, resulting in stronger cross-isentropic transport of air with low PV into the blocking anticyclones. Our findings provide evidence that moist processes become more important for the large-scale atmospheric circulation in the midlatitudes, with the potential for larger and more intense blocks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000561766",,"1748-9326||1748-9318","10.1088/1748-9326/ac81af","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/561766","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","atmospheric blocking||latent heating||moist and dry processes||air parcel trajectories||climate change||extreme weather||ensemble climate simulations","Response of moist and dry processes in atmospheric blocking to climate change","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-04T04:56:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Effects of latent heat release on atmospheric blocking: process understanding, model evaluation and potential impacts of climate change","ETH-09 15-2","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,,"85135159384",,"000830786000001","Environ.

Europe has a well-established air quality research infrastructure from which yearlong datasets using 21 aerosol chemical speciation monitors (ACSMs) and 1 aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) were gathered during 2013–2019. It includes 9 non-urban and 13 urban sites. This study developed a state-of-the-art source apportionment protocol to analyse long-term OA mass spectrum data by applying the most advanced source apportionment strategies (i.e., rolling PMF, ME-2, and bootstrap). This harmonised protocol was followed strictly for all 22 datasets, making the source apportionment results more comparable. In addition, it enables quantification of the most common OA components such as hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), cooking-like OA (COA), more oxidised-oxygenated OA (MO-OOA), and less oxidised-oxygenated OA (LO-OOA). Other components such as coal combustion OA (CCOA), solid fuel OA (SFOA: mainly mixture of coal and peat combustion), cigarette smoke OA (CSOA), sea salt (mostly inorganic but part of the OA mass spectrum), coffee OA, and ship industry OA could also be separated at a few specific sites. Oxygenated OA (OOA) components make up most of the submicron OA mass (average = 71.1%, range from 43.7 to 100%). Solid fuel combustion-related OA components (i.e., BBOA, CCOA, and SFOA) are still considerable with in total 16.0% yearly contribution to the OA, yet mainly during winter months (21.4%). Overall, this comprehensive protocol works effectively across all sites governed by different sources and generates robust and consistent source apportionment results. Our work presents a comprehensive overview of OA sources in Europe with a unique combination of high time resolution (30–240 min) and long-term data coverage (9–36 months), providing essential information to improve/validate air quality, health impact, and climate models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000554996",,"0160-4120||1873-6750","10.1016/j.envint.2022.107325","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/554996","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","European overview||Source apportionment||Harmonised protocol||Organic aerosol||Long-term datasets||Rolling PMF","European aerosol phenomenology − 8: Harmonised source apportionment of organic aerosol using 22 Year-long ACSM/AMS datasets","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-27T21:57:05Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constrained aerosol forcing for improved climate projections","821205","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85132343841",,"000836802300001","Environ.

Hence, successful predictions of these stratospheric events can be beneficial for extendedrange weather prediction. However, the predictability of extreme stratospheric events is most often limited to around 2 weeks or less. The predictability strongly differs within events of the same type and also between event types. The reasons for the observed differences in the predictability, however, are not resolved. We extend the analysis of the predictability of stratospheric extreme events to include wind deceleration and acceleration events, with SSW and strong vortex events as subsets, to conduct a systematic comparison of sub-seasonal predictability between events in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) prediction system. Events of stronger magnitude are found to be less predictable than weaker events for both wind deceleration and acceleration events, with both types of events showing a close to linear dependence of predictability on event magnitude. There are, however, deviations from this linear behaviour for very strong magnitude events. The difficulties of the prediction system in predicting extremely strong anomalies can be traced to a poor predictability of extreme wave activity fluxes in the lower stratosphere, which impacts the prediction of deceleration events and, interestingly, also acceleration events. Our study suggests that improvements in the understanding of the wave amplification that is associated with extremely strong wave activity fluxes and accurately representing these processes in the model are expected to enhance the predictability of stratospheric extreme events and, by extension, their impacts on surface weather and climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000559977",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-3-755-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/559977","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Differences in the sub-seasonal predictability of extreme stratospheric events","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-26T03:08:38Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85134411659",,,"Weather Clim.

Here we examine the role of cyclones and potential vorticity (PV) cutoffs for unusually long wet spells in Europe, defined as the 20 longest uninterrupted periods with at least 5 mm daily accumulated precipitation at each ERA-Interim grid point in Europe (this set of spells is hereafter referred to as S20). The S20 occur predominantly in summer over the eastern continent, in winter over the North Atlantic, in winter or fall over the Atlantic coast, and in fall over the Mediterranean and European inland seas. Four case studies reveal distinct archetypal synoptic storylines for long wet spells: (a) a 7 d wet spell near Moscow, Russia, is associated with a single slow-moving cutoff-cyclone couple; (b) a 15 d wet spell in Norway features a total of nine rapidly passing extratropical cyclones and illustrates serial cyclone clustering as a second storyline; (c) a 12 d wet spell in Tuscany, Italy, is associated with a single but very large cutoff complex, which is replenished multiple times by a sequence of recurrent anticyclonic wave breaking events over the North Atlantic and western Europe; and (d) a 17 d wet spell in the Balkans features intermittent periods of diurnal convection in an environment of weak synoptic forcing and recurrent passages of cutoffs and thus also highlights the role of diurnal convection for long wet spells over land. A systematic analysis of cyclone and cutoff occurrences during the S20 across Europe reveals considerable spatial variability in their respective role for the S20. For instance, cyclones are present anywhere between 10 % and 90 % and cutoffs between 20 % and 70 % of the S20 time steps, depending on the geographical region. However, overall both cyclones and cutoffs appear in a larger number and at a higher rate during the S20 compared to climatology. Furthermore, in the Mediterranean, cutoffs and cyclones are significantly more persistent during the S20 compared to climatology. Our study thus documents for the first time the palette of synoptic storylines accompanying unusually long wet spells across Europe, which is a prerequisite for developing an understanding of how these events might change in a warming climate and for evaluating the ability of climate models to realistically simulate the synoptic processes relevant to these events.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000559698",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-3-733-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/559698","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The role of cyclones and potential vorticity cutoffs for the occurrence of unusually long wet spells in Europe","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-24T03:13:54Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons||Lagrangian analysis of ice cloud formation pathways and their isotopic signals in high-resolution COSMO-iso simulations of the African and Asian monsoon||The role of PV cutoff reabsorption for atmospheric predictability","787652||177996||ETH-07 16-2","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100003006","EC||SNF||ETHZ","H2020||PIRE||ETH Grants",,,,"85134202008",,,"Weather Clim.

Different physical processes can contribute to the temperature anomaly associated with heatwaves. Previous studies have shown that increased solar radiation and adiabatic heating associated with blocking systems and local land–atmosphere coupling are important drivers of summer heatwaves. Less is known about the fundamental role of atmospheric large-scale dynamics and topography in generating heatwaves. Here, we perform idealized model simulations where all physical parameterisations are substituted by a simple zonally symmetric temperature relaxation scheme. This allows us to characterize the dynamical processes involved in the life cycle of heatwaves occurring at different latitudes. We find that blocking plays an active role in the life cycle of high- and midlatitude heatwaves, while blocking is less relevant for low-latitude heatwaves. Rossby-wave packets are the dominant drivers for midlatitude heatwaves, with horizontal advection being the main mechanism leading to heat extremes. Heatwaves exhibit a higher persistence and frequency near the pole and Equator compared with the midlatitudes, but a higher intensity in the midlatitudes compared with higher and lower latitudes. Topography located along the midlatitude jet has the largest impact on the heatwave distribution around the planet, resulting in increased heatwave frequency upstream for moderate topographic forcing and a circumglobal increase for topographic elevations above 6 km. Identifying the most relevant processes driving heatwaves can potentially benefit the prediction and representation of extreme events in operational weather and climate forecast systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000556844",,"0035-9009||1477-870X","10.1002/qj.4306","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/556844","en","Royal Meteorological Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Atmospheric dynamics||Blocking heatwaves||Idealized modeling||Jet latitude||Topography","The role of atmospheric dynamics and large‐scale topography in driving heatwaves","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-07T15:00:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application||Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events","170523||198896","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,,"85133463323",,"000821487400001","Q.

Recent studies about the physical mechanisms question the traditional thermodynamic foehn theory, pointing out the potential role of adiabatic descent and other diabatic processes, besides upstream latent heating in clouds, for the warming. This study applies a kilometre-scale simulation together with online trajectories and a Lagrangian heat budget to investigate the foehn air warming for an intense, long-lasting Alpine south foehn period in November 2016. Thereby, the focus lies on the attribution of the warming to adiabatic descent and the different diabatic processes in six foehn valleys, as well as the linkage of the warming processes to different airstreams. Overall, adiabatic warming emerges as the most important process for 57% of all air parcels arriving in the foehn valleys. However, upstream latent heating in clouds is the dominant mechanism for a considerable amount of air parcels (35%). The heat budget analysis reveals a clear transition along the Alps from west to east, whereat diabatic warming constitutes the driving mechanism for western valleys during the central phase of the event, and adiabatic warming dominates the foehn air warming in eastern valleys. The foehn trajectories can be separated into different air-stream categories according to their diabatic temperature change. Air parcels experiencing strong diabatic heating are transported in an easterly barrier jet in the Po Valley before crossing the Alpine crest. Air parcels experiencing diabatic cooling, in contrast, are advected quasi-horizontally from the south towards the Alpine crest prior to their descent. The relative strength of the different airstreams therefore determines the dominating warming process. These findings strongly point to the combined importance of adiabatic and diabatic warming mechanisms, which co-occur with varying relative contributions, depending on the valley and time period of the event.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000551470",,"0035-9009||1477-870X","10.1002/qj.4285","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551470","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","airstreams||Alpine south foehn||Foehn air warming||Lagrangian heat budget||trajectories","Thermodynamics and airstreams of a south foehn event in different Alpine valleys","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-08T16:46:42Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Foehn Dynamics - Lagrangian Analysis and Large-Eddy Simulation","181992","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85130896194",,"000802215400001","Q.

Weather regimes are one way to quantify this variability, but so far, their applications to energy research have focused on wind power generation in winter. However, the projected growth of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity implies that its absolute variability across the continent will grow substantially. Here we combine weather regimes based on ERA5 reanalysis data with country-specific capacity factors to investigate multiday PV generation variability in Europe. With current installed capacity (131 GW), total PV production in Europe (52.3 GW) varies by 0.9 GW on average, with a maximum change of 3.0 GW, upon transition from one weather regime to another. Using projected PV capacity for 2050 (1.94 TW), variability would rise to 13.9 and 43.8 GW. We present optimized spatial distributions of capacity additions in three scenarios that substantially reduce variability by up to 40%. One of them ascertains a large local PV production, thereby minimizing the need for long-range power transmission while still reducing variability by about 30%, highlighting that optimized siting and local generation can be reconciled. Our results emphasize the value of leveraging climate information in decarbonizing power systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000559715",,"2328-4277","10.1029/2022EF002673","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/559715","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Meteorologically-Informed Spatial Planning of European PV Deployment to Reduce Multiday Generation Variability","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-25T04:09:07Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Sustainable Energy Transition Laboratory","837089","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85135095848",,"000827455800001",,"7","Earth's Future","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They often form as a result of tropical deep convection, which strongly affects the water budget of the tropical tropopause layer. Ice cloud formation involves complex interactions on various scales. These processes are not yet fully understood and lead to large uncertainties in climate projections. In this study, we investigate the formation of tropical ice clouds related to deep convection in the West African monsoon, using stable water isotopes as tracers of moist atmospheric processes. We perform convection-permitting simulations with the regional Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling isotope-enabled (COSMOiso) model for the period from June to July 2016. First, we evaluate our model simulations using space-borne observations of mid-tropospheric water vapour isotopes, monthly station data of precipitation isotopes, and satellite-based precipitation estimates. Next, we explore the isotope signatures of tropical deep convection in atmospheric water vapour and ice based on a case study of a mesoscale convective system (MCS) and a statistical analysis of a 1-month period. The following five key processes related to tropical ice clouds can be distinguished based on isotope information: (1) convective lofting of enriched ice into the upper troposphere, (2) cirrus clouds that form in situ from ambient vapour under equilibrium fractionation, (3) sedimentation and sublimation of ice in the mixed-phase cloud layer in the vicinity of convective systems and underneath cirrus shields, (4) sublimation of ice in convective downdraughts that enriches the environmental vapour, and (5) the freezing of liquid water just above the 0 °C isotherm in convective updraughts. Importantly, we note large variations in the isotopic composition of water vapour in the upper troposphere and lower tropical tropopause layer, ranging from below −800 ‰ to over −400 ‰, which are strongly related to vertical motion and the moist processes that take place in convective updraughts and downdraughts. In convective updraughts, the vapour is depleted by the preferential condensation and deposition of heavy isotopes, whereas the non-fractionating sublimation of ice in convective downdraughts enriches the environmental vapour. An opposite vapour isotope signature emerges in thin-cirrus cloud regions where the direct transport of enriched (depleted) vapour prevails in large-scale ascent (descent). Overall, this study demonstrates that isotopes can serve as useful tracers to disentangle the role of different processes in the West African monsoon water cycle, including convective transport, the formation of ice clouds, and their impact on the tropical tropopause layer.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000558295",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-8863-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/558295","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Stable water isotope signals in tropical ice clouds in the West African monsoon simulated with a regional convection-permitting model","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-17T07:17:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Lagrangian analysis of ice cloud formation pathways and their isotopic signals in high-resolution COSMO-iso simulations of the African and Asian monsoon","177996","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","PIRE",,,,"85134197074",,"000822752300001","Atmos. chem. phys.","13","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Surface climate predictability in the Northern Hemisphere might be improved due to a previously proposed, albeit uncertain, link to springtime ozone depletion in the Arctic. Here we use observations and targeted chemistry–climate experiments from two models to isolate the surface impacts of ozone depletion from complex downward dynamical influences. We find that springtime stratospheric ozone depletion is consistently followed by surface temperature and precipitation anomalies with signs consistent with a positive Arctic Oscillation, namely, warm and dry conditions over southern Europe and Eurasia and moistening over northern Europe. Notably, we show that these anomalies, affecting large portions of the Northern Hemisphere, are driven substantially by the loss of stratospheric ozone. This is due to ozone depletion leading to a reduction in short-wave radiation absorption, when in turn causing persistent negative temperature anomalies in the lower stratosphere and a delayed break-up of the polar vortex. These results indicate that the inclusion of interactive ozone chemistry in atmospheric models can considerably improve the predictability of Northern Hemisphere surface climate on seasonal timescales.",,,,"1752-0908||1752-0894","10.1038/s41561-022-00974-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/560208","en","Nature",,,"Atmospheric chemistry||Atmospheric dynamics","Springtime arctic ozone depletion forces northern hemisphere climate anomalies","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-07-27T05:47:04Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"The Overlooked Role of Stratospheric Ozone in forcing Northern Hemispheric climate (TORSO)||Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application||Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events","180043||170523||198896","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Ambizione||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,,"85133595901",,"000824755900010","Nat.

Climate-driving variables like the surface solar radiation (SSR) are shown to exhibit unforced trends (i.e., trends due to internal variability) of magnitudes comparable to the magnitude of the forced signal even on decadal timescales. We use annual mean data from 50 models participating in the preindustrial control experiment (piControl) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 6 (CMIP6) to give quantitative grid-box specific estimates of the magnitudes of unforced trends. To characterize a trend distribution, symmetrical around 0, we use the 75th percentile of all possible values, which corresponds to a positive trend with 25% chance of occurrence. For 30-year periods and depending on geographical location, this trend has a magnitude between 0.15 and 2.1 W m(−2)/decade for all-sky and between 0.04 and 0.38 W m(−2)/decade for clear-sky SSR. The corresponding area-weighted medians are 0.69 W m(−2)/decade for all-sky trends and 0.17 W m(−2)/decade for clear-sky trends. The influence of internal variability is on average six times smaller in clear-sky, compared to all-sky SSR. The relative uncertainties in the physical representation, derived from the CMIP6 inter-model spread, are ±32% for all-sky and ±43% for clear-sky SSR trends. Reasons for differences between models like horizontal resolution, aerosol handling, and the representation of atmospheric and oceanic phenomena are investigated. The results can be used in the analysis of observational time series by attributing a probability for a trend to be caused by internal variability, given its magnitude, length, and location.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000555937",,"0148-0227||2169-897X","10.1029/2021JD036332","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/555937","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","surface solar radiation||CMIP6||internal variability||unforced trends||dimming and brightening","Internal Variability of All-Sky and Clear-Sky Surface Solar Radiation on Decadal Timescales","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-04T04:30:47Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: causes of decadal changes of solar radiation","188601","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85132919057",,"000816419500001","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","12","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","127","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Examining closely these models, it becomes apparent that they might underpredict significantly the direct RF for BC, largely due to their assumed spherical BC morphology. Specifically, the light absorption and direct RF of BC agglomerates are enhanced by light scattering between their constituent primary particles as determined by the Rayleigh–Debye–Gans theory interfaced with discrete dipole approximation and recent relations for the refractive index and lensing effect. The light absorption of BC is enhanced by about 20% by the multiple light scattering between BC primary particles regardless of the compactness of their agglomerates. The resulting light absorption agrees very well with the observed absorption aerosol optical depth of BC. ECHAM-HAM simulations accounting for the realistic BC morphology and its coatings reveal high direct RF = 3–5 W/m2 in East, South Asia, sub-Sahara, western Africa, and the Arabian peninsula. These results are in agreement with satellite and AERONET observations of RF and indicate a regional climate warming contribution by 0.75–1.25 °C, solely due to BC emissions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000555326",,"0013-936X||1520-5851","10.1021/acs.est.2c00428","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/555326","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","black carbon||morphology||optical properties||mass absorption cross-section||radiative forcing","Enhanced Light Absorption and Radiative Forcing by Black Carbon Agglomerates","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-28T14:05:26Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"System for comprehensive optical, chemical and structural characterization of flame-made carbonaceous nanoparticles||Tailor-made Carbonaceous Nanoparticles by Multiscale Combustion Design||Multifunctional nanoparticles for targeted theranostics||Integrated system for in operando characterization and development of portable breath analyzers||Rapid synthesis of conductive polymer nanocomposites films for functional devices||LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constrained aerosol forcing for improved climate projections","183298||182668||163243||170729||ETH-08 14-2||821205","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100003006||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||ETHZ||EC","R'Equip||Projekte MINT||Projekte MINT||R'Equip||ETH Grants||H2020",,,,"85131966541",,"000815254100001","Environ.

The three approaches agree that the tropics contribute over 63% of the global correlations, but differ on the dominant driver of the global NEEIAV, because they disagree on seasonal temperature effects in the Northern Hemisphere (NH, >25°N). In the NH, inversions and process-based models show inter-seasonal compensation of temperature effects, inducing a global TWS dominance supported by observations. Data-driven models show weaker seasonal compensation, thereby estimating a global temperature dominance.

We provide direct experimental evidence that Aitken mode particles (particles with diameters less than or similar to 70 nm) significantly contribute to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) or cloud droplet residuals, especially after the freeze-up of the sea ice in the transition toward fall. These Aitken mode particles were associated with air that spent more time over the pack ice, while size distributions dominated by accumulation mode particles (particles with diameters greater than or similar to 70 nm) showed a stronger contribution of oceanic air and slightly different source regions. This was accompanied by changes in the average chemical composition of the accumulation mode aerosol with an increased relative contribution of organic material toward fall. Addition of aerosol mass due to aqueous-phase chemistry during in-cloud processing was probably small over the pack ice given the fact that we observed very similar particle size distributions in both the whole-air and cloud droplet residual data. These aerosol-cloud interaction observations provide valuable insight into the origin and physical and chemical properties of CCN over the pristine central Arctic Ocean.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000553195",,"0148-0227||2169-897X","10.1029/2021JD036383","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/553195","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","aerosol–cloud interactions||aerosols||clouds||high Arctic||cloud residuals||in-situ measurements","Physical and Chemical Properties of Cloud Droplet Residuals and Aerosol Particles During the Arctic Ocean 2018 Expedition","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-18T02:54:22Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constrained aerosol forcing for improved climate projections","821205","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85131943914",,"000806579000001","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","11","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","127","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The abundance and often complex patterns of these missing values can be a barrier for combining different observational datasets and may cause biased estimates of derived statistics. To overcome this, missing values in geoscientific data are regularly infilled with estimates through univariate gap-filling techniques such as spatial or temporal interpolation or by upscaling approaches in which complete donor variables are used to infer missing values. However, these approaches typically do not account for information that may be present in other observed variables that also have missing values. Here we propose CLIMFILL (CLIMate data gapFILL), a multivariate gap-filling procedure that combines kriging interpolation with a statistical gap-filling method designed to account for the dependence across multiple gappy variables. In a first stage, an initial gap fill is constructed for each variable separately using state-of-the-art spatial interpolation. Subsequently, the initial gap fill for each variable is updated to recover the dependence across variables using an iterative procedure. Estimates for missing values are thus informed by knowledge of neighbouring observations, temporal processes, and dependent observations of other relevant variables. CLIMFILL is tested using gap-free ERA-5 reanalysis data of ground temperature, surface-layer soil moisture, precipitation, and terrestrial water storage to represent central interactions between soil moisture and climate. These variables were matched with corresponding remote sensing observations and masked where the observations have missing values. In this ""perfect dataset approach"" CLIMFILL can be evaluated against the original, usually not observed part of the data. We show that CLIMFILL successfully recovers the dependence structure among the variables across all land cover types and altitudes, thereby enabling subsequent mechanistic interpretations in the gap-filled dataset. Correlation between original ERA-5 data and gap-filled ERA-5 data is high in many regions, although it shows artefacts of the interpolation procedure in large gaps in high-latitude regions during winter. Bias and noise in gappy satellite-observable data is reduced in most regions. A case study of the European 2003 heatwave shows how CLIMFILL reduces biases in ground temperature and surface-layer soil moisture induced by the missing values. Furthermore, in idealized experiments we see the impact of fraction of missing values and the complexity of missing value patterns to the performance of CLIMFILL, showing that CLIMFILL for most variables operates at the upper limit of what is possible given the high fraction of missing values and the complexity of missingness patterns. Thus, the framework can be a tool for gap filling a large range of remote sensing observations commonly used in climate and environmental research.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000556195",,"1991-9603||1991-959X","10.5194/gmd-15-4569-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/556195","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"CLIMFILL v0.9: a framework for intelligently gap filling Earth observations","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-05T03:02:27Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85132310441",,"000810666900001","Geosci. model dev.","11","Geoscientific Model Development","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Between similar to 235 and 273 K, ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are responsible for the initial phase transition from the liquid to the ice phase in cloud hydrometeors. This study analyzes immersion-mode INP concentrations measured at 243 K at the High Altitude Research Station Jungfraujoch (3580 m a.s.l.) between February 2020 and January 2021, thereby presenting the longest continuous, high-resolution (20 min) data set of online INP measurements to date. The high time resolution and continuity allow us to study the seasonal and the diurnal variability of INPs. After exclusion of special events, like Saharan dust events (SDEs), we found a seasonal cycle of INPs, highest in April (median in spring 3.1 INP std L-1) followed by summer (median: 1.6 INP std L-1) and lowest in fall and winter (median: 0.5 and 0.7 INP std L-1, respectively). Pollen or subpollen particles were deemed unlikely to be responsible for elevated INP concentrations in spring and summer, as periods with high pollen loads from nearby measurement stations do not coincide with the periods of high INP concentrations. Furthermore, for days when the site was purely in the free troposphere (FT), no diurnal cycle in INP concentrations was observed, while days with boundary layer intrusions (BLIs) showed a diurnal cycle. The seasonal and diurnal variability of INPs during periods excluding SDEs is within a factor of 7 and 3.3, respectively, significantly lower than the overall variability observed in INP concentration including SDEs of more than 3 orders of magnitude, when peak values result from SDEs. The median INP concentration over the analyzed 12 months was 1.2 INP std L-1 for FT periods excluding SDEs and 1.4 INP std L-1 for both FT and BLI, and including SDEs, reflecting that despite SDEs showing strong but comparatively brief INP signals, they have a minor impact on the observed annual median INP concentration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000553515",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-7557-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/553515","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The diurnal and seasonal variability of ice-nucleating particles at the High Altitude Station Jungfraujoch (3680 m a.s.l.), Switzerland","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-21T03:12:41Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85133027533",,"000809059500001","Atmos. chem. phys.","11","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

There is, however, a ‘knowledge-value’ gap, where a lack of evidence and awareness of the potential socio-economic benefits of S2S forecasts limits their wider uptake. To address this gap, here we present the first global community effort at summarizing relevant applications of S2S forecasts to guide further decision-making and support the continued development of S2S forecasts and related services. Focusing on 12 sectoral case studies spanning public health, agriculture, water resource management, renewable energy and utilities, and emergency management and response, we draw on recent advancements to explore their application and utility. These case studies mark a significant step forward in moving from potential to actual S2S forecasting applications. We show that by placing user needs at the forefront of S2S forecast development – demonstrating both skill and utility across sectors – this dialogue can be used to help promote and accelerate the awareness, value and co-generation of S2S forecasts. We also highlight that while S2S forecasts are increasingly gaining interest among users, incorporating probabilistic S2S forecasts into existing decision-making operations is not trivial. Nevertheless, S2S forecasting represents a significant opportunity to generate useful, usable and actionable forecast applications for and with users that will increasingly unlock the potential of this forecasting timescale.",,,,"0003-0007||1520-0477","10.1175/bams-d-20-0224.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519326","en","American Meteorological Society",,,"Ensembles||Forecast verification/skill||Climate services||Decision support||Emergency preparedness||Societal impacts","Advances in the application and utility of subseasonal-to-seasonal predictions","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-12-07T11:15:42Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application","170523","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,"85130395208",,"000841455200002","BAMS","6","Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society","103","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, it remains challenging to quantify how changes in climate alter the likelihood of fire risks associated with compound events. Recent abrupt changes in fire regimes in iconic landscapes in Brazil (namely the Pantanal and Xingu) provide a key opportunity to evaluate how extremely dry and hot conditions, both together and individually, have influenced the probability of large fires. Here we quantify the relationships between climate and fire across these regions and provide evidence on the extent to which fire risk and the associated impacts could be constrained if anthropogenic global warming is limited. We investigate the burned area, differentiating between fire types according to land use (forest fires, savanna fires, farming fires and grassland and wetland fires), and derive present and future fire risks linked to multiple climate variables. We show that concurrent air dryness (high vapour-pressure deficit (VPD)) and low precipitation have driven fire occurrence in both Xingu and the Pantanal, with VPD playing a dominant role. Historical climatic change has already increased compound event-related (CE-related) fire risks of all fire types (5%-10%), and these risks are likely to increase in the future due to global warming. The likelihood of CE-related increase in fire risk may be reduced by up to 14.4% if global warming is constrained to +1.5 degrees C instead of +3 degrees C. Nevertheless, substantially increased CE-related fire risks are still expected even if restricting global mean warming to 1.5 degrees C, particularly in the Pantanal. We thus conclude that climate action should be coordinated with environmental protection to reduce ignition sources and promote effective conservation measures to preserve these biomes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000553516",,"1748-9326||1748-9318","10.1088/1748-9326/ac7342","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/553516","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","fire risks||compound events||global warming||Xingu||Pantanal","A compound event-oriented framework to tropical fire risk assessment in a changing climate","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-21T03:12:41Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Risk assessment of critical ecological thresholds in Amazonia and Cerrado","186282","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Brazilian-Swiss Joint Research Programme (full proposal)",,,,"85132937971",,"000809242800001","Environ.

Here, we combine the currently limited experimental data with a global climate model to investigate the effects of biocrusts on regional and global dust cycling under current and future conditions. We estimate that biocrusts reduce the global atmospheric dust emissions by similar to 60%, preventing the release of similar to 0.7 Pg dust per year. Until 2070, biocrust coverage is expected to be severely reduced by climate change and land-use intensification. The biocrust loss will cause an increased dust burden, leading to a reduction of the global radiation budget of around 0.12 to 0.22W m(-2), corresponding to about 50% of the total direct forcing of anthropogenic aerosols.

As the Earth warms due to the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, global temperatures rise and so heatwaves become warmer as well. This means that a fixed temperature threshold is passed more often: the probability of extreme heat increases. However, land use changes, vegetation change, irrigation, air pollution, and other changes also drive local and regional trends in heatwaves. Sometimes they enhance heatwave intensity, but they can also counteract the effects of climate change, and in some regions, the mechanisms that impact on trends in heatwaves have not yet been fully identified. Climate models simulate heatwaves and the increased intensity and probability of extreme heat reasonably well on large scales. However, changes in annual daily maximum temperatures do not follow global warming over some regions, including the Eastern United States and parts of Asia, reflecting the influence of local drivers as well as natural variability. Also, temperature variability is unrealistic in many models, and can fail standard quality checks. Therefore, reliable attribution and projection of change in heatwaves remain a major scientific challenge in many regions, particularly where the moisture budget is not well simulated, and where land surface changes, changes in short-lived forcers, and soil moisture interactions are important.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000554644",,"2328-4277","10.1029/2021EF002271","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/554644","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","extreme weather||heat waves||attribution||climate projections","Attributing and Projecting Heatwaves Is Hard: We Can Do Better","Other Journal Item","Open access",,,,"2022-06-25T02:59:49Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000811733600001",,"6","Earth's Future","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is therefore crucial to anticipate extremes and their impacts to allow for preparedness and emergency measures. There is indeed potential for probabilistic subseasonal prediction on time scales of several weeks for many extreme events. Here we provide an overview of subseasonal predictability for case studies of some of the most prominent extreme events across the globe using the ECMWF S2S prediction system: heatwaves, cold spells, heavy precipitation events, and tropical and extratropical cyclones. The considered heatwaves exhibit predictability on time scales of 3-4 weeks, while this time scale is 2-3 weeks for cold spells. Precipitation extremes are the least predictable among the considered case studies. Tropical cyclones, on the other hand, can exhibit probabilistic predictability on time scales of up to 3 weeks, which in the presented cases was aided by remote precursors such as the Madden-Julian oscillation. For extratropical cyclones, lead times are found to be shorter. These case studies clearly illustrate the potential for event-dependent advance warnings for a wide range of extreme events. The subseasonal predictability of extreme events demonstrated here allows for an extension of warning horizons, provides advance information to impact modelers, and informs communities and stakeholders affected by the impacts of extreme weather events.",,,,"0003-0007||1520-0477","10.1175/BAMS-D-20-0221.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557156","en","American Meteorological Society",,,"Madden-Julian oscillation||Severe storms||Ensembles||Forecast verification/skill||Probability forecasts/models/distribution||Flood events","Advances in the Subseasonal Prediction of Extreme Events: Relevant Case Studies across the Globe","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-07-10T03:29:48Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application||Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events||The downward impact of the stratosphere in current and future climates","170523||198896||891514","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||SNF||EC","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche||H2020",,,,"85132513648",,"000841455200003","BAMS","6","Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society","103","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using realistic distributions of ODS and consistent stratospheric ozone, we show that ODS dominate the adjusted stratospheric warming of the lower stratosphere, where CO2 has little radiative impact. We also show that the global mean RF of stratospheric ozone only cancels a fraction of the RF of ODS, leaving an important ODS contribution to anthropogenic forcing.

Thus, seasonal forecasts of precipitation and temperature are an essential tool for stakeholders to make timely choices regarding the strategies required to maximize their expected cereal yield outcomes. The availability of state-of-the-art seasonal forecasts such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) system 5 (SEAS5) may be an asset to help decision making. However, uncertainties and reduced skill may hamper the use of seasonal forecasts in several applications. Hence, in this work, we aim to understand the added value of such dynamical forecasts when compared to persistent anomalies of climate conditions used to predict the production of wheat and barley yields. With that in mind, empirical models relating annual wheat and barley yields in Spain to monthly values of precipitation and temperature are developed by taking advantage of ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. Then, dynamical and persistence forecasts are issued at different lead times, and the skill of the subsequent forecasted yield is verified through probabilistic metrics. The results presented in this study demonstrate two different outcomes: (1) wheat and barley yield anomaly forecasts (dynamical and persistent) start to gain skill later in the season (typically from April onwards); and (2) the added value of using the SEAS5 forecast as an alternative to persistence ranges from 6 to 16%, with better results in the southern Spanish regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000547755",,"2045-2322","10.1038/s41598-022-11228-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/547755","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Persistence versus dynamical seasonal forecasts of cereal crop yields","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-18T03:01:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Risk assessment of critical ecological thresholds in Amazonia and Cerrado","186282","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Brazilian-Swiss Joint Research Programme (full proposal)",,,,"85129748370",,"000791825700042","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To understand how tectonic and climatic forcings control regional rates of weathering, we must be able to identify their effects on sedimentary archives over geologic timescales. Cosmogenic nuclides are a valuable tool to study rates of surface processes and have long been applied in fluvial systems to quantify basin-wide erosion rates. However, in large rivers, continual processes of erosion and deposition during sediment transport make it difficult to constrain how long sediments spend within the fluvial system. In this study, we examine the role of rivers in buffering erosional signals by constraining the timescales of fluvial transport in large rivers across the world. We apply a stochastic numerical model based on measurements of cosmogenic nuclides concentrations and calculate sediment residence times of 10(4)-10(5) years in large rivers. These timescales are equal to or longer than climatic cycles, implying that changes to rates of erosion brought on by climatic variations are buffered during transport in large rivers and may not be recognizable in the sedimentary record.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000550918",,"0148-0227||2169-9003||2169-9011","10.1029/2021JF006417","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/550918","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","residence time||cosmogenic nuclides||fluvial transport||large rivers||signal buffering||sediment transport","Sediment Residence Times in Large Rivers Quantified Using a Cosmogenic Nuclides Based Transport Model and Implications for Buffering of Continental Erosion Signals","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-05T02:51:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85134025601",,"000798998000001","J. geophys. res.

Principled parametric and mechanistic modeling dominated science and engineering until the recent emergence of machine learning (ML). Despite great success in many areas, ML algorithms in the Earth and climate sciences, and more broadly in physical sciences, are not explicitly designed to be physically-consistent and may, therefore, violate the most basic laws of physics. In this work, motivated by the field of algorithmic fairness, we reconcile data-driven ML with physics modeling by illustrating a nonparametric and nonlinear physics-aware regression method. By incorporating a dependence-based regularizer, the method leads to models that are consistent with domain knowledge, as reflected by either simulations from physical models or ancillary data. The idea can conversely encourage independence of model predictions with other variables that are known to be uncertain either in their representation or magnitude. The method is computationally efficient and comes with a closed-form analytic solution. Through a consistency-vs-accuracy path diagram, one can assess the consistency between data-driven models and physical models. We demonstrate in three examples on simulations and measurement data in Earth and climate studies that the proposed ML framework allows us to trade-off physical consistency and accuracy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000546957",,"1748-9326||1748-9318","10.1088/1748-9326/ac6762","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/546957","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Earth sciences||detection and attribution||kernel methods||physics-aware machine learning","Physics-aware nonparametric regression models for Earth data analysis","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-13T02:46:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Extreme Events: Artificial Intelligence for Detection and Attribution","101003469","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,"000790544000001","Environ.

On inter-annual to decadal timescales, model projection uncertainty due to natural variability dominates at the local level and is imperative to describing near-term and seasonal climate events but difficult to quantify owing to the computational constraints of producing large ensembles. To this extent, emulators are valuable tools for approximating climate model runs, allowing for the exploration of the uncertainty space surrounding selected climate variables at a substantially reduced computational cost. Most emulators, however, operate at annual to seasonal timescales, leaving out monthly information that may be essential to assessing climate impacts. This study extends the framework of an existing spatially resolved, annual-scale Earth system model (ESM) emulator (MESMER, Beusch et al., 2020) by a monthly downscaling module (MESMER-M), thus providing local monthly temperatures from local yearly temperatures. We first linearly represent the mean response of the monthly temperature cycle to yearly temperatures using a simple harmonic model, thus maintaining month-to-month correlations and capturing changes in intra-annual variability. We then construct a month-specific local variability module which generates spatiotemporally correlated residuals with yearly temperature- and month-dependent skewness incorporated within. The emulator's ability to capture the yearly temperature-induced monthly temperature response and its surrounding uncertainty due to natural variability is demonstrated for 38 different ESMs from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The emulator is furthermore benchmarked using a simple gradient-boosting-regressor-based model trained on biophysical information. We find that while regional-scale, biophysical feedbacks may induce non-uniformities in the yearly to monthly temperature downscaling relationship, statistical emulation of regional effects shows comparable skill to the more physically informed approach. Thus, MESMER-M is able to statistically generate ESM-like, large initial-condition ensembles of spatially explicit monthly temperature fields, providing monthly temperature probability distributions which are of critical value to impact assessments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000545750",,"2190-4987||2190-4979","10.5194/esd-13-851-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/545750","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"MESMER-M: an Earth system model emulator for spatially resolved monthly temperature","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-08T03:32:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"A Modular Earth System Model Emulator for Regional eXtremes","964013","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85129757109",,"000788181700001",,"2","Earth System Dynamics","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Each flight followed a common flight pattern that sampled the atmosphere around the cloud base level, at different heights of the subcloud layer, near the sea surface and in the lower free troposphere. The aircraft's payload included a backscatter lidar and a Doppler cloud radar that were both horizontally oriented; a Doppler cloud radar looking upward; microphysical probes; a cavity ring-down spectrometer for water isotopes; a multiwavelength radiometer; a visible camera; and multiple meteorological sensors, including fast rate sensors for turbulence measurements. With this instrumentation, the ATR characterized the macrophysical and microphysical properties of trade-wind clouds together with their thermodynamical, turbulent and radiative environment. This paper presents the airborne operations, the flight segmentation, the instrumentation, the data processing and the EUREC(4)A datasets produced from the ATR measurements. It shows that the ATR measurements of humidity, wind and cloud base cloud fraction measured with different techniques and samplings are internally consistent; that meteorological measurements are consistent with estimates from dropsondes launched from an overflying aircraft (the High Altitude and LOng Range Research Aircraft, HALO); and that water-isotopic measurements are well correlated with data from the Barbados Cloud Observatory.

Assessing possible model limitations in simulating past climate changes can lead to an improved understanding and representation of the response of the climate system to changes in the forcing, setting the basis for more reliable information for the future.  In this study, the regional climate model (RCM) COSMO-CLM is used for the investigation of the mid-Holocene (MH, 6000 years ago) European climate, aiming to contribute to the solution of the long-standing debate on the reconstruction of MH summer temperatures for the region, and gaining more insights into the development of appropriate methods for the production of future climate projections.  Two physically perturbed ensembles (PPEs) are first built by perturbing model physics and parameter values, consistently over two periods characterized by different forcing (i.e., the MH and pre-industrial, PI). The goal is to uncover possible processes associated with the considered changes that could deliver a response in MH summer temperatures closer to evidence from continental-scale pollen-based reconstructions. None of the investigated changes in model configuration produces remarkable differences with respect to the mean model behavior. This indicates a limited sensitivity of the model to changes in the climate forcing, in terms of its structural uncertainty.  Additional sensitivity tests are further conducted for the MH, by perturbing the model initial soil moisture conditions at the beginning of spring. A strong spatial dependency of summer near-surface temperatures on the soil moisture available in spring is evinced from these experiments, with particularly remarkable differences evident over the Balkans and the areas north of the Black Sea. This emphasizes the role of soil–atmosphere interactions as one of the possible drivers of the differences in proxy-based summer temperatures evident between northern and southern Europe. A well-known deficiency of the considered land scheme of COSMO-CLM in properly retaining spring soil moisture, confirmed by the performed tests, suggests that more attention should be paid to the performance of the soil component of climate models applied to this case study. The consideration of more complex soil schemes may be required to help bridging the gap between models and proxy reconstructions.  Finally, the distribution of the PPEs with changes in model configuration is analyzed for different variables. In almost all of the considered cases the results show that what is optimal for one period, in terms of a model configuration, is not the best for another characterized by different radiative forcing. These results raise concerns about the usefulness of automatic and objective calibration methods for RCMs, suggesting that a preferable approach is the production of small PPEs that target a set of model configurations, properly representing climate phenomena characteristic of the target region and that will be likely to contain the best model answer under different forcing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543613",,"1814-9324||1814-9332","10.5194/cp-18-895-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543613","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The long-standing dilemma of European summer temperatures at the mid-Holocene and other considerations on learning from the past for the future using a regional climate model","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-25T08:36:54Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85129228825",,"000784552100001","Clim. past","4","Climate of the Past","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Ice formation in clouds is often triggered heterogeneously by ice-nucleating particles (INPs) that represent a very low number of particles in the atmosphere. To date, many sources of INPs, such as mineral and soil dust, have been investigated and identified in the low and mid latitudes. Although less is known about the sources of ice nucleation at high latitudes, efforts have been made to identify the sources of INPs in the Arctic and boreal environments. In this study, we investigate the INP emission potential from high-latitude boreal forests in the mixed-phase cloud regime. We introduce the HyICE-2018 measurement campaign conducted in the boreal forest of Hyytiala, Finland, between February and June 2018. The campaign utilized the infrastructure of the Station for Measuring Ecosystem-Atmosphere Relations (SMEAR) II, with additional INP instruments, including the Portable Ice Nucleation Chamber I and II (PINC and PINCii), the SPectrometer for Ice Nuclei (SPIN), the Portable Ice Nucleation Experiment (PINE), the Ice Nucleation SpEctrometer of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (INSEKT) and the Microlitre Nucleation by Immersed Particle Instrument (mu L-NIPI), used to quantify the INP concentrations and sources in the boreal environment. In this contribution, we describe the measurement infrastructure and operating procedures during HyICE-2018, and we report results from specific time periods where INP instruments were run in parallel for inter-comparison purposes. Our results show that the suite of instruments deployed during HyICE-2018 reports consistent results and therefore lays the foundation for forthcoming results to be considered holistically. In addition, we compare measured INP concentrations to INP parameterizations, and we observe good agreement with the Tobo et al.

As such, they are subject to continuous changes, thanks to advances in computer systems, numerical methods, more and better observations, and the ever-increasing knowledge about the atmosphere of earth. Many of the changes in today's models relate to seemingly innocuous modifications associated with minor code rearrangements, changes in hardware infrastructure, or software updates. Such changes are meant to preserve the model formulation, yet the verification of such changes is challenged by the chaotic nature of our atmosphere – any small change, even rounding errors, can have a significant impact on individual simulations. Overall, this represents a serious challenge to a consistent model development and maintenance framework.  Here we propose a new methodology for quantifying and verifying the impacts of minor changes in the atmospheric model or its underlying hardware/software system by using ensemble simulations in combination with a statistical hypothesis test for instantaneous or hourly values of output variables at the grid-cell level. The methodology can assess the effects of model changes on almost any output variable over time and can be used with different underlying statistical hypothesis tests.  We present the first applications of the methodology with the regional weather and climate model COSMO. While providing very robust results, the methodology shows a great sensitivity even to very small changes. Specific changes considered include applying a tiny amount of explicit diffusion, the switch from double to single precision, and a major system update of the underlying supercomputer. Results show that changes are often only detectable during the first hours, suggesting that short-term ensemble simulations (days to months) are best suited for the methodology, even when addressing long-term climate simulations. Furthermore, we show that spatial averaging – as opposed to testing at all grid points – reduces the test's sensitivity for small-scale features such as diffusion. We also show that the choice of the underlying statistical hypothesis test is not essential and that the methodology already works well for coarse resolutions, making it computationally inexpensive and therefore an ideal candidate for automated testing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000544273",,"1991-9603||1991-959X","10.5194/gmd-15-3183-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/544273","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"An ensemble-based statistical methodology to detect differences in weather and climate model executables","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-29T03:21:11Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85128909025",,"000783500900001","Geosci. model dev.","8","Geoscientific Model Development","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This approach relies on a strong relationship among LOSS, NPP, and HR at continental or biome scales. The DGVMs overestimated historical LOSS, particularly in tropical regions and eastern North America by as much as 5 Mg ha−1 y−1. The modeled spread of DGVM-projected NPP and HR uncertainties was substantially reduced in tropical regions after incorporating the field-based mortality constraint. The observation-constrained models show a decrease in the tropical forest carbon sink by the end of the century, particularly across South America (from 2 to 1.4 PgC y−1), and an increase in the sink in North America (from 0.8 to 1.1 PgC y−1).

The retrieval employs a forward model which accounts for scattering, and the algorithm infers the trace gas column information, surface properties, and effective cloud parameters from the observations. Compared to the previous clear-sky-only data product, coverage is greatly enhanced by including scenes over low clouds, particularly enabling data over oceans as the albedo of water in the SWIR spectral range is too low to retrieve under cloud-free conditions. The new dataset is validated against co-located ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) observations by the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). The median bias for clear-sky scenes is 1.4 x 10(21) molec cm(-2) (2.9 %) in H2O columns and 1.1 x 10(17) molec cm(-2) (-0.3 %) in HDO columns, which corresponds to -17 parts per thousand (9.9 %) in a posteriori delta D. The bias for cloudy scenes is 4.9 x 10(21) molec cm(-2) (11 %) in H2O, 1.1 x 10(18) molec cm(-2) (7.9 %) in HDO, and -20 parts per thousand (9.7 %) in a posteriori delta D. At low-altitude stations, the bias is small at low and middle latitudes and has a larger value at high latitudes. At high-altitude stations, an altitude correction is required to compensate for different partial columns seen by the station and the satellite. The bias in a posteriori delta D after altitude correction depends on sensitivity due to shielding by clouds and on realistic a priori profile shapes for both isotopologues. Cloudy scenes generally involve low sensitivity below the clouds, and since the information is filled up by the prior, a realistic shape of the prior is important for realistic total column estimation in these cases. Over oceans, aircraft measurements with the Water Isotope System for Precipitation and Entrainment Research (WISPER) instrument from a field campaign in 2018 are used for validation, yielding biases of -3.9 % in H2O and -3 parts per thousand in delta D over clouds. To demonstrate the added value of the new dataset, a short case study of a cold air outbreak over the Atlantic Ocean in January 2020 is presented, showing the daily evolution of the event with single-overpass results.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543513",,"1867-1381||1867-8548","10.5194/amt-15-2251-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543513","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Retrieving H2O/HDO columns over cloudy and clear-sky scenes from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-24T03:02:44Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85129012830",,"000782414100001","Atmos. meas. tech.","7","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) technology facilitates the achievement of the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Here, we use five state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESMs) to explore the consequences of large-scale BECCS deployment on the climate-carbon cycle feedbacks under the CMIP6 SSP5-3.4-0S overshoot scenario keeping in mind that all these models use generic crop vegetation to simulate BECCS. First, we evaluate the land cover representation by ESMs and highlight the inconsistencies that emerge during translation of the data from integrated assessment models (IAMB) that are used to develop the scenario. Second, we evaluate the land-use change (LUC) emissions of ESMs against bookkeeping models. Finally, we show that an extensive cropland expansion for BECCS causes ecosystem carbon loss that drives the acceleration of carbon turnover and affects the CO2 fertilization effect- and climate-change-driven land carbon uptake. Over the 2000-2100 period, the LUC for BECCS leads to an offset of the CO2 fertilization effect-driven carbon uptake by 12.2 % and amplifies the climate-change-driven carbon loss by 14.6 %. A human choice on land area allocation for energy crops should take into account not only the potential amount of the bioenergy yield but also the LUC emissions, and the associated loss of future potential change in the carbon uptake. The dependency of the land carbon uptake on LUC is strong in the SSP5-3.4-OS scenario, but it also affects other Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and should be taken into account by the IAM teams. Future studies should further investigate the trade-offs between the carbon gains from the bioenergy yield and losses from the reduced CO2 fertilization effect-driven carbon uptake where BECCS is applied.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543563",,"2190-4987||2190-4979","10.5194/esd-13-779-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543563","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Impact of bioenergy crop expansion on climate-carbon cycle feedbacks in overshoot scenarios","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-25T02:58:52Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constraining uncertainty of multi decadal climate projections","820829","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85129113349",,"000781896500001",,"2","Earth System Dynamics","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The cloud microphysical (CMP) processes that shape these properties are therefore important to represent in global climate models. Historically, parameterizations in these models have grown more detailed and complex. However, a simpler formulation of CMP processes may leave the model results mostly unchanged while enabling an easier interpretation of model results and helping to increase process understanding. This study employs sensitivity analysis of an emulated perturbed parameter ensemble of the global aerosol-climate model ECHAM-HAM to illuminate the impact of selected CMP cloud ice processes on model output. The response to the perturbation of a process serves as a proxy for the effect of a simplification. Autoconversion of ice crystals is found to be the dominant CMP process in influencing key variables such as the ice water path and cloud radiative effects, while riming of cloud droplets on snow has the most influence on the liquid phase. Accretion of ice and snow and self-collection of ice crystals have a negligible influence on model output and are therefore identified as suitable candidates for future simplifications. In turn, the dominating role of autoconversion suggests that this process has the greatest need to be represented correctly. A seasonal and spatially resolved analysis employing a spherical harmonics expansion of the data corroborates the results. This study introduces a new application for the combination of statistical emulation and sensitivity analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of a complex numerical model to a specific parameterized process. It paves the way for simplifications of CMP processes leading to more interpretable climate model results.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543471",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-4737-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543471","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Assessing the potential for simplification in global climate model cloud microphysics","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-24T03:01:52Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constrained aerosol forcing for improved climate projections","821205","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85128745484",,"000780896400001","Atmos. chem. phys.","7","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Special attention is devoted to the connection between the stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) and lower-stratosphere wave activity (LSWA). We find that in winter (December to February) dynamical forecasts initialised on the first of November are considerably more skilful than empirical forecasts based on October anomalies. Moreover, the coupling of the SPV with mid-latitude LSWA (i.e., meridional eddy heat flux) is generally well reproduced by the forecast systems, allowing for the identification of a robust link between the predictability of wave activity above the tropopause and the SPV skill. Our results highlight the importance of November-to-February LSWA, in particular in the Eurasian sector, for forecasts of the winter stratosphere. Finally, the role of potential sources of seasonal stratospheric predictability is considered: we find that the C3S multi-model overestimates the stratospheric response to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and underestimates the influence of the Quasi–Biennial Oscillation (QBO).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484618",,"0930-7575||1432-0894","10.1007/s00382-021-05787-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484618","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Seasonal predictions||Stratosphere||Lower-stratosphere wave activity||Meridional eddy heat flux||Sudden stratospheric warmings","Seasonal prediction of the boreal winter stratosphere","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-18T10:31:41Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application","170523","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,"85106279924",,"000651675000003","Clim Dyn","7","Climate Dynamics","58","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The ICON-A and ECHAM6.3 host models use different dynamical cores, parameterizations of vertical mixing due to sub-grid scale turbulence, and parameter settings for radiation balance tuning. Here, we study the role of the different host models for simulated aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and evaluate impacts of using HAM2.3 and the ECHAM6-HAM2.3 two-moment cloud microphysics scheme on several meteorological variables. Sensitivity runs show that a positive AOT bias over the subtropical oceans is remedied in ICON-A-HAM2.3 because of a different default setting of a parameter in the moist convection parameterization of the host models. The global mean AOT is biased low compared to MODIS satellite instrument retrievals in ICON-A-HAM2.3 and ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3, but the bias is larger in ICON-A-HAM2.3 because negative AOT biases over the Amazon, the African rain forest, and the northern Indian Ocean are no longer compensated by high biases over the sub-tropical oceans. ICON-A-HAM2.3 shows a moderate improvement with respect to AOT observations at AERONET sites. A multivariable bias score combining biases of several meteorological variables into a single number is larger in ICON-A-HAM2.3 compared to standard ICON-A and standard ECHAM6.3. In the tropics, this multivariable bias is of similar magnitude in ICON-A-HAM2.3 and in ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3.

Improving forecasts on this time-scale has therefore become a major effort. To evaluate their performance, these forecasts are routinely compared to a reference that forecasts the climatological distribution at any given time. This distribution is commonly assumed to be stationary over the verification period on time-scales longer than the seasonal cycle. However, there are prominent deviations from this assumption, especially considering trends associated with climate change. By employing synthetic forecast-verification pairs, we show that estimates of the probabilistic skill of both continuous and categorical forecasts increase as a function of the variance explained by the trend over the verification period, even when there are errors in the trends simulated by the forecasts. We also show this skill enhancement due to the trend in the ECMWF extended-range ensemble prediction system. We demonstrate that the effects on the skill in an operational forecast setting are currently strongest in the Tropics. Our results show that care needs to be taken when evaluating forecasts that are subject to non-stationarity on time-scales much longer than the forecast verification window. This is especially important for determining the skill of categorical forecasts, where assumptions on the stationarity of the climatology enter both in the reference forecast and in the determination of the category thresholds. The results presented in this study are not exclusive to the S2S time-scale but have wider implications for forecast verification on seasonal to decadal time-scales, where the existence of trends can further impact forecast skill.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542313",,"0035-9009||1477-870X","10.1002/qj.4259","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542313","en","Royal Meteorological Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","probabilistic skill||subseasonal forecasts||trend||verification","Influence of trends on subseasonal temperature prediction skill","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-14T02:44:32Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application","170523","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,"85127328250",,"000776420100001","Q.

In Switzerland, the development of climate change scenarios is strongly linked to the climate adaptation strategy of the Confederation. The current climate scenarios for Switzerland CH2018 - released in form of six user-oriented products - were the result of an intensive collaboration between academia and administration under the umbrella of the National Centre for Climate Services (NCCS), accounting for user needs and stakeholder dialogues from the beginning. A rigorous scientific concept ensured consistency throughout the various analysis steps of the EURO-CORDEX projections and a common procedure on how to extract robust results and deal with associated uncertainties. The main results show that Switzerland's climate will face dry summers, heavy precipitation, more hot days and snow-scarce winters. Approximately half of these changes could be alleviated by mid-century through strong global mitigation efforts. A comprehensive communication concept ensured that the results were rolled out and distilled in specific user-oriented communication measures to increase their uptake and to make them actionable. A narrative approach with four fictitious persons was used to communicate the key messages to the general public. Three years after the release, the climate scenarios have proven to be an indispensable information basis for users in climate adaptation and for downstream applications. Potential for extensions and updates has been identified since then and will shape the concept and planning of the next scenario generation in Switzerland.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543991",,"2405-8807","10.1016/j.cliser.2022.100288","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543991","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate scenarios||Climate Services||Switzerland||EURO-CORDEX||User-oriented communication||National projections","Climate Scenarios for Switzerland CH2018 – Approach and Implications","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-27T03:23:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85128409930",,"000795942500005",,,"Climate Services","26","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

During the 6 h experiments, the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity at super-saturation of water (0.1 %–0.5 %), hygroscopic growth factor at 90 % relative humidity (RH), and non-refractory PM1 chemical composition were recorded concurrently. Attempts to use the hygroscopicity parameter κ to reconcile water uptake ability below and above water saturation from various VOC precursor systems were made, aiming to predict the CCN activity from the sub-saturated hygroscopicity. The thermodynamic model AIOMFAC (aerosol inorganic-organic mixtures functional groups activity coefficients) was used to simulate κ values of model compound mixtures to compare with the observation and to isolate the controlling factors of water uptake at different RHs.  The sub- and super-saturated water uptake (in terms of both κHTDMA and κCCN) were mainly controlled by the SOA mass fraction, which depended on the SOA production rate of the precursors, and the SOA composition played a second-order role. For the reconciliation of κHTDMA and κCCN, the KHTDMA/KCCN ratio increased with the SOA mass fraction and this was observed in all investigated single and mixed VOC systems, independent of initial VOC concentrations and sources. For all VOC systems, the mean κHTDMA of aerosol particles was ∼25 % lower than the κCCN at the beginning of the experiments with inorganic seeds. With the increase of condensed SOA on inorganic seed particles throughout the experiments, the discrepancy of κHTDMA and κCCN became weaker (down to ∼0 %) and finally the mean κHTDMA was ∼60 % higher than κCCN on average when the SOA mass fraction approached ∼0.8. As indicated by AIOMFAC model simulations, non-ideality alone cannot fully explain the κ discrepancy at high SOA mass fraction (0.8). A good agreement in κCCN between model and observation was achieved by doubling the molecular weight of the model compounds or by reducing the dry particle size in the CCN counter. This indicates that the evaporation of semi-volatile organics in the CCN counter together with non-ideality could have led to the observed κ discrepancy. As a result, the predicted CCN number concentrations from the κHTDMA and particle number size distribution were ∼10 % lower than CCN counter measurement on average at the beginning, and further even turned to an overestimation of ∼20 % on average when the SOA mass fraction was ∼0.8. This chemical composition-dependent performances of the κ-Köhler approach on CCN prediction can introduce a variable uncertainty in predicting cloud droplet numbers from the sub-saturated water uptake, the influence of which on models still needs to be investigated.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542316",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-4149-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542316","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"On the evolution of sub- and super-saturated water uptake of secondary oraanic aerosol in chamber experiments from mixed precursors","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-14T02:44:32Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"AerOsol-Cloud Interactions: the Role of orgAnic compounds in CLoud droplEt activation (ORACLE)","197149","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85127954261",,"000776147400001","Atmos. chem. phys.","6","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Hence, knowledge of the concentration of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) is needed. Generally, the concentrations of INPs are found to be very low in remote marine locations allowing cloud water to persist in a supercooled state. We had expected the concentrations of INPs at the North Pole to be very low given the distance from open ocean and terrestrial sources coupled with effective wet scavenging processes. Here we show that during summer 2018 (August and September) high concentrations of biological INPs (active at >−20°C) were sporadically present at the North Pole. In fact, INP concentrations were sometimes as high as those recorded at mid-latitude locations strongly impacted by highly active biological INPs, in strong contrast to the Southern Ocean. Furthermore, using a balloon borne sampler we demonstrated that INP concentrations were often different at the surface versus higher in the boundary layer where clouds form. Back trajectory analysis suggests strong sources of INPs near the Russian coast, possibly associated with wind-driven sea spray production, whereas the pack ice, open leads, and the marginal ice zone were not sources of highly active INPs. These findings suggest that primary ice production, and therefore Arctic climate, is sensitive to transport from locations such as the Russian coast that are already experiencing marked climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000541830",,"0148-0227||2169-897X","10.1029/2021JD036059","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/541830","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Highly Active Ice-Nucleating Particles at the Summer North Pole","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-11T03:16:40Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85127305449",,"000776467500024","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","6","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","127","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Under global warming, the wave dynamics is expected to change and may possibly affect future extreme weather. In this study, the changes in RWB in a warming climate and their relationships to the jet (waveguide) and heavy precipitation are explored. Potential vorticity (PV) streamers and cutoffs are utilized as proxies for RWB events. Using a feature-based identification algorithm, their climatological frequencies are obtained in present-day and end-of-century climate model simulations of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). A comparison to ERA-Interim reanalysis demonstrates the ability of the CESM model to reproduce plausible seasonal cycles and geographical distributions of RWB despite an obvious isentropic level shift. The comparison between present-day and end-of-century climate simulations shows significant seasonal and regional changes of the climatological RWB frequencies. Prominent decreases in RWB frequency are observed near the North American west coast and the subtropical North Atlantic during boreal winter, while increases are seen in similar regions during boreal summer. These changes are mainly related to anticyclonic wave breaking (AWB) with the exception of the changes over the North American west coast in summer. Separated and merged jet configurations are revealed using composite zonal velocity fields during and outside of RWB occurrence. The changes in relative frequencies of the jet states are postulated to accompany the changes in RWB frequency. Though RWB is likely to remain as a trigger for heavy precipitation in future climate, the contribution from RWB changes in heavy precipitation redistribution cannot be quantified easily and other methods are required to explore this relationship.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000564088",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/564088","en","ETH Zurich, Department of Earth Sciences, Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Rossby wave breaking||Climate change","Rossby Wave Breaking in Present and End-of-Century Climate","Master Thesis","Open access",,,,"2022-08-16T10:20:02Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A space mission like Mini-EUSO experiences continuous changes in atmospheric conditions, including the cloud presence. The influence of clouds on space-based observation is, therefore, an important topic to investigate as it might alter the instantaneous exposure for EAS detection or deteriorate the quality of the EAS images with consequences on the reconstructed EAS parameters. For this purpose, JEM-EUSO is planning to have an IR camera and a lidar as part of its Atmospheric Monitoring System. At the same time, it would be extremely beneficial if the UV camera itself would be able to detect the presence of clouds, at least in some specific conditions. For this reason, we analyze a few case studies by comparing the pixel count rates from Mini-EUSO during orbits with the cloud cover (as cloud fraction). This quantity is retrieved from the Global Forecast System (GFS) model at different height levels over the Mini-EUSO trajectory.

The current main goals are to identify sources of UHECRs and their composition. For this, increased statistics is required. A space-based detector for UHECR research has the advantage of a very large exposure and a uniform coverage of the celestial sphere. The aim of the JEM-EUSO program [1] is to bring the study of UHECRs to space. The principle of observation is based on the detection of UV light emitted by isotropic fluorescence of atmospheric nitrogen excited by the Extensive Air Showers (EAS) in the Earth's atmosphere and forward-beamed Cherenkov radiation reflected from the Earth's surface or dense cloud tops. In addition to the prime objective of UHECR studies, JEM-EUSO will do several secondary studies due to the instruments' unique capacity of detecting very weak UV-signals with extreme time-resolution around 1 μs: meteors, Transient Luminous Events (TLE), bioluminescence, maps of human generated UV-light, searches for Strange Quark Matter (SQM) and high-energy neutrinos, and more.

The first is a Cherenkov telescope (CT) being developed to identify and estimate the background sources for future below-the-limb very high energy (E>10 PeV) astrophysical neutrino observations, as well as above-the-limb cosmic ray induced signals (E>1 PeV). The second is a fluorescence telescope (FT) being developed for detection of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). In preparation for the expected launch in 2023, extensive simulations tuned by preliminary laboratory measurements have been performed to understand the FT capabilities. The energy threshold has been estimated at 1018.2 eV, and results in a maximum detection rate at 1018.6 eV when taking into account the shape of the UHECR spectrum. In addition, onboard software has been developed based on the simulations as well as experience with previous EUSO missions. This includes a level 1 trigger to be run on the computationally limited flight hardware, as well as a deep learning based prioritization algorithm in order to accommodate the balloon's telemetry budget. These techniques could also be used later for future, space-based missions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000589621",,"1824-8039","10.22323/1.395.0405","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589621","en","Sissa Medialab","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Budget control||Cosmic rays||Cosmology||Deep learning||Fluorescence||Telescopes","Expected Performance of the EUSO-SPB2 Fluorescence Telescope","Conference Paper","Open access","Proceedings of 37th International Cosmic Ray Conference",,,"2023-01-03T04:37:56Z",,,,,,"yes","37th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2021)","July 12-23, 2021","Online",,,,,,,,,,"85144591925",,,"Pos proc. sci.",,"PoS: Proceedings of Science","395","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

EUSO-SPB2 is a pathfinder mission for instruments like the proposed Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA). The purpose of such a space-based observatory is to measure UHECRs and UHE neutrinos with high statistics and uniform exposure. EUSO-SPB2 is designed with two Schmidt telescopes, each optimized for their respective observational goals. The Fluorescence Telescope looks at the nadir to measure the fluorescence emission from UHECR-induced extensive air shower (EAS), while the Cherenkov Telescope is optimized for fast signals (∼10 ns) and points near the Earth's limb. This allows for the measurement of Cherenkov light from EAS caused by Earth skimming VHE neutrinos if pointed slightly below the limb or from UHECRs if observing slightly above. The expected launch date of EUSO-SPB2 is Spring 2023 from Wanaka, NZ with target duration of up to 100 days. Such a flight would provide thousands of VHECR Cherenkov signals in addition to tens of UHECR fluorescence tracks. Neither of these kinds of events have been observed from either orbital or suborbital altitudes before, making EUSO-SPB2 crucial to move forward towards a space-based instrument. It will also enhance the understanding of potential background signals for both detection techniques. This contribution will provide a short overview of the detector and the current status of the mission as well as its scientific goals.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000589610",,"1824-8039","10.22323/1.395.0404","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589610","en","Sissa Medialab","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cosmic rays||Cosmology||Fluorescence||Orbits||Particle detectors||Telescopes","Science and mission status of EUSO-SPB2","Conference Paper","Open access","Proceedings of 37th International Cosmic Ray Conference",,,"2023-01-03T04:37:34Z",,,,,,"yes","37th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2021)","July 12-23, 2021","Online",,,,,,,,,,"85144607297",,,"Pos proc. sci.",,"PoS: Proceedings of Science","395","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The detector has been observing Earth at night-time in the UV range and detected a wide variety of transient sources all of which have been modeled through Monte Carlo simulations. Mini-EUSO is also capable of detecting meteors and potentially space debris and we performed simulations for such events to estimate their impact on future missions for cosmic ray science from space. We show here examples of the simulation work done in this framework to analyze the Mini-EUSO data. The expected response of Mini-EUSO with respect to ultra high energy cosmic ray showers has been studied. The efficiency curve of Mini-EUSO as a function of primary energy has been estimated and the energy threshold for Cosmic Rays has been placed to be above 1021 eV. We compared the morphology of several transient events detected during the mission with cosmic ray simulations and excluded that they can be due to cosmic ray showers. To validate the energy threshold of the detector, a system of ground based flashers is being used for end-to-end calibration purposes.

While Europe has suffered from drought events in the last decade unlike ever seen since the beginning of weather recordings, harmonized long-term datasets across the continent are needed to monitor change and support predictions. Here we present soil moisture data from 66 cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNSs) in Europe (COSMOS-Europe for short) covering recent drought events. The CRNS sites are distributed across Europe and cover all major land use types and climate zones in Europe. The raw neutron count data from the CRNS stations were provided by 24 research institutions and processed using state-of-the-art methods. The harmonized processing included correction of the raw neutron counts and a harmonized methodology for the conversion into soil moisture based on available in situ information. In addition, the uncertainty estimate is provided with the dataset, information that is particularly useful for remote sensing and modeling applications. This paper presents the current spatiotemporal coverage of CRNS stations in Europe and describes the protocols for data processing from raw measurements to consistent soil moisture products. The data of the presented COSMOS-Europe network open up a manifold of potential applications for environmental research, such as remote sensing data validation, trend analysis, or model assimilation The dataset could be of particular importance for the analysis of extreme climatic events at the continental scale. Due its timely relevance in the scope of climate change in the recent years, we demonstrate this potential application with a brief analysis on the spatiotemporal soil moisture variability.

However, the potential predictive skill gained from stratospheric variability can be limited by biases in the representation of stratospheric processes and the coupling of the stratosphere with surface climate in forecast systems. This study provides a first systematic identification of model biases in the stratosphere across a wide range of subseasonal forecast systems.  It is found that many of the forecast systems considered exhibit warm global-mean temperature biases from the lower to middle stratosphere, too strong/cold wintertime polar vortices, and too cold extratropical upper-troposphere/lower-stratosphere regions. Furthermore, tropical stratospheric anomalies associated with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation tend to decay toward each system's climatology with lead time. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), most systems do not capture the seasonal cycle of extreme-vortex-event probabilities, with an underestimation of sudden stratospheric warming events and an overestimation of strong vortex events in January. In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), springtime interannual variability in the polar vortex is generally underestimated, but the timing of the final breakdown of the polar vortex often happens too early in many of the prediction systems.  These stratospheric biases tend to be considerably worse in systems with lower model lid heights. In both hemispheres, most systems with low-top atmospheric models also consistently underestimate the upward wave driving that affects the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex. We expect that the biases identified here will help guide model development for subseasonal-to-seasonal forecast systems and further our understanding of the role of the stratosphere in predictive skill in the troposphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000564968",,"2698-4024","10.5194/wcd-2022-12","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/564968","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Quantifying stratospheric biases and identifying their potential sources in subseasonal forecast systems","Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2022-08-19T09:36:48Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application||Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events","170523||198896","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,"109208972",,,,,,"Weather and Climate Dynamics Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Primary ice crystals are formed on ice-nucleating particles (INPs), which measurements suggest are sparsely populated in the troposphere. INPs are emitted by a large number of ground-based sources into the atmosphere, from where they can be lifted up to cloud heights. Therefore, it is vital to understand vertical INP transport mechanisms, which are particularly complex over orographic terrain. We investigate the vertical transport and mixing mechanisms of INPs over orographic terrain during cloudy conditions by simultaneous measurements of in situ INP concentration at a high valley and a mountaintop site in the Swiss Alps in late winter 2019. On the mountaintop, the INP concentrations were, on average, lower than in the high valley. However, a diurnal cycle in INP concentrations was observed at the mountaintop, which was absent in the high valley. The median mountaintop INP concentration equilibrated to the concentration found in the high valley towards the night. We found that, in nearly 70g% of the observed cases, INP-rich air masses were orographically lifted from low elevation upstream of the measurement site. In addition, we present evidence that, over the course of the day, air masses containing high INP concentrations were advected from the Swiss plateau towards the measurement sites, contributing to the diurnal cycle of INPs. Our results suggest a local INP concentration enhancement over the Alps during cloud events.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539465",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-3111-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539465","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Unveiling atmospheric transport and mixing mechanisms of ice-nucleating particles over the Alps","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-26T04:52:32Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Exploiting orographic clouds for constraining the sources of ice crystals","175824","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85126636082",,"000768208500001","Atmos. chem. phys.","5","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A key finding from these model studies is that the radiative forcing would increase sublinearly with increasing SO2 injection because most of the added sulfur increases the mass of existing particles, resulting in shorter aerosol residence times and aerosols that are above the optimal size for scattering. Injection of SO3 or H2SO4 from an aircraft in stratospheric flight is expected to produce particles predominantly in the accumulation-mode size range following microphysical processing within an expanding plume, and such injection may result in a smaller average stratospheric particle size, allowing a given injection of sulfur to produce more radiative forcing. We report the first multi-model intercomparison to evaluate this approach, which we label AM-H2SO4 injection. A coordinated multi-model experiment designed to represent this SO3- or H2SO4-driven geoengineering scenario was carried out with three interactive stratospheric aerosol microphysics models: the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model (CESM2) with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) atmospheric configuration, the Max-Planck Institute's middle atmosphere version of ECHAM5 with the HAM microphysical module (MAECHAM5-HAM) and ETH's SOlar Climate Ozone Links with AER microphysics (SOCOL-AER) coordinated as a test-bed experiment within the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP). The intercomparison explores how the injection of new accumulation-mode particles changes the large-scale particle size distribution and thus the overall radiative and dynamical response to stratospheric sulfur injection. Each model used the same injection scenarios testing AM-H2SO4 and SO2 injections at 5 and 25 Tg(S) yr−1 to test linearity and climate response sensitivity. All three models find that AM-H2SO4 injection increases the radiative efficacy, defined as the radiative forcing per unit of sulfur injected, relative to SO2 injection. Increased radiative efficacy means that when compared to the use of SO2 to produce the same radiative forcing, AM-H2SO4 emissions would reduce side effects of sulfuric acid aerosol geoengineering that are proportional to mass burden. The model studies were carried out with two different idealized geographical distributions of injection mass representing deployment scenarios with different objectives, one designed to force mainly the midlatitudes by injecting into two grid points at 30∘ N and 30∘ S, and the other designed to maximize aerosol residence time by injecting uniformly in the region between 30∘ S and 30∘ N. Analysis of aerosol size distributions in the perturbed stratosphere of the models shows that particle sizes evolve differently in response to concentrated versus dispersed injections depending on the form of the injected sulfur (SO2 gas or AM-H2SO4 particulate) and suggests that prior model results for concentrated injection of SO2 may be strongly dependent on model resolution. Differences among models arise from differences in aerosol formulation and differences in model dynamics, factors whose interplay cannot be easily untangled by this intercomparison.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539456",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-2955-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539456","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"An interactive stratospheric aerosol model intercomparison of solar geoengineering by stratospheric injection of SO2 or accumulation-mode sulfuric acid aerosols","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-26T04:44:24Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"The Overlooked Role of Stratospheric Ozone in forcing Northern Hemispheric climate (TORSO)||Exploring the chemical and climatic impacts of solid particles for stratospheric solar geoengineering","180043||ETH-17 19-2","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100003006","SNF||ETHZ","Ambizione||ETH Grants",,,,"85126614890",,"000766512400001","Atmos. chem. phys.","5","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As such, electric vehicles have the potential to mitigate the excessive heat in urban areas—a problem which has been exacerbated due to urbanisation and climate change. Still, the heat mitigation potential of electric vehicles has not been fully understood. Here, we combine high-resolution traffic heat emission inventories with an urban climate model to simulate the impact of the fleet electrification to the near-surface air temperature in the tropical city of Singapore. We show that a full replacement of traditional internal combustion engine vehicles with electric vehicles reduces the near-surface air temperature by up to 0.6°C. The heat mitigation potential is highest during the morning traffic peak and over areas with the largest traffic density. Interestingly, the reduction in exhaust heat emissions due to the fleet electrification during the evening traffic peak hardly leads to a reduction of near-surface air-temperatures, which is attributed to the different atmospheric conditions during morning and evening. This study presents a new quantification of the city-wide impact of electric vehicles on the air temperature in a tropical urban area. The results may support policy-makers toward designing holistic solutions to address the challenge of climate change adaptation and mitigation in cities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000537341",,"2296-665X","10.3389/fenvs.2022.810342","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/537341","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","urban climate||electric vehicles||heat mitigation||urban heat island||Singapore","Do Electric Vehicles Mitigate Urban Heat?

Individually, these structures have a significant impact on the midlatitude weather evolution, and the impact of their interaction is still a subject of research in the atmospheric sciences. A first step towards a deeper understanding of the meteorological processes is to extract the geometry of jet streams, for which we develop an integration-based feature extraction algorithm. Thus, rather than characterizing jet core line purely as extremal line structure of wind magnitude, our core-line definition includes a regularization to favor jet core lines that align with the wind vector field. Based on the line geometry, proximity-based filtering can automatically detect potential interactions between WCBs and jets, and results of an automatic detection of split and merge events of jets can be visualized in relation to the tropopause. Taking ERA5 reanalysis data as input, we first extract jet stream core lines using an integration-based predictor-corrector approach that admits momentarily weak air streams. Using WCB trajectories and the tropopause geometry as context, we visualize individual cases, showing how WCBs influence the acceleration and displacement of jet streams, and how the tropopause behaves near split and merge locations of jets. Multiple geographical projections, slicing, as well as direct and indirect volume rendering further support the interactive analysis. Using our tool, we obtained a new perspective on the three-dimensional jet movement, which can stimulate follow-up research.

We use global model simulations by the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) which is part of the Community Earth System Model version 1.0 (CESM1). WACCM is associated with the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA) sectional aerosol microphysics model which includes full sulphur chemical and microphysical cycles with no a priori assumption on particle size. Five main volcanic events (Kelud, Calbuco, Ambae, Raikoke and Ulawun) have been reported and are shown to have significantly influenced the stratospheric aerosol layer in the tropics, either through direct injection in this region or through transport from extra-tropical latitudes. Space-borne data as well as ground-based lidar and balloon-borne in situ observations are used to evaluate the model calculations in terms of aerosol content, vertical distribution, optical and microphysical properties, transport and residence time of the various volcanic plumes. Overall, zonal mean model results reproduce the occurrence and vertical extents of the plumes derived from satellite observations but shows some discrepancies for absolute values of extinction and of stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD). Features of meridional transport of the plumes emitted from extra-tropical latitudes are captured by the model but simulated absolute values of SAOD differ from 6 to 200% among the various eruptions. Simulations tend to agree well with observed in situ vertical profiles for the Kelud and Calbuco plumes but this is likely to depend on the period for which comparison is done. Some explanations for the model– measurement discrepancies are discussed such as the inaccurate knowledge of the injection parameters and the presence of ash not accounted in the simulations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000532267",,"2073-4433","10.3390/atmos13020250","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/532267","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","stratospheric aerosols||volcanic eruptions||satellite||balloon-borne observations||lidar||modelling","Variability of the Aerosol Content in the Tropical Lower Stratosphere from 2013 to 2019: Evidence of Volcanic Eruption Impacts","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-02-12T04:19:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85124073675",,,,"2","Atmosphere","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we analyse drought indicators, evapotranspiration and meteorological data from point observations, reanalyses and regional climate model data to assess trends and drivers of summer drought in Switzerland in the period 1981-2020. The drought indicators from station observations and ERA5-Land and ERA5 reanalyses show a tendency towards drier summer half-years (climatic water balance: -39 mm decade-1, 0-1 m integrated soil water content: -5 to -7 mm decade-1) with a drying in most months from March to October. Both, increasing evapotranspiration (potential evapotranspiration: +21 mm decade-1 or +7% K-1 warming; actual evapotranspiration: +8 to +15 mm decade-1) and a non-significant precipitation decrease of 17 mm decade-1 are identified as important and roughly equivalent drivers. The reanalyses show considerable differences for soil water and actual evapotranspiration, especially in drought summers. The ERA5 soil is clearly drier than the one in ERA5-Land. ERA5 evapotranspiration is smallest and partly soil moisture-limited in drought years while evapotranspiration in ERA5-Land is highest, still mainly energy-limited and scales well with temperature (+4% K-1 warming). ERA5-Land seems to better match with in situ measurements of soil water and evapotranspiration than ERA5, but considerable differences with in situ measurements remain. Variability and trends of the drought drivers temperature and precipitation are also investigated in the EURO-CORDEX regional climate model ensemble. Most simulations considerably underestimate the recent warming and the ensemble shows a large possible range of precipitation changes with a mean change near zero. The summer precipitation-temperature scaling and the correlation between summer temperature and precipitation on the interannual time scale are mostly overestimated. Our results highlight that the analysis of Central European summer drought evolution and its drivers remains challenging especially with regional climate model data, but considerable uncertainties also exist in reanalyses.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000535467",,"2515-7620","10.1088/2515-7620/ac4fb9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/535467","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","summer drought||evapotranspiration||soil water content||trends||climate change||regional climate models||reanalysis","Trends and drivers of recent summer drying in Switzerland","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-05T14:50:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85126872321",,"000756007700001","Environ.

The non-ideal interactions between these species and other inorganic and organic compounds within aqueous particle phases affect hygroscopicity, acidity, and gas-particle partitioning of semivolatile components. In this work, we present an extended version of the Aerosol Inorganic-Organic Mixtures Functional groups Activity Coefficients (AIOMFAC) model by incorporating the ions I-, IO3-, HCO3-, CO32-, OH-, and CO2(aq) as new species. First, AIOMFAC ion interaction parameters for aqueous solutions were determined based on available thermodynamic data, such as water activity, mean molal activity coefficients, solubility, and vapor-liquid equilibrium measurements. Second, the interaction parameters for the new ions and various organic functional groups were optimized based on experimental data or, where data are scarce, alternative estimation methods such as multiple linear regression or a simple substitution by analogy approach. Additional bulk water activity and electrodynamic balance measurements were carried out to augment the database for the AIOMFAC parameter fit. While not optimal, we show that the use of alternative parameter estimation methods enables physically sound predictions and offers the benefit of a more broadly applicable model. Our implementation of the aqueous carbonate-bicarbonate-CO2(aq) system accounts for the associated temperature-dependent dissociation equilibria explicitly and enables closed- or open-system computations with respect to carbon dioxide equilibration with the gas phase. We discuss different numerical approaches for solving the coupled equilibrium conditions and highlight critical considerations when extremely acidic or basic mixtures are encountered. The fitted AIOMFAC model performance for inorganic aqueous systems is considered excellent over the whole range of mixture compositions where reference data are available. Moreover, the model provides physically meaningful predictions of water activity under highly concentrated conditions. For organic-inorganic mixtures involving new species, the model-measurement agreement is found to be good in most cases, especially at equilibrium relative humidities above g1/4g70g%; reasons for deviations are discussed. Several applications of the extended model are shown and discussed, including the effects of ignoring the auto-dissociation of water in carbonate systems, the effects of mixing bisulfate and bicarbonate compounds in closed- or open-system scenarios on pH and solution speciation, and the prediction of critical cloud condensation nucleus activation of NaI or Na2CO3 particles mixed with suberic acid.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000530415",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-973-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/530415","en","European Geosciences Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Extension of the AIOMFAC model by iodine and carbonate species: applications for aerosol acidity and cloud droplet activation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-02-02T04:12:37Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Infectivity of influenza viruses in expiratory aerosols under ambient temperatures and humidities (IVEA)","189939","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Sinergia",,,,"85123398743",,"000747691900001","Atmos. chem. phys.","2","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Europe has a well-established air quality research infrastructure from which yearlong datasets using 21 aerosol chemical speciation monitors (ACSMs) and 1 aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) were gathered during 2013-2019. It includes 9 non-urban and 13 urban sites. This study developed a state-of-the-art source apportionment protocol to analyse long-term OA mass spectrum data by applying the most advanced source apportionment strategies (i.e., rolling PMF, ME-2, and bootstrap). This harmonised protocol enables the quantifications of the most common OA components such as hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), cooking-like OA (COA), more oxidised-oxygenated OA (MO-OOA), and less oxidised-oxygenated OA (LO-OOA). Other components such as coal combustion OA (CCOA), solid fuel OA (SFOA: mainly mixture of coal and peat combustion), cigarette smoke OA (CSOA), sea salt (mostly inorganic but part of the OA mass spectrum), coffee OA, and ship industry OA could also be separated at a few specific sites. Oxygenated OA (OOA) components make up most of the submicron OA mass (average = 71.1%, a range of 43.7-100%). Solid fuel combustion-related OA components (i.e., BBOA, CCOA, and SFOA) are still considerable with in total 16.0% yearly contribution to the OA, yet mainly during winter months (21.4%). Overall, this comprehensive protocol works effectively across all sites governed by different sources and generates robust and consistent source apportionment results.

Especially regarding precipitation formation, increasing aerosol concentrations are assumed to delay the precipitation onset, but may increase precipitation rates via convective invigoration and orographic spillover further downstream. In this study, we analyse the effect of increased aerosol concentrations on a heavy precipitation event observed in summer 2017 over northeastern Switzerland, an event which was considerably underestimated by the operational weather forecast model. Preceding the precipitation event, Saharan dust was advected towards the Alps, which could have contributed to increased precipitation rates north of the Alpine ridge. To investigate the potential impact of the increased ambient aerosol concentrations on surface precipitation, we perform a series of sensitivity simulations using the Consortium for Small-scale Modeling (COSMO) model with different microphysical parametrizations and prognostic aerosol perturbations. The results show that the choice of the microphysical parametrization scheme in terms of a one- or two-moment scheme has the relatively largest impact on surface precipitation rates. In the one-moment scheme, surface precipitation is strongly reduced over the Alpine ridge and increased further downstream. Simulated changes in surface precipitation in response to aerosol perturbations remain smaller in contrast to the impact of the microphysics scheme. Elevated cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations lead to increased cloud water and decreased cloud ice mass, especially in regions of high convective activity south of the Alps. These altered cloud properties indeed increase surface precipitation further downstream, but the simulated change is too small to explain the observed heavy precipitation event. Additional ice-nucleating particles (INPs) increase cloud ice mass, but only trigger local changes in downstream surface precipitation. Thus, increased aerosol number concentrations during the Saharan dust outbreak are unlikely to have caused the heavy precipitation event in summer 2017.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000524995",,"0035-9009||1477-870X","10.1002/qj.4240","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524995","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions||alpine meteorology||mixed-phase clouds||regional modelling||Saharan dust","Aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions during a Saharan dust event – A summertime case‐study from the Alps","Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-12T19:19:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"105352820","85122442874",,"000741472200001","Q.

Particulate matter (PM) also affects the climate and ecosystem directly and indirectly. PM can not only be emitted directly to the atmosphere as primary aerosols but secondary aerosols can also be formed by various aging processes. With 99% of the global population exposed to high PM2.5 (PM with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 µm) levels larger than the new WHO air quality guideline (annual average of 5 µg/m3), it is more important than ever to mitigate the PM level more effectively. Therefore, it is extremely crucial to continuously have a high-quality and timely characterization of its sources to design/validate mitigation strategies. This dissertation focuses on developing and implementing novel source apportionment (SA) analyses of PM across Europe. The datasets were collected using different versions of the aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) and a compact time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (C-ToF-AMS), which typically provide the aerosol composition in real-time with a time resolution of 30 min. One of the major components of PM is organic aerosol (OA). Positive matrix factorization (PMF) has been widely deployed on the OA mass spectrum to resolve its sources and their respective contributions quantitatively. Typically, the multilinear engine (ME-2) has been proven to be a useful tool to control rotational ambiguity of PMF model to provide environmental-reasonable solutions. In addition, a rolling window PMF approach has been introduced to conduct PMF within a smaller time window of 14/28 days and move with a one day. This approach allows the model to capture temporal variations of factor profiles, which has been proved to provide better separations among different factors. With a well-established air quality monitoring network in Europe, a standardized SA protocol has been developed while practicing advanced SA (rolling window PMF approach with ME-2) using 22 ACSM/AMS datasets since 2013 (13 urban and 9 non-urban sites). Overall, this comprehensive protocol works effectively across all sites governed by different sources and generates robust and consistent source apportionment results. In addition, this thesis has provided a comprehensive picture of OA sources in Europe that covers all seasons with a time resolution of 30-240 min. It enables the quantifications of the most common OA components such as hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA, related to traffic, 10.7 ± 3.8%), biomass burning OA (BBOA, 12.4 ± 6.9%), cooking-like OA (COA, 14.5 ± 2.5%), more oxidised-oxygenated OA (MO-OOA, 44.4 ± 12.6%), and less oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA, 27.9 ± 6.5%). Other components such as coal combustion OA (CCOA), solid fuel OA (SFOA: mainly a mixture of coal and peat combustion), cigarette smoke OA (CSOA), sea salt (mostly inorganic but part of the OA mass spectrum), coffee OA, and ship industry OA could also be identified at certain sites. Oxygenated OA (OOA) components make up most of the submicron OA mass (average = 71.1%, range from 43.7 to 100%). Solid fuel combustion-related OA components (i.e., BBOA, CCOA, and SFOA) are also considerable, totalling 16.0% of yearly contribution to the OA, with peak contributions during winter months (21.4%).  The second study presents the chemical composition and source apportionment of the submicron particle measurements in Magadino. This study conducted a novel and advanced SA approach by strictly following the standardized protocol to capture the temporal variations of source factors in a long-term dataset. It is a role model for similar analyses, which provides sophisticated OA information in a southern alpine valley. This study resolves three primary sources, an HOA factor, a BBOA factor, and a 58 related OA (58-OA) factor. Moreover, two secondary factors are identified: a MO-OOA and a LO-OOA factor. This study also demonstrated the robustness of this novel SA technique by comparing it with conventional seasonal PMF results. The third study demonstrates the state-of-the-art SA technique to provide robust OA sources in real-time (a few minutes after every scan) using yearlong ACSM datasets collected in three European cities, Athens, Paris, and Zurich. It shows remarkable robustness with an excellent agreement between this technique and the rolling results generated by following the abovementioned protocol. Although the real-time SA requires some a priori information about the sampling site (i.e., an appropriate number of factors and their corresponding factor profiles), this technique minimizes user interactions (requiring high levels of technical expertise). Overall, this PhD thesis developed and implemented state-of-the-art SA techniques on the OA mass spectrum across Europe. It provided high-quality SA results in high-time resolution across Europe with unprecedentedly extensive spatial and temporal coverage. Similar studies should be conducted in other continents to understand global OA sources better. The broad application of the new real-time SA approach allows for a larger spatial coverage of robust OA source information in real-time, which could be revolutionary to the next-generation climate/air quality model and helps authorities design/validate timely actions to successfully reduce the air pollution levels.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000575526",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575526","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Atmospheric science||Source apportionment||Air Pollution","Investigation of Organic Aerosol Sources across Europe using Novel Source Apportionment Techniques","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2022-10-12T09:55:47Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"28494",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This will assist the accurate quantification of their impact on future climate, and as a result, their regulation. Inverse modeling of GHG surface fluxes is a widely used top-down method to decrypt all those challenges. Inverse modeling integrates atmospheric observations of GHGs, apriori knowledge of their emissions, atmospheric chemistry transport models, and an inverse modeling framework to infer an optimum state with reduced uncertainty of the emissions. This work advances and applies inverse modeling of GHGs by (a) introducing a novel treatment of turbulent diffusion in Lagrangian particle dispersion models (LPDM) – reducing the error associated with atmospheric transport models –, (b) conveying the importance of a dense halocarbonsmeasurement network in Switzerland through inverse modeling studies, (c) providing an answer to the importance of high-resolution atmospheric transport models for national scale inversions, and (d) characterizing the uncertainty associated with the inversion framework through sensitivity inversions. Specifically, I developed a new turbulence diffusion parametrization scheme for the LPDM FLEXPART tailored towards the use of input meteorology fromthe regional atmospheric model COSMO, suitable for high-resolution inverse modeling applications. The novel scheme addresses the excessive dispersion observed in high-resolution simulations with FLEXPART’s default turbulence scheme at this resolution, which was producing a significant underestimation of the tracer’s observed concentration and variability. The new parameterization scheme was validated against observations and showed improved behavior compared to the default scheme. Its derivation methodology can be applied to different resolutions and othermodeling setups.  Subsequently, the new high-resolution inversion system was utilized to evaluate the Swiss emissions and the spatial distribution of four F-gases and the superiority of the high-resolution system is clearly demonstrated compared to the old system. Furthermore, sensitivity inversions are conducted varying different inversion parameters (e.g., inversion grid, spatial distribution of a-priori emissions, covariance parameters like baseline uncertainty and spatial correlation length, temporal resolution of the assimilated observations, observation network,seasonality of emissions) achieving the characterization of the error and its uncertainty in a Bayesian inversion framework. These high-resolution simulations were only possible because of new measurements of about 60 synthetic GHGs fron two sites (Beromünster and Sottens) on the Swiss Plateau conducted in the duration of the project by another PhD student. By employing them I demonstrate the power of a high-resolution inverse modeling system coupled with a dense measurement network.  A first study with observations from just one of the two sites (Beromünster) inferred the Swiss emission estimates for 28 synthetic GHGs using two top-downmethods and directly compared them with the inventory values. The results fromboth studies spell out the need for investment in extending the national measurement network for halocarbons. This work is a big step towards mitigating the errors associated with the applied transport model and better characterizing the uncertainty of the inversion system. Apart from its direct contribution to the development of inverse modeling of GHGs, this work uncovers areas where additional research (e.g., turbulence diffusion parameterizations in LPDMs and inverse modeling studies with different methods trying to assess the biggest sources of uncertainty) is needed, further assisting the evolution of inverse modeling.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000578641",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/578641","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Climate change mitigation||Greenhouse gas emissions||Atmosphere","Advances in Inverse Modelling for the Estimation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2022-10-31T11:40:40Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"28760",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the potential predictive skill gained from stratospheric variability can be limited by biases in the representation of stratospheric processes and the coupling of the stratosphere with surface climate in forecast systems. This study provides a first systematic identification of model biases in the stratosphere across a wide range of subseasonal forecast systems.  It is found that many of the forecast systems considered exhibit warm global-mean temperature biases from the lower to middle stratosphere, too strong/cold wintertime polar vortices, and too cold extratropical upper-troposphere/lower-stratosphere regions. Furthermore, tropical stratospheric anomalies associated with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation tend to decay toward each system's climatology with lead time. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), most systems do not capture the seasonal cycle of extreme-vortex-event probabilities, with an underestimation of sudden stratospheric warming events and an overestimation of strong vortex events in January. In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), springtime interannual variability in the polar vortex is generally underestimated, but the timing of the final breakdown of the polar vortex often happens too early in many of the prediction systems.  These stratospheric biases tend to be considerably worse in systems with lower model lid heights. In both hemispheres, most systems with low-top atmospheric models also consistently underestimate the upward wave driving that affects the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex. We expect that the biases identified here will help guide model development for subseasonal-to-seasonal forecast systems and further our understanding of the role of the stratosphere in predictive skill in the troposphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000566360",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-3-977-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566360","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Quantifying stratospheric biases and identifying their potential sources in subseasonal forecast systems","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-25T09:40:26Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application||Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events","170523||198896","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,,"85137841180",,,"Weather Clim.

Clouds redistribute fresh water and alter Earth’s radiative balance, thus, impacting the climate. Both precipitation formation and the radiative response of clouds are strongly related to the fraction of ice in them. The varying abundance of aerosol particles needed for cloud formation and the complex interplay between cloud particles during cloud evolution complicate an accurate representation of clouds in weather and climate models. This is especially critical in orographic regions, which frequently trigger precipitation, and in highly climate sensitive regions like the Arctic, which currently experiences warming at an unprecedented rate. In these regions, mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) consisting of ice crystals and supercooled cloud droplets are frequently ob- served and persistently prevail. In an MPC, ice nucleating particles (INPs), a subclass of atmospheric aerosol particles, are needed for the formation of primary ice crystals. Quantifying the abundance of INPs is challenging given their sparse atmospheric concentration. Compared to the global average, atmospheric INP concentrations are even lower in remote regions such as the Alps or the Arctic, additionally contributing to uncertainties in model simulations. In addition, the amount of ice crystals can be increased by different processes (e. g., rime splintering, or fragmentation during ice-ice or drop-ice collisions) – commonly referred to as secondary ice production. While different processes leading to secondary ice production have been identified, the occurrence and magnitude of ice enhancement in the atmosphere remain uncertain. This thesis aims to constrain the abundance and variability of atmospheric INPs in remote regions, thereby improving the predictability needed for the representation of MPCs in numerical models, and to assess the prevalence of secondary ice formation occurring in MPCs. During three field campaigns, each lasting between seven and ten weeks, synergistic datasets of aerosol, clouds, and snow from in situ and remote sensing observations were obtained and complemented with meteorological and model re-analysis datasets. In the four studies presented in this thesis, the field observations were used to assess different aspects of primary and secondary ice formation in MPCs. Specifically, this includes the atmospheric transport of INPs, assessment of secondary ice production from remote sensing observations, and the predictability of INPs from snow samples and parameterizations. During the Role of Aerosols and CLouds Enhanced by Topography on Snow (RACLETS) campaign in the Swiss Alps in late winter 2019, INP concentrations were measured in situ in a high valley and on a nearby mountaintop using high flow rate impingers for sampling and drop-freezing techniques for the analysis. Analysis of the diurnal variability of INP concentrations revealed that on average INP concentrations on the mountaintop increased over the course of the day, while they remained constant in the high valley. The diurnal cycle on the mountaintop was related to the enhanced advection of INP-rich air masses from the Swiss plateau. The INP concentrations measured at the mountaintop were further used to validate the retrieval of INP concentration from dust-carrying and continental air masses using ground-based lidar (light detection and ranging). For the latter, a calibration factor is proposed validating the INP lidar retrieval from continental air masses for the first time. In addition, a novel approach to estimate secondary ice production from remote sensing observations is proposed. Indications for secondary ice production in Alpine MPCs were found at all observed temperatures between −5 ◦C and −30 ◦C with an average enhancement of ice crystals by nearly two orders of magnitude. During the Ny-Ålesund AeroSol Cloud ExperimeNT (NASCENT) in the Arctic in autumn 2019 and spring 2020, INP concentrations were measured in situ at sea level. Comparing the observations between the contrasting seasons, no significant difference in median INP concentration was found – contrary to previous observations. Furthermore, a statistically reliable relationship between INP concentration and aerosol properties was not found. Exploiting the log-normal characteristic and temperature dependence of INP concentration occurrence, a novel INP parameterization is proposed for the Arctic, for which no parameterization exists so far. In parallel to the observations of INP concentrations in ambient air, INP concentrations were determined in fresh snow samples, which were converted to INP concentrations in ambient air using an estimate of a cloud’s ice water content (IWC). Comparing the INP concentrations found in the fresh snow samples to those of ambient air samples, it could be shown that the method generally works and that for Arctic MPCs an IWC of 0.15 g m−3 is recommended as the conversion factor estimate. The INP retrieval accuracy from the fresh snow samples can be further improved when using individual IWCs per cloud from radar observations. Overall, this thesis explores fundamental aspects related to ice formation in MPCs, including the quantification and atmospheric transport of INPs, and the prevalence of ice crystal multiplication during cloud evolution. In addition to the individual studies, all findings and their general implications, i. e., abundance and predictability of INPs, and prevalence of ice multiplication in remote regions, are synthesized and recommendations for the usage of different INP measurement methods are presented based on the work in this thesis. Ultimately, the obtained insight and proposed methods further our understanding of ice formation and evolution in MPCs, and could contribute to refinement of weather forecasts and global climate projections.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000565134",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/565134","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CLOUDS (METEOROLOGY)||Aerosols and Clouds||Aerosols||Ice Nucleation||Ice Nucleating Particles||Ice nuclei||PRECIPITATION/INFLUENCE OF TOPOGRAPHY (METEOROLOGY)||Orographic clouds||Orographic precipitation||METEOROLOGY||Arctic||Arctic clouds||ALPS (EUROPEAN MOUNTAINS)||Field measurements||Climate","Ice formation in remote regions: From nucleation to multiplication","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2022-08-21T15:11:14Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"28286",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Exhaustive evaluations on model representation of aerosol distributions and properties are fundamental to assess health and climate impacts of BBA. Here we conducted a comprehensive comparison of Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project model simulations with satellite observations. A total of 59 runs by 18 models from three AeroCom Phase-III experiments (i.e., biomass burning emissions, CTRL16, and CTRL19) and 14 satellite products of aerosols were used in the study. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm was investigated during the fire season over three key fire regions reflecting different fire dynamics (i.e., deforestation-dominated Amazon, Southern Hemisphere Africa where savannas are the key source of emissions, and boreal forest burning in boreal North America). The 14 satellite products were first evaluated against AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations, with large uncertainties found. But these uncertainties had small impacts on the model evaluation that was dominated by modeling bias. Through a comparison with Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances measurements with the Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties algorithm (POLDER-GRASP), we found that the modeled AOD values were biased by -93% to 152 %, with most models showing significant underestimations even for the state-of-the-art aerosol modeling techniques (i.e., CTRL19). By scaling up BBA emissions, the negative biases in modeled AOD were significantly mitigated, although it yielded only negligible improvements in the correlation between models and observations, and the spatial and temporal variations in AOD biases did not change much. For models in CTRL16 and CTRL19, the large diversity in modeled AOD was in almost equal measures caused by diversity in emissions, lifetime, and the mass extinction coefficient (MEC). We found that in the AeroCom ensemble, BBA lifetime correlated significantly with particle deposition (as expected) and in turn correlated strongly with precipitation. Additional analysis based on Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol profiles suggested that the altitude of the aerosol layer in the current models was generally too low, which also contributed to the bias in modeled lifetime. Modeled MECs exhibited significant correlations with the Angstrom exponent (AE, an indicator of particle size). Comparisons with the POLDER-GRASP-observed AE suggested that the models tended to overestimate the AE (underestimated particle size), indicating a possible underestimation of MECs in models. The hygroscopic growth in most models generally agreed with observations and might not explain the overall underestimation of modeled AOD. Our results imply that current global models contain biases in important aerosol processes for BBA (e.g., emissions, removal, and optical properties) that remain to be addressed in future research.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000569859",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-11009-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/569859","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Satellite-based evaluation of AeroCom model bias in biomass burning regions","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-09T18:12:57Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000847671100001","Atmos. chem. phys.","17","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recent work showed that amplified Rossby wavenumber 5 and 7 show phase-locking behavior which can trigger simultaneous warm anomalies in different breadbasket regions in the Northern Hemisphere. These types of wave patterns thus pose a potential threat to human health and ecosystems. The representation of such persistent wave events in summer and their surface anomalies in general circulation models (GCMs) has not been systematically analyzed. Here we validate the representation of wavenumbers 1–10 in three state-of-the-art global climate models (EC-Earth, CESM, and MIROC), quantify their biases, and provide insights into the underlying physical reasons for the biases. To do so, the ExtremeX experiments output data were used, consisting of (1) historic simulations with a freely running atmosphere with prescribed ocean and experiments that additionally (2) nudge towards the observed upper-level horizontal winds, (3) prescribe soil moisture conditions, or (4) do both. The experiments are used to trace the sources of the model biases to either the large-scale atmospheric circulation or surface feedback processes. Focusing on wave 5 and wave 7, we show that while the wave's position and magnitude are generally well represented during high-amplitude (> 1.5 SD) episodes, the associated surface anomalies are substantially underestimated. Near-surface temperature, precipitation and mean sea level pressure are typically underestimated by a factor of 1.5 in terms of normalized standard deviations. The correlations and normalized standard deviations for surface anomalies do not improve if the soil moisture is prescribed. However, the surface biases are almost entirely removed when the upper-level atmospheric circulation is nudged. When both prescribing soil moisture and nudging the upper-level atmosphere, then the surface biases remain quite similar to the experiment with a nudged atmosphere only. We conclude that the near-surface biases in temperature and precipitation are in the first place related to biases in the upper-level circulation. Thus, relatively small biases in the models' representation of the upper-level waves can strongly affect associated temperature and precipitation anomalies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000569906",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-3-905-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/569906","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Summertime Rossby waves in climate models: Substantial biases in surface imprint associated with small biases in upper-level circulation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-09T18:28:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate||Extreme Events: Artificial Intelligence for Detection and Attribution","617518||101003469","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC","FP7||H2020",,,,"85136922060",,,"Weather Clim.

Due to their short tropospheric lifetime of only several days, the aerosol forcing responds quickly to emissions. Here, we present and discuss the evolution of the aerosol forcing since 2000. There are multiple lines of evidence that allow us to robustly conclude that the anthropogenic aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) - both aerosol- radiation interactions (ERFari) and aerosol-cloud interactions (ERFaci) - has become less negative globally, i.e. the trend in aerosol effective radiative forcing changed sign from negative to positive. Bottom-up inventories show that anthropogenic primary aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions declined in most regions of the world; observations related to aerosol burden show declining trends, in particular of the fine-mode particles that make up most of the anthropogenic aerosols; satellite retrievals of cloud droplet numbers show trends in regions with aerosol declines that are consistent with these in sign, as do observations of top-of-atmosphere radiation. Climate model results, including a revised set that is constrained by observations of the ocean heat content evolution show a consistent sign and magnitude for a positive forcing relative to the year 2000 due to reduced aerosol effects. This reduction leads to an acceleration of the forcing of climate change, i.e. an increase in forcing by 0.1 to 0.3 W m(-2), up to 12 % of the total climate forcing in 2019 compared to 1750 according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000572791",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-12221-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572791","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Robust evidence for reversal of the trend in aerosol effective climate forcing","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-27T03:03:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85140652466",,"000855738200001","Atmos. chem. phys.","18","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These extremes can subsequently influence weather in the troposphere from weeks to months and thus are important sources of surface predictability. However, the predictability of the SPVextreme events is limited to 1–2 weeks in state-of-the-art prediction systems. Longer predictability timescales of SPV would strongly benefit long-range surface prediction. One potential option for extending predictability timescales is the use of machine learning (ML). However, it is often unclear which predictors and patterns are important for ML models to make a successful prediction. Here we use explainable multiple linear regressions (MLRs) and an explainable artificial neural network (ANN) framework to model SPV variations and identify one type of extreme SPV events called sudden stratospheric warmings. We employ a NN attribution method to propagate the ANN’s decision-making process backward and uncover feature importance in the predictors. The feature importance of the input is consistent with the known precursors for extreme SPV events. This consistency provides confidence that ANNs can extract reliable and physically meaningful indicators for the prediction of the SPV. In addition, our study shows a simple MLR model can predict the SPV daily variations using sequential feature selection, which provides hints for the connections between the input features and the SPV variations.

While in some models the occurrence of these clouds is strongly reduced under future climate conditions, it remains nearly invariant in others.  These contradictory results reflect our limited understanding of the mechanisms involved in the formation and spatial organisation of these clouds. Processes on different scales are at play: turbulent fluxes, convective mixing, large-scale subsidence, and the clouds themselves, which affect the thermodynamical conditions in their surroundings through diabatic processes (i.e., cloud radiative effects, warming through condensation, evaporative cooling).  To shed light on the complex cloud-circulation coupling, the field campaign Elucidate the Couplings Between Clouds, Convection and Circulation (in short EUREC4A) was carried out in 2020 in the vicinity of the Caribbean island Barbados. The intensive observation period took place from 20 January to 20 February. The overarching goal of the campaign was to provide observational constraints for these low-level cloud processes and their interaction with atmospheric circulations. Already before EUREC4A, it was known that these clouds frequently organise themselves in different mesoscale patterns referred to as Sugar, Gravel, Flower, and Fish. These mesoscale cloud organisation patterns were readily adopted by the EUREC4A community to classify the cloudiness during the campaign.  The campaign included a component called EUREC4Aiso, which operated a stable water isotopologue measurement network consisting of two aircrafts, four ships, and the Barbados Cloud Observatory (BCO), which was the major island-based observational site of EUREC4A. Stable water isotopologues (hereafter water isotopes or isotopes) are non-radioactive water molecules with different molecular structures and weights due to a heavy hydrogen (2H) or oxygen (18O) atom. Here, the isotopes 1H216O, 1H2H16O, and 1H218O were considered and the isotope parameter d2H and d-excess were used to assess isotope effects. The above-mentioned isotopes have different saturation vapour pressures and diffusion velocities, which means that their relative abundance in a given water sample changes during phase transition. The isotopic composition, thus, reflects the accumulated record of all moist atmospheric processes (e.g., evaporation, condensation and mixing) that the sample has experienced since evaporation from the ocean (which is the reference used for the normalisation of atmospheric isotope ratios). Thus, isotopes provide a link to the Lagrangian history of atmospheric water and have the ability to link processes on different scales.  The measurements conducted by the author include measurements of water vapour isotopes in the lower troposphere onboard the French aircraft ATR-42 during 19 research flights that took place between 25 January and 13 February 2020, the continuous measurements of water vapour isotopes at the BCO from 13 January to 17 February 2020, and the collection of 42 rain samples at the BCO from 16 January to 18 February 2020. High consistency was found between the isotope measurements from the different EUREC4Aiso platforms except for an unexpected offset between the two instruments deployed for the vapour measurements at the BCO. Overall, the comparison of the isotope measurements from the different platforms showed that our measurements are of high quality and suitable for model evaluations and process-oriented analyses.  The EUREC4A observations were complemented with ERA5 reanalyses and numerical simulations performed with the isotope-enabled, regional model COSMOiso in a setting with fully resolved convection. Applying a spectral nudging, nested simulations with spatial resolutions of 10 km, 5 km, 1km (referred to as COSMOiso,10km, COSMOiso,5km, COSMOiso,1km), were performed. The simulated cloud organisation patterns approximate the ones found in satellite images. Fish, Flower, and finer-structured (i.e., Gravel and Sugar) cloud patterns are clearly distinguishable in the simulations. However, cold pools, which are closely connected to the different patterns, are only evident in the COSMOiso,1km data. Precipitation is simulated in smaller regions compared to satellite observations. Cloud fraction as well as liquid water contents at cloud base are larger than in aircraft observations. These variables are strongly dependent on the spatial model resolution and generally, they approximate the observations better the higher the resolution. Contrastingly, temperature, humidity, and isotopes in vapour are nearly insensitive to the spatial model resolution. While their temporal variability (except for temperature) matches well with observations, deviations were found with respect to absolute values. The simulations are characterized by a low-level cold-dry bias associated with too strongly depleted vapour and an overly high d-excess. Despite these shortcomings, the high correlation between simulated and measured time series at the synoptic timescale showed that the simulations represent the large-scale forcing in an adequate way. Furthermore, a feature-based analysis of the isotope variability at cloud base showed that the key processes of the mesoscale moisture cycling are well captured by the model.  The role of the large-scale circulation for the trade-wind region and its cloudiness was addressed using trajectories that reach 10 d (using ERA5 winds) or 6 d (with winds from COSMOiso,10km) backward in time. They showed that the air parcels arriving in the lower troposphere near Barbados typically take one of three pathways. Either they cross the North Atlantic at low latitudes with little vertical displacement (typical trade-wind flow) or they descend from high latitudes and altitudes within an extratropical dry intrusion in the rear of a Rossby wave breaking. If the Rossby wave breaking occurs over the eastern North Atlantic/Europe, the air parcels cross the North Atlantic (similarly to the typical trade-wind flow) after completing their descent. If the Rossby waver breaking is situated over the central/western North Atlantic, the air parcels arrive much more directly after their descent (extratropical dry intrusion flow). The different pathways are reflected in the subsidence rate of the trajectories, which is weakest for air parcels following a tropical trade-wind flow and strongest for air parcels travelling within an extratropical dry intrusion flow regime. A link could be established between the subsidence rate and the isotopic composition in the trade-wind region: the stronger the subsidence, the lower the d2H and the higher the d-excess of the vapour and precipitation. In other words, flow regime-specific processes lead to contrasting isotope signals and, therefore, isotopes can be used to identify changes in the large-scale circulation.   The extratropical dry intrusion flow regime was shown to play a crucial role for the occurrence of the Fish cloud pattern. The dry intrusion air parcels either arrive together with the trailing cold front leading to moist and cloudy conditions or they arrive shortly afterwards in the cold sector leading to dry and clear-sky conditions. Independently of this, on a daily basis, the arrival of dry intrusion air parcels in Barbados generally leads to a radiative cooling through the shortwave effect of the Fish cloud and the longwave effect of the dryness in the free troposphere (caused by the strengthened large-scale subsidence within the dry intrusion). Another process that is induced by the large-scale circulation and alters the radiative balance, although not directly connected to shallow clouds, is the formation of an altostratus cloud layer in the mid troposphere. Such an event occurred towards the end of EUREC4A. The trajectory analysis showed that this mid-level cloud layer was formed due to detrainment of moist air parcels from tropical convection at the 0°C-isotherm and subsequent northward transport towards Barbados.  The search for the origin of the isotopic contrasts between cloudy and clear-sky cloud base environments led to novel insights into the overturning circulation associated with clouds. A link was found between the isotopic characteristics of clear-sky environments and the altitude at which detrainment from shallow clouds takes place. Moreover, the comparison of the COSMOiso,1km data to a simple model simulating fractionation due to condensation in a moist adiabatically cooled air parcel during ascent revealed that vapour in COSMOiso,1km is enriched through evaporation in the lower part of the cloud layer and depleted through mixing with surrounding vapour in the upper part of the cloud layer. Finally, strong up- and downdrafts in clouds (assumed to represent shallow convective mixing) were shown to moisten and enrich the lower troposphere more than weak shallow convective mixing.  The work carried out in the framework of this thesis clearly reveals the prominent role of the large-scale circulation for the trade-wind region and its cloudiness. Furthermore, it shows that isotopes reflect changes in the large-scale circulation and provide constraints for processes embedded in the overturning circulation associated with clouds. By adding a complementary perspective to conventional meteorological variables, isotopes substantially contribute to the understanding of atmospheric processes. Combining the isotope signal and the trajectory of an air parcel, one can identify couplings across large distances, which would be difficult to diagnose otherwise.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000586270",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/586270","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","stable water isotopes||numerical weather prediction models||CLOUDS (METEOROLOGY)||Hydrological cycle||METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS","Large-scale circulation drivers and stable water isotope characteristics of shallow clouds over the tropical North Atlantic","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2022-12-12T08:30:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Large-scale circulation drivers and stable water isotope characteristics of low-level clouds over the tropical North Atlantic","188731","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"28824",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recently, due to climate change and water scarcity, abandoned agricultural lands with little surficial crust and negligible vegetation cover have become an increasing source of atmospheric dust worldwide. Unlike deserts, these areas are rich in soluble salt and (bio-)organic compounds. Using soil samples from various sites of the Lake Urmia playa (LUP) in northwestern Iran and airborne dusts collected at nearby meteorological stations, we elucidate how minerals, soluble salts, and organic matter interact to determine the IN activity of saline soils and dust. X-ray powder diffraction shows that the mineralogical composition is dominated by K-feldspars (microcline), quartz, carbonates, and clay minerals. The samples were stripped stepwise of organic matter, carbonates, and soluble salts. After each removal step, the ice nucleation (IN) activity was quantified in terms of onset freezing temperatures (Thet) and heterogeneously frozen fractions (Fhet) by emulsion freezing experiments using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). We examined the influence of soluble salts and pH on microcline and quartz in emulsion freezing experiments, comparing these with reference suspensions of microcline and quartz exposed to salt concentrations and pH levels characteristic of the LUP samples. These analyses, combined with correlations between Thet and Fhet, allow us to identify the components that contribute to or inhibit IN activity. The LUP dusts turn out to be very good INPs, with freezing onset temperatures around 248 K in immersion freezing experiments. Interestingly, their IN activity proves to be dominated by the relatively small share of (bio-)organic matter (1 %–5.3 %). After organic matter removal, the remaining IN activity (Thet≈244 K) can be traced back to the clay fraction, because Thet and Fhet correlate positively with the clay mineral content but negatively with quartz and microcline. We attribute the inability of quartz and microcline to act as INPs to the basic pH of the LUP samples as well as to the presence of soluble salts. After additionally removing soluble salts and carbonates, the IN activity of the samples increased again significantly (Thet≈249 K), and the negative correlation with quartz and microcline turned into a slightly positive one. Removing carbonates and salts from the natural samples leads to an increase in Thet and Fhet as well, indicating that their presence also suppresses the IN activity of the (bio-)organic INPs. Overall, this study demonstrates that mineral and organic INPs do not just add up to yield the IN activity of soil dust but that the freezing behavior is governed by inhibiting and promoting interactions between the components.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000587863",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-14931-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587863","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The Urmia playa as a source of airborne dust and ice-nucleating particles - Part 2: Unraveling the relationship between soil dust composition and ice nucleation activity","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-17T08:54:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Immersion and adhesion freezing influenced by charge and solutes","175716","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85144264348",,"000889112900001","Atmos. chem. phys.","22","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

PV anomalies have been well studied with respect to their effect on surface cyclogenesis. A gap however exists in the scientific literature describing the effect that stratospheric intrusion depth has on surface cyclogenetic forcing. Numerical experiments using PV inversion diagnostics reveal that stratospheric depth is crucial in the intensity of cyclonic circulation induced at the surface. In an idealized setting, shallow, high-PV intrusions (above 300 hPa) resulted in a marginal effect on the surface, whilst growing stratospheric depth resulted in enhanced surface pressure anomalies and surface cyclonic circulation. It is shown that the height above the surface that intrusions reach is more critical than the vertical size of the intrusion when inducing cyclonic flow at the surface. This factor is however constrained by the height of the dynamical tropopause above the surface. The width of the stratospheric intrusion is an additional factor, with broader intrusions resulting in enhanced surface cyclogenetic forcing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583032",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-3-1291-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583032","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Stratospheric intrusion depth and its effect on surface cyclogenetic forcing: an idealized potential vorticity (PV) inversion experiment","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-25T08:57:19Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85143396048",,,"Weather Clim.

This recurrence can lead to persistent surface anomalies. Here, we first demonstrate the significance of RRWPs for persistent hot spells in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) using the ERA-Interim (ERA-I) reanalysis dataset and then examine the role of RRWPs and blocks for heatwaves over south-eastern Australia (SEA).  A Weibull regression analysis shows that RRWPs are statistically associated with a significant increase in the duration of hot spells over several regions in the SH, including SEA. Two case studies of heatwaves in SEA in the summers of 2004 and 2009 illustrate the role of RRWPs in forming recurrent ridges (anticyclonic potential vorticity – PV – anomalies), aiding in the persistence of the heatwaves. Then, using a weather-station-based dataset to identify SEA heatwaves, we find that SEA heatwaves are more frequent than climatology during days with extreme RRWPs activity over SEA (high RSEA). On days with both high RSEA and heatwaves, circumglobal zonal wavenumber 4 and 5 (WN4, WN5) anomaly patterns are present in the composite mean of the upper-level PV field, with an anticyclonic PV anomaly over SEA. The Fourier decomposition of the PV and meridional wind velocity fields further reveals that the WN4 and WN5 components in the suitable phase aids in forming the ridge over SEA for days with high RSEA. In addition, we find anomalous blocking over the Indian and the South Pacific oceans during SEA heatwaves, which may help to modulate the phase of RRWPs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583031",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-3-1139-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583031","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Recurrent Rossby waves and south-eastern Australian heatwaves","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-25T08:56:12Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","787652","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85142528171",,,"Weather Clim.

In addition, it exhibits strong variability on timescales from days to seasons. While recent research elucidated processes leading to short-term extreme conditions in the Arctic, this study investigates unusual atmospheric conditions on the seasonal timescale. Based on a principal component analysis in the phase space spanned by the seasonal-mean values of surface temperature, precipitation and the atmospheric components of the surface energy balance, individual seasons are objectively identified that deviate strongly from a running-mean climatology and that we define as extreme seasons. Given the strongly varying surface conditions in the Arctic, this analysis is done separately in Arctic sub-regions that are climatologically characterized by either sea ice, open ocean or mixed conditions.  Using ERA5 reanalyses for the years 1979–2018, our approach identifies two to three extreme seasons for each of winter, spring, summer and autumn, with strongly differing characteristics and affecting different Arctic sub-regions. Two extreme winters affecting the Kara and Barents seas are selected for a detailed investigation of their substructure, the role of synoptic-scale weather systems, and potential preconditioning by anomalous sea ice extent and/or sea surface temperature at the beginning of the season. Winter 2011/12 started with average sea ice coverage and was characterized by constantly above-average temperatures during the season related mainly to frequent warm air advection by quasi-stationary cyclones in the Nordic Seas. In contrast, winter 2016/17 started with reduced sea ice and enhanced sea surface temperatures in the Kara and Barents seas, which, together with increased frequencies of cold air outbreaks and cyclones, led to large upward surface heat flux anomalies and strongly increased precipitation during this extreme season.  In summary, this study shows that extreme seasonal conditions in the Arctic are spatially heterogeneous, related to different near-surface parameters and caused by different synoptic-scale weather systems, potentially in combination with surface preconditioning due to anomalous ocean and sea ice conditions at the beginning of the season. The framework developed in this study and the insight gained from analyzing the ERA5 period will be beneficial for addressing the effects of global warming on Arctic extreme seasons.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583027",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-3-89-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583027","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Identification, characteristics and dynamics of Arctic extreme seasons","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-25T08:52:34Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","787652","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,,"Weather Clim.

ENSO tends to be negatively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation in winter, while this connection is less clear in boreal spring and summer when the ENSO teleconnection encounters altered background conditions (i.e., a weaker subtropical jet), which can modulate the signal on the way to the NAE region. One such region that modulates the ENSO teleconnection to the NAE region is the tropical North Atlantic (TNA). While several mechanisms exist for this modulation, we center our analysis on the Caribbean region and the Walker cells. In order to isolate the relevant mechanism, we force an idealized atmospheric circulation model with three different seasonally varying sea surface temperature patterns that represent an ENSO event with or without the influence of the TNA, focusing on the decaying phase of ENSO in boreal spring and summer. We find that in boreal spring, the TNA modulates the ENSO teleconnection to the NAE primarily through a propagating Rossby wave train, while in summer, the TNA's influence tends to strengthen the ENSO influence over the NAE sector. Overall, this study offers a deeper understanding of the inter-basin interactions through the Walker cell following an ENSO event and the central role of tropical Atlantic SSTAs in modulating the teleconnection to the NAE region in boreal spring and summer.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000574073",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-3-1077-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/574073","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Modulation of the El Niño teleconnection to the North Atlantic by the tropical North Atlantic during boreal spring and summer","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-03T19:52:04Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"How linear is the remote Impact of El Nino Southern Oscillation on Europe?||Dynamical constraints for the predictability of heat waves in current future climates||Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application||Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events","ETH-17 18-1||847456||170523||198896","10.13039/501100003006||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","ETHZ||EC||SNF||SNF","ETH Grants||H2020||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,,"85140591259",,,"Weather Clim.

This study for the first time explicitly considers the radiative forcing resulting from realistic land management and offers new insights into the local land surface response to land management. Regression-based trend analysis is applied to observations and present-day ensemble simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 1.2.2 to assess the impact of irrigation and conservation agriculture (CA) on warming trends using an approach that is less sensitive to temperature extremes. At the regional scale, an irrigation- and CA-induced acceleration of the annual mean near-surface air temperature (T2m) warming trends and the annual maximum daytime temperature (TXx) warming trends were evident. Estimation of the impact of irrigation and CA on the spatial average of the warming trends indicated that irrigation and CA have a pulse cooling effect on T2m and TXx, after which the warming trends increase at a greater rate than the control simulations. This differed at the local (subgrid) scale under irrigation where surface temperature cooling and the dampening of warming trends were both evident. As the local surface warming trends, in contrast to regional trends, do not account for atmospheric (water vapour) feedbacks, their dampening confirms the importance of atmospheric feedbacks (water vapour forcing) in explaining the enhanced regional trends. At the land surface, the positive radiative forcing signal arising from enhanced atmospheric water vapour is too weak to offset the local cooling from the irrigation-induced increase in the evaporative fraction. Our results underline that agricultural management has complex and non-negligible impacts on the local climate and highlight the need to evaluate the representation of land management in global climate models using climate models of higher resolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000536609",,"2190-4987||2190-4979","10.5194/esd-13-419-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/536609","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Agricultural management effects on mean and extreme temperature trends","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-11T04:06:06Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85125601274",,"000763866600001",,"1","Earth System Dynamics","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Aviation activities emitting soot particles into the upper troposphere can potentially impact ice nucleation (IN) in cirrus clouds. Pore condensation and freezing (PCF) is an important ice formation pathway for soot particles in the cirrus regime, which requires the soot INP to have specific morphological properties, i.e., mesopore structures. In this study, the morphology and pore size distribution of two kinds of soot samples were modified by a physical agitation method without any chemical modification by which more compacted soot sample aggregates could be produced compared to the unmodified sample. The IN activities of both fresh and compacted soot particles with different sizes, 60, 100, 200 and 400 nm, were systematically tested by the Horizontal Ice Nucleation Chamber (HINC) under mixed-phase and cirrus-cloud-relevant temperatures (T). Our results show that soot particles are unable to form ice crystals at T>235 K (homogeneous nucleation temperature, HNT), but IN is observed for compacted and larger-sized soot aggregates (>200 nm) well below the homogeneous freezing relative humidity (RHhom) for T< HNT, demonstrating PCF as the dominating mechanism for soot IN. We also observed that mechanically compacted soot particles can reach a higher particle activation fraction (AF) value for the same T and RH condition compared to the same aggregate size fresh soot particles. The results also reveal a clear size dependence for the IN activity of soot particles with the same degree of compaction, showing that compacted soot particles with large sizes (200 and 400 nm) are more active INPs and can convey the single importance of soot aggregate morphology for the IN ability. In order to understand the role of soot aggregate morphology for its IN activity, both fresh and compacted soot samples were characterized systematically using particle mass and size measurements, comparisons from TEM (transmission electron microscopy) images, soot porosity characteristics from argon (Ar) and nitrogen (N2) physisorption measurements, as well as soot–water interaction results from DVS (dynamic vapor sorption) measurements. Considering the soot particle physical properties along with its IN activities, the enhanced IN abilities of compacted soot particles are attributed to decreasing mesopore width and increasing mesopore occurrence probability due to the compaction process.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543967",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-4985-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543967","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Enhanced soot particle ice nucleation ability induced by aggregate compaction and densification","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-27T03:13:23Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"SADOA – Surface Area Determination by Ozone Adsorption","195035","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Bridge - Proof of Concept",,,,"85129050256",,"000783538500001","Atmos. chem. phys.","7","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Bare soot particles, generally hydrophobic and fractal ones, mainly exist near emission sources. Coated or internally mixed soot particles are more abundant in the atmosphere and have a higher probability of impacting cloud formation and climate. However, the ice nucleation ability of coated soot particles is not as well understood as that of freshly produced soot particles. In this laboratory study, two samples, a propane flame soot and a commercial carbon black, were used as atmospheric soot surrogates and coated with varying wt % of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The ratio of coating material mass to the mass of bare soot particles was controlled and progressively increased from less than 5 wt % to over 100 wt %. Both bare and coated soot particle ice nucleation activities were investigated with a continuous-flow diffusion chamber operated at mixed-phase and cirrus cloud conditions. The mobility diameter and mass distribution of size-selected soot particles with/without H2SO4 coating were measured by a scanning mobility particle sizer and a centrifugal particle mass analyser running in parallel. The mixing state and morphology of soot particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the evidence of the presence of H2SO4 on a coated soot particle surface is shown by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Our study demonstrates that H2SO4 coatings suppress the ice nucleation activity of soot particles to varying degrees depending on the coating thickness, but in a non-linear fashion. Thin coatings causing pore filling in the soot aggregate inhibits pore condensation and freezing. Thick coatings promote particle ice activation via droplet homogeneous freezing. Overall, our findings reveal that H2SO4 coatings will suppress soot particle ice nucleation abilities in the cirrus cloud regime, having implications for the fate of soot particles with respect to cloud formation in the upper troposphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000544517",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-5331-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/544517","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Laboratory studies of ice nucleation onto bare and internally mixed soot-sulfuric acid particles","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-01T02:53:15Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85129041550",,"000785864500001","Atmos. chem. phys.","8","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is shown that while most models considered can well simulate the stationary wavenumbers 1 and 2 during the first 2 weeks of integration, they diverge from observations following week 3. Those models with a poor resolution in the stratosphere struggle to simulate the waves, in both the troposphere and the stratosphere, even during the first 2 weeks. Focusing on the tropospheric regions where SWs peak in amplitude reveals that the models generally do a better job in simulating the northwestern Pacific stationary trough, while certain models struggle to simulate the stationary ridges in both western North America and the North Atlantic. In addition, a strong relationship is found between regional biases in the stationary height field and model errors in simulated upward propagation of planetary waves into the stratosphere. In the stratosphere, biases are mostly in wave 2 in those models with high stratospheric resolution, whereas in those models with low resolution in the stratosphere, a wave 1 bias is evident, which leads to a strong bias in the stratospheric mean zonal circulation due to the predominance of wave 1 there. Finally, biases in both amplitude and location of mean tropical convection and the subsequent subtropical downwelling are identified as possible contributors to biases in the regional SW field in the troposphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000554538",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-3-679-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/554538","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Stationary wave biases and their effect on upward troposphere– stratosphere coupling in sub-seasonal prediction models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-24T10:22:46Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application||Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events","170523||198896","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,,"85133264736",,,"Weather Clim.

Satellite observations proved that immersion freezing, i.e., ice formation on particles immersed within aqueous droplets, is the dominant ice nucleation (IN) pathway in mixed-phase clouds. However, the impact of anthropogenic emissions on atmospheric IN in the urban environment remains ambiguous. In this study, we present in situ observations of ambient ice-nucleating particle number concentration (NINP) measured at mixed-phase cloud conditions (−30 °C, relative humidity with respect to liquid water RHw= 104 %) and the physicochemical properties of ambient aerosol, including chemical composition and size distribution, at an urban site in Beijing during the traditional Chinese Spring Festival. The impact of multiple aerosol sources such as firework emissions, local traffic emissions, mineral dust, and urban secondary aerosols on NINP is investigated. The results show that NINP during the dust event reaches up to 160 # L(−1) (where “#” represents number of particles), with an activation fraction (AF) of 0.0036 % ± 0.0011 %. During the rest of the observation, NINP is on the order of 10(−1) to 10 # L(−1), with an average AF between 0.0001 % and 0.0002 %. No obvious dependence of NINP on the number concentration of particles larger than 500 nm (N500) or black carbon (BC) mass concentration (mBC) is found throughout the field observation. The results indicate a substantial NINP increase during the dust event, although the observation took place at an urban site with high background aerosol concentration. Meanwhile, the presence of atmospheric BC from firework and traffic emissions, along with urban aerosols formed via secondary transformation during heavily polluted periods, does not influence the observed INP concentration. Our study corroborates previous laboratory and field findings that anthropogenic BC emission has a negligible effect on NINP and that NINP is unaffected by heavy pollution in the urban environment under mixed-phase cloud conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000553513",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-7539-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/553513","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ice-nucleating particles from multiple aerosol sources in the urban environment of Beijing under mixed-phase cloud conditions","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-21T03:12:41Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85133031871",,"000809126800001","Atmos. chem. phys.","11","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Besides the high ice nucleation activity of microcline, recent studies also revealed a high sensitivity of microcline to interaction with solutes on its surface. Here, we investigate the effect of organic and bio-organic substances on the ice nucleation activity of microcline, with the aim to better understand the underlying surface interactions. We performed immersion freezing experiments with microcline in solutions of three carboxylic acids, five amino acids, and two polyols to represent these compound classes. By means of a differential scanning calorimeter we investigated the freezing of emulsified droplets of microcline suspended in various solutions. Depending on the type of solute, different effects were observed. In the case of carboxylic acids (acetic, oxalic, and citric acid), the measured heterogeneous onset temperatures, Thet, showed no significant deviation from the behavior predicted by the water activity criterion, Thet(aw) = Tmelt(aw + Δaw), which relates Thet with the melting point temperature Tmelt via a constant water activity offset Δaw. While this behavior could be interpreted as a lack of interaction of the solute molecules with the surface, the carboxylic acids caused the fraction of heterogeneously frozen water, Fhet(aw), to decrease by up to 40 % with increasing solute concentrations. In combination, unaltered Thet(aw) and reduced Fhet(aw) suggest that active sites were largely deactivated by the acid molecules, but amongst those remaining active are also the best sites with the highest Thet. A deviation from this behavior is citric acid, which showed not only a decrease in Fhet, but also a decrease in Thet of up to 4 K for water activities below 0.99, pointing to a depletion of the best active sites by interactions with the citrate ions. When neutralized solutions of the acids were used instead, the decrease in Fhet became even more pronounced. The slope of Thet(aw) was different for each of the neutralized acid solutions. In the case of amino acid solutions, we found a decrease in Thet (up to 10 K), significantly below the Δaw criterion, as well as a reduction in Fhet (up to 60 %). Finally, in the case of the investigated polyols, no significant deviation of Thet from the Δaw criterion was observed, and no significant deviation of Fhet in comparison to a pure water suspension was found. Furthermore, we measured the effects of aging on the ice nucleation activity in experiments with microcline suspended in solutions for up to 7 d, and tested the reversibility of the interaction with the solutes after aging for 10 d. For citric acid, an ongoing irreversible degradation of the ice nucleation activity was observed, whereas the amino acids showed completely reversible effects. In summary, our experiments demonstrate a remarkable sensitivity of microcline ice nucleation activity to surface interactions with various solutes, underscoring the importance of the history of such particles from the source to frozen cloud droplets in the atmosphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000540001",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-3655-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/540001","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The impact of (bio-)organic substances on the ice nucleation activity of the K-feldspar microcline in aqueous solutions","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-31T02:51:29Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Immersion and adhesion freezing influenced by charge and solutes","175716","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85127203955",,"000772233300001","Atmos. chem. phys.","5","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Local extremes emerge from the interaction of weather systems with local terrain features such as coastlines and orography; however, multi-duration extremes do not follow exactly the patterns of cumulative precipitation and are still not well understood. High-resolution information from weather radars could help us quantify their patterns better, but traditional extreme value analyses based on radar records were found to be too inaccurate for quantifying the extreme intensities required for impact studies. Here, we propose a novel methodology for extreme precipitation frequency analysis based on relatively short weather radar records, and we use it to investigate the coastal and orographic effects on extreme precipitation of durations between 10 min and 24 h. Combining 11 years of radar data with 10 min rain gauge data in the southeastern Mediterranean, we obtain estimates of the once in 100 years precipitation intensities with ∼26 % standard error, which is lower than those obtained using traditional approaches on rain gauge data. We identify the following three distinct regimes which respond differently to coastal and orographic forcing: short durations (∼10 min), related to peak convective rain rates, hourly durations (∼1 h), related to the yield of individual convective cells, and long durations (∼6–24 h), related to the accumulation of multiple convective cells and to stratiform processes. At short and hourly durations, extreme return levels peak at the coastline, while at longer durations they peak corresponding to the orographic barriers. The distributions tail heaviness is rather uniform above the sea and rapidly changes in presence of orography, with opposing directions at short (decreasing tail heaviness, with a peak at hourly durations) and long (increasing) durations. These distinct effects suggest that short-scale hazards, such as urban pluvial floods, could be more of concern for the coastal regions, while longer-scale hazards, such as flash floods, could be more relevant in mountainous areas.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000540323",,"1027-5606||1607-7938","10.5194/hess-26-1439-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/540323","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Coastal and orographic effects on extreme precipitation revealed by weather radar observations","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-01T03:14:46Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Understanding precipitation patterns in deserts, their hydrological significance, and the effects of climate change","21-1 FEL-67","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Fellows",,,,"85127084854",,"000771351900001","Hydrol.

Here, we present the first chain of computationally efficient Earth system model (ESM) emulators that allow for the translation of any greenhouse gas emission pathway into spatially resolved annual mean temperature anomaly field time series, accounting for both forced climate response and natural variability uncertainty at the local scale. By combining the global mean, emissions-driven emulator MAGICC with the spatially resolved emulator MESMER, ESM-specific and constrained probabilistic emulated ensembles can be derived. This emulator chain can hence build on and extend large multi-ESM ensembles such as the ones produced within the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The main extensions are threefold. (i) A more thorough sampling of the forced climate response and the natural variability uncertainty is possible, with millions of emulated realizations being readily created. (ii) The same uncertainty space can be sampled for any emission pathway, which is not the case in CMIP6, where only a limited number of scenarios have been explored and some of the most societally relevant strong mitigation scenarios have been run by only a small number of ESMs. (iii) Other lines of evidence to constrain future projections, including observational constraints, can be introduced, which helps to refine projected ranges beyond the multi-ESM ensembles' estimates. In addition to presenting results from the coupled MAGICC-MESMER emulator chain, we carry out an extensive validation of MESMER, which is trained on and applied to multiple emission pathways for the first time in this study. By coupling MAGICC and MESMER, we pave the way for rapid assessments of any emission pathway's regional climate change consequences and the associated uncertainties.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539483",,"1991-9603||1991-959X","10.5194/gmd-15-2085-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539483","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"From emission scenarios to spatially resolved projections with a chain of computationally efficient emulators: coupling of MAGICC (v7.5.1) and MESMER (v0.8.3)","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-27T03:54:37Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"A Modular Earth System Model Emulator for Regional eXtremes","964013","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85127331559",,"000769795600001","Geosci. model dev.","5","Geoscientific Model Development","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous studies have suggested a link between springtime Arctic ozone depletion and Northern Hemispheric surface climate, which might add surface predictability. However, so far it has not been possible to isolate the role of stratospheric ozone from dynamical downward impacts. Using observations and targeted chemistry-climate model experiments that allow to isolate the role of ozone depletion from dynamical downward impacts, we quantify the impact of springtime Arctic ozone depletion on surface climate. We find that springtime stratospheric ozone depletion is followed by surface anomalies in precipitation and temperature resembling a positive Arctic Oscillation. Most notably, we show that these anomalies, affecting large portions of the Northern Hemisphere, are to a substantial degree (30-60\%) driven by the loss of stratospheric ozone.

Here, we investigate the quasi-horizontal transport of air masses from the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone (ASMA) into the extratropical lower stratosphere and their chemical evolution. For that reason, we developed a method to identify and track the air masses exported from the monsoon. This method is based on the anomalously low potential vorticity (PV) of these air masses (tropospheric low PV cutoffs) compared to the lower stratosphere and uses trajectory calculations and chemical fields from the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS). The results show evidence of frequent summertime transport from the monsoon anticyclone to midlatitudes over the North Pacific, even reaching the high-latitude regions of Siberia and Alaska. Most of the low PV cutoffs related to air masses exported from the ASMA have lifetimes shorter than 1 week (about 90 %) and sizes smaller than 1 % of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) area. The chemical composition of these air masses is characterized by carbon monoxide, ozone, and water vapour mixing ratios at an intermediate range between values typical for the monsoon anticyclone and the lower stratosphere. The chemical evolution during transport within these low PV cutoffs shows a gradual change from the characteristics of the monsoon anticyclone to characteristics of the lower stratospheric background during about 1 week, indicating continuous mixing with the background atmosphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000540660",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-3841-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/540660","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Characterization of transport from the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone into the UTLS via shedding of low potential vorticity cutoffs","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-04T02:56:28Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85127394851",,"000773769100001","Atmos. chem. phys.","6","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous studies have suggested a link between springtime Arctic ozone depletion and Northern Hemispheric surface climate, which might add surface predictability. However, so far it has not been possible to isolate the role of stratospheric ozone from dynamical downward impacts. Using observations and targeted chemistry-climate model experiments that allow to isolate the role of ozone depletion from dynamical downward impacts, we quantify the impact of springtime Arctic ozone depletion on surface climate. We find that springtime stratospheric ozone depletion is followed by surface anomalies in precipitation and temperature resembling a positive Arctic Oscillation. Most notably, we show that these anomalies, affecting large portions of the Northern Hemisphere, are to a substantial degree (30-60\%) driven by the loss of stratospheric ozone.

They can cool the climate by reflecting incoming solar radiation, or they can warm the climate by trapping thermal radiation emitted to space. As the climate warms in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, clouds are expected to change in terms of their composition, structure, and spatial distribution. Clouds therefore represent an important feedback mechanism and can either dampen or intensify human-induced climate change. Predicting how they will change in the future is of great importance for climate projections, but at the same time represents one of the greatest challenges of climate change research. The most significant role of clouds on the global radiation balance is in the tropics because of the large input of solar radiation. In this PhD project, we aim to better understand and simulate how tropical clouds will evolve with climate change.   The representation of clouds in atmospheric models requires high numerical resolution since convective circulations that drive the cloud formation and feedbacks act on very small scales. The numerical resolution of global climate models (GCMs), however, is constrained by the complexity and spatial extent of the climate system, and the available computing power. Currently, GCMs are run on coarse horizontal grids of ≈100 km, and thus cannot explicitly represent the interactions between clouds and circulations. Instead, they rely on parameterizations of cumulus convection which are considered a major source of uncertainty. It has been found that clouds in the tropics – in particular tropical marine low clouds such as stratocumulus and shallow cumulus – lie at the heart of the uncertainty in global climate model projections. Due to this resolution problem, tropical low clouds have extensively been studied under idealized conditions using large-eddy simulations (LES) with a fine grid spacing of about 10-100 m. LES resolve cloud-circulation interactions and have contributed substantially to a better understanding of these cloud types. However, LES are computationally feasible only on small domains and therefore simplify the representation of larger-scale circulations. Scaling LES results to the entire climate system is therefore challenging and introduces new uncertainties.   An alternative and more novel approach to study tropical marine clouds is the application of kilometerresolution models (KRMs) with a grid spacing on the order of 1 km. KRMs represent an auspicious compromise between LES and GCMs as they resolve a fraction of the underlying convective circulations, but can be run on much larger domains and during longer time periods than LES. Global multiyear climate simulations using KRMs are not yet feasible with current computing power but expected to become feasible within the coming decade. Until then, KRMs can be run on limited-area domains to study regional climate changes. In this project, we explore the potential of KRMs to study tropical marine clouds and their response to a warming climate.   We start in Chapter 1 with an introduction about (i) the role of clouds in the climate system, (ii) the different cloud types encountered over tropical oceans, (iii) the representation of clouds in atmospheric models, (iv) the expected changes of the tropical overturning circulation and tropical clouds in a warming climate, and (v) how KRMs may help to better understand these changes.   In Chapter 2, we study the representation of tropical marine low clouds in an ensemble of KRMs. We find a substantial inter-model spread in the simulated low-cloud amount, even though all models simulate a realistic trade-wind inversion. Yet, there is a systematic relation between the simulated cloud amounts and marine boundary layer processes, which suggests that the dynamics of the marine boundary layer begin to take shape in KRMs.   In Chapter 3, we present the pseudo-global-warming (PGW) methodology to set up climate change simulations in limited-area models. This methodology represents the current climate by a reanalysisdriven simulation and modulates the boundary conditions of the latter with a climate-change signal to obtain a simulation of the future climate.   The PGW approach is applied in Chapter 4 where we perform two multi-year KRM simulations over the tropical Atlantic: one under current climate conditions and one under projected future conditions. In comparison to GCM simulations, the current-climate simulation shows an improved representation of the Hadley circulation without any signs of a double ITCZ bias, and of tropical marine low clouds and deep convection. The climate change signal simulated by the KRM shows fundamental similarities to GCM projections in terms of temperature and humidity changes, but also distinct differences in the change of the tropical overturning (Hadley) circulation. For instance, the narrowing of the ITCZ frequently seen in GCMs is not simulated by the KRM.   In Chapter 5, we study the cloud changes seen in Chapter 4 in more detail and present an estimate of the resulting cloud-radiative feedback. The KRM simulates a reduction of the stratocumulus cloud albedo and, surprisingly, an increase of the West Atlantic shallow cumulus cloud albedo in the warmer climate. Further, the amount of high clouds at the ITCZ increases substantially. The mean shortwave cloud feedback over the tropical Atlantic is positive, but less positive than projected by the GCMs. The longwave cloud feedback is slightly positive because of the increase in the high-cloud fraction, and thus at the upper end of GCM projections.   In Chapter 6, we draw general conclusions and provide an outlook on key aspects that deserve more attention. Overall, we conclude that the application of KRMs to study tropical marine cloud changes using the PGW approach is highly promising. The systematic application of KRMs may in the future help to better constrain low-latitude cloud feedbacks. Hereby, the key potential of KRMs is arguably that they allow for a much improved representation of tropical convective clouds and circulations compared to GCMs, while still being applicable in real-world large-scale climatological studies. Nevertheless, efforts are needed to better understand and reduce inter-model differences in the representation of low and high clouds in KRMs. We belief that the most novel contribution of this project to the existing literature is a systematic assessment of the representation of tropical low clouds in a KRM ensemble, and the detailed study of low-cloud changes in one of the first multi-year climate change simulations at kilometer-resolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000595739",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/595739","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Simulation of Tropical Marine Clouds in Kilometer-Resolution Atmospheric Models","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2023-01-30T09:59:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Exploiting km-resolution climate models in the tropics to constrain climate change uncertainties (trCLIM)","192133","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"28817",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Clouds influence terrestrial and solar radiative fluxes and thereby impact the amplified Arctic warming. The partitioning of thermodynamic phases (i.e., ice crystals and water droplets) within mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) especially influences their radiative properties. However, the processes responsible for ice crystal formation remain only partially characterized. In particular, so-called secondary ice production (SIP) processes, which create supplementary ice crystals from primary ice crystals and the environmental conditions that they occur in, are poorly understood. The microphysical properties of Arctic MPCs were measured during the Ny-Ålesund AeroSol Cloud ExperimENT (NASCENT) campaign to obtain a better understanding of the atmospheric conditions favorable for the occurrence of SIP processes. To this aim, the in situ cloud microphysical properties retrieved by a holographic cloud imager mounted on a tethered balloon system were complemented by ground-based remote sensing and ice-nucleating particle measurements. During the 6 d investigated in this study, SIP occurred during about 40 % of the in-cloud measurements, and high SIP events with number concentrations larger than 10 L−1 of small pristine ice crystals occurred in 4 % of the in-cloud measurements. This demonstrates the role of SIP for Arctic MPCs. The highest concentrations of small pristine ice crystals were produced at temperatures between −5 and −3 ∘C and were related to the occurrence of supercooled large droplets freezing upon collision with ice crystals. This suggests that a large fraction of ice crystals in Arctic MPCs are produced via the droplet-shattering mechanism. From evaluating the ice crystal images, we could identify ice–ice collision as a second SIP mechanism that dominated when fragile ice crystals were observed. Moreover, SIP occurred over a large temperature range and was observed in up to 80 % of the measurements down to −24 ∘C due to the occurrence of ice–ice collisions. This emphasizes the importance of SIP at temperatures below −8 ∘C, which are currently not accounted for in most numerical weather models. Although ice-nucleating particles may be necessary for the initial freezing of water droplets, the ice crystal number concentration is frequently determined by secondary production mechanisms.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590820",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-15579-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590820","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Conditions favorable for secondary ice production in Arctic mixed-phase clouds","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-07T07:37:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constrained aerosol forcing for improved climate projections||Exploiting orographic clouds for constraining the sources of ice crystals","821205||175824","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF","H2020||Projekte MINT",,,,"85145615133",,"000898114300001","Atmos. chem. phys.","23","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Nevertheless, the latest cumulative land carbon sink projections from 11 Earth system models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) show an intermodel spread of 150 Pg C (i.e., similar to 15 years of current anthropogenic emissions) for a policy-relevant scenario, with mean global warming by the end of the century below 2 degrees C relative to preindustrial conditions. We hypothesize that this intermodel uncertainty originates from model differences in the sensitivities of net biome production (NBP) to atmospheric CO2 concentration (i), to air temperature (ii), and to soil moisture (iii), as well as model differences in average conditions of air temperature (iv) and soil moisture (v). Using multiple linear regression and a resampling technique, we quantify the individual contributions of these five drivers for explaining the cumulative NBP anomaly of each model relative to the multi-model mean. We find that the intermodel variability of the contributions of each driver relative to the total NBP intermodel variability is 52.4 % for the sensitivity to temperature, 44.2 % for the sensitivity to soil moisture, 44 % for the sensitivity to CO2, 26.2 % for the average temperature, and 21.9 % for the average soil moisture. Furthermore, the sensitivities of NBP to temperature and soil moisture, particularly at tropical regions, contribute to explain 34 % to 65 % of the cumulative NBP deviations from the ensemble mean of the two models with the lowest carbon sink (ACCESS-ESM1-5 and UKESM1-0-LL) and of the two models with the highest sink (CESM2 and NorESM2-LM), highlighting the primary role of the response of NBP to interannual climate variability. Overall, this study provides in- sights on why each Earth system model projects either a low or high land carbon sink globally and across regions relative to the ensemble mean, which can focalize efforts to identify the representation of processes that lead to intermodel uncertainty.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590809",,"1726-4170||1726-4170","10.5194/bg-19-5435-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590809","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Drivers of intermodel uncertainty in land carbon sink projections","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-07T07:37:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Climate-Carbon Interactions in the Coming Century","821003","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85145549599",,"000894510000001",,"23","Biogeosciences","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The austral stratospheric vortex shows its largest variability in spring, and a weakened polar vortex is associated with changes in the spring to summer surface climate, including hot and dry extremes in Australia. However, the robustness and extent of the connection between polar vortex strength and surface climate on interannual timescales remain unclear. We assess this relationship by using reanalysis data and time-slice simulations from two chemistry-climate models (CCMs), building on previous work that is mainly based on observations. The CCMs show a similar downward propagation of anomalies in the polar vortex strength to the reanalysis data: a weak polar vortex is on average followed by a negative tropospheric Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in spring to summer, while a strong polar vortex is on average followed by a positive SAM. The signature in the surface climate following polar vortex weakenings is characterized by high surface pressure and warm temperature anomalies over Antarctica, the region where surface signals are most robust across all model and observational datasets. However, the tropospheric SAM response in the two CCMs considered is inconsistent with observations. In one CCM, the SAM is more negative compared to the reanalysis after weak polar vortex events, whereas in the other CCM, it is less negative. In addition, neither model reproduces all the regional changes in midlatitudes, such as the warm and dry anomalies over Australia. We find that these inconsistencies are linked to model biases in the basic state, such as the latitude of the eddy-driven jet and the persistence of the SAM. These results are largely corroborated by models that participated in the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI). Furthermore, bootstrapping of the data reveals sizable uncertainty in the magnitude of the surface signals in both models and observations due to internal variability. Our results demonstrate that anomalies of the austral stratospheric vortex have significant impacts on surface climate, although the ability of models to capture regional effects across the Southern Hemisphere is limited by biases in their representation of the stratospheric and tropospheric circulation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000584640",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","10.5194/acp-22-13915-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/584640","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Exploring the link between austral stratospheric polar vortex anomalies and surface climate in chemistry-climate models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-03T05:37:48Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"The Overlooked Role of Stratospheric Ozone in forcing Northern Hemispheric climate (TORSO)||Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events","180043||198896","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Ambizione||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,,"85142664413",,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the vicinity of the Caribbean island of Barbados, they appear in different mesoscale organization patterns with distinct net cloud radiative effects (CREs). Cloud formation processes in this region are typically controlled by the prevailing large-scale subsidence. However, occasionally weather systems from remote origin cause significant disturbances. This study investigates the complex cloud–circulation interactions during the field campaign EUREC4A (Elucidate the Couplings Between Clouds, Convection and Circulation) from 16 January to 20 February 2020, using a combination of Eulerian and Lagrangian diagnostics. Based on observations and ERA5 reanalyses, we identify the relevant processes and characterize the formation pathways of two moist anomalies above the Barbados Cloud Observatory (BCO), one in the lower troposphere (∼ 1000–650 hPa) and one in the middle troposphere (∼ 650–300 hPa). These moist anomalies are associated with strongly negative CRE values and with contrasting long-range transport processes from the extratropics and the tropics, respectively. The first case study about the low-level moist anomaly is characterized by an unusually thick cloud layer, high precipitation totals, and a strongly negative CRE. The formation of the low-level moist anomaly is connected to an extratropical dry intrusion (EDI) that interacts with a trailing cold front. A quasi-climatological (2010-2020) analysis reveals that EDIs lead to different conditions at the BCO depending on how they interact with the associated trailing cold front. Based on this climatology, we discuss the relevance of the strong large-scale forcing by EDIs for the low-cloud patterns near the BCO and the related CRE. The second case study about the mid-tropospheric moist anomaly is associated with an extended and persistent mixed-phase shelf cloud and the lowest daily CRE value observed during the campaign. The formation of the mid-level moist anomaly is linked to “tropical mid-level detrainment” (TMD), which refers to detrainment from tropical deep convection near the melting layer. The quasi-climatological analysis shows that TMDs consistently lead to mid-tropospheric moist anomalies over the BCO and that the detrainment height controls the magnitude of the anomaly. However, no systematic relationship was found between the amplitude of this mid-tropospheric moist anomaly and the CRE at the BCO. This is most likely due to the modulation of the CRE by above and below lying clouds and the fact that we used daily mean CREs, thereby ignoring the impact of the timing of the synoptic anomaly with respect to the daily cycle. Overall, this study reveals the important impact of the long-range moisture transport, driven by dynamical processes either in the extratropics or the tropics, on the variability of the vertical structure of moisture and clouds, and on the resulting CRE in the North Atlantic winter trades.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583023",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-3-59-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583023","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Lagrangian formation pathways of moist anomalies in the trade-wind region during the dry season: two case studies from EUREC4A","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-25T08:46:05Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Large-scale circulation drivers and stable water isotope characteristics of low-level clouds over the tropical North Atlantic||An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","188731||787652","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","Projekte MINT||H2020",,,,"85131514623",,,"Weather Clim.

Recent studies have shown that diabatic heating processes in the ascending warm conveyor belt branch of extratropical cyclones are relevant to blocking dynamics. This leads to the question of the extent to which diabatic heating associated with mid-latitude cyclones may influence high-latitude blocking and drive Arctic warm events. In this study we investigate the dynamics behind 50 extreme warm events of wintertime high-Arctic temperature anomalies during 1979–2016. Classifying the warm events based on blocking occurrence within three selected sectors, we find that 30 of these events are associated with a block over the Urals, featuring negative upper-level potential vorticity (PV) anomalies over central Siberia north of the Ural Mountains. Lagrangian back-trajectory calculations show that almost 60 % of the air parcels making up these negative PV anomalies experience lifting and diabatic heating (median 11 K) in the 6 d prior to the block. Further, almost 70 % of the heated trajectories undergo maximum heating in a compact region of the mid-latitude North Atlantic, temporally taking place between 6 and 1 d before arriving in the blocking region. We also find anomalously high cyclone activity (on average five cyclones within this 5 d heating window) within a sector northwest of the main heating domain. In addition, 10 of the 50 warm events are associated with blocking over Scandinavia. Around 60 % of the 6 d back trajectories started from these blocks experience diabatic heating, of which 60 % undergo maximum heating over the North Atlantic but generally closer to the time of arrival in the block and further upstream relative to heated trajectories associated with Ural blocking. This study suggests that, in addition to the ability of blocks to guide cyclones northwards, Atlantic cyclones play a significant role in the dynamics of high-latitude blocking by providing low-PV air via moist-diabatic processes. This emphasizes the importance of the mutual interactions between mid-latitude cyclones and Eurasian blocking for wintertime Arctic warm extremes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583026",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-3-21-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583026","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Interaction between Atlantic cyclones and Eurasian atmospheric blocking drives wintertime warm extremes in the high Arctic","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-25T08:50:50Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85133014180",,,"Weather Clim.

Several previous studies investigated aspects of their relationship, for instance the climatological dependence of daily precipitation on daily mean temperature, P(T). However, the role of specific weather systems in shaping this relationship has not been analysed yet. This study therefore identifies the weather systems (WSs) that are associated with intense precipitation days as a function of T, focusing on the question of how this relationship, symbolically expressed as P(T, WS), varies regionally across the Northern Hemisphere and between seasons. To this end, we first quantify if intense precipitation occurs on climatologically warmer or on colder days. In winter, over most continental and ocean regions, intense precipitation falls on warmer days apart from the Mediterranean area and regions in the lee of the Rocky Mountains, where intense precipitation is favoured on colder days. In summer, only at high latitudes is intense precipitation favoured on warmer days, whereas continental areas experience intense precipitation on colder days. For selected regions in Europe and North America, we then identify the weather systems that occur preferentially on days with intense precipitation (referred to as wet days). In winter, cyclones are slightly dominant on colder wet days, whereas warm conveyor belts and atmospheric rivers occur preferentially on warmer wet days. In summer, the overall influence of atmospheric rivers increases, and the occurrence of weather systems depends less on wet day temperature. Wet days in the lee of the Rocky Mountains are influenced by most likely convective systems in anticyclones. Finally, we investigate P(T, WS) during the wettest and driest season in central Europe and the central United States (US). In qualitative agreement with the results from the first part of this study, the wettest winter is warmer than normal in central Europe but colder in the central US, and the wettest summer is colder in both regions. The opposite holds for the driest winter and summer, respectively. During these anomalous seasons, both the frequency and the precipitation efficiency of weather systems change in central Europe, while the wettest and driest seasons in central US mainly arise from a modified precipitation efficiency. Our results show that the precipitation–temperature–weather system relationship strongly depends on the region and that (extreme) seasonal precipitation is influenced by the frequency and precipitation efficiency of the different weather systems. This regional variability is reflected in the relative importance of weather system frequency and efficiency anomalies for the formation of anomalously wet and dry seasons. Interestingly, in some regions and seasons, the precipitation efficiency of weather systems is increased during anomalously cold seasons.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583028",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-3-391-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583028","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"How intense daily precipitation depends on temperature and the occurrence of specific weather systems – an investigation with ERA5 reanalyses in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-25T08:53:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","787652","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85147269757",,,"Weather Clim.

This study focuses on the origin of such moist-air intrusions during winter and examines the moisture sources, moisture transport pathways, and their linkage to the driving large-scale circulation patterns. For that purpose, 597 moist-air intrusions, defined as daily events of intense (exceeding the 90th anomaly percentile) zonal mean moisture transport into the polar cap (≥70° N), are identified. Kinematic backward trajectories combined with a Lagrangian moisture source diagnostic are then used to pinpoint the moisture sources and characterize the airstreams accomplishing the transport.  The moisture source analyses show that the bulk of the moisture transported into the polar cap during these moist-air intrusions originates in the eastern North Atlantic with an uptake maximum poleward of 50° N. Trajectories further reveal an inverse relationship between moisture uptake latitude and the level at which moisture is injected into the polar cap, consistent with ascent of poleward-flowing air in a baroclinic atmosphere. Focusing on intrusions in the North Atlantic (424 intrusions), we find that lower tropospheric moisture transport is predominantly accomplished by two types of airstreams: (i) cold, polar air warmed and moistened by surface fluxes and (ii) air subsiding from the mid-troposphere into the boundary layer. Both airstreams contribute about 36 % each to the total transport. The former accounts for most of the moisture transport during intrusions associated with an anomalously high frequency of cyclones east of Greenland (218 intrusions), whereas the latter is more important in the presence of atmospheric blocking over Scandinavia and the Ural Mountains (145 events). Long-range moisture transport, accounting for 17 % of the total transport, dominates during intrusions with weak forcing by baroclinic weather systems (64 intrusions). Finally, mid-tropospheric moisture transport is invariably associated with (diabatically) ascending air and moisture origin in the central and western North Atlantic, including the Gulf Stream front, accounting for roughly 10 % of the total transport. In summary, our study shows that moist-air intrusions into the polar atmosphere result from a combination of airstreams with predominantly high-latitude or high-altitude origin, whose relative importance is determined by the underlying driving weather systems (i.e., cyclones and blocks).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583024",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-3-1-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583024","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Moisture origin, transport pathways, and driving processes of intense wintertime moisture transport into the Arctic","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-25T08:47:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","787652","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85147307461",,,"Weather Clim.

Systematic biases in boreal midwinter ENSO and MJO teleconnections are found in eight subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecast models over the Pacific–North America region. All models simulate an anomalous 500-hPa geopotential height response that is too weak. This overly weak response is associated with overly weak subtropical upper-level convergence and a too-weak Rossby wave source in most models, and in several models there is also a biased subtropical Pacific jet, which affects the propagation of Rossby waves. In addition to this overly weak response, all models also simulate ENSO teleconnections that reach too far poleward toward Alaska and northeastern Russia. The net effect is that these models likely underestimate the impacts associated with the MJO and ENSO over western North America, and suffer from a reduction in skill from what could be achieved.",,,,"0894-8755||1520-0442","10.1175/jcli-d-22-0179.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589164","en","American Meteorological Society",,,"El Niño||Madden-Julian oscillation||Teleconnections","The Winter North Pacific Teleconnection in Response to ENSO and the MJO in Operational Subseasonal Forecasting Models Is Too Weak","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-12-24T09:57:24Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events","198896","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,,"85147529036",,"000894741300010","J. climate","24","Journal of Climate","35","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Computational models that are used to predict weather and project future climate changes require parameterizations of both homogeneous nucleation (i.e. in pure water) and heterogeneous nucleation (i.e. catalysed by ice-nucleating particles, INPs). Microfluidic systems have gained momentum as a tool for obtaining such parameterizations and gaining insight into the stochastic and deterministic contributions to ice nucleation. To overcome the shortcomings of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices with regard to temperature uncertainty and droplet instability due to continuous water adsorption by PDMS, we have developed a new instrument: the Microfluidic Ice Nuclei Counter Zurich (MINCZ). In MINCZ, droplets with a diameter of 75 mu m are generated using a PDMS chip, and hundreds of these droplets are then stored in fluoropolymer tubing that is relatively impermeable to water and solvents. Droplets within the tubing are cooled in an ethanol bath. We validate MINCZ by measuring the homogeneous freezing temperatures of water droplets and the heterogeneous freezing temperatures of aqueous suspensions containing microcline, a common and effective INP in the atmosphere. We obtain results with a high accuracy of 0.2 K in measured droplet temperature. Pure water droplets with a diameter of 75 mu m freeze at a median temperature of 237.3 K with a standard deviation of 0.1 K. Additionally, we perform several freeze-thaw cycles. In the future, MINCZ will be used to investigate the freezing behaviour of INPs, motivated by a need for better-constrained parameterizations of ice nucleation in weather and climate models, wherein the presence or absence of ice influences cloud optical properties and precipitation formation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000573212",,"1867-1381||1867-8548","10.5194/amt-15-5367-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/573212","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The Microfluidic Ice Nuclei Counter Zurich (MINCZ): a platform for homogeneous and heterogeneous ice nucleation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-29T02:50:49Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Ice nucleation in mineral dust mixtures: measurements, predictions, and implications for the climate","20-1 FEL-46","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Fellows",,,,"85140395485",,"000855765200001","Atmos. meas. tech.","18","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The assessment focuses on land regions excluding Antarctica. Changes in marine extremes are addressed in Chapter 9 and Cross-Chapter Box 9.1. Assessments of past changes and their drivers are from 1950 onward, unless indicated otherwise. Projections for changes in extremes are presented for different levels of global warming, supplemented with information for the conversion to emissions scenario-based projections (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1 and Table 4.2). Since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), there have been important new developments and knowledge advances on changes in weather and climate extremes, in particular regarding human influence on individual extreme events, on changes in droughts, tropical cyclones, and compound events, and on projections at different global warming levels (1.5°C–4°C).

It has been argued that as policy advisors, scientists can legitimately make instrumental value judgements (recommendations based on defined policy goals), but not categorical value judgements (challenge and/or redefine established policy goals), and that to do otherwise is to overstep in ways that may threaten their perceived trustworthiness. However, whether these types of value judgements affect public trust in scientists remains largely untested. We conducted two studies (N1 = 367, N2 = 819) to investigate public perceptions of trustworthiness of a climate scientist expressing either an instrumental or a categorical value judgement. We found no difference in perceived trustworthiness between the two conditions. However, trustworthiness perceptions in both studies depended on individuals’ support for the policy recommended by the scientist. Our findings suggest that climate scientists should not fear for their overall perceived trustworthiness when making categorical value judgments if their opinions are supported by the majority of the public.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590363",,"1752-4032||1752-4040","10.1080/17524032.2022.2153896","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590363","en","Routledge","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Climate change||Science communication||Value-free ideal||Credibility||Advocacy||Trust","The Communication of Value Judgements and its Effects on Climate Scientists’ Perceived Trustworthiness","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-05T08:44:33Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000898226200001",,"8","Environmental Communication","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Aerosol indirect effects consist of the modification of cloud droplet number concentrations, cloud albedo, and ice-nucleating particle concentrations with ensuing effects on precipitation through aerosol perturbations. Different aerosol types present over the basin, notably dust, sea salt, and anthropogenic, contribute to the formation of cloud condensation and ice-nucleating particles, thus modifying cloud parameters. These processes notably occur during the frequent dust outbreaks over the Mediterranean Sea. Besides, the semi-direct aerosol effect, namely, changes in cloud cover and atmospheric dynamics due to aerosol absorption, is another impact on regional climate. Regional climate simulations including aerosol-cloud interactions highlight the importance of considering aerosols, even if uncertainties are still important notably with regard to effects on cloud microphysics. To date, the direct and semi-direct effects seem to have larger impacts on the average radiative budget over the Mediterranean than the cloud-albedo indirect effect, but the question remains open concerning other indirect effects. Therefore, more observations of these interactions coupled with numerical simulations considering all these processes are needed to reduce uncertainties.",,,"978-3-030-82384-9||978-3-030-82384-9",,"10.1007/978-3-030-82385-6_20","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580899","en","Springer",,,"Climate-aerosol interactions||Aerosol indirect effects||Aerosol-cloud interactions||Cloud-albedo indirect effect||Semi-direct aerosol effect||Aerosol impact on surface temperature||Cloud microphysics||Cloud fraction||Cloud droplet effective radius||Cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC)||Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)||Ice nuclei (IN)||Ice nuclei particles (INP)||Aerosol impact on precipitation||Regional climate simulations||Aerosol observations||Mineral dust||Sea-salt aerosols||Anthropogenic aerosols","Aerosol-Cloud Interactions and Impact on Regional Climate","Book Chapter","Metadata only","Atmospheric Chemistry in the Mediterranean Region: Volume 2 - From Air Pollutant Sources to Impacts",,,"2022-11-15T16:47:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85153903769",,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Still, we lack a global understanding of how land and climate affect plant traits. A previous global analysis of six traits observed two main axes of variation: (1) size variation at the organ and plant level and (2) leaf economics balancing leaf persistence against plant growth potential. The orthogonality of these two axes suggests they are differently influenced by environmental drivers. We find that these axes persist in a global dataset of 17 traits across more than 20,000 species. We find a dominant joint effect of climate and soil on trait variation. Additional independent climate effects are also observed across most traits, whereas independent soil effects are almost exclusively observed for economics traits. Variation in size traits correlates well with a latitudinal gradient related to water or energy limitation. In contrast, variation in economics traits is better explained by interactions of climate with soil fertility. These findings have the potential to improve our understanding of biodiversity patterns and our predictions of climate change impacts on biogeochemical cycles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522514",,"2397-334X","10.1038/s41559-021-01616-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522514","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Climatic and soil factors explain the two-dimensional spectrum of global plant trait variation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-31T03:43:48Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85121711005",,"000733709100011","Nat Ecol Evol","1","Nature Ecology & Evolution","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
