While the role of recombination in the evolution of sex has received theoretical and empirical attention, less is known about how recombination rate itself evolves and what influence this has on evolutionary processes within sexually reproducing organisms. Here, we explore the patterns of, and processes governing recombination in eukaryotes. We summarize patterns of variation, integrating current knowledge with an analysis of linkage map data in 353 organisms. We then discuss proximate and ultimate processes governing recombination rate variation and consider how these influence evolutionary processes. Genome-wide recombination rates (cM/Mb) can vary more than tenfold across eukaryotes, and there is large variation in the distribution of recombination events across closely related taxa, populations and individuals. We discuss how variation in rate and distribution relates to genome architecture, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, sex, environmental perturbations and variable selective pressures. There has been great progress in determining the molecular mechanisms governing recombination, and with the continued development of new modelling and empirical approaches, there is now also great opportunity to further our understanding of how and why recombination rate varies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000206765",,"0962-8436||1471-2970||0080-4622",,"10.1098/rstb.2016.0455","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/206765","en","The Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Crossing over||Meiosis||Genetic linkage||Evolution||Adaptation||Genomic architecture","Variation in recombination frequency and distribution across eukaryotes: patterns and processes","Review Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2017-11-09T15:01:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85034070949",,"000414521900001","Phil.

Abiotic cues of leaf emergence are well studied but investigation of the relative roles of shared evolutionary history (phylogeny) and local adaptation to climate in determining the species-level responses to these cues is needed to better apprehend the effect of global change on leaf emergence. We explored the relative importance of phylogeny and climate in determining the innate leaf out phenology across the temperate biome.  Methods We used an extensive dataset of leaf-out dates of 1126 temperate woody species grown in eight Northern Hemisphere common gardens. For these species, information on the native climate and phylogenetic position was collected. Using linear regression analyses, we examine the relative effect of climate variables and phylogeny on leaf out variation among species.  Results Climate variables explained twice as much variation in leaf out timing as phylogenetic information, a process that was driven primarily by the complex interactive effects of multiple climate variables. Although the primary climate factors explaining species-level variation in leaf-out timing varied drastically across different families, our analyses reveal that local adaptation plays a stronger role than common evolutionary history in determining tree phenology across the temperate biome.  Conclusions In the long-term, the direct effects of physiological adaptation to abiotic effects of climate change on forest phenology are likely to outweigh the indirect effects mediated through changes in tree species composition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000224970",,,,"10.1186/s40663-017-0113-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/224970","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Leaf emergence||Temperate tree species||Phylogeny||Climate||Carbon cycling","The relative roles of local climate adaptation and phylogeny in determining leaf-out timing of temperate tree species","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-03T02:32:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000417753700001",,,"FOREST ECOSYSTEMS","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Plasmid-mediated oxazolidinone resistance has been strongly linked to animals where the use of phenicols might co-select resistance to both antibiotic families. Our goal was to assess the diversity of genes conferring phenicol/oxazolidinone resistance among diverse enterococci and to characterize the optrA genetic environment.  Methods Chloramphenicol-resistant isolates (>16 mg/L, n = 245) from different sources (hospitals/healthy humans/wastewaters/animals) in Portugal, Angola and Tunisia (1996–2016) were selected. Phenicol (eight cat variants, fexA, fexB) or phenicol + oxazolidinone [cfr, cfr(B), optrA] resistance genes were searched for by PCR. Susceptibility (disc diffusion/microdilution), filter mating, stability of antibiotic resistance (500 bacterial generations), plasmid typing (S1-PFGE/hybridization), MLST and WGS (Illumina-HiSeq) were performed for optrA-positive isolates.  Results Resistance to phenicols (n = 181, 74%) and phenicols + oxazolidinones (n = 2, 1%) was associated with the presence of cat(A-8) (40%, predominant in hospitals and swine), cat(A-7) (29%, predominant in poultry and healthy humans), cat(A-9) (2%), fexB (2%) and fexA + optrA (1%). fexA and optrA genes were co-located in a transferable plasmid (pAF379, 72 918 bp) of two ST86 MDR Tunisian Enterococcus faecalis (wastewaters) carrying several putative virulence genes. MICs of chloramphenicol, linezolid and tedizolid were stably maintained at 64, 4 and 1 mg/L, respectively. The chimeric pAF379 comprised relics of genetic elements from different Gram-positive bacteria and origins (human/porcine).  Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, we report the first detection of optrA in an African country (Tunisia) within a transferable mosaic plasmid of different origins. Its identification in isolates from environmental sources is worrisome and alerts for the need of a concerted global surveillance on the occurrence and spread of optrA.",,,,"0305-7453||1460-2091",,"10.1093/jac/dkx321","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473478","en","Oxford University Press",,,,"Detection of optrA in the African continent (Tunisia) within a mosaic Enterococcus faecalis plasmid from urban wastewaters","Journal Article||Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-03-08T16:05:04Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,"42263591",,"2-s2.0-85040017229",,,"J Antimicrob Chemother","12","Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy","72","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Like many other prokaryotic sRNAs, Pxr is predicted to fold into three stem loops (SL1-SL3). SL1 and SL2 are highly conserved across the myxobacteria, whereas SL3 is much more variable. SL1 is necessary for the regulatory function of Pxr but the importance of SL3 in this regard is unknown. To test for cis genetic elements required for Pxr function, we deleted the entire pxr gene from a developmentally defective strain that fails to remove Pxr-mediated blockage of development and reintroduced variably truncated fragments of the pxr region to test for their ability to block development. These truncations demonstrated that SL3 is necessary for Pxr function in the defective strain. We further show that a highly conserved eight-base-pair segment of SL3 is not only necessary for Pxr to block development in the defective strain under starvation conditions, but is also required for Pxr to prevent fruiting body development by a developmentally proficient wild-type strain under high-nutrient conditions. This conserved segment of SL3 is also necessary for detectable levels of Pxr to accumulate, suggesting that this segment either stabilizes Pxr against premature degradation during vegetative growth or positively regulates its transcription.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000234976",,"2045-2322","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/217108||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/233771","10.1038/s41598-017-15439-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/234976","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A conserved stem of the Myxococcus xanthus sRNA Pxr controls sRNA accumulation and multicellular development","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-12-05T05:45:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85034229459",,"000415022900047","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Its causative agent, the myxozoan Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, has a complex lifecycle exploiting freshwater bryozoans as primary hosts and salmonids as secondary hosts. We carried out an integrated study of PKD in a prealpine Swiss river (the Wigger). During a 3-year period, data on fish abundance, disease prevalence, concentration of primary hosts’ DNA in environmental samples [environmental DNA (eDNA)], hydrological variables, and water temperatures gathered at various locations within the catchment were integrated into a newly developed metacommunity model, which includes ecological and epidemiological dynamics of fish and bryozoans, connectivity effects, and hydrothermal drivers. Infection dynamics were captured well by the epidemiological model, especially with regard to the spatial prevalence patterns. PKD prevalence in the sampled sites for both young-of-the-year (YOY) and adult brown trout attained 100% at the end of summer, while seasonal population decay was higher in YOY than in adults. We introduce a method based on decay distance of eDNA signal predicting local species’ density, accounting for variation in environmental drivers (such as morphology and geology). The model provides a whole-network overview of the disease prevalence. In this study, we show how spatial and environmental characteristics of river networks can be used to study epidemiology and disease dynamics of waterborne diseases.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000211927",,"0027-8424||1091-6490","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/211927||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/233106","10.1073/pnas.1713691114","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/238051","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","waterborne epidemic||Metacommunity framework||eDNA||climate change||parasite–host interactions","Integrated field, laboratory, and theoretical study of PKD spread in a Swiss prealpine river","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-11-22T08:54:21Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85033447346",,"000414631200075","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","45","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","114","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for the most recent gene gains and losses. We screened the genomes of 123 worldwide isolates of the major pathogen of wheat Zymoseptoria tritici for robust evidence of gene copy number variation. Based on orthology relationships in three closely related fungi, we identified 599 gene gains and 1,024 gene losses that have not yet reached fixation within the focal species. Our analyses of gene gains and losses segregating in populations showed that gene copy number variation arose preferentially in subtelomeres and in proximity to transposable elements. Recently lost genes were enriched in virulence factors and secondary metabolite gene clusters. In contrast, recently gained genes encoded mostly secreted protein lacking a conserved domain. We analyzed the frequency spectrum at loci segregating a gene presence–absence polymorphism in four worldwide populations. Recent gene losses showed a significant excess in low-frequency variants compared with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism, which is indicative of strong negative selection against gene losses. Recent gene gains were either under weak negative selection or neutral. We found evidence for strong divergent selection among populations at individual loci segregating a gene presence–absence polymorphism. Hence, gene gains and losses likely contributed to local adaptation. Our study shows that microbial eukaryotes harbor extensive copy number variation within populations and that functional differences among recently gained and lost genes led to distinct evolutionary trajectories.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000220077",,"0737-4038||1537-1719",,"10.1093/molbev/msx208","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/220077","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","copy number variation||evolutionary genomics||fungi","Distinct Trajectories of Massive Recent Gene Gains and Losses in Populations of a Microbial Eukaryotic Pathogen","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-12-12T05:36:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000416178700006","Mol Biol Evol","11","Molecular Biology and Evolution","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It also plays a role in plant cell wall integrity as mutants impaired in the Gβ- (agb1-2) or Gγ-subunits have an altered wall composition compared with wild-type plants. Here we performed a mutant screen to identify suppressors of agb1-2 (sgb) that restore susceptibility to pathogens to wild-type levels. Out of the four sgb mutants (sgb10–sgb13) identified, sgb11 is a new mutant allele of ESKIMO1 (ESK1), which encodes a plant-specific polysaccharide O-acetyltransferase involved in xylan acetylation. Null alleles (sgb11/esk1-7) of ESK1 restore to wild-type levels the enhanced susceptibility of agb1-2 to the necrotrophic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina BMM (PcBMM), but not to the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 or to the oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. The enhanced resistance to PcBMM of the agb1-2 esk1-7 double mutant was not the result of the re-activation of deficient PTI responses in agb1-2. Alteration of cell wall xylan acetylation caused by ESK1 impairment was accompanied by an enhanced accumulation of abscisic acid, the constitutive expression of genes encoding antibiotic peptides and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan-derived metabolites, and the accumulation of disease resistance-related secondary metabolites and different osmolites. These esk1-mediated responses counterbalance the defective PTI and PcBMM susceptibility of agb1-2 plants, and explain the enhanced drought resistance of esk1 plants. These results suggest that a deficient PTI-mediated resistance is partially compensated by the activation of specific cell-wall-triggered immune responses.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000199095",,"0960-7412||1365-313X",,"10.1111/tpj.13660","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/199095","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","heterotrimeric G-protein||AGB1||agb1-2||plant cell wall||Xylan||necrotrophic fungi||Immunity||pathogen-associated molecular pattern||Plectosphaerella cucumerina||Arabidopsis thaliana","Alteration of cell wall xylan acetylation triggers defense responses that counterbalance the immune deficiencies of plants impaired in the β-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-22T02:24:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85029405800",,"000412932100005","Plant j.","3","The Plant Journal","92","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Kin competition often reduces – and sometimes entirely negates – the benefits of cooperation among family members. Surprisingly, the impact of kin competition on the fitness effects of family life only received close scrutiny in studies on sibling rivalry, whereas the possibility of parent–offspring competition has attracted much less attention. As a consequence, it remains unclear whether and how parent–offspring competition could have affected the early evolution of parental care and family life.  2. Here, we examined the occurrence and consequences of parent–offspring competition over food access in the European earwig Forficula auricularia, an insect with facultative family life reminiscent of an ancestral state. Specifically, we (1) raised earwig offspring under food limitation either together with or without their mother, and (2) tested whether and how the — potentially competitive — weight gains of mothers and offspring during family life affected the offsprings' survival rate and morphology, and the future reproductive investment of their mother.  3.  In line with the occurrence of parent–offspring competition, we showed that high maternal weight gains during family life reduced the survival prospects of maternally tended offspring, while they increased the mothers' investment into the production of a second clutch (but not the body size of the surviving offspring). Conversely, high offspring weight gains generally increased the offsprings' survival, but did so to a larger extent when they were together with their mother. Intriguingly, mothers that had exhibited a low initial weight showed especially high weight gains.  4. Overall, our results demonstrate that maternal presence under food restriction triggered a local competition between mothers and their offspring. This competition limited offspring survival, but allowed mothers to increase their investment into future reproduction and/or to maintain their current body condition. On a general level, our findings reveal that parent–offspring competition can counteract the benefits of (facultative) parental care, and may thus impede the evolution of family life in resource-poor environments.",,,,"0269-8463||1365-2435",,"10.1111/1365-2435.12915","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551343","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,,"environmental conditions||European earwig||Family life||Kin competition||Orphaning||Parental care||Parent–offspring competition||Parent–offspring conflict","When earwig mothers do not care to share: Parent–offspring competition and the evolution of family life","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-06-08T11:04:00Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"84945218928",,"000414248100008","Funct.

Different formulations of this strain, and combinations of the fungus with garlic as efficacy-enhancing agent, were tested over 4 months in a pot and a field experiment carried out for biological control of Agriotes spp. in potatoes. A biocontrol effect was observed only in the pot experiment, i.e. the application of FCBK resulted in 77% efficacy. Colony counts combined with genotyping and marker sequence abundance confirmed the successful establishment of the applied strain. Only the formulated applied strain caused small shifts in fungal communities in the pot experiment. Treatment effects were in the same range as the effects caused by barley kernels, the carrier of the FCBK formulation and temporal effects. Garlic treatments and time affected prokaryotic communities. In the field experiment, only spatial differences affected fungal and prokaryotic communities. Our findings suggest that M. brunneum may not adversely affect soil microbial communities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000214285",,"0168-6496||1574-6941",,"10.1093/femsec/fix117","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/214285","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","inundative release||biological control agent||amplicon sequencing||non-target effect||fungal inoculant||next-generation sequencing","Assessing effects of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum on soil microbial communities in Agriotes spp. biological pest control","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-11-28T02:16:30Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85039993134",,"000416389000007","FEMS microbiol. ecol.","10","FEMS Microbiology Ecology","93","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, environmental change may affect ecosystem function without affecting richness, most notably by affecting population densities and community composition. Using a theoretical model, we find that, despite invariant richness, (1) small environmental effects may already lead to a collapse of function; (2) competitive strength may be a less important determinant of ecosystem function change than the selectivity of the environmental change driver and (3) effects on ecosystem function increase when effects on composition are larger. We also present a complementary statistical analysis of 13 data sets of phytoplankton and periphyton communities exposed to chemical stressors and show that effects on primary production under invariant richness ranged from -75% to +10%. We conclude that environmental protection goals relying on measures of richness could underestimate ecological impacts of environmental change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000230793",,"1461-023X||1461-0248",,"10.1111/ele.12828","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/230793","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Algae||biodiversity||coexistence||community ecology||modelling||primary production","Shifts of community composition and population density substantially affect ecosystem function despite invariant richness","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-18T13:00:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecol. lett.","10","Ecology Letters","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, in situ studies aiming to demonstrate the link between water temperature and community structure in complex ecosystems such as large river floodplains are still rare. In particular, we have little indication about how an increase in temperature affects the density of native and invasive species within a community. Large river floodplains cover a varied range of environmental conditions, are rich in species, and therefore potentially useful ecosystems to study the effect of water temperature at the community level. Moreover, as freshwater communities are increasingly impacted by global warming and biological invasions, an improved understanding of the possible interaction between these drivers would be beneficial. First, we studied during two years the thermal heterogeneity of 36 sites in a large river (Rhone) floodplain. Second, we compared the thermal regimes of sites having different levels of hydrological connectivity with the main river channel. Third, we studied the combined and separated effects of the thermal regime and the hydrological connectivity on the presence and densities of native and non-native species of macroinvertebrates. The studied large river floodplain covered a wide range of thermal regimes, with some sites displaying a yearlong constant temperature of about 10°C, whereas others experienced thermal amplitude of over 25°C. The thermal regime was independent of the level of hydrological connectivity of the sites. The increase in hydrological connectivity had a significant and positive effect on the richness of non-native species within sites. The thermal regime had a positive influence on the density of non-native species but no effect on the total density of native taxa within communities. This study showed that large river floodplains possess a wide range of thermal conditions and that the increase in water temperature can have a positive influence on the presence of non-native populations of macroinvertebrates. This study provides a first set of empirical results to establish models predicting the effect of increasing temperatures on the establishment of non-native and native species in a complex ecosystem and underline the problem of biological invasions under climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000230865",,"2150-8925",,"10.1002/ecs2.1972","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/230865","en","ESA","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","air-water temperature||alien species||climatic change||ecosystem management||generalized additive models||lateral connectivity||Rhone River||species distribution model||thermal pollution","Large river floodplain as a natural laboratory: non‐native macroinvertebrates benefit from elevated temperatures","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-18T13:53:48Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"10","Ecosphere","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

How can resistance be reversed in order to prolong the effec- tiveness of available treatments? Some key parameters affecting reversion of resistance are well known, such as the fitness cost of resistance. However, the population biological processes that actually cause resistance to persist or decline remain poorly characterized, and consequently our ability to manage reversion of resistance is limited. Where do susceptible genotypes that replace resistant lineages come from? What is the epidemiological scale of reversion? What information do we need to predict the mechanisms or likelihood of reversion? Here, we define some of the population biological processes that can drive reversion, using examples from a wide range of taxa and biocides. These processes differ primarily in the origin of revertant genotypes, but also in their sensitivity to factors such as coselection and compensatory evolution that can alter the rate of reversion, and the likelihood that resistance will re-emerge upon re-exposure to biocides. We therefore argue that discriminating among different types of reversion allows for better prediction of where resistance is most likely to persist.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000196595",,"0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/215928||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/196595","10.1098/rspb.2017.1619","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/216140","en","The Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Reversing resistance||Biocides||Antimicrobials||Fungicides","Reversing resistance: different routes and common themes across pathogens","Review Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2017-10-17T12:51:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,"The role of bacteria-virus interactions in antimicrobial resistance","165803","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,"85030709439",,"000411723200020","Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1863","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","284","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Females of many Lepidopteran species have secondarily lost their flight ability, which may lead to changes in the olfactory capabilities of both larval and adult stages. The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, an important forest pest worldwide, is currently undergoing a diversification process with three recognized subspecies: the Asian gypsy moth (AGM), Lymantria dispar asiatica; the Japanese gypsy moth (JGM), Lymantria dispar japonica; and the European gypsy moth (EGM), Lymantria dispar dispar. Females of EGM populations from North America have lost their flight capacity whereas the JGM and AGM females are flight capable, making this an ideal system to investigate the relationship between flight and olfaction. We used next-generation sequencing to obtain female antennal and larval head capsule transcriptomes in order to (i) investigate the differences in expression of olfaction-related genes among populations; (ii) identify the most similar protein sequences reported for other organisms through a BLAST search, and (iii) establish the phylogenetic relationships of these sequences with respect to other insect species. Using this approach, we identified 115 putative chemosensory genes belonging to five families of olfaction-related genes. A principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the gene-expression patterns of female antennal transcriptomes from different subspecies were more similar to one another than to the larval head capsules of their respective subspecies supporting strong chemosensory differences between the two developmental stages. An analysis of the shared and exclusively expressed genes for three populations shows no evidence that loss of flight affects the number or type of genes being expressed. These results indicate either (a) that loss of flight does not impact the olfactory gene repertoire or (b) that the secondary loss of flight in American EGM populations may be too recent to have caused major changes in the genes being expressed. However, we found higher expression values for most olfaction-related genes in EGM females, suggesting that differences in transcription rates could be an adaptation of flightless females to their chemical environment. Differences in olfactory genes and their expression in the larvae appear to be unrelated to the flight ability of adult females and are likely adaptations to different ecological pressures.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000201936",,"2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2017.00115","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/201936","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Lymantria dispar||transcriptome||odorant receptor||ionotropic receptor||gustatory receptor||odorant binding protein||chemosensory protein","Comparing the expression of olfaction-related genes in gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) adult females and larvae from one flightless and two flight-capable populations","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-28T02:35:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85031717273",,,"Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although both such effects have been documented within plant species’ native ranges, how the balance of these forces influences local adaptation in invasive plant populations is less clear, in part because introduced species often have lower genetic variation initially but also tend to have good dispersal abilities. To evaluate the extent of gene flow and adaptation to local climate in invasive populations of Solidago canadensis, and the implications of this for range expansion, we compared population differentiation at microsatellite and chloroplast loci for populations across Switzerland and assessed the effect of environmental transfer distance using common gardens. We found that while patterns of differentiation at neutral genetic markers suggested that populations are connected through extensive pollen and seed movement, common-garden plants nonetheless exhibited modest adaptation to local climate conditions. Growth rate and flower production declined with climatic distance from a plant's home site, with clones from colder home sites performing better at or above the range limit. Such adaptation in invasive species is likely to promote further spread, particularly under climate change, as the genotypes positioned near the range edge may be best able to take advantage of lengthening growing seasons to expand the range.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000202885",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0185539","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/202885","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Population genetics and adaptation to climate along elevation gradients in invasive Solidago canadensis","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-31T13:08:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000411985200080","PLoS ONE","9","PLoS ONE","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This includes applying multiple antibiotics strategically, using bacteriophages against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and combining both types of antibacterial agents. All these approaches rely on or are impacted by associations among resistance phenotypes (where bacteria resistant to one antibacterial agent are also relatively susceptible or resistant to others). Experiments with laboratory strains have shown strong associations between some resistance phenotypes, but we lack a quantitative understanding of associations among antibiotic and phage resistance phenotypes in natural and clinical populations. To address this, we measured resistance to various antibiotics and bacteriophages for 94 natural and clinical Escherichia coli isolates. We found several positive associations between resistance phenotypes across isolates. Associations were on average stronger for antibacterial agents of the same type (antibiotic-antibiotic or phage-phage) than different types (antibiotic-phage). Plasmid profiles and genetic knockouts suggested that such associations can result from both colocalization of resistance genes and pleiotropic effects of individual resistance mechanisms, including one case of antibiotic-phage cross-resistance. Antibiotic resistance was predicted by core genome phylogeny and plasmid profile, but phage resistance was predicted only by core genome phylogeny. Finally, we used observed associations to predict genes involved in a previously uncharacterized phage resistance mechanism, which we verified using experimental evolution.

Their evolutionary dynamics depend on their genetic basis, the historical pattern of predation risk that populations have experienced and current selection gradients. When populations experience predators with contrasting hunting strategies and size preferences, theory suggests contrasting micro-evolutionary responses to selection. Daphnia pulex is an ideal species to explore the micro-evolutionary response of anti-predator traits because they face heterogeneous predation regimes, sometimes experiencing only invertebrate midge predators and other times experiencing vertebrate fish and invertebrate midge predators. We explored plausible patterns of adaptive evolution of a predator-induced morphological reaction norm. We combined estimates of selection gradients that characterize the various habitats that D. pulex experiences with detail on the quantitative genetic architecture of inducible morphological defences. Our data reveal a fine scale description of daphnid defensive reaction norms, and a strong covariance between the sensitivity to cues and the maximum response to cues. By analysing the response of the reaction norm to plausible, predator-specific selection gradients, we show how in the context of this covariance, micro-evolution may be more uniform than predicted from size-selective predation theory. Our results show how covariance between the sensitivity to cues and the maximum response to cues for morphological defence can shape the evolutionary trajectory of predator-induced defences in D. pulex.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000230855",,"0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2017.0859","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/230855","en","The Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","reaction norm||evolution||redator-induced plasticity||morphological defence||Daphnia pulex","Evolution of a predator-induced, nonlinear reaction norm","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-18T13:52:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1861","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","284","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it is now recognised that a diverse microbial community exists in the airways comprising aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as fungi and viruses. This rich soup of microorganisms provides ample opportunity for interspecies interactions, particularly when considering secreted compounds. Here, we discuss how P. aeruginosa-secreted products can have community-wide effects, with the potential to ultimately shape microbial community dynamics within the lung. We focus on three well-studied traits associated with worsening clinical outcome in CF: phenazines, siderophores and biofilm formation, and discuss how secretions can shape interactions between P. aeruginosa and other commonly encountered members of the lung microbiome: Staphylococcus aureus, the Burkholderia cepacia complex, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. These interactions may shape the evolutionary trajectory of P. aeruginosa while providing new opportunities for therapeutic exploitation of the CF lung microbiome.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191192",,"0378-1097||1574-6968||0168-6496||0920-8534||0168-6445",,"10.1093/femsle/fnx128","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191192","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Pseudomonas aeruginosa||microbial communities||interspecific interactions: multispecies interactions||microbiome||cystic fibrosis","The role of multispecies social interactions in shaping Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenicity in the cystic fibrosis lung","Review Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:55:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85028365170",,"000410350900004","FEMS Microbiol Lett","15","FEMS Microbiology Letters","364","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This has generally necessitated a switch to new drugs and the discontinuation of older ones, after which resistance often only declines slowly or even persists indefinitely. These long-term effects are usually ascribed to low fitness costs of resistance in absence of the drug. Here we show that structure in the host population, in particular heterogeneity in number of contacts, also plays an important role in the reversion dynamics. Host contact structure acts both during the phase of intense treatment, leading to non-random distributions of the resistant strain among the infected population, and after the discontinuation of the drug, by affecting the competition dynamics resulting in a mitigation of fitness advantages. As a consequence, we observe both a lower rate of reversion and a lower probability that reversion to sensitivity on the population level occurs after treatment is stopped. Our simulations show that the impact of heterogeneity in the host structure is maximal in the biologically most plausible parameter range, namely when fitness costs of resistance are small.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190585",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005704","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190585","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Host population structure impedes reversion to drug sensitivity after discontinuation of treatment","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:14:30Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85030617820",,"000408759400030","PLOS comput. biol.","8","PLoS Computational Biology","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The effect such cheats have on reducing population productivity suggests that there is selection for cooperators to mitigate the adverse effects of cheats. While mechanisms have been elucidated for scenarios involving a direct association between producer and cooperative product, it is less clear how cooperators may suppress cheating in an anonymous public goods scenario, where cheats cannot be directly identified. Here, we investigate the real-time evolutionary response of cooperators to cheats when cooperation is mediated by a diffusible public good: the production of iron-scavenging siderophores by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We find that siderophore producers evolved in the presence of a high frequency of non-producing cheats were fitter in the presence of cheats, at no obvious cost to population productivity. A novel morphotype independently evolved and reached higher frequencies in cheat-adapted versus control populations, exhibiting reduced siderophore production but increased production of pyocyanin—an extracellular toxin that can also increase the availability of soluble iron. This suggests that cooperators may have mitigated the negative effects of cheats by downregulating siderophore production and upregulating an alternative iron-acquisition public good. More generally, the study emphasizes that cooperating organisms can rapidly adapt to the presence of anonymous cheats without necessarily incurring fitness costs in the environment they evolve in.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191424",,"0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2017.1089","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191424","en","The Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Siderophore||Public Goods||Cooperation||Pseudomonas||pyoverdine||Experimental evolution","Adaptation to public goods cheats in Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:12:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85026491204",,"000406288700021","Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1859","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","284","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We show that the evolution of alleles increasing the mutation or phenotypic switching rates toward cooperation is in itself a social dilemma. Although cooperative offspring are often unlikely to reproduce, due to high cost of cooperation, they can be seen both as a living public good and a part of the extended parental phenotype. The competition between individuals that generate cooperators and ones that do not is often more relevant than the competition between cooperators and non-cooperators. The dilemma of second-order cooperation we describe relates directly to eusociality, but can be also interpreted as a division of labor or a soma-germline distinction. The results of our simulations shine a new light on what Darwin had already termed a “special difficulty” of evolutionary theory and describe a novel type of cooperation dynamics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191071",,"0014-3820||1558-5646",,"10.1111/evo.13279","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191071","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Cooperation||Division of labor||mutation rate||mutational landscape||phenotypic switching||second-order evolution||soma-germline distinction","Second-order cooperation: Cooperative offspring as a living public good arising from second-order selection on non-cooperative individuals","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:47:26Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85020403207",,"000405888100006","Evolution","7","Evolution","71","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A prerequisite for evolutionary change is within-population heritable genetic variation in traits subject to selection. In relation to climate change, mainly phenological traits as well as heat and desiccation resistance have been examined for such variation. Therefore, it is important to investigate adaptive potential under climate change conditions across a broader range of traits. This is especially true for life-history traits and defences against natural enemies (e.g. parasites) since they influence organisms’ fitness both directly and through species interactions. We examined the adaptive potential of fitness-related traits and their responses to heat waves in a population of a freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. We estimated family-level variation and covariation in life history (size, reproduction) and constitutive immune defence traits [haemocyte concentration, phenoloxidase (PO)-like activity, antibacterial activity of haemolymph] in snails experimentally exposed to typical (15 °C) and heat wave (25 °C) temperatures. We also assessed variation in the reaction norms of these traits between the treatments. Results  We found that at the heat wave temperature, snails were larger and reproduced more, while their immune defence was reduced. Snails showed high family-level variation in all examined traits within both temperature treatments. The only negative genetic correlation (between reproduction and antibacterial activity) appeared at the high temperature. However, we found no family-level variation in the responses of most examined traits to the experimental heat wave (i.e. largely parallel reaction norms between the treatments). Only the reduction of PO-like activity when exposed to the high temperature showed family-level variation, suggesting that the cost of heat waves may be lower for some families and could evolve under selection. Conclusion  Our results suggest that there is genetic potential for adaptation within both thermal environments and that trait evolution may not be strongly affected by trade-offs between them. However, rare differences in thermal reaction norms across families indicate limited evolutionary potential in the responses of snails to changing temperatures during extreme weather events.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191021",,"1471-2148","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191021||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/233117","10.1186/s12862-017-0988-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/260098","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","G × E interaction||Global warming||Great pond snail||Immunocompetence||Life history trait||Mollusc","Potential for adaptation to climate change: family-level variation in fitness-related traits and their responses to heat waves in a snail population","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:45:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000403409300002","BMC evol. biol.",,"BMC Evolutionary Biology","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, their implementation remains challenging and would profit from a deepened mechanistic understanding of HIV-antibody interactions and the mucosal transmission process. In this study we experimentally determined stoichiometric parameters of the HIV-1 trimer-antibody interaction, confirming that binding of one antibody is sufficient for trimer neutralization. This defines numerical requirements for HIV-1 virion neutralization and thereby enables mathematical modelling of in vitro and in vivo antibody neutralization efficacy. The model we developed accurately predicts antibody efficacy in animal passive immunization studies and provides estimates for protective mucosal antibody concentrations. Furthermore, we derive estimates of the probability for a single virion to start host infection and the risks of male-to-female HIV-1 transmission per sexual intercourse. Our work thereby delivers comprehensive quantitative insights into both the molecular principles governing HIV-antibody interactions and the initial steps of mucosal HIV-1 transmission. These insights, alongside the underlying, adaptable modelling framework presented here, will be valuable for supporting in silico pre-trial planning and post-hoc evaluation of HIV-1 vaccination or antibody treatment trials.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000130816",,"1553-7374||1553-7366",,"10.1371/journal.ppat.1006313","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/130816","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Predicting HIV-1 transmission and antibody neutralization efficacy in vivo from stoichiometric parameters","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T21:04:00Z",,"pub:193847",,"yes",,,,"Infering virus colonization pathways from high-throughput genetic data","149769","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,"imp5936556f3917535116","005409548",,,"85020192575",,"000402877700010","PLoS Pathog","5","PLoS Pathogens","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02060 - Dep.

We study an oscillatory biological system: collective activity cycles in ant colonies. Ant colonies have become model systems for research on biological networks because the interactions between the component parts are visible to the naked eye, and because the time-ordered contact network formed by these interactions serves as the substrate for the distribution of information and other resources throughout the colony. To understand how the collective activity cycles influence the contact network transport properties, we used an automated tracking system to record the movement of all the individuals within nine different ant colonies. From these trajectories we extracted over two million ant-to-ant interactions. Time-series analysis of the temporal fluctuations of the overall colony interaction and movement rates revealed that both the period and amplitude of the activity cycles exhibit a diurnal cycle, in which daytime cycles are faster and of greater amplitude than night cycles. Using epidemiology-derived models of transmission over networks, we compared the transmission properties of the observed periodic contact networks with those of synthetic aperiodic networks. These simulations revealed that contrary to some predictions, regularly-oscillating contact networks should impede information transmission. Further, we provide a mechanistic explanation for this effect, and present evidence in support of it.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190530",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005527","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190530","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Short-term activity cycles impede information transmission in ant colonies","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:11:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85020081727",,"000402889500023","PLOS comput. biol.","5","PLoS Computational Biology","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we report the LysM effectors of the soil-borne fungal vascular wilt pathogen Verticillium dahliae. Comparative genomics revealed three core LysM effectors that are conserved in a collection of V. dahliae strains. Remarkably, and in contrast with the previously studied LysM effectors of other plant pathogens, no expression of core LysM effectors was monitored in planta in a taxonomically diverse panel of host plants. Moreover, targeted deletion of the individual LysM effector genes in V. dahliae strain JR2 did not compromise virulence in infections on Arabidopsis, tomato or Nicotiana benthamiana. Interestingly, an additional lineage-specific LysM effector is encoded in the genome of V. dahliae strain VdLs17, but not in any other V. dahliae strain sequenced to date. Remarkably, this lineage-specific effector is expressed in planta and contributes to the virulence of V. dahliae strain VdLs17 on tomato, but not on Arabidopsis or N. benthamiana. Functional analysis revealed that this LysM effector binds chitin, is able to suppress chitin-induced immune responses and protects fungal hyphae against hydrolysis by plant hydrolytic enzymes. Thus, in contrast with the core LysM effectors of V. dahliae, this lineage-specific LysM effector of strain VdLs17 contributes to virulence in planta.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000217279",,"1464-6722||1364-3703",,"10.1111/mpp.12520","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/217279","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","aggressiveness||chitin||comparative genomics||hyphal protection||lineage-specific effecto||tomato||vascular wilt disease","Verticillium dahliae LysM effectors differentially contribute to virulence on plant hosts","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-12-05T09:46:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mol. plant pathol.","4","Molecular Plant Pathology","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying migrations allows for improved management of species and ecosystems [1, 2, 3, 4]. For centuries, the catadromous European eel (Anguilla anguilla) has provided one of Europe’s most important fisheries and has sparked considerable scientific inquiry, most recently owing to the dramatic collapse of juvenile recruitment [5]. Larval eels are transported by ocean currents associated with the Gulf Stream System from Sargasso Sea breeding grounds to coastal and freshwater habitats from North Africa to Scandinavia [6, 7]. After a decade or more, maturing adults migrate back to the Sargasso Sea, spawn, and die [8]. However, the migratory mechanisms that bring juvenile eels to Europe and return adults to the Sargasso Sea remain equivocal [9, 10]. Here, we used a “magnetic displacement” experiment [11, 12] to show that the orientation of juvenile eels varies in response to subtle differences in magnetic field intensity and inclination angle along their marine migration route. Simulations using an ocean circulation model revealed that even weakly swimming in the experimentally observed directions at the locations corresponding to the magnetic displacements would increase entrainment of juvenile eels into the Gulf Stream System. These findings provide new insight into the migration ecology and recruitment dynamics of eels and suggest that an adaptive magnetic map, tuned to large-scale features of ocean circulation, facilitates the vast oceanic migrations of the Anguilla genus [7, 13, 14].","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000130641",,"0960-9822||1879-0445","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/233125||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/130641","10.1016/j.cub.2017.03.015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/242253","en","Cell Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Anguilla anguilla||Animal migration||Animal navigation||Magnetic orientation||Ocean currents||Sargasso Sea||Sensory ecology","A Magnetic Map Leads Juvenile European Eels to the Gulf Stream","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:58:28Z",,"pub:193659",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936556c5a1a472698","010842595",,,"85017445725",,"000399986500032","Curr Biol","8","Current Biology","27","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Bony armor traits of fish are good candidates for this because they evolve rapidly in some freshwater fish populations, and bone is phosphorus rich and likely to affect nutrient recycling in aquatic ecosystems. Here, we explore how ontogeny, rearing environment, and bone allocation among body parts affect the stoichiometric phenotype (i.e., stoichiometric composition of bodies and excretion) of threespine stickleback. We use two populations from distinct freshwater lineages with contrasting lateral plating phenotypes (full vs. low plating) and their hybrids, which are mostly fully plated. We found that ontogeny, rearing environment, and body condition were the most important predictors of organismal stoichiometry. Although elemental composition was similar between both populations and their hybrids, we found significant divergence in phosphorus allocation among body parts and in phosphorus excretion rates. Overall, body armor differences did not explain variation in whole body phosphorus, phosphorus allocation, or phosphorus excretion. Evolutionary divergence between these lineages in both allocation and excretion is likely to have important direct consequences for ecosystems, but may be mediated by evolution of multiple morphological or physiological traits beyond plating phenotype.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000230786",,"2045-7758","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/233115||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/230786","10.1002/ece3.2802","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/242229","en","John Wiley & Sons","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","allocation||condition||ecological stoichiometry||fish||phosphorus","Stoichiometric traits of stickleback: Effects of genetic background, rearing environment, and ontogeny","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-18T12:59:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecol Evol","8","Ecology and Evolution","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Because the effects of fish predators and their phenotypic differences on microbial communities have not received much attention, we tested how the presence/absence, genotype, and plasticity of the predatory three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) influence aquatic microbes in outdoor mesocosms. We reared lake and stream stickleback genotypes on contrasting food resources to adulthood, and then added them to aquatic mesocosm ecosystems to assess their impact on the planktonic bacterial community. We also investigated whether the effects of fish persisted following the removal of adults, and the subsequent addition of a homogenous juvenile fish population. The presence of adult stickleback increased the number of bacterial OTUs and altered the size structure of the microbial community, whereas their phenotype affected bacterial community composition. Some of these effects were detectable after adult fish were removed from the mesocosms, and after juvenile fish were placed in the tanks, most of these effects disappeared. Our results suggest that fish can have strong short-term effects on microbial communities that are partially mediated by phenotypic variation of fish.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000230794",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.2784","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/230794","en","John Wiley & Sons","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Gasterosteus aculeatus||bacterial community composition||ecosystem effects||mesocosms||stickleback","The effect of top-predator presence and phenotype on aquatic microbial communities","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-18T13:00:46Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecol Evol","5","Ecology and Evolution","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Dynamics of natural communities are driven by the interaction between individual organisms and their growth environment, which is mediated by the organisms’ expressed phenotypic traits. We tested whether exposure to a mixture of 12 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) influences phenotypic trait diversity in lake phytoplankton communities and their ability to regulate biomass production to fit environmental changes (response capacity). We exposed natural phytoplankton assemblages to three mixture levels in permeable microcosms maintained at three depths in a eutrophic lake for one week, during which the environmental conditions were fluctuating. We studied individual-level traits, phenotypic diversity and community biomass. PPCP reduced individual-level trait variance and overall community phenotypic diversity, but maintained higher standing phytoplankton biomass compared to untreated controls. Estimated effect sizes of PPCP on traits and community properties were very large (partial Eta-squared > 0.15). The PPCP mixture antagonistically interacted with the natural environmental gradient in habitats offered by different depths and, at concentrations comparable to those in waste-water effluents, prevented communities from converging to the same phenotypic structure and total biomass of unexposed controls. We show that micropollutants can alter individual-level trait diversity of lake phytoplankton communities and therefore their capacity to respond to natural environmental gradients, potentially affecting aquatic ecosystem processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000243110",,"1932-6203","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/130109||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/233127","10.1371/journal.pone.0174207","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/243110","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Water-borne pharmaceuticals reduce phenotypic diversity and response capacity of natural phytoplankton communities","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:40:34Z",,"pub:193111",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365562007f293212","010850889",,,"85015999627",,,"PLoS ONE","3","PLoS ONE","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The mechanisms by which the bacteria manage to infest this alternative host, to overcome its immune system, and to ultimately kill the insect are still largely unknown. However, the investigation of the few virulence factors discovered so far, points to a highly multifactorial nature of insecticidal activity. Antimicrobial compounds produced by fluorescent pseudomonads are effective weapons against a vast diversity of organisms such as fungi, oomycetes, nematodes, and protozoa. Here, we investigated whether these compounds also contribute to insecticidal activity. We tested mutants of the highly insecticidal strains Pseudomonas protegens CHA0, Pseudomonas chlororaphis PCL1391, and Pseudomonas sp. CMR12a, defective for individual or multiple antimicrobial compounds, for injectable and oral activity against lepidopteran insect larvae. Moreover, we studied expression of biosynthesis genes for these antimicrobial compounds for the first time in insects. Our survey revealed that hydrogen cyanide and different types of cyclic lipopeptides contribute to insecticidal activity. Hydrogen cyanide was essential to full virulence of CHA0 and PCL1391 directly injected into the hemolymph. The cyclic lipopeptide orfamide produced by CHA0 and CMR12a was mainly important in oral infections. Mutants of CMR12a and PCL1391 impaired in the production of the cyclic lipopeptides sessilin and clp1391, respectively, showed reduced virulence in injection and feeding experiments. Although virulence of mutants lacking one or several of the other antimicrobial compounds, i.e., 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, phenazines, pyrrolnitrin, or pyoluteorin, was not reduced, these metabolites might still play a role in an insect background since all investigated biosynthetic genes for antimicrobial compounds of strain CHA0 were expressed at some point during insect infection. In summary, our study identified new factors contributing to insecticidal activity and extends the diverse functions of antimicrobial compounds produced by fluorescent pseudomonads from the plant environment to the insect host.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000216402",,"1664-302X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128773||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/215753","10.3389/fmicb.2017.00100","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/216402","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","orfamide||sessilin||Gac regulatory system||Pseudomonas fluorescens||Pseudomonas protegens||Pseudomonas chlororaphis||secondary metabolites||insecticidal activity","Antimicrobial and Insecticidal: Cyclic Lipopeptides and Hydrogen Cyanide Produced by Plant-Beneficial Pseudomonas Strains CHA0, CMR12a, and PCL1391 Contribute to Insect Killing","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T19:59:40Z",,"pub:191700",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365547f36a034053","010181524",,,"85014472372",,"000393219800001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

High-throughput sequencing enabled major advances in understanding how pathogens cause disease on crops. Hundreds of fungal genomes are now available and analyzing these genomes highlighted the key role of effector genes in disease. Effectors are small secreted proteins that enhance infection by manipulating host metabolism. Fungal genomes carry 100s of putative effector genes, but the lack of homology among effector genes, even for closely related species, challenges evolutionary and functional analyses. Furthermore, effector genes are often found in rapidly evolving chromosome compartments which are difficult to assemble. We review how population and comparative genomics toolsets can be combined to address these challenges. We highlight studies that associated genome-scale polymorphisms with pathogen lifestyles and adaptation to different environments. We show how genome-wide association studies can be used to identify effectors and other pathogenicity-related genes underlying rapid adaptation. We also discuss how the compartmentalization of fungal genomes into core and accessory regions shapes the evolution of effector genes. We argue that an understanding of genome evolution provides important insight into the trajectory of host-pathogen co-evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000216386",,"1664-462X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128774||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/215762","10.3389/fpls.2017.00119","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/216386","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","plant pathogens||genome||population genomics||evolution||molecular||fungi||agricultural ecosystems||association mapping studies","Using Population and Comparative Genomics to Understand the Genetic Basis of Effector-Driven Fungal Pathogen Evolution","Review Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T19:59:40Z",,"pub:191701",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365548057a518153","010181292",,,"85011923287",,"000393216500001","Front.

However, the propensity to mutate is likely to vary among co-existing individuals within a population, due to genetic polymorphisms, heterogeneous environmental influences, and random physiological fluctuations. We review the evidence for mutation rate heterogeneity and explore its consequences by extending classic population genetic models to allow an arbitrary distribution of mutation rate among individuals, either with or without inheritance. With this general new framework, we rigorously establish the effects of heterogeneity at various evolutionary timescales. In a single generation, variation of mutation rate about the mean increases the probability of producing zero or many simultaneous mutations on a genome. Over multiple generations of mutation and selection, heterogeneity accelerates the appearance of both deleterious and beneficial multi-point mutants. At mutation-selection balance, higher-order mutant frequencies are likewise boosted, while lower-order mutants exhibit subtler effects; nonetheless, population mean fitness is always enhanced. We quantify the dependencies on moments of the mutation rate distribution and selection coefficients, and clarify the role of mutation rate inheritance. While typical methods of estimating mutation rate will recover only the population mean, analyses assuming mutation rate is fixed to this mean could underestimate the potential for multi-locus adaptation, including medically relevant evolution in pathogenic and cancerous populations. We discuss the potential to empirically parameterize mutation rate distributions, which have to date hardly been quantified.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190688",,"0737-4038||1537-1719",,"10.1093/molbev/msw244","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190688","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","population genetics||adaptation||hypermutator||transient mutagenesis||cancer||bacteria","Population Heterogeneity in Mutation Rate Increases the Frequency of Higher-Order Mutants and Reduces Long-Term Mutational Load","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:22:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,"The population biology of drug resistance: Key principles for a more sustainable use of drugs||Evolution and spread of drug resistance: A combined computational and experimental approach","268540||155866","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF","FP7||Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,,,,,"85021852143",,"000396511300011","Mol Biol Evol","2","Molecular Biology and Evolution","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We tested whether 55 populations of the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus that underwent selection for increased fitness at the leading edge of swarming colonies adapted by swarming faster toward unused resources or by other means. Populations adapted greatly but diversified markedly in both swarming phenotypes and apparent mechanisms of adaptation. Intriguingly, although many adapted populations swarm intrinsically faster than their ancestors, numerous others do not. Some populations evolved interference competition toward their ancestors, whereas others gained the ability to facultatively increase swarming rate specifically upon direct interaction with ancestral competitors. Our results both highlight the diverse range of mechanisms by which actively motile organisms can adapt evolutionarily and help to explain the high levels of swarming-phenotype diversity found in local soil populations of M. xanthus.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120992",,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/ismej.2016.115","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120992","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Evolution by flight and fight: Diverse mechanisms of adaptation by actively motile microbes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T13:27:27Z",,"pub:183075",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654be285a922811","005502685",,,"84988578976",,"000394541500022","ISME J","2","The ISME Journal","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We present 13 principles that can help guide valuation and therefore inform the management of alien species. Seven of these relate to the science domain, representing aspects of change caused by alien species that can be measured or otherwise assessed using scientific methods. The remaining six principles invoke values, risk perception, and environmental ethics, but also cognitive and motivational decision biases. We illustrate the consequences of insufficient appreciation of these principles. Finally, we provide guidance rooted in political agreements and environmental ethics for improving the consideration of the consequences of these principles and present appropriate tools for management decisions relating to alien species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191871",,"0006-3568||1525-3244",,"10.1093/biosci/biw160","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191871","en","Oxford University Press","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","biological invasions||decisionmaking||environmental ethics||perception||values","Scientific and Normative Foundations for the Valuation of Alien-Species Impacts: Thirteen Core Principles","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:47:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000396895800010","Bioscience (Print)","2","Bioscience","67","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We hypothesize that depending on the prevalent environmental conditions, only a portion of the daughter tubers of a plant that is secondarily infected by viruses may become infected. To test this hypothesis experimental data from standardized field experiments were produced in three contrasting environments at 112, 3280, and 4000 m a.s.l. in Peru during two growing seasons. In these experiments, the percentage of infected daughter tubers produced by seed tubers that were infected with either potato potexvirus X (PVX), potato Andean mottle comovirus (APMoV), potato potyvirus Y (PVY) (jointly infected with PVX) or potato leafroll luteovirus (PLRV) was determined. Incomplete autoinfection was found in all cases, as the percentage of virus infected daughter tubers harvested from secondarily infected plants was invariably less than 100%, with the lowest percentage of infection being 30%. Changing the growing site to higher altitudes decreased autoinfection for all viruses. Therefore, the assumption of complete autoinfection of secondarily infected plants were rejected, while the hypothesis of environmentally dependent incomplete autoinfection was accepted. The findings help explain the occurrence of traditional seed management practices in the Andes and may help to develop locally adapted seed systems in environments of the world that have no steady access to healthy seed tubers coming from a formally certified seed system. The results obtained almost three decades ago are discussed in light of most recent knowledge on epigenetic regulation of host plant – virus interactions which allow for speculating about the underlying biological principles of the incomplete autoinfection. A research roadmap is proposed for achieving explicit experimental proof for the epigenetic regulation of incomplete autoinfection in the pathosystem under study.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000128909",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2017.00074","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128909","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","autoinfection||plant viruses||seed potato systems||seed degeneration||food security||climate change||epigenetics||gene-silencing","Incomplete infection of secondarily infected potato plants – an environment dependent underestimated mechanism in plant virology","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:03:34Z",,"pub:191838",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936554adb17f93374","010181292",,,"85011844309",,,"Front.

Biological control using entomopathogens is an alternative pest management strategy to chemical control, is considered to be more environmental friendly than chemical control and is often part of integrated pest management (IPM). Beneficial effects of entomopathogens as compared to chemicals may include conservation of other natural enemies, reduction of pesticide residues in soil and plants as well as safety for non-target organisms. The development of existing biological control for important soil dwelling pests in Europe by exploiting novel application strategies and synergistic effects of entomopathogenic fungi, entomopathogenic nematodes and natural substances, has been the major aim of the EU-project supporting this thesis (INBIOSOIL). Biological control using entomopathogenic fungi may include soil applications of large quantities of fungal propagules, often resulting in densities of up to 1014 propagules per ha. Such mass applications and introductions of microorganisms to soil may affect indigenous soil microbial communities and the ecosystem functions they fulfil. Assessment of potential effects of applied microorganisms on native soil microbial communities is therefore important and also required in the registration process of novel products by European and Swiss regulations. Species of the entomopathogenic fungal genus Metarhizium are widely used in biological control and potential effects of Metarhizium on native soil microbial communities have barely been investigated. As a basic principal of risk assessment of mass applications it is mandatory to verify that soil microbial communities are exposed to the applied fungal biological control agent (BCA). It is important to be able to determine both exposure (presence and abundance) as well as effects, e.g., changes in microbial community structures, of a BCA in soil as basis of a risk assessment. Therefore, the aims of this thesis were I) to improve molecular tools to assess presence and abundance of the BCA in soil in order to track exposure of soil microbial communities and II) to assess potential effects of applications of two strains of the BCA on soil microbial communities in pot and field experiments and III) to investigate potential analytical constraints of the presence of one highly abundant microbial strain on the assessment of changes in soil microbial community structures. Exposure of soil microbial communities to the BCA was assessed by isolation of Metarhizium spp. from soil on selective medium and subsequently identifying the genotype of the applied strains using simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker analyses. To optimize the typing tool the transferability of 41 existing SSR markers to different Metarhizium spp. were investigated (Chapter 2). This was particularly important since structure and taxonomy within the genus Metarhizium have been drastically revised in the recent past. Among other changes, the species M. anisopliae has been recognized as a species complex and has been divided into 10 species. Suitable markers were selected for genotyping of the applied strains and discriminating them from native Metarhizium strains present in soils. Biocontrol experiments were performed to control Agriotes obscurus larvae in a pot and a field experiment and Diabrotica virgifera virgifera larvae in a pot experiment using the BCA M. brunneum ART2825 and M. brunneum EAMa01/58-Su over a period of four months (Chapter 3 and 4). Treatments included three different formulations of the BCA, i.e. fungus colonized barley kernels (FCBK), fungal capsules (Fcap) and fungal granules (Fgran), unformulated fungal spores, combinations of the BCA and garlic extract, garlic extract alone and controls. Potential effects of M. brunneum on fungal and prokaryotic soil communities were assessed using next generation sequencing (NGS) of ribosomal marker regions, i.e., the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) for fungal soil communities and part of the small subunit of the ribosomal RNA gene (16S V3-V4) for prokaryotic communities. One of the biases occurring in NGS is preferential amplification of target sequences in the PCR due to the occurrence of one highly abundant sequence. In order to assess if the sequence of the applied strain, which was highly abundant, will affect the assessment of changes of soil microbial communities, an experiment was performed in which different concentration of a plasmid containing the target sequence of the BCA was added to a soil DNA extract (Chapter 5). Results revealed that M. brunneum ART2825 formulated as FCBK was the most efficient treatment against A. obscurus larvae in the pot experiment, which resulted in 77 % reduction of damaged potato tubers compared to the untreated control (Chapter 3). No biocontrol effect was detected in the Agriotes-field experiment as well as in the Diabrotica-pot experiment (Chapter 3 and 4). Selective plating and SSR marker analyses confirmed exposure of soil microbial communities to the applied strains in the pot and field experiments and built the basis for effect analyses (Chapter 3 and 4). In the Agriotes-pot experiment, M. brunneum ART2825 affected the fungal community structures only slightly and only if formulated. These effects were in the same range as effects caused by the carrier material only and no effects were detected if pure fungal spores were applied to soil. In contrast, prokaryotic community structures were not affected by any fungal applications. Also, fungal and prokaryotic communities did not change upon the application of the BCA in the Diabrotica-pot and the Agriotes-field experiment. Finally, assessment of effects, i.e., changes in soil microbial community structures, were not impeded by the presence of one highly abundant sequence or sequencing errors that potentially corroborate the reliability of the results (Chapter 5). In conclusion, genotyping using SSR marker analyses was a valuable tool for confirming inoculation success and exposure of soil microbial communities to the applied strains. Although, constraints of amplicon sequencing, such as PCR bias, erroneous sequences and limitations in species identification, may occur, it is currently the most suitable technique, for the sequencing depth and the large number of samples and replicates required in experiments as performed in this study. Natural fluctuations including spatial and temporal differences of soil microbial community structures were similar or greater than any treatment-effects detected by applying different formulations of the BCA or unformulated fungal spores. Therefore, it is unlikely that applications of M. brunneum ART2825 and M. brunneum EAMa01/58-Su adversely affect soil microbial communities beyond the extent induced by fluctuations occurring in natural habitats. However, the findings of this study are restricted to specific BCA strains, soils, experimental designs, and analytical procedures and may require confirmation in other systems or if new analytical tools become available.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000244602",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/244602","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Stability of soil microbial communities to applications of the fungal biological control agent Metarhizium brunneum","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture","2018-02-27T09:54:33Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24581",,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This dissertation focuses on phenotypic and molecular correlates of hybrid seed failure between closely-related species. Three main compartments comprise the angiosperm seed, each with different genomic make-up: the seed coat (maternal), the endosperm (2m:1p), and the embryo (1m:1p). The endosperm plays a central role in early seed development because it regulates embryo nutrient acquisition while synchronizing growth between seed compartments. Importantly, hybrid seed abortion is generally associated with an altered endosperm development. Moreover, genomic imprinting, i.e. parent-of-origin–dependent expression, is exceedingly rare in other plant tissues but widespread in the endosperm. Potential functional links between imprinting perturbation or -mismatch and seed abortion are predicted by evolutionary theory based on parental conflict, but have only begun to be elucidated at the molecular level. Wild tomatoes (Solanum sect. Lycopersicon) were chosen to compare seed development and gene expression in the endosperm of seeds from intraspecific and hybrid crosses, and to address the role of genomic imprinting in lineage divergence and hybrid seed failure. To this end, I used three tomato lineages with interesting hybrid seed phenotypes and patterns of genetic divergence: S. arcanum var marañón (A), S. chilense (C), and S. peruvianum (P). A large part of my study was based on laser-microdissected developing endosperm obtained from seeds of intra- and interspecific crosses and subsequent transcriptome sequencing. In Chapter 1, I hypothesized that seed abortion in wild tomatoes is triggered by endosperm failure and that viable hybrid progenies, after seed germination, may reveal additional symptoms of hybrid incompatibility. Jointly with my collaborators, I provided a comprehensive morphological description of seed development in intra- and interspecific crosses. I found that the incidence of hybrid seed failure was variable among species combinations, with marked phenotypic asymmetries between reciprocal crosses with near- complete seed inviability. For the latter, circumstantial evidence pointed to endosperm proliferation defects being responsible for embryo arrest at early globular stages. The reciprocal C×A and A×C hybrid crosses yielded intermediate levels of viable seeds, from which we grew an F1 hybrid cohort showing some developmental abnormalities, interpreted as reflecting post-germination genetic incompatibilities. Chapter 2 focuses on seeds from intraspecific crosses, i.e. those with normal seed development. My hypothesis was that genomic imprinting in the endosperm of normally developing seeds serves specific functions and is nonrandomly shared between recently diverged species. I found that the degree of overlap among imprinted genes across the three wild tomato lineages was significant, and higher for Paternally Expressed Genes (PEGs) than for Maternally Expressed Genes (MEGs). However, variation in imprinting status for many genes is suggestive of an evolutionarily fast turnover of imprinted expression. MEGs and PEGs appear to be associated with distinct functions, but I found evidence that they interact in functional and physical networks. In particular, I inferred that interactions between imprinted genes contribute to cell-cycle control. Candidate imprinted genes identified in this chapter should be representative of the typical imprinting landscape of wild tomato viable endosperm; they were used as a reference to compare parent-specific gene expression in within-lineage- and hybrid endosperms in Chapter 3. Chapter 3 aimed at testing the hypothesis that hybrid seed failure involves imprinting perturbation and/or large gene expression changes in wild tomato hybrid endosperms. When compared to intraspecific endosperms, those from strongly abortive crosses were characterized by extensive gene expression perturbation together with increased maternal expression proportions. Two homogeneous groups of hybrid endosperms were separated by the largest expression differences in the whole dataset, congruent with either maternal-excess-like (P×A and P×C) or paternal-excess-like (A×P and C×P) endosperms at the phenotypic level. I found strong evidence for perturbations of parental dosage mechanisms in these abortive endosperms, particularly the widespread loss of imprinting status of candidate PEGs. Crosses yielding only partial seed abortion (A×C and C×A) had far fewer expression changes than strongly abortive endosperms and also retained the imprinted status of most candidate PEGs. I discuss the potential roles of parental conflict and coadaptation in driving expression perturbation in abortive endosperm. Finally, I hypothesize that different ‘genetic strengths’ evolved since lineage divergence and identify candidate genes, such as AGAMOUS-LIKE transcriptions factors, that may underlie this dosage-related phenomenon. Such genes may significantly contribute to postzygotic reproductive isolation between wild tomato lineages. By revealing the widespread perturbation of imprinted expression in abortive hybrid endosperms, my project accrued molecular evidence for the fundamental role of parental dosage in successful seed development. As a collateral resource, it also provides a large number of candidate genes that are potentially useful for developmental and evolutionary biology and for plant breeding.","application/PDF","10.3929/ethz-b-000246855",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/246855","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Wild tomatoes||hybrid||endosperm||transcriptomics||seed||genomic imprinting||parental conflict","Variability of Hybrid Seed Failure in Wild Tomatoes (Solanum sect.

The weed has morphological similarities to a wild relative of maize and has generally been referred to as teosinte. However, the identity, origin or genetic composition of ‘Spanish teosinte’ was unknown. Here, we present a genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for Spanish teosinte, sympatric populations of cultivated maize and samples of reference teosinte taxa. Our data are complemented with previously published SNP datasets of cultivated maize and two Mexican teosinte subspecies. Our analyses reveal that Spanish teosinte does not group with any of the currently recognized teosinte taxa. Based on Bayesian clustering analysis and hybridization simulations, we infer that Spanish teosinte is of admixed origin, most likely involving Zea mays ssp. mexicana as one parental taxon, and an unidentified cultivated maize variety as the other. Analyses of plants grown from seeds collected in Spanish maize fields and experimental crosses under controlled conditions reveal that hybridization does occur between Spanish teosinte and cultivated maize in Spain, and that current hybridization is asymmetric, favouring the introgression of Spanish teosinte into cultivated maize, rather than vice versa.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000192716",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-017-01478-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/192716","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Teosinte in Europe - Searching for the Origin of a Novel Weed","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T05:28:04Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85019158590",,,"Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Extending earlier work of others and us, we present a mathematical model capturing treatment strategies using two drugs, i.e the multi-drug therapies referred to as cycling, mixing, and combination therapy, as well as monotherapy with either drug. We randomly sample a large parameter space to determine the conditions determining success or failure of these strategies. We find that combination therapy tends to outperform the other treatment strategies. By using linear discriminant analysis and particle swarm optimization, we find that the most important parameters determining success or failure of combination therapy relative to the other treatment strategies are the de novo rate of emergence of double resistance in patients infected with sensitive bacteria and the fitness costs associated with double resistance. The rate at which double resistance is imported into the hospital via patients admitted from the outside community has little influence, as all treatment strategies are affected equally. The parameter sets for which combination therapy fails tend to fall into areas with low biological plausibility as they are characterised by very high rates of de novo emergence of resistance to both drugs compared to a single drug, and the cost of double resistance is considerably smaller than the sum of the costs of single resistance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000197708",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005745","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/197708","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Modeling antibiotic treatment in hospitals: A systematic approach shows benefits of combination therapy over cycling, mixing, and mono-drug therapies","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-19T02:09:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85030457044",,"000411981000034","PLOS comput. biol.","9","PLoS Computational Biology","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although bacteria have become model organisms to study social dilemmas in laboratory systems, we know little about their relevance in natural communities. Here, we show that social interactions mediated by a single shareable compound necessary for growth (the iron-scavenging pyoverdine) have important consequences for competitive dynamics in soil and pond communities of Pseudomonas bacteria. We find that pyoverdine non- and low-producers co-occur in many natural communities. While non-producers have genes coding for multiple pyoverdine receptors and are able to exploit compatible heterologous pyoverdines from other community members, producers differ in the pyoverdine types they secrete, offering protection against exploitation from non-producers with incompatible receptors. Our findings indicate that there is both selection for cheating and cheating resistance, which could drive antagonistic co-evolution and diversification in natural bacterial communities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000236935",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-017-00509-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/236935","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Siderophore cheating and cheating resistance shape competition for iron in soil and freshwater Pseudomonas communities","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-30T10:57:18Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The experimental methods to label and track cells over time range from fluorescent dyes over congenic markers towards single-cell labelling techniques, such as genetic barcodes. While these methods have been widely used to quantify cell differentiation and division dynamics, the extent to which the applied labelling strategy actually affects the quantification of the dynamics has not been determined so far. This is especially important in situations where measurements can only be obtained at a single time point, as e.g. due to organ harvest. To this end, we studied the appropriateness of various labelling strategies as characterised by the number of different labels and the initial number of cells per label to quantify cellular dynamics. We simulated adoptive transfer experiments in systems of various complexity that assumed either homoeostatic cellular turnover or cell expansion dynamics involving various steps of cell differentiation and proliferation. Re-sampling cells at a single time point, we determined the ability of different labelling strategies to recover the underlying kinetics. Our results indicate that cell transition and expansion rates are differently affected by experimental shortcomings, such as loss of cells during transfer or sampling, dependent on the labelling strategy used. Furthermore, uniformly distributed labels in the transferred population generally lead to more robust and less biased results than non-equal label sizes. In addition, our analysis indicates that certain labelling approaches incorporate a systematic bias for the identification of complex cell expansion dynamics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000201965",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0185523","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/201965","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"More or less - On the influence of labelling strategies to infer cell population dynamics","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-28T02:40:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85031756748",,"000413168100019","PLoS ONE","10","PLoS ONE","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, we have limited understanding of how covert infections persist and vary in bryozoan populations over time and space and how they may impact these populations. In addition, previous studies have likely underestimated covert infection prevalence. To improve our understanding of the dynamics, impacts and implications of covert infections we employed a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and undertook the first investigation of covert infections in the field over an annual period by sampling bryozoans every 45 days from three populations within each of three rivers.  Results Covert infections persisted throughout the year and prevalence varied within and between rivers, but were often > 50%. Variation in temperature and water chemistry were linked with changes in prevalence in a manner consistent with the maintenance of covert infections during periods of low productivity and thus poor growth conditions for both bryozoans and T. bryosalmonae. The presence and increased severity of covert infections reduced host growth but only when bryozoans were also investing in the production of overwintering propagules (statoblasts). However, because statoblast production is transitory, this effect is unlikely to greatly impact the capacity of bryozoan populations to act as persistent sources of infections and hence potential disease outbreaks in farmed and wild fish populations.  Conclusions We demonstrate that covert infections are widespread and persist over space and time in bryozoan populations. To our knowledge, this is the first long-term study of covert infections in a field setting. Review of the results of this and previous studies enables us to identify key questions related to the ecology and evolution of covert infection strategies and associated host-parasite interactions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000207205",,"1756-3305","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/207205||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/233110","10.1186/s13071-017-2495-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/260102","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae||Fredericella sultana||Proliferative kidney disease||Myxozoans||Bryozoans||Productivity||Temperature||Host condition-dependent effects||Covert infection strategies||Fish disease reservoirs","Persistence, impacts and environmental drivers of covert infections in invertebrate hosts","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-11-12T04:07:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85032725680",,"000414331300001","Parasit. vectors","1","Parasites & Vectors","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although some individual lakes are well studied, less knowledge is available on large-scale patterns essential to general understanding of their functioning. Here, we aimed to describe crustacean zooplankton communities (Cladocera, Copepoda) and identify their environmental drivers in the pelagic zone of 54 oligotrophic lakes in the montane region of the Alps (400–1200 m) in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, covering a spatial scale of 650 km. Moreover, we aimed to provide data on the distribution and ecological requirements of the North American invader Bythotrephes longimanus in its Central European native range. Communities were mainly dominated by widespread species typical of lowland habitats, and only a few true specialists of oligotrophic alpine lakes were present. The most frequent taxa were the Daphnia longispina complex and Eudiaptomus gracilis, with 48 and 45 occurrences, respectively. Species richness decreased with altitude and increased with lake area. The main structuring factors of community composition were chlorophyll a concentration and depth, which drove an apparent separation of mesotrophic and oligotrophic communities. Bythotrephes had 13 occurrences, showing a preference for deep oligotrophic lakes. Its presence was not coupled with lower crustacean species richness, as was repeatedly observed in North America. Additionally, it frequently co-occurred with the other large predatory cladoceran, Leptodora kindtii. B. longimanus might be considered a truly montane species in Central Europe, given its absence in lowland and alpine lakes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000230788",,"2044-205X||2044-2041",,"10.1080/20442041.2017.1294317","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/230788","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Alps||Bythotrephes||elevation||montane||oligotrophic||zooplankton","Zooplankton communities and Bythotrephes longimanus in lakes of the montane region of the northern Alps","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-18T13:00:13Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","Inland Waters","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Point-of-care (POC) tests that detect resistance promise individually tailored treatment, but might lead to more treatment and higher levels of resistance. We investigate the impact of POC tests on antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea.  Methods We used data about the prevalence and incidence of gonorrhoea in men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexual men and women (HMW) to calibrate a mathematical gonorrhoea transmission model. With this model, we simulated four clinical pathways for the diagnosis and treatment of gonorrhoea: POC test with (POC+R) and without (POC−R) resistance detection, culture and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). We calculated the proportion of resistant infections and cases averted after 5 years, and compared how fast resistant infections spread in the populations.  Results The proportion of resistant infections after 30 years is lowest for POC+R (median MSM: 0.18%, HMW: 0.12%), and increases for culture (MSM: 1.19%, HMW: 0.13%), NAAT (MSM: 100%, HMW: 99.27%), and POC−R (MSM: 100%, HMW: 99.73%). Per 100 000 persons, NAAT leads to 36 366 (median MSM) and 1228 (median HMW) observed cases after 5 years. Compared with NAAT, POC+R averts more cases after 5 years (median MSM: 3353, HMW: 118). POC tests that detect resistance with intermediate sensitivity slow down resistance spread more than NAAT. POC tests with very high sensitivity for the detection of resistance are needed to slow down resistance spread more than by using culture.  Conclusions POC with high sensitivity to detect antibiotic resistance can keep gonorrhoea treatable longer than culture or NAAT. POC tests without reliable resistance detection should not be introduced because they can accelerate the spread of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190471",,"1741-7015",,"10.1186/s12916-017-0881-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190471","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Epidemiology||Mathematical model||Gonorrhoea||Sexually transmitted infection||Bacterial drug resistance||Point-of-care testing","Detection of antibiotic resistance is essential for gonorrhoea point-of-care testing: a mathematical modelling study","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:06:50Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85026289108",,"000406313100001","BMC med.",,"BMC Medicine","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To address this question, we exposed Escherichia coli K12 MG1655, in combination with three lytic phages, to various substances that natural and clinical microbial populations are likely to encounter: bile salts (present in mammalian gastrointestinal tracts), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, a common surfactant in cleaning and hygiene products) and four antibiotics (present at variable concentrations in natural and clinical environments). Our results show that bile salts and SDS can reduce the detrimental effect of phages on bacterial growth. In some cases these compounds completely mitigated any negative effects of phages on bacterial growth and consequently bacteria did not evolve resistance to phages in these conditions. The proportional effects of phages were unaffected by antibiotics in most combinations, excepting three cases of phage-drug synergy. These results suggest that accounting for interactions between phages and environmental factors such as surfactants and antibiotics will improve understanding of both bacterial growth and resistance evolution to phages in vivo and in nature.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000127563",,"0168-6496||1574-6941",,"10.1093/femsec/fiw211","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/127563","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bacteriophage||Antibiotics||Bile salts||Escherichia coli||Phage therapy||Genotype-by-environment interaction","Modification of Escherichia coli-bacteriophage interactions by surfactants and antibiotics in vitro","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T19:22:14Z",,"pub:190419",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365531b4a9668565","000887946",,,"85026313679",,"000397429600010","FEMS microbiol. ecol.","1","FEMS Microbiology Ecology","93","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modeling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first 3 months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation > 90%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods’ development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000126058",,"0737-4038||1537-1719",,"10.1093/molbev/msw217","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/126058","en","Oxford University Press","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","HIV transmission and prevention||Molecular epidemiology of infectious diseases||Viral phylogenetic methods validation","Phylogenetic Tools for Generalized HIV-1 Epidemics: Findings from the PANGEA-HIV Methods Comparison","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T18:22:07Z",,"pub:188728",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936551a1e9e128651","000025306",,,"85014945562",,"000396511400007","Mol Biol Evol","1","Molecular Biology and Evolution","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This approach allows us to quantify the amount of migration between the bone marrow niches and the peripheral blood. We use this model to investigate clonal hematopoiesis, which is a significant risk factor for hematologic cancers. We also analyse the engraftment of donor stem cells into non-conditioned and conditioned hosts, quantifying the impact of different treatment scenarios. The simplicity of the model permits a thorough mathematical analysis, providing deeper insights into the dynamics of both the model and of the real-world system. We predict the time taken for mutant clones to expand within a host, as well as chimerism levels that can be expected following transplantation therapy, and the probability that a preconditioned host is reconstituted by donor cells.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000205790",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005803","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/205790","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Clonal dominance and transplantation dynamics in hematopoietic stem cell compartments","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-11-08T04:35:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85032452098",,"000414148800051","PLOS comput. biol.","10","PLoS Computational Biology","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These interactions have a strong influence on habitat composition, ecosystem processes and community composition. Nowadays, flow and sediment regimes are highly altered due to anthropogenic modifications of rivers and floodplains, such as dams or river channelization, which disrupt the main properties of both regimes.  The primary goal of this thesis was to understand the role of flow and sediment interactions on ecosystem structure and function in managed rivers and evaluate different techniques that mitigate the impact of rivers regulation. Hyporheic sediment respiration, periphyton biomass and chlorophyll-a were used as indicators of ecosystem function, whereas macroinvertebrates assemblages were used as a structural indicator.  The first chapter studied the variability of different indicators of ecosystem structure and function under different flow and geomorphology conditions. The study took place in a section of the river Thur, where a widening restoration was implemented by removing 1 km of lateral protections. This widening section characterized by newly established habitats such as gravel bars is fringed upstream and downstream by channelized sections. Channelized sites showed higher rates of sediment respiration, periphyton and macroinvertebrates compared to restored sites. Restored sites showed a greater temporal and spatial variability in the measured indicators due to the influence of flow disturbance, which was lower in channelized sites. Overall, sediment respiration and macroinvertebrate richness were related to flow variability and geomorphology, whereas periphyton and macroinvertebrate density was influenced mainly by flow variability. 	  The second chapter investigated the influence of flow regulation (residual flows and hydropeaking) on aquatic life stages that can persist in sediments during dry phases (i.e. macroinvertebrate seedbanks). Gravel bars affected by hydropeaking showed greater densities of organisms due to the high frequency of inundations, which increased the drift of animals onto gravel bars. The opposite trend was found in residual flow rivers, where there is a lack of flood occurrence.   The third chapter assessed the ecological impact of a Sediment Bypass Tunnel, a structure that routes upstream sediment input around dams, reducing the accumulation of sediments in the dam. Operations of the tunnel create a general decrease in measured indicators (sediment respiration, periphyton and macroinvertebrates), the decrease being related to the magnitude of flow and sediment released at the tunnel.   The fourth chapter described the interactions of flow and sediment inputs in two rivers with contrasting management programs (experimental floods and sediment bypass tunnel). Sediment lateral inputs caused local interactions with flow, generating morphological and biotic heterogeneity in the streambed, whereas upstream sediment inputs together with high flows by sediment bypass tunnel created a general decrease in biotic indicators in the system, reducing spatial variability.  The results from this thesis showed that each of the measured ecosystem properties is influenced in a specific way by flow-sediment interactions. The results indicated that different techniques can be used to mitigate the negative consequences of flow and sediment regime alterations on ecosystem functioning and structure, highlighting the important role of integrative objectives in river management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000000140",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/140","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Flow regime||Sediment regime||Macroinvertebrates||Reservoirs||Enviromental Impact||Sediment Respiration||Sediment Bypass Tunnel","Flow Sediment Interactions in Managed Rivers: Influence on Ecosystem Structure and Function","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::624 - Civil engineering","2017-05-25T08:57:48Z","2018-05-26",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24007",,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Their mode of action is thought to be to create pores that disrupt the gut epithelial membranes of juvenile insects. These pores allow pathogen entry into the hemocoel, thereby killing the insect. Genes encoding a spectrum of Cry toxins, including Cry mutants, Cry chimaeras and other Cry derivatives, are used commercially to enhance insect resistance in genetically modified (GM) crops. In most countries of the world, such GM crops are regulated and must be assessed for human and environmental safety. However, such risk assessments often do not test the GM crop or its tissues directly. Instead, assessments rely primarily on historical information from naturally occurring Cry proteins and on data collected on Cry proteins (called ‘surrogates’) purified from laboratory strains of bacteria engineered to express Cry protein. However, neither surrogates nor naturally occurring Cry proteins are identical to the proteins to which humans or other nontarget organisms are exposed by the production and consumption of GM plants. To-date there has been no systematic survey of these differences. This review fills this knowledge gap with respect to the most commonly grown GM Cry-containing crops approved for international use. Having described the specific differences between natural, surrogate and GM Cry proteins this review assesses these differences for their potential to undermine the reliability of risk assessments. Lastly, we make specific recommendations for improving risk assessments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000215951",,"0264-8725||2046-5556",,"10.1080/02648725.2017.1357295","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/215951","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cry toxin||risk assessment||GM||Bacillus thuringiensis||insecticide||crops","The distinct properties of natural and GM cry insecticidal proteins","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-11-30T15:37:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biotechnol. genet. eng. rev.",,"Biotechnology & Genetic Engineering Reviews","33","::ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The specific mode of reproduction profoundly impacts almost all aspects of biology, ranging from the genetic makeup of organisms to their physiology, morphology, behavior, life history and eventually evolution. Understanding variation among individuals in their ability to reproduce has therefore been a central theme in evolutionary biology for a long time.  Of particular interest are organisms that are not restricted to a single mode of reproduction, as their study facilitates comparisons between different reproductive strategies. The freshwater snail Radix balthica is simultaneously hermaphroditic and additionally able to reproduce through self-fertilization (hereafter selfing). In my Ph.D. project, I characterized the mating system in a single natural population of this snail by (I) estimating the rate of selfing and (II) the frequency of multiple paternity in field-collected egg clutches, (III) measuring the fitness consequences of individual reproductive strategies in the laboratory, and (IV) quantifying inbreeding depression in two natural environments. In collaboration with engineers, I also developed an automatic high throughput method to measure living snails from digital images (V). I found that the study population had been almost exclusively outcrossing for at least several generations. From a methodological perspective, I demonstrated the importance of using both a robust method and molecular markers of sufficient statistical power when estimating selfing rates, and identified the conditions under which an indirect estimation method can safely replace a direct but more labor-intensive approach.  Next I counted the number of siring fathers among the embryos of an egg clutch for a total of 60 clutches collected in the field. Multiple paternity was present in half of all clutches, and showed a strong and surprising increase in both frequency and magnitude during the reproductive season. The evident promiscuity, coupled with the finding of a single dominant father in most clutches, suggests that sexual selection may be a strong evolutionary force in this population. Using carefully monitored mating trials in the laboratory, I then examined the relationship between individual mating behavior and lifetime reproductive success. Although all snails were given access to mating partners, I found surprisingly large variation in reproductive strategies, ranging from pure voluntary selfing over sex-role specialization to snails utilizing their full hermaphroditic potential. Even so, failing to mate as a female, thereby restricting the individual to self-fertilize its eggs, reduced female lifetime reproductive output by half. Finally, I conducted a large-scale field experiment to quantify inbreeding depression in selfed snails in juvenile survival, growth and parasite resistance in two natural habitats that greatly differed in quality. I found that selfed snails were only moderately disadvantaged as juveniles, but future studies will need to measure the cost of being selfed in adult snails. Nevertheless, it likely is the combined effect of a reduction in fecundity when selfing, inbreeding depression and potential additional factors that maintains predominant outcrossing in the study population. Altogether, this thesis presents individual-level, high-resolution data on the natural mating system of a self-compatible animal. It also identifies R. balthica as a promising model species for studying mating system evolution and sexual selection.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000185629",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/185629","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Individual-level variation in the mating system of a self-compatible hermaphrodite","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::590 - Zoological sciences","2017-09-19T08:18:02Z","2018-09-19",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24194",,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it has rarely been tested whether such estimates are useful proxies for genome-wide patterns of variation and differentiation. Here, we compared microsatellite variation with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to assess and quantify potential marker-specific biases and derive recommendations for future studies. Overall, we genotyped 180 Arabidopsis halleri individuals from nine populations using 20 microsatellite markers. Twelve of these markers were originally developed for Arabidopsis thaliana (cross-species markers) and eight for A. halleri (species-specific markers). We further characterized 2 million SNPs across the genome with a pooled whole-genome re-sequencing approach (Pool-Seq).  Results Our analyses revealed that estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation derived from cross-species and species-specific microsatellites differed substantially and that expected microsatellite heterozygosity (SSR-H e) was not significantly correlated with genome-wide SNP diversity estimates (SNP-H e and θ Watterson) in A. halleri. Instead, microsatellite allelic richness (A r) was a better proxy for genome-wide SNP diversity. Estimates of genetic differentiation among populations (F ST) based on both marker types were correlated, but microsatellite-based estimates were significantly larger than those from SNPs. Possible causes include the limited number of microsatellite markers used, marker ascertainment bias, as well as the high variance in microsatellite-derived estimates. In contrast, genome-wide SNP data provided unbiased estimates of genetic diversity independent of whether genome- or only exome-wide SNPs were used. Further, we inferred that a few thousand random SNPs are sufficient to reliably estimate genome-wide diversity and to distinguish among populations differing in genetic variation.  Conclusions We recommend that future analyses of genetic diversity within and differentiation among populations use randomly selected high-throughput sequencing-based SNP data to draw conclusions on genome-wide diversity patterns. In species comparable to A. halleri, a few thousand SNPs are sufficient to achieve this goal.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000125486",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-016-3459-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/125486","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Microsatellites||SSR||Arabidopsis halleri||Genetic diversity||Expected heterozygosity||SNPs||Population genomics||Whole-genome re-sequencing||Pool-Seq||Conservation units","Estimating genomic diversity and population differentiation – an empirical comparison of microsatellite and SNP variation in Arabidopsis halleri","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T18:07:23Z",,"pub:188090",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365510d9b3191629",,,,"85009260460",,"000391750800002","BMC Genomics",,"BMC Genomics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, little is known about the functional evolution of sRNAs in bacteria, which might occur via changes in sRNA structure and/or stability or changes in interactions between sRNAs and their associated regulatory networks, including target mRNAs. The sRNA Pxr functions as a developmental gatekeeper in the model cooperative bacterium Myxococcus xanthus. Specifically, Pxr prevents the initiation of fruiting body development when nutrients are abundant. Previous work has shown that Pxr appears to have a recent origin within a sub-clade of the myxobacteria, which allowed us to infer the most recent common ancestor of pxr and examine the divergence of Pxr since its origin.  Results  To test for inter-specific divergence in functional effects, extant pxr homologs from several species and their inferred ancestor were introduced into an M. xanthus deletion mutant lacking pxr. Both the inferred ancestral pxr and all extant alleles from species containing only one copy of pxr were found to control development in M. xanthus in a qualitatively similar manner to the native M. xanthus allele. However, multiple paralogs present in Cystobacter species exhibited divergent effects, with two paralogs controlling M. xanthus development but two others failing to do so. These differences may have occurred through changes in gene expression caused by apparent structural differences in the sRNA variants encoded by these paralogs.  Conclusions  Taken together, our results suggest that Pxr plays a common fundamental role in developmental gene regulation across diverse species of myxobacteria but also that the functional effects of some Pxr variants may be evolving in some lineages.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191344",,"1471-2148","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191344||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/233761","10.1186/s12862-017-1037-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/239518","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Small non-coding RNAs||Bacterial development||Myxobacteria||Gene duplication||Regulation of gene expression||Multicellularity","Divergence of functional effects among bacterial sRNA paralogs","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:09:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85027998727",,"000408143200003","BMC evol. biol.","1","BMC Evolutionary Biology","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
