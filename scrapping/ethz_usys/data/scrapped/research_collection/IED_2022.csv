Given the current threat of climate change, we must develop new products that not only maximise the circularity of resources but also minimise climate change impacts. While these two goals are usually aligned, trade-offs exist. For instance, recycling biobased asphalt is a better end-of-life option than landfilling from a resource efficiency perspective. However, landfilling of biogenic non-biodegradable material leads to permanent carbon storage and, therefore, climate benefits. To fully understand the potential benefits and impacts of biobased circular innovations, we need metrics to capture their complexity from both a circular and climate point of view. This study explores the use of different circularity and sustainability metrics to understand the impacts and trade-offs of lignin-based versus bitumen-based asphalts. The analysis is done by calculating the Material Circularity Index (MCI) and two newly developed indicators quantifying the biogenic carbon storage (BCS) of products (BCS100 and c-BCS) while following the CE principles. In addition, the impacts regarding climate change, life cycle costs and ECI (environmental costs indicator) are also provided. Based on the MCI, it can be concluded that lignin-based asphalt roads have slightly higher material circularity than their bitumen-based counterparts. The BCS analysis indicated that the least circular lignin-based alternative sequesters the highest amount of carbon in the long term due to permanent storage in foundations. Despite these trade-offs, the results from the newly developed BCS indicators allowed to align both climate and circularity goals, guiding policymakers and industry actors to implement circular biobased strategies where the value of biobased materials is optimised. Finally, this article discusses the use of different circularity and environmental metrics for decision making in the context of a circular biobased economy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000578523",,"0959-6526",,"10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134829","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/578523","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Circular economy||Lignin||Asphalt||Biobased||Biogenic carbon||Metrics","Metrics for minimising environmental impacts while maximising circularity in biobased products: The case of lignin-based asphalt",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-31T07:40:13Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85140808394",,"000880808900006","J Cleaner Prod.","Part 2","Journal of Cleaner Production","379","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Models that consider intra-particle porosity do not adequately describe the overall mass transfer, especially when the porosity values are low. For such cases, it is common to employ models based on solid matrix diffusivity. However, such models do not describe the non-linear solute concentration profiles commonly encountered in the liquid loading zone of extractors. A new mathematical model based on a control volume that moves along with the liquid phase is proposed to describe the solute concentration within the particle and liquid phases. Such an approach also enables calculation of the transient and local solute concentrations in the loading zone. The model parameter sets were fitted to the experimental results from the porous systems (soybean layer). The global mean deviation (11.6%) between the model and experimental results demonstrates that the proposed model is consistent and can be used to simulate solid-liquid extraction operations for porous and low-porosity solids.",,,,"0260-8774||1873-5770",,"10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2022.111154","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/592679","en","Elsevier",,,"Computational simulation||Mathematical modelling||Particle porosity||Loading zone||Mass transfer","Implementation of the moving control volume and filling front concepts in modelling solid-liquid extraction of vegetable oil from porous and non-porous solids in a fixed bed",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2023-01-16T12:45:02Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"J. food eng.",,"Journal of Food Engineering","334","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A meta-heuristic framework has been developed to find the optimal quota regime for the national or worldwide aviation industry. The minimization of ticket prices and CO2 emissions are considered to be objective functions. The results of the current study indicate that implementing optimized quotas is more effective than intensive tax regimes. To elaborate, much more important than the value of the carbon price is the shape (convexity or concavity) of the tax regime. The optimal tax regime shape is also obtained. Based on the optimal quota and tax regime, the concept of golden time and value is introduced. In the golden time window, investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) will be the most cost-effective. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that neither the sole introduction of quotas nor the imposition of high carbon taxes are beneficial from an economic and decarbonization standpoint. Thus, an optimized quota regime should be employed. These quotas should be introduced as soon as possible, and their implementation should be combined with political efforts to introduce a carbon tax and policies supporting the development of an alternative jet fuel industry.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000575680",,"0301-4215",,"10.1016/j.enpol.2022.113263","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575680","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Sustainable aviation fuels||Metaheuristic optimization||Tax||Quota","Novel quota and tax regime design approach for green transition: A case study on Switzerland's aviation industry",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-13T03:08:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85139070173",,"000868976300002","Energy Policy",,"Energy Policy","171","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recent studies have mainly focused on technical challenges, performance or on the attitudes of the public towards EEW systems in countries where EEW systems are already in operation or where damaging earthquakes are frequent. Building on these efforts, from the societal perspective we assess how different message elements influence the intention to take action and ability to grasp relevant information within a few seconds. Further, we explore the public attitudes towards EEW systems in a country where damaging earthquakes are expected less frequently. In a survey (N = 596, between-subjects experiment) targeting the Swiss public, we assess EEW system preferences and test different versions of EEW messages to identify elements which trigger people to take immediate actions and can be correctly recalled. Our main findings are that i) the public attitudes in countries with moderate seismic hazard are similar to attitudes in countries with high seismic hazard; ii) pictograms trigger people to protect themselves on the spot whereas maps prompt the public to look for further information or to warn others; iii) the designs preferred by the public are not always those that actually trigger them to take action; and iv) people tend to react proportionally to the hazard level. We show that insights from studies focusing on societal issues related to EEW systems can help operators define technical settings and to address specific concerns or likely misconceptions in education campaigns.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000582240",,"2212-4209",,"10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.103441","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/582240","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Earthquake early warning||Public reaction||Message design||System preferences||Information recall","Earthquake early warning in countries where damaging earthquakes only occur every 50 to 150 years – The societal perspective",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-22T04:08:12Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Real-time Earthquake Risk Reduction for Europe","821115","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,"85141814249",,"000892342100003",,,"International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","83","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00003 - Schulleitung und Dienste::00022 - Bereich VP Forschung / Domain VP Research::02818 - Schweiz.

It has not yet been investigated which allocation schemes are preferred by medical laypeople in a particular situation of medical scarcity like an emerging infectious disease and how the choices are affected by providing information about expected population-level effects of the allocation scheme based on modelling studies. We investigated the potential benefit of strategic communication of infectious disease modelling results.  Methods In a two-way factorial experiment (n = 878 participants), we investigated if prognosis of the disease or information about expected effects on mortality at population-level (based on dynamic infectious disease modelling studies) influenced the choice of preferred allocation schemes for prevention and treatment of an unspecified sexually transmitted infection. A qualitative analysis of the reasons for choosing specific allocation schemes supplements our results.  Results Presence of the factor “information about the population-level effects of the allocation scheme” substantially increased the probability of choosing a resource allocation system that minimized overall harm among the population, while prognosis did not affect allocation choices. The main reasons for choosing an allocation scheme differed among schemes, but did not differ among those who received additional model-based information on expected population-level effects and those who did not.  Conclusions Providing information on the expected population-level effects from dynamic infectious disease modelling studies resulted in a substantially different choice of allocation schemes. This finding supports the importance of incorporating model-based information in decision-making processes and communication strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000540640",,"1471-2458",,"10.1186/s12889-022-13000-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/540640","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Allocation strategies||Factorial design||STI","Providing laypeople with results from dynamic infectious disease modelling studies affects their allocation preference for scarce medical resources – a factorial experiment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-03T03:14:05Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85126842382",,"000772425600007","BMC public health","1","BMC Public Health","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, there is limited evidence to inform the design of policies. We scrutinized an agricultural development program that follows a holistic approach and includes the cultivation of fruit trees, to tackle this natural resource degradation and human vulnerability nexus. Can it transform so-called wastelands and lift marginalized smallholders out of poverty? The geographic rollout of the program produced a natural experiment that allowed for an evaluation design with treatment and control groups and a survey of 2000 households randomly sampled from 188,231 participants in four Indian states, covering geographically diverse areas. This is the first time that the livelihood impacts of such farming systems have been analyzed on such a large scale and over a 23-year period. Our results show that degraded farmland can be transformed into green assets if poverty alleviation and environmental regeneration are tackled in a holistic manner. We find a clear and significant trend in the improvement of socio-economic factors, including higher income and positive life changes, as well as ecological benefits. By assessing the potential of trees to reverse environmental degradation and alleviate chronic poverty, this study provides much-needed evidence for the science-policy dialog of development programs.

However, there is an important disconnect between the way these terms are defined and used in the academic literature and the way they are defined and used in the policy literature. Academic writing on interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity offers plural understandings of both terms, whereas policy documents argue for concrete and simplified definitions. In this paper, we analyse the implications of these differences for research and funding. On the basis of an extensive literature review, we argue that the heterogeneity of understandings in interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity constitutes an asset. We advocate for the plurality of understandings to be used constructively in order to strengthen and promote effective research and research funding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000556475",,"0302-3427||1471-5430",,"10.1093/scipol/scac034","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/556475","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","transdisciplinary research||interdisciplinary research||science policy||academic literature||policy literature","Embracing heterogeneity: Why plural understandings strengthen interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-06T08:52:28Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Shaping Interdisciplinary Practices in Europe","822705","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"000818063200001","Sci public policy","6","Science and Public Policy","49","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

After decades of obstruction, Germany recently launched a new, participatory, site-selection process for the disposal of HLW in deep geological formations. Nonetheless, significant opposition is assumed. Therefore, citizens’ trust in the procedure and the agents involved may be paramount. We conducted an online survey (N ≈ 5000) in March/April 2020 to test a theoretical model on trust, perceived risks and benefits, and acceptance. We differentiated acceptance as a dependent variable according to distinct phases: the procedure, a possible decision on a disposal location, and the repository facility itself. The results show that trust is mainly important for explaining acceptance of the ongoing procedure and less so for the acceptance of the decision or the repository facility itself. Moreover, our investigation of the sample using a cluster analysis reveals characteristic patterns of trust, risk perception, and acceptance by three clusters: a cluster focusing on risk perception, an ambivalent cluster, and an indifferent cluster. Trust is lowest in the risk-focused cluster and highest in the ambivalent cluster.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000530888",,"0272-4332||1539-6924",,"10.1111/risa.13889","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/530888","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","acceptance||nuclear waste repository||procedure||risk perception||trust","The role of trust and risk perception in current German nuclear waste management",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-02-05T14:06:45Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85123842604",,"000748300300001","Risk Anal.","12","Risk Analysis","42","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we provide self-consistent, high spatial resolution relative local land subsidence (RLLS) velocities derived from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar for the 48 largest coastal cities, which represent 20% of the global urban population. We show that cities experiencing the fastest RLLS are concentrated in Asia. RLLS is also more variable across the 48 cities (−16.2 to 1.1 mm per year) than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimations of vertical land motion (−5.2 to 4.9 mm per year). With our standardized method, the identification of relative vulnerabilities to RLLS and comparisons of RSLR effects accounting for RLLS are now possible across cities worldwide.

Economic growth is one reason for this: its impacts can lead to deforestation and put tremendous harvesting pressure on forests. In light of increasingly popular – and growth-based – bio - economy strategies, the need for more wood is likely to accelerate. Degrowth, in contrast, rejects economic growth as the central economic principle, argu - ing that the material throughput of countries in the Global North must shrink to achieve global sustainability. Although the concept has gained importance, there have been no attempts to link degrowth with the forest sector. This arti - cle argues that degrowth principles are beneficial for basing the forest sector on sustainable grounds, while the degrowth movement also needs to define its relationship to the forest. Against this backdrop, this contribution sets the cor- nerstone by linking the Swiss forest sector to central degrowth principles, and discussing possible interrelations and mismatches.

We then show how ML-based inference techniques deliver more reliable estimates of the causal impact of electrification than traditional alternatives when applied to these data. We estimate that grid access improves village-level asset wealth in rural Uganda by up to 0.15 standard deviations, more than doubling the growth rate during our study period relative to untreated areas.

Spatio-temporal predictions of electric load become increasingly important for planning this transition, while deep learning prediction models provide increasingly accurate predictions for it. The data that are used for training deep learning models, however, are usually collected at random using a passive learning approach. This naturally results in a large demand for data and associated costs for sensors such as smart meters, posing a large barrier for electric utilities when decarbonizing their grids. Here we investigate whether electric utilities can use active learning to collect a more informative subset of data by leveraging additional computation for better distributing smart meters. We predict ground-truth electric load profiles for single buildings using only remotely sensed data from aerial imagery of these buildings and meteorological conditions in the area of these buildings at different times.

Corporate zero-deforestation supply chain commitments (ZDCs) have the potential to address this deforestation, especially if strong state-led forest governance is absent. Yet, because ZDC adoption is limited to particular locations and supply chains, these commitments may fall short at reducing regional deforestation and protecting biodiverse ecosystems. Here, we leverage timeseries of spatially explicit corporate commodity sourcing data and ZDCs to assess the current and potential effect of ZDCs within soybean supply chains on forest loss and biodiversity. We focus on the Brazilian Amazon, where the first ZDC (soy moratorium (SoyM)) was implemented, and the Cerrado, where companies have adopted but not implemented ZDCs. We found that in the Amazon, SoyM signatories that controlled the market caused a 57% reduction in direct deforestation for soy from 2006 to 2015. In the Cerrado, if companies had implemented their ZDCs with the same relative effectiveness as in the Amazon, deforestation for soy could have been reduced by 46%. Thus, ZDC implementation in the Cerrado via stringent monitoring and enforcement could contribute substantially to forest and habitat conservation. Yet, incomplete ZDC adoption leaves >50% of soy-suitable forests and the biodiversity that they harbor outside the reach of ZDCs. To protect these forests, it is vital to incentivize more companies-including smaller, less publicly exposed traders-to make and implement ZDCs, while also promoting forest governance through public policy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000580560",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ac97f6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580560","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","governance||soy moratorium||deforestation||conservation||sustainability","Gaps in adoption and implementation limit the current and potential effectiveness of zero-deforestation supply chain policies for soy",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-10T13:51:32Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85141806127",,"000875451900001","Environ.

In response, van den Bergh and Savin (2021) criticised our review in an article in this journal, claiming that it is ""unfair"", incomplete and flawed in various ways. Here, we respond to this critique by elaborating on the conceptual roots of our argumentation based on the importance of short-term emission reductions and longer-term technological change, and by expanding the review. This verifies our original findings: existing carbon pricing schemes have sometimes reduced emissions, mainly through switching to lower-carbon fossil fuels and efficiency increases, and have triggered weak innovation increases. There is no evidence that carbon pricing systems have triggered zero-carbon investments, and scarce but consistent evidence that they have not. Our findings highlight the importance of adapting and improving climate policy assessment metrics beyond short-term emissions by also assessing the quality of emission reductions and the progress of underlying technological change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000562722",,"0924-6460||1573-1502",,"10.1007/s10640-022-00708-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/562722","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Carbon pricing||Climate policy||Decarbonisation||Technological change||Energy transition","On the quality of emission reductions: observed effects of carbon pricing on investments, innovation, and operational shifts.

In medium farms, antimicrobials are prescribed by a veterinarian, whereas in small farms antimicrobial use remains largely unsupervised. The impact of these differences as well as other farming practices on the emergence and composition of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) remains largely unknown. We analyzed 363 genomes of extended-spectrum ß-lactamase producing (ESBL) and/or AmpC producing Escherichia coli recovered from humans and pigs at small and medium farms from the Khon Kaen province, Thailand. We tested for genome-wide associations to identify links between ARGs, host, and farm size. Pig isolates from small farms were associated with mcr and qnr genes conferring resistance to colistin and fluoroquinolones, respectively. In contrast, pig isolates from medium farms were associated with ARGs conferring resistance to drugs commonly used on medium farms (i.e., streptomycin). ESBL plasmids from small farms co-carried ARGs conferring resistance to critically important antimicrobials more frequently compared to plasmid from medium farms. Frequent ARG combinations included blaCTX-M-55 + qnrS1 (29.8% vs 17.5% in small and medium farms, respectively), blaCTX-M-55 + qnrS1 + mcr-3.19 (5% vs 0%), blaCTX-M-14 + qnrS1 (9.3% vs 6.2%), and blaCTX-M-14 + qnrS1 + mcr-1.1 (3.1% vs 0%). The co-location on plasmids of ARGs conferring resistance to critically important antimicrobials as defined by the World Health Organization is concerning, and actions to curb their spread are urgently needed. Legislation on limiting antimicrobial sales and initiatives to better inform farmers and veterinarians on appropriate antimicrobial usage and farm biosecurity could help reduce antimicrobial use on farms.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000578400",,"1471-2180",,"10.1186/s12866-022-02646-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/578400","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Antimicrobial resistance||Pig||Farms||Antimicrobial use||Escherichia coli||ESBL","Genome-associations of extended-spectrum ß-lactamase producing (ESBL) or AmpC producing E. coli in small and medium pig farms from Khon Kaen province, Thailand",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-29T05:40:34Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Piloting on-site interventions for reducing antimicrobial use in livestock farming in emerging economies","180179","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","ERA-NET + EJP",,"85140229537",,"000870738600001","BMC microbiol.

Hence, a circular bioeconomy (CBE) model that ensures more conservative use of resources has become essential. Specifically, a CBE model that focuses on recycling and reusing organic waste is essential to close nutrient loops and establish more resilient rural-urban nexus food systems. However, the CBE status quo in many African food systems is not established. Moreover, scientific evidence on CBE in Africa is almost inexistent, thus limiting policy guidance to achieving circular food systems. Using a sample of about 2,100 farmers and consumers from key food value chains (cassava in Rwanda, coffee in DRC, and bananas in Ethiopia), we explored existing CBE practices; awareness, knowledge, and support for CBE practices; consumers’ opinions on eating foods grown on processed organic waste (CBE fertilizers), and determinants of such opinions. We analysed data in Stata, first descriptively, and then econometrically using the ordered logistic regression, whose proportional odds assumption was violated, thus resorting to the generalized ordered logistic regression. Results show that communities practice aspects of CBE, mainly composting, and are broadly aware, knowledgeable, supportive of CBE practices, and would broadly accept eating foods grown CBE fertilizers. Households with heads that used mobile phones, or whose heads were older, or married, or had a better education and agricultural incomes were more likely to strongly agree that they were knowledgeable and supportive of CBE practices and would eat CBE foods (foods grown on processed organic waste). However, the reverse was true for households that were severely food insecure or lived farther from towns. Rwandan and Ethiopian households compared to DRC were less likely to eat CB foods. Policies to stimulate CBE investments in all three countries were largely absent, and quality scientific evidence to guide their development and implementation is currently insufficient.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000579621",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0276319","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/579621","en","PLOS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Circular bioeconomy in African food systems: What is the status quo?

This study performs the intercomparison of four different global-scale synthetic TC datasets in the impact space, comparing impact return period curves, probability of rare events, and hazard intensity distribution over land. We find that the model choice influences the costliest events, particularly in basins with limited TC activity.

Um die Triebkräfte zu verstehen, welche das Gewässermanagement prägen, und den Grad der Policy-Integration zu bestimmen, welcher Aufschluss darüber geben soll, wie gut die Wasserwirtschaftsinteressen aufeinander abgestimmt sind, führen wir eine Fallstudie im Alptal im Kanton Schwyz durch. Anhand einer historischen Analyse von Archivdokumenten über das Gewässermanagement im Alptal und einer Policy-Integrationsanalyse der Gesetzestexte im Kanton Schwyz der Jahre 1848-2021 beantworten wir folgende Forschungsfrage:   Was sind die Triebkräfte im Alptal, die dazu führten, dass die Alp und ihre Zuflüsse so bewirtschaftet werden wie heute und wie integriert sind die drei Interessen der Wasserwirtschaft „Wasser nutzen“, „Schutz vor Wasser“ und „Schutz des Wassers“?   Wir stellen fest, dass der Grad der Policy-Integration im Kanton Schwyz über die Zeit so weit zugenommen hat, dass man von einer integrierten Wasserwirtschaft sprechen kann. Diese berücksichtigt die Interessen «Wasser nutzen», «Schutz vor Wasser» und «Schutz des Wassers» und versucht sie aufeinander abzustimmen. Die Triebkräfte des Gewässermanagements im Alptal haben sich über die Zeit verändert. Bestimmten früher vorwiegend lokale Triebkräfte wie Naturereignisse den Umgang mit den Gewässern, so nahm der Einfluss von Vorgaben seitens Kanton und Bund immer mehr zu. Dadurch nimmt die integrierte Wasserwirtschaft des Kantons inzwischen so weit Einfluss auf das Alptal, dass bestehende Strukturen wie die der Wuhrkorporation Alp nicht mehr zeitgenössisch sind. Somit findet innerhalb der Integration des einen Systems (Gewässermanagement Kanton Schwyz) eine Desintegration eines anderen Systems (Gewässermanagement Alptal) statt. Diese Desintegration kann mit dem Verlust von Bewirtschaftungselementen verbunden sein, welche sich über eine lange Zeit bewährt haben. Deshalb ist es essentiell, sich dieser Entwicklung bewusst zu werden und die Elemente zu identifizieren und beizubehalten, welche ein erfolgreiches und nachhaltiges Gewässermanagement der Zukunft erlauben.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000598249",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/598249","de","ETH Zürich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Die Triebkräfte des Wandels und der Grad der Policy-Integration des Gewässermanagements im Gebiet Alpthal – eine Fallstudie",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,,"2023-02-13T14:43:02Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Residents of lower-income neighbourhoods exhibit similar patterns in searches for air quality information but not for health protection, spend less time at home and have more muted sentiment responses.

Whether geothermal energy is a sustainable source of heat and/or electricity depends on how it is deployed in specific contexts. Therefore, it is striking that there is only limited attention to geothermal energy from a social science and humanities (SSH) perspective. Geothermal energy is largely conceptualized as a technological and/or geological issue in both science and practice. This perspective article aims to go beyond such conceptualizations by positioning social science research as an important lens to explore the promises and pitfalls of geothermal energy. We first provide an overview of the current state of geothermal energy as a decarbonization strategy. Second, we move on to review the existing literature. This review shows that studies that do address geothermal energy from an SSH perspective tend to be of a descriptive nature and lack analytical diversity. Third, we discuss three complementary theoretical approaches that are used in the social sciences to observe and address other forms of energy and energy transition. We believe that socio-technical assemblages, systems, and imaginaries can provide fruitful analytical lenses to study the promises, pitfalls and spatialization of geothermal energy. We conclude the paper with a research agenda and call for further engagement with this topic in SSH research, with attention to specificities of global South and North contexts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000570911",,"2214-6296",,"10.1016/j.erss.2022.102801","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/570911","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Assemblage||Socio-technical systems||Imaginaries||Infrastructures||Narratives||Geothermal","Out of steam?

Farmer-managed natural regeneration (FMNR) is an agroforestry-based approach for restoring degraded agricultural land and it has been widely implemented in African drylands. However, a recent systematic review found significant gaps in the evidence base for FMNR, including that its upscaling has been based on inadequate understandings of local contexts. Furthermore, studies reporting on farmer adoption of FMNR have mainly relied on quantitative data from household surveys, resulting in limited understandings of what motivates farmers who practice FMNR. This paper draws on the results of a qualitative study in northeastern Ghana to address two questions: 1) How and why do farmers practice FMNR? And 2) How does context influence farmers’ rationales for practicing FMNR? We found that farmers grounded their perspectives on the utility of FMNR in nuanced understandings of the local farming and land and tree tenure systems. The results of our study also demonstrate how farmers’ decision-making was situated within socially and agroecologically differentiated contexts, which were conditioned by long-term, multi-faceted change in the region. We conclude that in spite of the rush to scale up FMNR, more attention should be directed to assessing where, when, and for whom FMNR might be appropriate. Such assessments should be grounded in resource managers’ preferences, local agricultural and land and tree tenure systems, and the requisite biophysical conditions for FMNR. To support these efforts, we propose an FMNR suitability assessment framework, based on our findings and those from related studies. As landscape restoration is scaled up globally, initiatives should be informed by evidence demonstrating how and why resource managers might practice a restoration activity as well as how context influences their choices.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557741",,"0305-750X",,"10.1016/j.worlddev.2022.106014","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557741","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Agroforestry||Landscape restoration||Land tenure||Tree tenure||Land and natural resources||African drylands||UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration","Farmers’ perspectives and context are key for the success and sustainability of farmer-managed natural regeneration (FMNR) in northeastern Ghana",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-13T03:07:03Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85133242894",,"000830562700007",,,"World Development","158","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As a designated UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, the rural region of Entlebuch has committed to reaching these goals. To achieve a transition towards environmentally friendly mobility patterns, research around behaviour change frequently adopts an individualistic approach. This approach can however be criticised for overemphasising the sovereignty and rationality of consumers and assuming that values always translate into actual behaviour. Social practice theory provides an alternative approach by focussing not on individuals and their choices but on the practices they adopt. This turning away from the individual and conceptualising mobility as a practice leaves however little room for the agency and reflexivity of individuals in their practices. This thesis tries to address this lacuna by investigating motivations as part of a practice. By analysing the practices of driving, taking public transport, cycling and walking as well as the practices around the transport purposes, namely commuting, shopping and pursuing leisure activities, this thesis accounts for the embeddedness of mobility in everyday life. Through conducting semi-structured interviews with residents of the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Entlebuch (UBE), this thesis analysed how mobility practices of households of the UBE are configured, how individuals justify their mobility practices in different contexts, and how environmentally friendly they perceive their mobility practices to be. The frequent car use, as well as the mobility confined mostly to the region, are characteristic of the mobility practices of residents of the UBE. The thesis was able to show that mobility practices are configured and motivated differently depending on the purpose they are used for. Dominant motivations for performing mobility practices in a certain way revolve around associated meanings, such as flexibility, convenience, safety, privacy or degree of relaxation. Especially the connectedness to the region and the strong sense of community in the UBE have a positive influence on the environmental friendliness of mobility. The frequent desire to not spent a lot of time on mobility leads to either shorter distances travelled or more frequent car use. Material motivations, such as available infrastructure and alternatives, are a second type of motivation, which were found to be more relevant in the rural area of the UBE than in urban contexts. Lastly, spatiotemporal motivations determine the way a practice is performed. In the UBE, the regional mobility is more car dominated than the local or supra-regional mobility. Environmental concerns play only a minor role in how mobility practices are performed because of the strong necessity associated with being mobile. These findings highlight the importance of considering the embeddedness of mobility practices and going beyond the dominant research focus on car use and commuting. This will not only help to understand the challenges of shifting to more sustainable means of transport in different situations but also why people are mobile in the first place and the potential for avoiding being mobile. Investigating these challenges and potentials can be achieved by analysing practices around transport purposes and the motivations associated with them, which will contribute to a transition towards more environmentally friendly mobility practices.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000577345",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/577345","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Mobility practices in the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Entlebuch",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,,"2022-10-23T09:56:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, cross-border leakage is insignificant (<3%) because soybean production is displaced to existing U.S. farmland. Eliminating deforestation from the supply chains of all firms exporting Brazilian soy to the EU or China from 2011-2016 could have reduced net global deforestation by 2% and Brazilian deforestation by 9%.

Changes in both the storm track and individual storms are expected as climate changes. Understanding future changes in winter storm activity is thus key for risk assessment and damage mitigation in Europe. This thesis combines state-of-the-art climatic projections from 29 General Circulation Models (GCMs) participating in the 6th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), with the open-source weather and climate risk assessment model CLIMADA to obtain a set of relevant projections for future winter-storm-induced damages over Europe. More specifically, we study the uncertainties, spatial patterns, and atmospheric factors of influence of future projected windstorm damages occurring during the winter half-year (October-March: ONDJFM). We use an ANOVA model to partition the uncertainty in the projections of the damages into four different sources: the climate model, the stochastic, the emission scenario, and the impact function uncertainty. We find that the climate model uncertainty dominates the uncertainty in the projections of damages related to frequent events, but that the stochastic uncertainty dominates for damages related to extreme events, highlighting the need for improvements in climate models and an increased number of ensemble members. Spatial patterns of the future changes in winter storm damages projected by the multi-model ensemble show a median increase in the damages in a narrow band covering parts of the British Isles, northern mainland Europe, southern Scandinavia and the Baltic states, and a median decrease in the rest of the European domain, in agreement with an eastward extension of the North Atlantic storm track into Europe. The large variability in the projected changes of extreme surface winds between GCMs suggests that projected storm damages cannot be explained exclusively by the changes in the storm track. We investigate the changes in extreme loss events by combining the different climate models and model members resulting in two long simulations of 1920 years of modelled climate and find solid evidence for the intensity of rare and extreme events to increase more relatively to the intensity of more frequent events. We study the role of different remote climate drivers, such as the tropical warming, the arctic amplification, and the stratospheric polar vortex strength, as well as the trends of different indices of atmospheric circulation, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the East Atlantic/Western Russia pattern (EAWR) on the projected wind extremes and associated losses. We find climate models projecting the strongest changes in the ONDJFM mean states of the NAO and EAWR indices to be associated with significantly different responses in terms of spatial patterns and changes in frequency and intensity of future winter storm damages. Also, we find polar amplification and changes in the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex to potentially influence the future extreme winds and damages over Europe. Our findings identify climate features that influence part of the variability in future European wind losses, with potential applications in the assessment of future climate simulations, or in seasonal forecasting of winter storm activity and damage. Our study also provides a common framework which can serve as a guidance for future climate risk assessment studies which could similarly take benefit of the association of a large ensemble of GCMs’ projections with a powerful open-source risk assessment model.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000602093",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/602093","en","ETH Zurich",,,,"The Impact of Climate Change on Winter Storm Damage in Europe",,"Master Thesis","Embargoed",,,,"2023-03-07T13:06:15Z","2024-03-06",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we present a new feature of the climate-risk modelling platform CLIMADA (CLIMate ADAptation), which allows us to carry out global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. CLIMADA underpins the Economics of Climate Adaptation (ECA) methodology which provides decision-makers with a fact base to understand the impact of weather and climate on their economies, communities, and ecosystems, including the appraisal of bespoke adaptation options today and in future. We apply the new feature to an ECA analysis of risk from tropical cyclone storm surge to people in Vietnam to showcase the comprehensive treatment of uncertainty and sensitivity of the model outputs, such as the spatial distribution of risk exceedance probabilities or the benefits of different adaptation options. We argue that broader application of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis will enhance transparency and intercomparison of studies among climate-risk modellers and help focus future research. For decision-makers and other users of climate-risk modelling, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis has the potential to lead to better-informed decisions on climate adaptation. Beyond provision of uncertainty quantification, the presented approach does contextualize risk assessment and options appraisal, and might be used to inform the development of storylines and climate adaptation narratives.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000574101",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-15-7177-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/574101","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for probabilistic weather and climate-risk modelling: an implementation in CLIMADA v.3.1.0",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-04T05:45:00Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Building a low-carbon, climate resilient future: climate action in support of the Paris Agreement||REmote Climate Effects and their Impact on European sustainability, Policy and Trade","821010||820712","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC","H2020||H2020",,"85140086217",,"000859112700001","Geosci. model dev.","18","Geoscientific Model Development","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The wind hazard dataset is based on the global International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) (Knapp et al. 2010) which includes 269-recorded events making landfall in Vietnam.   Holland 2008 elaborates the internal methodologies of CLIMADA for wind field and the surge hazard dataset (flood depth) is derived from wind intensity with a linear relationship that modifies the water level according to the local elevation and distance to the coastal line (Xu 2010). The hazard dataset is created on an irregular grid with: 30 arcsecond (~1km2) resolution along the coastline and going 50km inland as well as over major population centres, which cover more than 95 percentile of the population; and a coarser resolution of 150 arcsecond for the rest of the country. To account for uncertainties and model sensitivity, each historic TC is resampled 100 times creating a large sample of stochastic events (a representative set of simulated events and process is detailed in Aznar-Siguan and Bresch 2019). For simulating surge, Climate Central's proprietary, high-accuracy Digital Elevation Model (DEM) known as CoastalDEM (Kulp and Strauss 2018) was used at a resolution of 90 arcsecond. It reduces median errors in NASA's SRTM3 DEM to near zero and thus allows a better understanding of coastal risk. High accuracy DEMs from airborne lidar are unavailable.  The future hazard dataset is created for the future Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) RCP8.5- The future climate scenarios are simulated through CLIMADA’s TC module but based on assumptions from Knutson et al. 2015, which stipulate increased intensity and reduced frequency of TCs in the Eastern Pacific basin for the RCP8.5 scenario by 2050.

Despite being responsible for approximately two-thirds of aviation's impacts on the climate, most of aviation non-CO2 species are currently excluded from climate mitigation efforts. Here we identify three plausible definitions of climate-neutral aviation that include non-CO2 forcing and assess their implications considering future demand uncertainty, technological innovation and CO2 removal. We demonstrate that simply neutralizing aviation's CO2 emissions, if nothing is done to reduce non-CO2 forcing, causes up to 0.4 degrees C additional warming, thus compromising the 1.5 degrees C target. We further show that substantial rates of CO2 removal are needed to achieve climate-neutral aviation in scenarios with little mitigation, yet cleaner-flying technologies can drastically reduce them. Our work provides policymakers with consistent definitions of climate-neutral aviation and highlights the beneficial side effects of moving to aircraft types and fuels with lower indirect climate effects. Non-CO2 effects must be addressed for climate-neutral aviation but are currently ignored in international climate policies. The authors provide a framework with different definitions of climate neutrality, then show how technological and demand-side mitigation efforts can help to achieve these targets.",,,,"1758-6798","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/561038||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587427","10.1038/s41558-022-01404-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591307","en","Nature",,,,"Definitions and implications of climate-neutral aviation",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-08-01T04:31:15Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85135151684",,"000829691700003","Nat.

Besides other consequences, high temperatures increase the mortality risk and severely affect the labour productivity of workers. We perform a high-resolution spatial analysis to assess the impacts of heat on mortality and labour productivity in Switzerland and project their development under different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, considering that no socio-economic changes take place. The model is based on the risk framework of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which combines the three risk components: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. We model the two impact categories in the same spatially explicit framework, and we integrate uncertainties into the analysis by a Monte Carlo simulation. We model first that about 658 deaths are associated with heat exposure currently each year in Switzerland. Second, the economic costs caused by losses in labour productivity amount to around CHF 665 million (approx. USD 700 million) per year. Should we remain on an RCP8.5 emissions pathway, these values may double (for mortality) or even triple (for labour productivity) by the end of the century. Under an RCP2.6 scenario impacts are expected to slightly increase and peak around mid-century, when climate is assumed to stop warming. Even though uncertainties in the model are large, the underlying trend in impacts is unequivocal. The results of the study are valuable information for political discussions and allow for a better understanding of the cost of inaction.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000564868",,"1561-8633||1684-9981",,"10.5194/nhess-22-2531-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/564868","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Projected impact of heat on mortality and labour productivity under climate change in Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-19T02:47:22Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Combining theory with Big Data?

However, even in data-rich countries such as Austria, no consistent and curated multi-hazard database is available. Based on the requirements of the United Nations, the European Union, as well as on national demands to deal with disaster impacts, we conceived and set up a demonstrator for a consistent multi-hazard national event-based loss and damage database that addresses event identification, loss accounting and disaster forensics according to international standards. We built our database on already existing data from administration and federal agencies and formulated a process to combine those data in a synergetic way. Furthermore, we tested how earth observation and weather data could help to derive more robust disaster event information. Our demonstrator focuses on two Austrian federal provinces, three hazard types – floods, storms and mass movements – and the period between 2005 and 2018. By analyzing over 140.000 single event descriptions, we conclude that – despite some limitations in retrospective data harmonization – the implementation of a curated event-based national loss and damage database is feasible and adds significant value compared to the usage of single national datasets or existing international databases such as EM-DAT or the Risk Data Hub. With our demonstrator, we are able to support the national risk assessment, the national Sendai Monitoring and federal disaster risk management with the provision of best possible harmonized loss and damage information, tailored indicators and statistics as well as hazard impact maps on the municipality scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000568891",,"2076-3263",,"10.3390/geosciences12080283","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/568891","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","loss and damage database||loss accounting||disaster forensics||harmonization||standards||Sendai framework||Sendai monitor||national risk assessment","Collection, Standardization and Attribution of Robust Disaster Event Information – A Demonstrator of a National Event-Based Loss and Damage Database in Austria",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-06T02:57:59Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85137995494",,"000846133300001",,"8","Geosciences","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, emerging sanitation technologies afford a hygienically safe and ecologically sustainable solution to this development challenge by providing fertilizers derived from human excreta that could facilitate a socio-technical transition toward a more sustainable food system. To evaluate one such technology, nitrified urine fertilizer (NUF), we conducted participatory action research to assess the potential, from both a biophysical and social perspective, of NUF to serve as a soil fertilizer to support smallholder agricultural production in Swayimane, South Africa. To achieve this objective, we formed a stakeholder group comprised of a cooperative of smallholder farmers, a local NGO (Zimele), and researchers from ETH Zurich and the University of Kwazulu-Natal. Over the course of two growing seasons (2016 and 2017) this stakeholder group assessed the potential of NUF to support smallholder vegetable production (i.e., cabbage). First, we adopted a randomized complete block design incorporating five treatments in season 1 (unfertilized control, nitrified urine, nitrified urine+bone meal, urea, and urea+diammonium phosphate (DAP) and six treatments (unfertilized control, urea, urea+DAP, DAP, nitrified urine, and nitrified urine+DAP) in season 2 to assess cabbage yield and leaf nutrient concentration (sodium, phosphorus, potassium, carbon, nitrogen). Although we observed large variability in yields, the urine-based treatments were as effective as any of the chemical fertilizers. Second, beyond the biophysical analysis, we elicited the challenges and opportunities of the smallholder farmers in our stakeholder group, as well as their attitudes toward the use of NUF as a fertilizer. Through this qualitative work, farmers indicated that their attitudes about the use of NUF as a fertilizer improved and that they would be willing to incorporate this product into their production practices if it was available at scale. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of participatory action research to co-produce knowledge and awareness around an innovative technology. In so doing, we provide evidence that this approach can support a change toward nutrient recycling-based agriculture.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000564597",,"2571-581X",,"10.3389/fsufs.2022.781879","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/564597","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","nitrified urine fertilizer||sustainable agriculture||South Africa||smallholder farming||nutrient recycling","A participatory assessment of nitrified urine fertilizer use in Swayimane, South Africa: Crop production potential, farmer attitudes and smallholder challenges",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-18T03:05:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85136830748",,"000837091600001","Front.

To understand why funding remains low despite growing interest, we conduct semi-structured interviews with financial actors and restoration finance practitioners to examine what incentives and barriers corporations and asset managers experience in financing restoration, and what type of restoration projects and regions different finance actors are likely to fund. Next, we assess how current financial barriers might be overcome. We find that there are market incentives for corporate entities to finance restoration for carbon drawdown, sustainable branding, and to promote sustainability in supply chains. Conversely, asset managers face strong barriers as projects are deemed high risk and with low prospects for sufficient return on investments. Through enhanced markets for restoration benefits, complementary public policies, and financial instruments, private finance for restoration can be scaled for a wider variety of restoration projects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000592696",,,,"https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1851634/v1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/592696","en","Research Square","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Unlocking the potential of private finance for forest and landscape restoration",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2023-01-16T13:01:14Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Research Square",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Energy system modeling faces a transformation: accounting for changing meteorological conditions imposed by climate change. To enable that transformation, a community of practice in energy-climate modeling has started to form that aims to better integrate energy system models with weather and climate models. Here, we evaluate the disconnects between the energy system and climate modeling communities, then lay out a research agenda to bridge those disconnects. In the near-term, we propose interdisciplinary activities for expediting uptake of future climate data in energy system modeling. In the long-term, we propose a transdisciplinary approach to enable development of (1) energy-system-tailored climate datasets for historical and future meteorological conditions and (2) energy system models that can effectively leverage those datasets.

Yet, the question arises of which types of organizations might be preferred. To address this, we systematically analyze which water supply organizations decision-makers and stakeholders, across different levels of government in Switzerland, prefer. We find that the actors prefer public organizations that involve coordination between municipalities and reject private organizations. Distinguishing between different actor levels reveals a distinct pattern, mainly related to the level of responsibility: the national (confederation) and regional (cantonal) actors only prefer coordination across municipalities, where local politicians lose a degree of control. In contrast, the local actors prefer those organizations where they can maintain democratic control the most. However, such organizations are not expected to perform sustainably, mainly because of lengthy decision-making processes, lack of access to external funds, and short-term financial planning. We, thus, conclude that, at the local level, there is potentially a trade-off between democratic values and performance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557080",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su14137560","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557080","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","administrative reforms||organizational autonomy||coordination||actor preferences||water sector||Switzerland","Public, Private, or Inter-Municipal Organizations: Actors’ Preferences in the Swiss Water Sector",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-09T11:39:38Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85133009136",,"000824230700001",,"13","Sustainability","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this manuscript, we provide an early career researcher (ECR) perspective on this discussion. We argue that travel-intensive conference practices damage both the environment and our credibility as a discipline, conflict with the intrinsic values and motivations of our discipline, and are inequitable. As such, they must change. This change can be achieved by moving toward virtual and hybrid conferences, which can reduce researchers’ carbon footprints and promote equity, if employed carefully and with informal exchange as a priority. By acting collectively and with the support of institutional change, we can adapt conference travel norms in our field. To investigate whether our arguments correspond to views in the wider community of ECRs within environmental psychology, we conducted a community case study. By leveraging our professional networks and directly contacting researchers in countries underrepresented in those networks, we recruited 117 ECRs in 32 countries for an online survey in February 2022. The surveyed ECRs supported a change in conference travel practices, including flying less, and perceived the number of researchers wanting to reduce their travel emissions to be growing. Thirteen percent of respondents had even considered leaving academia due to travel requirements. Concerning alternative conference formats, a mixed picture emerged. Overall, participants had slightly negative evaluations of virtual conferences, but expected them to improve within the next 5 years. However, ECRs with health issues, facing visa challenges, on low funding, living in remote areas, with caretaking obligations or facing travel restrictions due to COVID-19 expected a switch toward virtual or hybrid conferences to positively affect their groups. Participants were divided about their ability to build professional relationships in virtual settings, but believed that maintaining relationships virtually is possible. We conclude by arguing that the concerns of ECRs in environmental psychology about current and alternative conference practices must be taken seriously. We call on our community to work on collective solutions and less travel-intensive conference designs using participatory methods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000552913",,"1664-1078",,"10.3389/fpsyg.2022.906108","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/552913","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Scientific conferences||Early career researchers||Travel-intensive conferences||Academic travel||Sustainable academia||Equitable academia||Accessibility||Inclusivity","The Need for Sustainability, Equity, and International Exchange: Perspectives of Early Career Environmental Psychologists on the Future of Conferences",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-16T19:17:54Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85133507139",,,"Front Psychol",,"Frontiers in Psychology","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Damages to CIs often lead to failure cascades with catastrophic impacts in terms of people being cut off from basic service access. Yet, there is a gap between traditional CI failure models, operating often at local scales, with detailed proprietary, non-transferrable data, and the large scales and global occurrences of natural disasters.  We demonstrate a way to bridge those incompatibilities by linking a globally consistent and spatially explicit natural hazard risk modelling platform (CLIMADA) and a CI failure cascade model. The latter is built on publicly available infrastructure, end-user and supply data, and makes use of consistent and transferrable dependency heuristics between CIs to represent infrastructure systems at national scales for any place interest. Impacts are then spatially mapped in terms of people experiencing disruptions to basic service access.  With this approach, we aim to showcase how the interplay of available data and well-informed heuristics can allow large-scale impact models to produce consistent hot-spot analyses and rapid emergency assessments, which may then provide a starting point for more detailed, local studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594978",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-911","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594978","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A globally consistent approach for basic service disruptions after natural disasters",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2023-01-26T08:53:48Z",,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23-27, 2023","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02130 - Dep.

Real-time information is commonly communicated to the public through multi-hazard platforms. However, whether these platforms' messages are correctly understood and whether they increase people's intention to take action is yet to be proven. We thus aimed at compiling recommendations on how to develop actionable and understandable (multi-)hazard warning messages. To this end, we designed various multi-hazard overviews and hazard messages, which were refined during the five virtual workshops we conducted with experts (N = 15) from different fields. We then surveyed (N = 601, between-subjects experiment) the Swiss public to check whether our designs increase people's intention to take action and help them correctly interpret the information presented. The design of the hazard overviews, we found, exerted no significant effect on people's intention to take action, probably because the participants showed a generally high interest in seeking further information. In contrast, the hazard overviews with time and action indications significantly increased people's understanding of whether they should take immediate actions. Moreover, adding a time- and action-related icon to the hazard messages significantly increased people's intention to take action. For both hazard overviews and messages, people's intention to take action was found to be proportional to the hazard's severity and urgency and influenced by various personal factors, such as past hazard experiences. To conclude, rendering information on multi-hazard platforms more actionable can prompt public responses and, in turn, increase society's resilience toward disasters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000540681",,"2212-4209",,"10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.102917","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/540681","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Multi-hazard platforms||Event-related communication||Actionable information||Time indication||Personal factors","Actionable and understandable?

The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery's indicators include the population proportion accessing laparotomy and open fracture care, key trauma interventions, within two hours. The ""Golden Hour"" for receiving facility-based resuscitation also guides injury care system strengthening. Firstly, we estimated the proportion of the local population able to reach primary, secondary and tertiary facility care within two and one hours using Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis. Secondly, we compared community household-reported with GIS-estimated travel time. Methods: Using information from a Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (Karonga, Malawi) on road network, facility location, and local staff-estimated travel speeds, we used a GIS-generated friction surface to calculate the shortest travel time from all households to each facility serving the population. We surveyed community households who reported travel time to their preferred, closest, government secondary and tertiary facilities. For recently injured community members, time to reach facility care was recorded. To assess the relationship between community household-reported travel time and GIS-estimated travel time, we used linear regression to generate a proportionality constant. To assess associations and agreement between injured patient-reported and GIS-estimated travel time, we used Kendall rank and Cohen's kappa tests. Results: Using GIS, we estimated 79.1% of households could reach any secondary facility, 20.5% the government secondary facility, and 0% the government tertiary facility, within two hours. Only 28.2% could reach any secondary facility within one hour, 0% for the government secondary facility. Community household-reported travel time exceeded GIS-estimated travel time. The proportionality constant was 1.25 (95%CI 1.21–1.30) for the closest facility, 1.28 (95%CI 1.23–1.34) for the preferred facility, 1.45 (95%CI 1.33–1.58) for the government secondary facility, and 2.12 (95%CI 1.84–2.41) for tertiary care. Comparing injured patient-reported with GIS-estimated travel time, the correlation coefficient was 0.25 (SE 0.047) and Cohen's kappa was 0.15 (95%CI 0.078–0.23), suggesting poor agreement. Discussion: Most households couldn't reach government secondary care within recognised thresholds indicating poor temporal access. Since GIS-estimated travel time was shorter than community-reported travel time, the true proportion may be lower still. GIS derived estimates of population emergency care access in similar contexts should be interpreted accordingly.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000548434",,,,"10.1016/j.injury.2022.02.010","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/548434","en","HMSO","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Wounds and injuries||Healthcare systems||Health services accessibility||Geographic Information Systems||Emergency Care","Access to care following injury in Northern Malawi, a comparison of travel time estimates between Geographic Information System and community household reports",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-21T03:02:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85124421554",,"000832372900020",,"5","Injury","53","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Drought risk management is extremely complex. Apart from irrigation, most drought risk management options have more than one goal and may potentially have negative trade-offs with other risk management objectives. Moreover, government regulations and market mechanisms influence farmers' decision-making. However, previous studies, both in developed and in developing countries, have predominantly focused on attitudinal and structural influencing factors on farmers' risk management behavior. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate farmers' decision spaces with respect to drought risk management. We address two applied research questions: (1) What are farmers' preferred drought risk management measures? (2) From a farmer's perspective, what are the dominant factors influencing drought risk management decisions? We find that farmers primarily think of production-based rather than financial measures with respect to drought risk management. At the same time, natural and technical constraints and enabling factors dominate their mental decision space, followed by public and private institutional aspects. This research provides a basis for the design of integrated and holistic drought risk management policy and the drought risk governance needed for sustainable use of land and water resources such as needed to address systemic risks and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach using mental models extracted from interviews to explore cognitive representations of farmers' decision spaces. This approach has the potential to complement mainstream research using standardized surveys and behavioral models to analyze drivers of risk management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000518848",,"1387-585X||1573-2975","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/501356||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517534","10.1007/s10668-021-01693-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518848","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Decision space||Mental model||Agriculture||Climate risk||Drought||Risk management","Decision spaces in agricultural risk management: a mental model study of Austrian crop farmers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-19T02:36:24Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85112204903",,"000683675600005","Environ Dev Sustain","5","Environment, Development and Sustainability","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Somit unterstützt die SBB die gewünschte Verdichtung nach innen und leisten einen Beitrag zur Erhöhung des Modalsplits zu Gunsten des öffentlichen Verkehrs. Verkehrsdrehscheiben mit kundenorientierten Mobilitätslösungen und integrierten Arealentwicklungen leisten einen wichtigen Beitrag zu einem schonenden Umgang mit der knappen Ressource Boden und schaffen lebenswerten urbanen Raum für die Bevölkerung. Die Konzernleitung der SBB hat bei der Entwicklung von Verkehrsdrehscheiben Herausforderungen erkannt und die für die Weiterentwicklung relevanten Organisationseinheiten der SBB und zwei Forschungsgruppen der ETH Zürich und eine der EPF Lausanne damit beauftragt, im Rahmen des zweijährigen transdisziplinären Forschungsprojektes «Co-Creating Mobility Hubs» (CCMH) Methoden für die Entwicklung von Verkehrsdrehscheiben zu erarbeiten. Im Rahmen des Forschungsprojektes wurden folgende Erkenntnisse gewonnen: - Ein gemeinsames übergeordnetes Verständnis der Akteur:innen für Verkehrsdrehscheiben fehlte bisher, was die kollaborative Entwicklung erschwert. - Es gibt keine Gesamtverantwortung für die Entwicklung von Verkehrsdrehscheiben. Die koordinierte Zusammenarbeit zwischen situativ relevanten Akteur:innen ist deshalb zentral für eine erfolgreiche Entwicklung. - Wegen der nicht vorhandenen Gesamtverantwortung fehlt die notwendige lokale Gesamtsystemsicht für eine erfolgreiche Transformation. Die Resultate aus den drei Workstreams «Raum» (Kapitel 3), «Gesellschaft» (Kapitel 4) und «Akteur:innen» (Kapitel 5) zeigen die folgenden Kernvoraussetzungen für eine erfolgreiche kollaborative Entwicklung von Verkehrsdrehscheiben auf: - Es braucht Sensibilität für die lokalen Eigenschaften des meist knappen Raums. Bei Projekten, die zur Transformation beitragen, sollte auf einen grösseren Umkreis, dessen urbane Strukturen und die Bedeutung des öffentlichen Raums geachtet werden. - Die gesellschaftlichen Anforderungen müssen erhoben, analysiert und einbezogen werden. Zudem muss ein Bewusstsein für die Auswirkungen auf die Gesellschaft und den urbanen Raum geschaffen werden. - Die Akteur:innen sind angehalten, Empathie für die anderen Akteur:innen und ein gemeinsames Verständnis für die Verkehrsdrehscheibe zu entwickeln sowie den Transformationsprozess gemeinsam zu strukturieren und zu lenken. Um die für die kollaborative Entwicklung von Verkehrsdrehscheiben notwendigen Veränderungen und Neuerungen innerhalb der SBB strukturiert zu planen, zu steuern und nachhaltig zu verankern, wird eine Analyse der Betroffenheit und Veränderungsbereitschaft der relevanten Organisationseinheiten, eine kulturelle Transformation bei diesen, die Schaffung des Bewusstseins für die Auswirkungen auf Raum und Gesellschaft, eine Wissensvermittlung und Befähigung derer Mitarbeitenden und ein Aufbau einer Community vorgeschlagen.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000549806",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/549806","de","ETH Zürich; EPF Lausanne; SBB",,,"Mobility Hubs||Railway||Verkehrsdrehscheiben","Co-Creating Mobility Hubs (CCMH) – Ein transdisziplinäres Forschungsprojekt der SBB zusammen mit der ETH Zürich und der EPF Lausanne.",,"Report","Embargoed",,,,"2022-05-31T07:26:58Z","2023-12-31",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The approach uses the natural catastrophe impact model CLIMADA and considers three distinct types of climate impacts. First, direct climate impacts on agricultural production due to rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. Second, indirect climate impacts associated with countries’ net climate impacts within their trade portfolio of agricultural commodities. And third, indirect economic impacts in downstream sectors that depend on agricultural inputs through one or more layers of dependency. To assess the outputs of the different impact assessments, risk metrics that focus on changes in the frequency and intensity of average and high-intensity impacts at different global warming levels are presented. The results make use of the contrasting examples of maize and wheat to reveal distinct patterns of direct climate impacts across crops and major exporting countries. The assessment of the transmission of impacts along with trade flows highlights the transboundary nature of climate impacts. Furthermore, it shows that countries that depend on few trading partners have higher net impacts than those with a diversified trade portfolio. Finally, the results emphasize the significance of downstream indirect economic impacts in relation to direct impacts. Climate impact studies focusing on direct impacts alone therefore may substantially underestimate economic consequences. Three case studies act as proofs of concept of the modelling framework and are presented alongside the results. Furthermore, relevant insights for assessing compounding and cascading impacts and associated consequences for global climate adaptation efforts are discussed. Despite apparent limitations, the simplicity and global comprehensiveness of the presented modelling framework allow identifying hotspots of climate impacts in agricultural production regions, within trade portfolios, and across networks of economic dependency. This thesis thereby contributes to a growing field of literature that aims at informing policymakers and private actors along agri-food supply chains with comprehensive data on climate impacts in a globalized world.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000558201",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/558201","en","ETH Zurich",,,,"Modelling the impacts of climate change on global agri-food supply chains",,"Master Thesis","Embargoed",,,,"2022-07-15T07:15:08Z","2023-07-15",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Based on empirical results of an ITD 2019 Conference Workshop entitled ""Is there a new profession of integration experts on the rise?"" held in Gothenburg, Sweden, and our own experience in leading and studying ITD integration, the present article sheds light on the overarching question, ""What are integration experts?"", thus contributing to the emerging literature on integration and integration expertise. We use direct quotes from participants to substantiate workshop results and triangulate them with recent literature on ITD research as well as Science of Team Science (SciTS) and Science and Technology Studies (STS). We conclude our article by discussing possible unintended consequences of establishing academic careers for integration experts, and suggest four complementary ways to support them, while mitigating potentially negative consequences: (a) establishing an international Community of Practice (CoP) to foster peer-to-peer exchange among integration experts, create greater visibility, and develop ideas for transforming academic structures; (b) studying academic careers of integration experts to provide empirical evidence of ""successful"" examples and disclose different ways of establishing related academic positions; (c) funding respective positions and aligning metrics for ITD research to foster integration within ITD projects or programs; and (d) engaging in collaborative dialog with academic institutions and funding agencies to present empirical results and lessons learnt from (a) and (b) to support them in establishing and legitimating careers for integration experts.

One of the most highly rated risks that may dynamically impact agriculture, is climate change. Climate change may threaten agriculture's inherent diversification benefits due to winter and summer crops and/ or geographic spread. This thesis investigates the changing risk landscape at a higher granularity compared to other relevant research (keeping in mind the limitations at the regional scale). The following method within the CLIMADA environment is mainly used to assess the climate’s impacts on crops: process-based crop growth models. To achieve the goal of the thesis, CLIMADA combined with output from AgMIP and ISIMIP will be used for the overall analysis. The main questions to address are how climate change impacts the 'tailish' behavior of agricultural portfolios and how climate change threatens portfolio diversification benefits caused by the geographic and seasonal (i.e., winter vs summer crops) diversification of each portfolio. As a consequence, the impact of projected mid-term climate change on the interannual yield variability, the trend and ultimately the severity of different cat event (e.g., 1-in-100-year) scenarios will be analyzed. Primary data collection methods and especially quantitative methods - time series analysis - can be reliably implemented to get the possible desired results.

To address complex societal and environmental problems facing the world today, a particular expertise that can identify new connections between diverse knowledge fields is needed in order to integrate diverse perspectives from a wide range of stakeholders and develop novel solutions. The capacity for “insight discovery” means becoming aware of personal mental representations of the world and being able to shape and integrate perspectives different from one’s own. Based on experiences and empirical observations within the scope of an educational programme for Masters students, PhD candidates and post-doctoral researchers, we suggest that insights are the outcome of a learning process influenced by the collective and environment in which they are conceived, rather than instant moments of individual brilliance. The process which we describe, named the insight discovery process (IDP), is made up of five aspects. Within a group setting, a person begins with an “original mental model”, experiences an “insight trigger”, processes new information within the “liminal space”, “formulates an insight” and eventually forms an “adapted mental model”. There is a potential for incorporating such process as a fundamental competence for transdisciplinary curricula in undergraduate and graduate programmes by cultivating specific practices and safe learning environments, focused on the enquiry, exchange and integration of diverse perspectives.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543091",,"2662-9992",,"10.1057/s41599-022-01129-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543091","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Going beyond the AHA! moment: insight discovery for transdisciplinary research and learning",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-21T04:51:15Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85128013174",,"000779353500002",,,"Humanities and Social Sciences Communications","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Therefore, assessing and quantifying their economic risk is of great interest to governmental authorities and (re-)insurance companies.  To estimate the risk, the probabilistic wildfire module in the open-source software CLIMADA (CLIMate ADAptation) simulates wildfire seasons based on a cellular automaton. In this thesis, we extend the wildfire module by incorporating physical constraints. First, we combine land cover and population data to improve the fire spread simulation with the cellular automaton. Second, we add fire ignition probabilities based on population and historical data, defining particularly wildfire-prone regions. Third, we create the possibility to add a climate change signal as input to assess future economic impacts. The extended wildfire module is applied in ten different geographical regions to evaluate its accuracy using the same default parameters. In nine out of ten investigated regions, reasonable economic impact and burned area estimations are found for present-day climate conditions. To gain further insights into the performance of the wildfire module, we conduct two in-depth case studies for Portugal and central Chile. The case studies show that the probabilistically estimated economic impacts and burned area are in the same order of magnitude as derived from historical seasons. Additionally, including an end of the century climate change signal to the wildfire module leads to a substantial increase in economic impacts and burned area in Portugal. In contrast, the approach is not feasible to simulate the end of century climate conditions in central Chile since the interactions between the climatic conditions and wildfires are complex, and humans strongly influence wildfire activity. Therefore, implementing a climate change signal is only applicable in regions where the climatic conditions during the fire season directly determine the wildfire activity.  We conclude that the wildfire module provides accurate estimations of the economic impacts and burned area in numerous regions across the world. The consistency in the parameters and the data-efficient approach enables probabilistic risk assessments without great effort, even in data-sparse geographical regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542247",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542247","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Wildfires||Impact modeling||Model development||CLIMADA","Further Development of the Wildfire Module in CLIMADA by Integrating Physical Constraints",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2022-04-13T12:19:22Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While payments for environmental services (PES) have been advocated in many contexts as an efficient and pro-poor environmental policy to incentivize conservation, they have been the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism for leading to mixed and sometimes adverse environmental and social outcomes. It remains unclear whether such an approach is an improvement over existing approaches to govern sustainability in supply chains and especially as a mechanism for reducing ecosystem conversion. Here we conduct an ex-ante analysis to examine the potential outcomes of using a standalone PES scheme versus existing standalone market exclusion mechanisms (MEM) to govern commodity supply chains. The analysis develops a theoretical framework to examine the potential effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, equity, and legitimacy of the two approaches and then applies this framework using qualitative analysis of secondary and interview data. Using this theory-driven evaluation approach we examine the case of the Brazilian Cerrado, where a PES mechanism is currently being proposed to achieve zero-deforestation targets in soy supply chains. We find that both standalone approaches suffer from different strengths and challenges and would be better used in combination. We conclude that a mixture of strict market exclusion with positive incentives and enabling programs that are targeted at the poorest farmers would be more effective, cost-effective, equitable, and legitimate. However, in the future such supply chain focused soy deforestation control efforts in the Cerrado must be complemented by broader jurisdictional approaches to addressing deforestation and sustainable developement that include all land use actors, not just soy farmers. These more inclusive and balanced initiatives can help ensure that avoiding deforestation goes hand in hand with supporting sustainable livelihoods for a wider range of actors in the Cerrado.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529026",,"0305-750X",,"10.1016/j.worlddev.2022.105814","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529026","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sustainable supply chains||Deforestation-risk commodities||Trade||Environmental governance||Conservation policy","Should payments for environmental services be used to implement zero-deforestation supply chain policies?

In situ measurements of nifH gene abundance (essential for nitrogen fixation) are increasingly being used to inform the biogeography of diazotrophs. However, comparing such gene abundances spatially, temporally and between diazotroph species remains difficult. We synthesize existing data on gene-to-cell and cell-to-biomass conversions for four major diazotroph groups to convert nifH gene counts to abundance- and biomass-based biogeographic ""currencies."" Results suggest up to two orders of magnitude uncertainty converting from nifH gene abundance to cell abundance, and up to four orders of magnitude uncertainty from nifH gene abundance to biomass. Uncertainty arises due to large taxonomic variation in cell size and presumed polyploidy, that is, variability in the number of genomes per cell. Such uncertainties hinder comparing biogeographies of different species. Additionally, numerical models need biogeographies for validation, typically in the currency of carbon biomass. Here, we show that conversion uncertainty from nifH gene abundance to biomass overwhelms biomass variability simulated in such models. These results demonstrate a basic currency problem in converting gene abundance observations to biogeographically meaningful quantities for synthesizing studies and modeling approaches. Such issues may also have relevance to other genes and organisms beyond diazotrophs. To avoid biases in interpreting gene counts as a measure of abundance, we suggest converting gene counts to a binary presence/non-detect metric to map broad biogeographical distributions more robustly.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000532073",,"0024-3590||1939-5590",,"10.1002/lno.12036","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/532073","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Constraining uncertainties of diazotroph biogeography from nifH gene abundance",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-02-11T04:53:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85124074163",,"000750216300001","Limnol. oceanogr.","4","Limnology and Oceanography","67","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

About half of the meteorologically associated impacts are caused by TCs. In a changing climate, TCs are projected to intensify, and category 4 and 5 storms to occur more frequently. To adequately plan adaptation and mitigation measures, to prevent casualties and damage to private and public assets, an estimation of future impacts of TCs is desired. In this Master’s Thesis, we calculate the number of affected people and monetary damage of 100-yr TC events for the present and at the end of the 21st century in CLIMADA on global scale. We study a probabilistic set of TCs based on historical observations and scaled to represent future TC frequencies and intensities and synthetic TC datasets from a coupled statistical-dynamical TC model to compare TC impacts in four regions. The wind fields induced by modeled TCs constitute the hazard impacting the underlying exposure. Present exposure layers represent the population and assets of today. Future exposure layers are initialized using the socioeconomic development scenario corresponding to the worst-case climate change scenario. The impact functions, connecting the hazard intensity to the exposure, are defined as a step-function (threshold at 34 kn) for the number of people affected and regionally-calibrated sigmoid functions for the monetary damage. An uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is performed for the monetary damages. The number of affected people by the 100-yr TC event is projected to increase by contributions of socioeconomic development but decrease by contributions from climate change. The 100-yr TC event in the late 21st century is projected to affect more people in the North Atlantic and North Eastern Pacific region and fewer people in the North Western Pacific and Southern Hemisphere regions consistently over all TC datasets. In the North Indian Ocean region, the models project increasing and decreasing impacts depending on the TC dataset. The monetary damage is projected to increase significantly on the 90%-CI level in the next 60 years in all regions and by all models. The IBTrACS model shows weaknesses in simulating high-intensity/low-frequency events due to its simplistic approach of simulating climate change by scaling historic TCs. This observation could not be validated with results of the number of people affected, since the threshold of 34 kn masks all model differences. This study and impact modeling, in general, provides insight into risks of natural hazards in the present and future and informs policymakers about the implications of climate change and socioeconomic development so mitigation policies can be implemented. Modeling TC impacts is used by private and public institutions to develop risk transfer solutions and adaptation plans to save lives and reduce damages.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557568",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557568","en","ETH Zurich",,,,"Comparison of today's vs. future tropical cyclone impacts using different sources of storm tracks in CLIMADA",,"Master Thesis","Embargoed",,,,"2022-07-12T09:28:00Z","2023-07-12",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In Switzerland, the development of climate change scenarios is strongly linked to the climate adaptation strategy of the Confederation. The current climate scenarios for Switzerland CH2018 - released in form of six user-oriented products - were the result of an intensive collaboration between academia and administration under the umbrella of the National Centre for Climate Services (NCCS), accounting for user needs and stakeholder dialogues from the beginning. A rigorous scientific concept ensured consistency throughout the various analysis steps of the EURO-CORDEX projections and a common procedure on how to extract robust results and deal with associated uncertainties. The main results show that Switzerland's climate will face dry summers, heavy precipitation, more hot days and snow-scarce winters. Approximately half of these changes could be alleviated by mid-century through strong global mitigation efforts. A comprehensive communication concept ensured that the results were rolled out and distilled in specific user-oriented communication measures to increase their uptake and to make them actionable. A narrative approach with four fictitious persons was used to communicate the key messages to the general public. Three years after the release, the climate scenarios have proven to be an indispensable information basis for users in climate adaptation and for downstream applications. Potential for extensions and updates has been identified since then and will shape the concept and planning of the next scenario generation in Switzerland.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543991",,"2405-8807",,"10.1016/j.cliser.2022.100288","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543991","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate scenarios||Climate Services||Switzerland||EURO-CORDEX||User-oriented communication||National projections","Climate Scenarios for Switzerland CH2018 – Approach and Implications",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-27T03:23:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85128409930",,"000795942500005",,,"Climate Services","26","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Drivers of food insecurity are becoming increasingly embedded in sociocultural and economic processes that transcendent multiple spatial and temporal scales. This is due to the increasingly globalized interconnections of places and people. Understanding this complexity is essential to devise locally relevant and effective adaptation strategies to tackle existing vulnerabilities causing food insecurity. This article analytically addresses the complexity in cross-scale dynamics by combining a case study from northern Vanuatu with a conceptual analysis of the broader socioeconomic dynamics within the telecoupling framework. Our aim is to identify drivers of vulnerability that span multiple temporal and spatial scales and contribute to food insecurity in a given location while exploring the relevance and applicability of the framework for the holistic assessment of vulnerability to food insecurity. The transdisciplinary approach used in this work involved local community members and local agriculture extension officers at all stages of the study process. For this, we used complementary research methods, such as workshops, participant observations, and in-depth interviews. The results showed that potential vulnerability to food insecurity in northern Vanuatu is likely to be related to individual choices aimed at maximizing income, enabled by economic development and driven by socio-cultural changes. These choices and their consequences are perceived in many cases to be responsible for lower subsistence food production and the overuse of natural food resources. However, economic changes in particular can also enable additional livelihoods that complement existing (subsistence-based) strategies, leading to a reduction in one-sided dependencies and thus to an overall increase in the resilience of local livelihoods. We find the telecoupling approach to be a useful tool to holistically capture a local vulnerability context. However, we also encountered challenges in describing telecouplings that operate over longer time scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543429",,"2571-581X",,"10.3389/fsufs.2022.818586","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543429","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Food insecurity||livelihood vulnerability||telecoupling||Vanuatu||climate change||drivers of vulnerability||subsistence-based livelihoods","Vulnerability to Food Insecurity in a Telecoupled World: Insights From Vanuatu",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-23T03:52:57Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85128227287",,"000781771900001","Front.

Current eco-acoustic research focuses on automatic audio recorder arrays and acoustic indices, which may be used to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of local animal communities in high resolution. While such soundscapes have often been studied above ground, their applicability in soils has rarely been tested. For the first time, we applied acoustic and statistical methods to explore the spatial, diurnal, and seasonal dynamics of the soundscape in soils. We studied the dynamics of acoustic complexity in forest soils in the alpine Pfynwald forest in the Swiss canton of Valais and related them to meteorological and microclimatic data. To increase microclimatic variability, we used a long-term irrigation experiment. We also took soil samples close to the sensors on 6 days in different seasons. Daily and seasonal patterns of acoustic complexity were predicted to be associated with abiotic parameters—that is, meteorological and microclimatic conditions—and mediated by the dynamics of the diversity and activity of the soil fauna. Seasonal patterns in acoustic complexity showed the highest acoustic complexity values in spring and summer, decreasing in fall and winter. Diurnal acoustic complexity values were highest in the afternoon and lowest during the night. The measurement of acoustic diversity at the sampling site was significantly associated with soil communities, with relationships between taxa richness or community composition and acoustic complexity being strongest shortly before taking the soil samples. Our results suggest that the temporal and spatial dynamics of the diversity and community composition of soil organisms can be predicted by the acoustic complexity of soil soundscapes. This opens up the possibility of using soil soundscape analysis as a noninvasive and easy-to-use method for soil biodiversity monitoring programs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000537735",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0263618","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/537735","en","PLOS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Temporal and spatial dynamics in soil acoustics and their relation to soil animal diversity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-18T04:07:04Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85126079716",,"000835141200007","PLoS ONE","3","PLoS ONE","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, formulating such models is challenged by the necessity to formulate equations for plausible causal mechanisms between the intensity of COVID-19 transmission and external epidemic drivers such as temperature, and the stringency of nonpharmaceutical interventions. Here, we combined a neural network model (NN) with a Susceptible- Exposed-Infected-Recovered model (SEIR) in a hybrid model and attempted to increase the prediction accuracy of existing models used to forecast ICU occupancy. Between 1st of October, 2020 - 1st of July, 2021, the hybrid model improved performances of the SEIR model at different geographical levels. At a national level, the hybrid model improved, prediction accuracy (i.e., mean absolute error) by 74%. At the cantonal and hospital levels, the reduction on the forecast's mean absolute error were 46% and 50%, respectively. Our findings illustrate those predictions from hybrid model can be used to anticipate occupancy in ICU, and support the decision-making for lifesaving actions such as the transfer of patients and dispatching of medical personnel and ventilators.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000536702",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0263789","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/536702","en","PLOS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A hybrid Neural Network-SEIR model for forecasting intensive care occupancy in Switzerland during COVID-19 epidemics",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-12T05:08:27Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85125687917",,"000776002200014","PLoS ONE",,"PLoS ONE","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For instance, illegally constructed mountain bike trails lead to trade-offs between environmental protection and other forest utilizations such as wood production. We thus study how such trade-off situations can be negotiated to find an outcome, such as a legal mountain bike trail, which is accepted by stakeholders. In doing so, we select case studies where we expect to find similar trade-off situations that lead to the negotiation process about mountain bike trails. Specifically, we analyse the cases' negotiation processes (action situations) by applying Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development Framework. Our findings show the importance of collective actors, a clear delineation of responsibilities and of compensation and funding measures as well as structured workshops and collective site inspections for addressing trade-offs and for arriving at acceptable outcomes in our cases.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000524441",,"1389-9341",,"10.1016/j.forpol.2021.102683","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524441","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Getting a grip on negotiation processes: Addressing trade-offs in mountain biking in Austria, Germany and Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-11T06:34:42Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85122286033",,"000787587600013",,,"Forest Policy and Economics","136","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We performed two analyses using primary and secondary data, namely propensity score matching to estimate the effects of the enactment of HN Simancuang in 2012 on forest cover loss and ordinal logistic regression (OLR) to predict the determinants of conservation awareness. The results of the forest cover analysis showed that forest cover loss in HN Simancuang between 2012 and 2019 was 0.038 percentage point lower than the adjacent protection forest. The relatively small impact was meaningful because although HN Simancuang is located much closer to settlements which increases the pressure on the forest, it could still maintain lower tree cover losses than the adjacent protection forest. This result indicated a certain degree of conservation awareness among HN Simancuang members, which prompted us to conduct a survey to 111 individuals from different households. To do this, we used the Ecosystem Services framework to conceptualise conservation awareness in HN Simancuang. Our OLR results showed that regulating and provisioning services of forests are the strong determinants of conservation awareness among the individuals in our sample. Our study indicates the need to implement social forestry program monitoring and evaluation, improve access to facilitation, and enhance agroforestry practice as the means to increase conservation awareness among forest-dwelling communities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519265",,"1873-7617||1873-7854",,"10.1007/s11842-021-09489-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519265","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Village forest||Social forestry||Environmental services||Conservation awareness||Indonesia","Assessing Drivers of Forest Conservation in Simancuang Village Forest, West Sumatra",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-07T09:35:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85116527940",,"000704935500001",,"1","Small-scale Forestry","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, efforts to use these genomes for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance have thus far been limited and geographically heterogeneous. We inferred global resistance trends in Escherichia coli in food animals using genomes from public databases.  Methods We retrieved 7632 E. coli genomes from public databases (NCBI, PATRIC and EnteroBase) and screened for antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) using ResFinder. Selection bias towards resistance, virulence or specific strains was accounted for by screening BioProject descriptions. Temporal trends for MDR, resistance to antimicrobial classes and ARG prevalence were inferred using generalized linear models for all genomes, including those not subjected to selection bias.  Results MDR increased by 1.6 times between 1980 and 2018, as genomes carried, on average, ARGs conferring resistance to 2.65 antimicrobials in swine, 2.22 in poultry and 1.58 in bovines. Highest resistance levels were observed for tetracyclines (42.2%–69.1%), penicillins (19.4%–47.5%) and streptomycin (28.6%–56.6%). Resistance trends were consistent after accounting for selection bias, although lower mean absolute resistance estimates were associated with genomes not subjected to selection bias (difference of 3.16%±3.58% across years, hosts and antimicrobial classes). We observed an increase in extended-spectrum cephalosporin ARG blaCMY-2 and a progressive substitution of tetB by tetA. Estimates of resistance prevalence inferred from genomes in the public domain were in good agreement with reports from systematic phenotypic surveillance.  Conclusions Our analysis illustrates the potential of using the growing volume of genomes in public databases to track AMR trends globally.",,,,"0305-7453||1460-2091",,"10.1093/jac/dkab451","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526195","en","Oxford University Press",,,,"Increase in antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli in food animals between 1980 and 2018 assessed using genomes from public databases",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-01-17T11:23:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Piloting on-site interventions for reducing antimicrobial use in livestock farming in emerging economies||Towards quantification of the contribution of plasmids to the spread of antibiotic resistance||Global Policies for Antimicrobial Resistance in Animals","180179||167121||181248||180179||167121||181248||180179||167121||181248","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","ERA-NET + EJP||Eccellenza||ERA-NET + EJP||Eccellenza||ERA-NET + EJP||Eccellenza||NFP 70: Gesuch",,"85125828387",,"000759761100017","J Antimicrob Chemother","3","Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy","77","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Drawing on a sample of 54 recent research projects, we investigated how and by whom the knowledge was used, what changes were achieved, and how non-academic actors were involved. As a conceptual framework we combined a concept of “stages of knowledge utilization” with a spiral model that co-creates three forms of knowledge – systems knowledge, target knowledge, and transformation knowledge, and which spans from joint problem definition to concrete sustainability transformations. We analysed questionnaires from 94 academic and non-academic actors using cross-tabulation, chi-squared tests, and qualitative content analysis. The early involvement of non-academic actors from key groups such as local enterprises was positively related to the utilization of research knowledge, as was their involvement in diverse roles. However, only little of the research knowledge generated has so far resulted in changes in policy and practice, partly because sustainability transformations are larger societal processes. Utilization of research knowledge for sustainability transformations cannot be achieved without employing a transdisciplinary approach that brings together academic and non-academic actors in a setting that enables discussions on an even footing and the empowering of actors who are often not heard. In such settings, researchers are also part of the change rather than mere observers, an additional factor that came up in our participatory results validation activities and that requires further research. For more influence on policies and practice, research for development requires active participation of non-academic actors from the outset, when the project contents are defined.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522877",,"1462-9011||1873-6416",,"10.1016/j.envsci.2021.12.017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522877","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Transdisciplinarity||Sustainability||Co-creation||Transformation||Knowledge utilization","Transdisciplinary co-creation increases the utilization of knowledge from sustainable development research",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-04T07:18:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85122133686",,"000787577400011","Environ.

This thesis aims to build a reliable microscopic traffic model for Seychelles’ main island Mahé. It focuses on motorized private transport. I used openly available map data to build a model in the open-source traffic simulation software SUMO. The traffic demand is based on existing reports, but I refined it following the current change in mobility behavior. I performed traffic counts using drones to calibrate the model to the actual traffic situation. The validation showed a good fit for the current situation. However, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may have impacted the traffic counts. Then, I demonstrated the utility of the traffic model in a case study. I assessed the pedestrianization of major roads in the capital city in four scenarios. All scenarios showed negative effects on the road transport network. Nevertheless, pedestrianization also has many positive aspects that a traffic model can not assess. During the entire thesis, I worked in close collaboration with Seychelles’ Department of Transport, following a transdisciplinary approach. The authorities should be able to use the developed traffic model to assess infrastructure improvements and prioritize projects based on their benefits.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000549150",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/549150","en","IVT, ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Traffic Model||Digital Twin","Towards a Digital Twin of Seychelles' Road Transport System",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::624 - Civil engineering",,"2022-05-26T09:24:32Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In the country of Georgia, at the heart of the Caucasus region, forest degradation has been the largest land change process over the last thirty years. The prevailing narrative is that poor, rural Georgians are primarily responsible for this process, largely via legal and illegal cutting of trees for fuelwood. Yet, since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the country has undergone rapid socioeconomic and institutional changes which have not been explored as drivers of forest change. We combine newly available land cover change estimates, Georgian statistical data, and historical institutional change data to examine socioeconomic drivers of forest degradation. Our analysis controls for concurrent changes in climate that would affect degradation and examines variation at the regional (state) level from 2011-2019, as well as at the national level from 1987-2019. We find that higher earnings and road access are associated with higher degradation at the regional scale, whereas major institutional changes and drought events explain higher forest degradation at the national level. We find that the Rose Revolution of 2003 (representing the end of Soviet-era leadership and a new orientation towards Europe and the U.S.) is associated with a significant increase in forest degradation. Natural gas access, the major energy alternative to fuelwood, had no significant association with degradation. Our results challenge the narrative that poverty and a lack of alternative energy infrastructure drive forest degradation and suggest that government policies banning household fuelwood cutting, including the new Forest Code of 2020, will be unlikely to reduce forest degradation. Given these results, more research on the commercial drivers of degradation and their links to economic and political reforms following the Rose Revolution is urgently needed to better inform forest policy in the region, especially given ongoing risks from climate change.",,,,,,"https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4045409","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/592694","en","Social Science Research Network",,,"forest degradation||post-Soviet||Georgia||forest governance||land cover and land use change||Caucasus","What Drives Forest Degradation in Post-Soviet Landscapes?",,"Working Paper","Metadata only",,,,"2023-01-16T12:58:04Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"SSRN",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this paper, we synthesize knowledge accumulated in land system science, the integrated study of terrestrial social-ecological systems, into 10 hard truths that have strong, general, empirical support. These facts help to explain the challenges of achieving sustainability in land use and thus also point toward solutions. The 10 facts are as follows: 1) Meanings and values of land are socially constructed and contested; 2) land systems exhibit complex behaviors with abrupt, hard-to-predict changes; 3) irreversible changes and path dependence are common features of land systems; 4) some land uses have a small footprint but very large impacts; 5) drivers and impacts of land-use change are globally interconnected and spill over to distant locations; 6) humanity lives on a used planet where all land provides benefits to societies; 7) land-use change usually entails trade-offs between different benefits-""win-wins"" are thus rare; 8) land tenure and land-use claims are often unclear, overlapping, and contested; 9) the benefits and burdens from land are unequally distributed; and 10) land users have multiple, sometimes conflicting, ideas of what social and environmental justice entails. The facts have implications for governance, but do not provide fixed answers. Instead they constitute a set of core principles which can guide scientists, policy makers, and practitioners toward meeting sustainability challenges in land use.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000533327",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2109217118","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/533327","en","NAS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","land use||sustainability||social-ecological systems||governance","Ten facts about land systems for sustainability",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-02-19T05:49:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85124259162",,"000766919700022","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","7","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","119","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Hence, spatial and socio-economic context, considered as the main stimulant of organizational innovation, can be particularly important for cities. We investigate 22 Swiss cities with smart city projects and use fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to determine the configuration of conditions that make some cities more advanced than others in their smart city development. Results indicate that a configuration of high share of service sector, presence of research institutions and high urban density is sufficient for the outcome, whereas population size, new residential development and participation to international networks appear as less important.

The current warning system is based on fixed geographical warning regions which are manually classified into levels of danger by weather forecasters. The aim of this master’s thesis is to automatize the generation of warnings of winter storms. An algorithm is designed and implemented which automatically shapes and classifies event-based warning polygons. The inputs to the algorithm are the wind speeds computed by the COSMO2-E numerical weather prediction model. The data is processed with the image processing technique Morphological Filtering to reduce the heterogeneity in the wind speed data and to obtain warning polygons. Evaluated on past winter storms, the algorithm’s probability of detection has improved by 0.11 to 0.48 while the false alarm ratio has increased by 0.1 to 0.85, compared to the preprocessed COSMO2-E wind speed output. Therefore, the implemented algorithm forms contiguous warning polygons while preserving the COSMO2-E model’s accuracy. In future work, the algorithm can be further developed to reduce heterogeneity and form warning polygons of other numerical weather predictions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000548850",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/548850","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Automatic Generation of Winter Storm Warnings",,"Master Thesis","Embargoed",,,,"2022-05-24T12:00:51Z","2023-05-23",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the Brazilian Amazon, these policies take the form of market exclusion mechanisms, i.e., immediately dropping suppliers who have cleared their land after a specific cut-off date. Theory suggests that strict exclusionary policies such as these are likely to result in both negative livelihood effects and reduced effectiveness of the policy if some farmers are not able to comply. It is proposed that a more cooperative model of enforcement that uses flexible and negotiated approaches to compliance management may enable more marginal and disadvantaged farmers to achieve compliance, thereby improving both the effectiveness of supply chain policies and their equity. Through our case study of cattle in the Brazilian Amazon, we examine the degree to which a purportedly cooperative supply chain policy exhibits coercive tendencies at different tiers and the degree to which these tendencies influence effectiveness and equity outcomes of the policy. We show that, surprisingly, even cooperative models of enforcement are prone to exhibit coercive tendencies in multi-tier supply chains, leading to severe equity shortcomings. We provide recommendations and a research agenda to mitigate effectiveness-equity tradeoffs in multi-tier, forest-focused supply chain policies in the aim to improve the design, adoption, and implementation of such policies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522349",,"0959-6526",,"10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.130031","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522349","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Deforestation||Voluntary sustainability standards||Multi-tier supply chains||Enforcement||Commodities||Market access","Effectiveness-equity tradeoffs in enforcing exclusionary supply chain policies: Lessons from the Amazonian cattle sector",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-26T03:55:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85121423932",,"000779963400006","J Cleaner Prod.",,"Journal of Cleaner Production","332","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, the current and future climate impacts faced by Viet Nam due to Tropical Cyclones (TCs), specifically wind and surge, are evaluated, and different adaptation measures to manage this risk are appraised. The level of wind and storm surge risk was assessed focusing on three categories of assets: residential houses, agriculture, and people. The expected damage to these assets was then evaluated based on their exposure to the hazard under current and future climate scenarios. Physical adaptation measures such as mangroves, sea dykes, and gabions, and financial adaptation measures such as risk transfer via insurance were applied to the expected future risk and evaluated based on a socio-economic cost–benefit analysis. The output will give decision-makers the ability to make more informed decisions, prioritize the most cost-effective adaptation measures and increase physical and financial resilience. The results indicated significant TC exposure in future climate scenarios due to economic development and climate change that almost doubles the current expected damage. Surge-related damage was found to be many times higher than wind damage, and houses had more exposure (value in total) than agriculture on a national scale. The physical adaptation measures are successful in significantly reducing the future wind and especially surge risk and would form a resilient strategy along with risk transfer for managing TC risks in the region.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000524510",,"0165-0009||1573-1480",,"10.1007/s10584-021-03290-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524510","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate Resilience||Coastal protection||Tropical cyclones||Cost–benefit||Insurance||Nature-based solutions","Strengthening climate-resilient development and transformation in Viet Nam",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-11T09:09:13Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85122699446",,"000740365800001",,,"Climatic Change","170","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The economic sectors are also classified based on their embodied pollution intensity and trade advantage index under various FTA scenarios. Results show that the UK's GDP and welfare and China's welfare will increase, along with changes in their trade structures. Overall, this FTA brings about larger net impacts on embodied emissions of SO2 than on PM2.5, NOX and NH3, and both countries are net importers of the latter three pollutants. Key sectors such as non-metallic mineral products, chemical products, and agriculture are inclined to become less competitive and less polluting under the FTA. The inclusion of agri-food sectors exhibits slight counteracting effects in general. The findings are of policy importance as they provide insights into how best to target key sectors, seeking a balance between trade development and environmental protection.",,,,"1387-585X||1573-2975",,"10.1007/s10668-022-02612-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566563","en","Springer",,,"FTA||Embodied pollution||Environmental MRIO||GTAP||Trade competitiveness","Examining industrial air pollution embodied in trade: implications of a hypothetical China-UK FTA",,"Journal Article",,,,,"2022-08-26T03:57:19Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000842018800002","Environ Dev Sustain",,"Environment, Development and Sustainability",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Zero deforestation can be implemented using the High Carbon Stock Approach (HCSA), a tool that distinguishes forests from degraded land which can be developed. In highly forested countries like Gabon, zero deforestation may conflict with national economic goals involving palm oil and other agricultural commodities. We investigated perspectives of stakeholders in Gabon about zero deforestation and the HCSA using Critical Systems Heuristics, a systems thinking methodology. In 25 interviews with government, NGOs, companies, and research institutions, and two focus groups with rural communities, we identified three contrasting perspectives on forest conservation and agro-industrial development: international, national, and local. Zero deforestation represents an international perspective that marginalises issues from a national perspective. This may produce unintended consequences that undermine the legitimacy of zero deforestation, including conversion of Gabon’s savannahs and disincentives for sustainable business. From a local perspective, zero deforestation is embedded in an agro-industrial vision that may marginalise value judgements concerning forests and traditional livelihoods. Gabon’s National Land Use Plan could help reconcile the three perspectives but requires recognition by international standards. Adapting the HCSA to Gabon’s context should also be considered to promote legitimacy. Research is required to ensure proposed institutional arrangements deliver equitable multi-stakeholder participation in land-use planning. Gabon’s case shows the applicability of zero deforestation to all highly forested countries cannot be assumed. Improved international understanding of national contexts, and flexibility in applying “zero deforestation”, is important for designing effective and equitable international standards for sustainable agricultural production.",,,,"0264-8377||1873-5754",,"10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105770","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/592672","en","Elsevier",,,"Commodities||Conservation||Critical systems heuristics||Palm oil||Systems thinking||Supply chains","Understanding zero deforestation and the High Carbon Stock Approach in a highly forested tropical country",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2023-01-16T12:38:06Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Land Use Policy",,"Land Use Policy","112","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The respective ‘bioeconomy strategies’ bear high conflict potential as they, sometimes unintentionally, rely on forest-land or wood as a resource, which are already appropriated also in other policies. We first outline the resulting governance challenges in terms of coherence of policy goals, consistency of instruments and the congruence between the two and identify trade-offs between forest ecosystem services that exhibit a high conflict potential regarding the bioeconomy. We then provide a comparative analysis of the extent to which bioeconomy strategies tackle the related governance challenges for two pairs of countries from the temperate (Germany and Switzerland) and the boreal (Sweden and Norway) forest zone. We find that the strategies do not mention conflicts related to wood mobilization. Coherence and consistency tend to be addressed for non-extractive forest utilizations that are perceived as a market opportunity rather than solely a restriction on wood mobilization. The latter seems more common in countries with a multi-functional forestry paradigm. Consequences for the prevailing forest management paradigm, however, are not explored in the strategies and thus policy congruence is neglected.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000502283",,"1522-7200",,"10.1080/1523908X.2021.1967731","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502283","en","Routledge","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Bioeconomy||forest-related conflicts||forest ecosystem trade-offs||governance challenges||policy coherence","How national bioeconomy strategies address governance challenges arising from forest-related trade-offs",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-26T10:30:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Analyzing TRade-offs between sustainable Ecanomy and Environmental objectiues (ATREE)","172388||172388","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","NFP 73: Gesuch||NFP 73: Gesuch",,"85113788514",,"000687539100001","J Envir Pol Plan","1","Journal of Environmental Policy & Planning","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It presents 54 farm-level indicators, compared across five standard systems, and links field results to a discussion of the strategies and governance prospects of voluntary standards.

For onshore wind energy this has resulted in an active research field devoted to analysing these resources for regions, countries or globally. A particular thread of this research attempts to go beyond purely technical or spatial restrictions and determine the realistic, feasible or actual potential for wind energy. Motivated by these developments, this paper reviews methods and assumptions for analysing geographical, technical, economic and, finally, feasible onshore wind potentials. We address each of these potentials in turn, including aspects related to land eligibility criteria, energy meteorology, and technical developments of wind turbine characteristics such as power density, specific rotor power and spacing aspects. Economic aspects of potential assessments are central to future deployment and are discussed on a turbine and system level covering levelized costs depending on locations, and the system integration costs which are often overlooked in such analyses. Non-technical approaches include scenicness assessments of the landscape, constraints due to regulation or public opposition, expert and stakeholder workshops, willingness to pay/accept elicitations and socioeconomic cost-benefit studies. For each of these different potential estimations, the state of the art is critically discussed, with an attempt to derive best practice recommendations and highlight avenues for future research.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000518171",,"0960-1481||1879-0682","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517310||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517577||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517585||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518171","10.1016/j.renene.2021.10.027","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/533881","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Onshore wind||Resource assessments||Social acceptance||Planning constraints||Research priorities","High-resolution large-scale onshore wind energy assessments: A review of potential definitions, methodologies and future research needs",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-27T04:11:40Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The transition to a renewable electricity system and its interactions with other policy aims","715132||715132","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC","H2020||H2020",,"85117767161",,"000714438500002","Renew.

To combat this, many companies have made zero-deforestation commitments (ZDCs), policies to purchase goods only from deforestation-free producers. It is hoped that these private supply chain policies can reduce producers’ incentives to deforest and achieve deforestation at scale in a context of insufficient territorial governance. However, evidence for ZDCs’ efficacy remains unclear, particularly due to key knowledge gaps stemming from: i) the heterogenous exposure of farmers to ZDC companies over time and space, ii) incomplete implementation to all actors involved in ZDC supply chains, and iii) the unclear impact of political context in implementing regions. The goal of this dissertation is to address each of these uncertainties, using evidence from the soy and cattle sectors of the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado. Chapter 2 of this thesis uses multivariate regression to assess how local variations in ZDC exposure, measured by estimating the municipal-level market share of ZDC companies, influenced conservation outcomes in the cattle sector of the Brazilian Amazon. This chapter finds that for the Amazonian portions of the Brazilian states of Pará, Rondônia, and Mato Grosso, 7,000 ± 4,000 km2 (15 ± 8%) of deforestation was avoided due to ZDCs between 2010 and 2018, and that had all firms adopted an effective ZDC, deforestation could have dropped by 24,000 ± 13,000 km2 (50 ± 28%). These results suggest that ZDCs in the Brazilian cattle sector are reducing deforestation, but only where ZDC market share is high. Chapter 3 examines both how the presence of non-ZDC buyers and ZDC companies’ failure to monitor indirect suppliers’ deforestation affects the ZDC effectiveness in the cattle sector of Pará. It also investigates whether these two policy weaknesses are associated with leakage. This is achieved by developing a property level dataset of direct and indirect cattle suppliers in the state of Pará to differentiate producers’ supply chain tier and ZDC treatment. In line with Chapter 2, this chapter finds that incomplete adoption is the biggest challenge to ZDC effectiveness, as this allows producers to avoid ZDCs and business-as-usual deforestation to continue.  Yet cattle laundering, whereby indirect suppliers to ZDC supply chains continue to deforest and sell through “clean” direct suppliers, is also linked to a substantial amount of deforestation. This pathway seems particularly linked to leakage, as direct ZDC suppliers who deforest are significantly more likely to switch to supplying ZDC firms indirectly than direct ZDC suppliers who do not deforest. The final research chapter of this thesis presents the concept of the “sacrifice frontier” to explain the role that local political narratives have on producers’ resistance to supply chain policies. I suggest that sacrifice frontiers are regions where due to reinforcing perceptions of suitability for agricultural expansion, there is a heightened likelihood of political consolidation by agribusiness interests, low levels of public and private policy implementation, high levels of agglomeration, and low perceived risks to frontier expansion, making rapid land use change especially probable. Using data from semi-structured interviews with soy value chain members in the Matopiba region collected in 2018, this chapter examines to what extent the Cerrado aligns with this characterization and the potential implications that being a sacrifice frontier has for the effectiveness of private policies in such regions. This chapter finds the Cerrado closely corresponds to the sacrifice frontier concept and that as a result, the implementation of ZDCs in the region is highly challenging, as producers and agribusiness institutions are resistant to ZDC adoption locally and feel entitled to deforest. These results suggest that in sacrifice frontiers, such as the Cerrado, interventions need to go beyond market exclusion and alter prevailing narratives surrounding agricultural expansion, such as via interventions that consider the specific issues faced by local producers, or via more inclusive, jurisdictional-level positive incentives, technical support, and capacity building.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539299",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539299","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","sustainability||Deforestation||Private policy||Brazil||zero-deforestation commitment||environment","Can companies end deforestation?

It argues that interdisciplinarity is a means to better approach current societal chal- lenges and therefore to achieve meaningful impact on current problems, as the ones presented in this book. We seek to open a fruitful pathway to reflect on the urgent demand to bridge knowledges, perspectives and insights, that help to overcome crisis such as the current Covid-19 pandemic. In so doing, we identify challenges coming from a national and international perspective and we analyze them in the light of a Uruguayan interdisciplinary program: the Núcleo de Ingeniería Biomédica of the Universidad de la República (Uruguay). This program has been working for almost 40 years in the interface between Medicine and Engineering, training sci- entists and researchers in how to foster meaningful solutions to health problems. Lessons learnt and successful narratives are presented as means to promote inter- disciplinary collaborations between these and other fields of knowledge. We also build on general and also specific research strands that have historically pursued collaborations among different disciplines to approach complex problems. Several examples have also been provided in this book so as to include two powerful ideas to leverage BME and MI as means to achieve socially robust solutions for health and well-being. As chapters in this book show, the development of biomedical devices, software and systems must stem from clinical wish lists and desiderata.

Here, we show the importance of the interplay between human societies and Earth systems in creating tipping points and cascading effects and the way they in turn affect sustainability and security. The lack of modeling of these links can lead to an underestimation of climate and societal risks as well as how societal tipping points can be harnessed to moderate physical impacts. This calls for the systematic development of models for a better integration and understanding of Earth and human systems at different spatial and temporal scales, specifically those that enable decision-making to reduce the likelihood of crossing local or global tipping points.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000524670",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ac42fd","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524670","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","tipping points||cascading effects||coupling of natural and human Earth systems||telecoupling||extreme events","Perspectives on tipping points in integrated models of the natural and human Earth system: cascading effects and telecoupling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-12T03:56:51Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"REmote Climate Effects and their Impact on European sustainability, Policy and Trade","820712","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,"85123779660",,"000739050900001","Environ.

Our study focuses on the context of ""Latin American Public Universities."" We examine the following research questions: (i) How is transdisciplinarity conceptualized in university policy and what are the conditions for its institutionalization? (ii) What lessons can be drawn more broadly from the role of university policy in the process of institutionalizing transdisciplinarity? To address these questions, we take the Universidad de Chile as a case study and apply a qualitative methodology of content analysis of university policy documents in the period 2006-2021. Grounded on empirical data, we elaborate on the concept of ""situated transdisciplinarity"" that emerges from the interplay between practices and policy at the Universidad de Chile and serves as a tool for future institutionalizing processes.

In particular, climate change and increasing globalization pose challenges to societies worldwide. On the one hand, such changes can affect the exposure, sensitivity, or adaptive capacity of individuals or entire societies, thus increasing their vulnerability to shocks (e.g., storms or sudden market price collapse) and stressors (e.g., droughts or high cost of education). On the other hand, such changes may themselves impact livelihoods directly by causing the aforementioned shocks and stressors. The example of North Vanuatu in the South Pacific illustrates the extent to which these changes and their consequences are already part of the reality of life for the region’s citizens. For example, local food production and income opportunities are already being affected by the impacts of climate change. In addition, North Vanuatu is transitioning from a subsistence economy to a market economy and is experiencing significant sociocultural change, with traditional values and norms changing or increasingly being replaced. These changes can also affect livelihoods by facilitating or impeding access to livelihood assets. However, the question of how these transformations in the environment, society, and economy lead to vulnerabilities and how this can affect the living conditions of society in general and food security in particular has not yet been fully clarified. Specifically, there are only few studies that use a concrete example (i.e., case studies) to show how local vulnerabilities relate to transregional or even global dynamics. However, this understanding is essential to empowering affected people to recognize changes and their causes and effects and to respond to them with adequate adaptation strategies.  This desideratum leads to one of the central research questions of this dissertation: How are local vulnerabilities linked to global changes and their impacts? Answering this question requires an understanding of the causal relationships between cause, such as climate change, and local effect, such as crop failures. Previous studies have shown that local knowledge of affected populations is very useful, if not essential, in capturing the complex dynamics that shape vulnerabilities. Local knowledge enables an understanding of local conditions at a granularity that would otherwise be unattainable. In line with these findings, I place local knowledge and needs at the center of the analysis and address the role of local knowledge as a source of data for vulnerability research from a methodological perspective. I also place local knowledge centrally because this approach—according to the literature—ensures the relevance of the results and the implementability of the derived recommendations in the long term. Despite the importance of local knowledge, very little is known about how exactly local knowledge on vulnerability factors such as climate change, is generated, and, in particular, how local actors construct vulnerability-relevant causal relationships. These considerations lead to another central research question of this dissertation: How do the local people of North Vanuatu perceive change and its impact on their livelihoods, and what might influence this perception and associated knowledge?  The dissertation is based on a transdisciplinary (td) research design that combines various qualitative research methods, including semi-structured interviews, participant observations, focus group discussions, expert interviews, and workshops. The td approach ensured an integrative study that links scientific findings and local knowledge, and puts local problem perception, problem identification, and problem structuring at the center of the analysis. The results of this dissertation shed light on how study participants in North Vanuatu relate potential vulnerabilities, particularly related to food insecurity, to environmental, social, and economic changes. According to study participants, crop failures and a decline in garden productivity are at least partially attributable to the impacts of climate change. While these disruptions in food production can have significant consequences, they allegedly do not threaten food security, at least for the present. However, the results also show how the attribution of perceived problems to external causes, such as climate change, is supplemented or even replaced by internal causal factors during and because of a participatory reflection process. For example, study participants explain that changes in crop rotation or planting times can also directly lead to lower harvests or increase the vulnerability of gardens to severe climatic conditions such as drought. The results also suggest that these changes in farming practices are based on economic decision-making logic aimed at maximizing income, which has only recently been made possible by economic developments and their implications, such as improved access to the market. However, new market access can also lead to an overall reduction in livelihood vulnerability by enabling the development of additional sources of income and food that complement existing (subsistence-oriented) strategies, thereby leading to a reduction in one-sided dependencies. The results illustrate the multidimensional character of vulnerability. On the one hand, vulnerability factors can emerge and have an impact at the local level; thus they are at least partially within the scope of action of those affected. On the other hand, vulnerability factors can be embedded in broader dynamics and processes that transcend multiple temporal and spatial scales, such as globalization. Therefore, such vulnerability factors can be influenced by those affected only with difficulty or not at all. Furthermore, the research process and results highlight the importance and usefulness of local knowledge to understand the complexities around vulnerabilities. In particular, local knowledge has helped link local problems, such as lower productivity of gardens, to possible causes, such as changes in farming practices. However, results also suggest that prevailing narratives, such as those about the impacts of climate change, can significantly influence the attribution of local problems to possible causes. On the one hand, these narratives are incorporated in local knowledge and thus influence the individual perceptions of local people. On the other hand, hegemonic narratives can generate social desirability.  Furthermore, the findings point to the need to understand the complex individual circumstances of people to gain relevant insights for their adaptation to changing conditions when analyzing vulnerabilities. This is because prevailing norms and values can lead to different social groups having different scopes of action and opportunities to acquire the necessary capabilities and strategies to adapt to new conditions. Specifically, this has been illustrated by the social categories of gender and age. The dissertation contributes to empirical knowledge on factors that significantly influence livelihood vulnerability in North Vanuatu. In addition, the dissertation illustrates the challenges associated with incorporating local knowledge into vulnerability analyses and provides insights on how to overcome these challenges. At the same time, it highlights the necessity and usefulness of local knowledge for such analyses to develop relevant strategies that enable people to adapt their livelihoods to changing conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000578738",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/578738","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Vulnerability factors||Food insecurity||Livelihood vulnerability||Climate change||Vanuatu||Transdisciplinary research||Social desirability bias||Subsistence-based livelihoods","Vulnerability of rural livelihoods in North Vanuatu to climate and socioeconomic change",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences||DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::300 - Social sciences",,"2022-10-31T20:43:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"(Agro)ecosystem-based livelihoods in an environment of climate change and socio-economic transformation in northern Vanuatu","ETH-15 18-1","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants","28428",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Research and practice therefore describe TD as well-suited for addressing complex sustainability challenges. However, the effects of TD on sustainable development are difficult to assess, as such projects produce manifold, interconnected effects through nonlinear processes, contingent on different contexts. In this article, we use a systematic literature review of 101 TD projects to assess the different effects of TD projects and their interconnections. We distinguish between North-South TD projects and TD projects within the global North. Due to differences in terms of historical development and context, we expect to observe differences in the effects they achieve. We find that North-South projects scored higher for societal effects and uptake of knowledge, while projects in the global North produced more tangible outputs, such as academic publications. In terms of interconnections of effects, N-S projects emphasize inclusion more strongly than global North projects, due to an increased awareness of differences between different project participants. However, effects related to uptake of knowledge, learning, and societal effects are often interconnected in both types of projects. This article improves our understanding of the prominence of different effects of TD projects, the interconnections between effects they produce, and the differences between N-S and North projects. Acknowledging this diversity of effects is important, not least for evaluating the efficacy of TD projects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000566893",,,,"10.1016/j.crsust.2022.100180","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566893","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Transdisciplinary research||Sustainable development||Project effects||North-South research partnerships||Evaluation","What are the effects of transdisciplinary research projects in the global North and South?

We used a novel transdisciplinary methodology combining participatory outcome definition with household surveys, biophysical measurements, satellite data and counterfactual analysis. Utilising our climate resilience framework, we find that certification has a strong effect on the adoption of basic management, e.g. fertilization, but a weak influence on more complex resilience strategies, e.g. agroforest diversification. Beyond certification, we identify strong regional patterns in resilience.

However, transport accounts for 24% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is the largest emitting sector in many developed countries. While other sectors such as housing and industry have been able to reduce their emissions in recent decades, emissions from the transport sector are increasing substantially in some countries. One of the reasons we have not succeeded in reducing transport-related GHG emissions is the increasing share of larger and more powerful vehicles in new car registrations. It is estimated that the rise of sport-utility-vehicles (SUVs) and large cars just about cancel the emission reductions we would have acquired from the increasing adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Other externalities are often neglected, such as increases in pedestrian fatalities and particulate matter emissions that are harmful to health. To counteract these negative externalities, scholars suggest spurring the adoption of BEVs. BEVs can drastically decrease GHG emissions from a lifecycle perspective (cradle to grave) compared to conventional cars fuelled by gasoline and diesel, if the electricity used for charging the BEV stem from renewable energy sources, e.g., solar and wind. Yet, simply replacing conventional cars with large BEVs could lead to potential problems such as increased GHGs and other toxic emissions for the production of large batteries, raw material depletion and supply-chain shortages, increased particulate matter emissions, increased accident severity and increased land use. A small BEV with a usable range of 250km is capable to satisfy more than 96% of trips per year on average, without the need for recharging during the day, given that one could charge the BEV at home. Hence, the number of times per year, where one would need to opt for an alternative is rare. The occasional long-range and special purpose trips (e.g., including large luggage) could be conducted by emerging mobility services like carsharing, car-rental, public transport or the convenient integration of these mobility services in one app, called Mobility as a Service (MaaS). If people would switch from owning a large car to a smaller BEV, capable to satisfy almost all trips and combine it with the occasional use of mobility service, substantial sustainability benefits could be possible.  In this thesis, I investigate these alternative mobility lifestyles to owning a large car by conducting several choice experiments within the Swiss Household Energy Demand Survey in 2018 and 2020. In the first contribution, I investigate the challenges and needs of Swiss households in using MaaS for commuting, weekday leisure and weekend trips. The results underline the importance of experience with mobility services like carsharing and public transport, which increases the openness to use MaaS. The needs in using MaaS differ regarding the trip purpose, where fast transfer times and low price are important for commuting, and luggage carrying possibilities and flexibility are important for leisure trips. Policies directly addressing consumers, e.g., increasing fuel levies, vehicle import restrictions and a ban of non-electric vehicles in the city centre, were found to significantly increase the openness to use MaaS. This could be specifically relevant for the hard-to reach groups, i.e., frequent car users.  In the second contribution, I directly investigate the effect from experience with carsharing on the likelihood to opt for a micro to mid-sized BEV as the next car replacement for Swiss households. By controlling for a large set of potential influential variables like socio-demographics, mobility characteristics, attitudes, and values, I find a significant correlation between carsharing experience and likelihood to choose a micro to mid-sized BEV for people living in the countryside and agglomerations. This finding suggests that owning a small BEV in combination with mobility services could be marketed especially to people who live outside the city and rely on a car. I am the first to find an additional potential sustainable effect resulting from experience with carsharing, that is, deciding to own a smaller car due to the certainty of having access to long-distance and specialized vehicles when needed. In the third contribution, I investigate the probability of Swiss households to choose a mobility lifestyle comprising the ownership of a small BEV in combination with mobility services for long-range trips. By including different push and pull measures as treatments, I find that providing charging at home and at work can significantly increase the probability to switch from previously owning a conventional car to owning a small BEV and using carsharing, car-rental and public transport for occasional long-range trips, especially for households that currently own large cars. The provision of carsharing and car-rental close to the place of residents increases the openness to switch as well. By combining secured charging at home and at work with a 50% fuel tax, up to 51% of conventional car-owning households would switch to own a small BEV and occasional use mobility services for long-range trips.  Two conclusions for society, mobility planners, and policy makers emerge from my findings. First, experience with carsharing can encourage willingness to use MaaS, as well as the purchase of a small BEV. Second, a large proportion of households with conventional vehicles could be convinced to switch to a small BEV and combine it with mobility services through a combination of push and pull measures. The work can serve as a guide on how to curb or stop the trend towards ever larger cars and boost the acceptance and attractiveness of BEVs and mobility services alike.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583791",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583791","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Sustainable transport||Battery electric vehicle||Push pull-effects||choice experiments||Car size||Mobility as a Service (MaaS)","Sustainable transformation of the mobility system",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment",,"2022-11-29T13:19:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"28639",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this doctoral project, I have conducted basic research on the question of why and how that affective intensity and the polarization of people’s responses to wildlife are generated. I have chosen wolves, corvids, and spiders as model cases of controversial wildlife because the comparison of ecologically disparate animals allows for identifying overarching dynamics in human-wildlife relations. I have analyzed extant literature on these model animals in a meta-ethnographic approach, and collected empirical data through in-depth interviews with 20 stakeholders. In this thesis, I report on five investigations that contribute to answering the main research question: I) In an eclectic literature review on natural and social scientific, as well as cultural works, I show that despite their dissimilar ecologies, wolves, corvids and spiders are portrayed in similar ways. I propose that congruent perceptions of these animals may be caused since wolves, corvids, and spiders concurrently raise questions regarding humans’ role in nature, activate a motivation for exerting or ceding control, and evoke symbolic associations to “darkness”. II) I elucidate the associations to darkness evoked by wildlife, considering wolves as an example. By reference to portrays of wolves in selected media reports, I depict how negative feelings towards wolves partly correspond to aspects of actual wolf behavior, which meet humans’ definition of evilness. These associations jointly feed into the stereotype of a Big Bad Wolf that may contribute to the emotional intensity seen in the societal debates about wolves. III) Again focusing on wolves as a paradigmatic case of controversial wildlife, a multi-method approach provides qualitative as well as quantitative evidence for the impact of nature- and wildlife- related value orientations and beliefs on people’s responses to wildlife. My co-authors and I carve out how the different narratives that people hold about nature in general and about wolves in particular map onto the management options they favor. Specifically, we identify a continuum of value orientations ranging from a “beings-focused, harmony-oriented, wolf-favoring” extreme to a “human-focused, dominion-oriented, wolf-critical” extreme, that correlates with a continuum of management directives that ranges from an “allowing” to a “controlling” pole. IV) Comparing the case of wolves with the other two model animals, I present a particular dynamic impacting human-wildlife encounters: People's feeling of being personally targeted by wild animals' behavior.  The perception of wildlife as holding intentions towards humans individually or collectively, emotionally charges human-wildlife interactions in both positive and negative ways and thus contributes to people’s intense and polarized reactions to wildlife. I identify 12 intentions attributed to wildlife that can be reduced to four essential motivational states ascribed to wildlife: rebellion against human dominance, menace of humans or their belongings, relationality offered to people, and the absence of human-focused intentions. V) Integrating these findings and corroborating them with further deductive as well as inductive data analyses, I derive a framework for explaining in detail how a person’s response to wildlife is formed through the interaction of three layers of influences: Person-specific factors – such as a person’s biography, idiosyncratic life themes, and utopian visions – combine with species-specific factors – mediated by an individual’s representation of a wildlife species –, and with overarching factors such as their ideas about humans' role in nature, their individual motivation for control, and their relations to the shadow-aspects within themselves. Thus, a person’s stance to a wildlife species is generated, which coalesces or conflicts with other individuals’ views, bringing forth the intense and polarized debates on wildlife and on wildlife management that we see on the societal scale. In sum, the comparison of human relations to three biologically disparate wild animals evidences that human-wildlife conflicts and avenues to human-wildlife coexistence hinge not exclusively on the objective challenges raised by wildlife behavior. Instead, human psychology interacts with wildlife ecology, bringing forth representations of wild animals and perceptions of wildlife behavior conducive to either conflict or coexistence of humans and wildlife.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000586996",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/586996","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Human-Wildlife-Conflicts||Human-Wildlife-Coexistence||Wolves||Corvids||Spiders||Human Dimensions||Attitudes||Wildlife||Values||Beliefs||Environmental Psychology||Environmental Humanities||Qualitative Research","The Psychology of Human Relations to Wildlife: Factors and Processes Contributing to Intense and Polarized Reactions to Wild Animals",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::1 - Philosophy & psychology::150 - Psychology",,"2022-12-14T09:34:58Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"28775",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite poor recognition and even a lack of research conditions, experiences involving different societal actors and types of collaboration have developed across the region. These experiences form a collection of integration and implementation processes not yet fully systematised in a way that serves other cases. This paper aims to contribute to the discussion of how expertise is defined in integration and implementation processes in Latin America. To re-signify collaborative practices in the region, a critical perspective is applied, and a heuristic framework is built that comprehends the 'situated' and relational dimensions of expertise. This framework is tested to study five cases from Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay related to territorial planning, gender and knowledge, coastal management and the provision of climate services. These concepts are compared on the basis of the three dimensions comprising the framework-context, actors and methods -and the intersections among them. Applying a qualitative methodology and auto-ethnography, we identified the main features of situated expertise in Latin America, that is, engaging marginalised societal actors, fostering greater participation, acknowledging power imbalances, managing conflicts and contradicting perspectives, and directing an ethical-political engagement in the research process. As a result, situated expertise encompasses not only the situatedness of practices and processes, but also their political (and potentially transformative) dimensions in tracing power imbalances. This paper then argues that this situated aspect of expertise is relevant for conducting more context-sensitive integration and implementation processes in Latin America, thus contributing to the ethical-political dimension on how expertise is defined, embodied and enacted in vulnerable contexts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000551845",,"2662-9992",,"10.1057/s41599-022-01203-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551845","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Situated expertise in integration and implementation processes in Latin America",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-11T04:58:13Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85130887805",,"000803304600001",,"1","Humanities and Social Sciences Communications","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Due to their increasing incidence and impact on global health and the economy, the emergence of zoonoses is a major public health challenge. Here, we use a biogeographic approach to predict future hotspots and determine the factors influencing disease emergence. We have focused on the following three viral disease groups of concern: Filoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Henipaviruses. Methods: We modelled presence–absence data in spatially explicit binomial and zero-inflation binomial logistic regressions with and without autoregression. Presence data were extracted from published studies for the three EID groups. Various environmental and demographical rasters were used to explain the distribution of the EIDs. True Skill Statistic and deviance parameters were used to compare the accuracy of the different models. Results: For each group of viruses, we were able to identify and map areas at high risk of disease emergence based on the spatial distribution of the disease reservoirs and hosts of the three viral groups. Common influencing factors of disease emergence were climatic covariates (minimum temperature and rainfall) and human-induced land modifications. Conclusions: Using topographical, climatic, and previous disease outbreak reports, we can identify and predict future high-risk areas for disease emergence and their specific underlying human and environmental drivers. We suggest that such a predictive approach to EIDs should be carefully considered in the development of active surveillance systems for pathogen emergence and epidemics at local and global scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000558308",,,,"10.3390/tropicalmed7070124","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/558308","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Human-Altered Landscapes and Climate to Predict Human Infectious Disease Hotspots",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-17T07:28:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85133610548",,,,"7","Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Climate change and population growth coupled with increased urbanization will likely expand the demand for water services, which are already confronted with water scarcity due to hydro-climatic variability. On top of these challenges, ageing water supply and sanitation infrastructures are facing underinvestment and shrinking subsidies. Integrating decentralized water technologies that are multi-functional and fit-for-purpose could enable a more efficient treatment of resources and diversify water assets, creating mixed-scale or hybrid water systems. Although such technological solutions already exist, the implementation rate remains low, as the transition of infrastructures also necessitates institutional change, altering, e.g., user practices, regulations, organizational structures and markets. As institutions provide stability and regularity to urban water infrastructures and their management, however, they are not easily changed.  Against this backdrop, this thesis investigates how shifts in urban water governance arrangements ¬– i.e. actor constellations, organizational structures, policies (instruments) and mechanisms – can overcome institutional inertia and steer infrastructure transitions. It examines how new actor constellations, altered or novel policy instruments and organizations support the integration of decentralized water technologies, enabling the development of more sustainable urban water infrastructures. Insights are drawn from four individual research papers, which are linked by the following overall research question that examines the different elements of urban water governance arrangements: how can urban water governance arrangements foster the implementation and operation of decentralized water technologies as part of hybrid infrastructures? As the papers follow different thematic priorities and associated sub-research questions, a plurality of conceptual approaches and methods is used, in addition to empirical cases. The papers mostly rely on qualitative methods, such as literature review, interviews, comparative case studies and process-tracing, besides one paper that applies the mixed-method of Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). In order to open the “black box” of urban water governance arrangements, this thesis first looks more broadly at the link between governance arrangements and decentralized water technologies. By investigating alternative urban water governance arrangements for hybrid water systems that have already been implemented in OECD countries and emerging economies, it shows that there remains a strong reliance on established policy instruments, such as regulatory and economic measures, for introducing decentralized water technologies. However, as local actors play more central roles in the implementation (and operation) process of decentralized water technologies than in conventional urban water management (UWM), policymakers supplement traditional policy instruments with voluntary, informative and “collaboration-inducing” instruments. These mixes of different policy instruments, which are currently being used for operating decentralized or modular water technologies, are further examined in this thesis. The investigations show that policy instrument mixes with both substantive – i.e. regulative, economic and informational instruments ¬– and procedural instruments are key for successfully operating decentralized water technologies. Analyzing the interplay between procedural instruments, which activate mechanisms such as participation and user responsibility, with different substantive policy instruments provides valuable insights on the supportive role of procedural tools in policy instrument mixes to the policy literature. Moreover, this thesis also examines how these policy instrument mixes are intentionally sequenced over time, in order to enable bottom-up transition processes of transitioning urban water infrastructures. By conceptualizing two local bottom-up policy sequencing patterns, i.e. strategic and reactive, this thesis shows that the strategic sequencing of policies and policy instruments is particularly successful in addressing potential institutional barriers and accelerating transition processes. The conceptual framework for investigating bottom-up policy sequencing patterns links current work on policy instrument mixes in transition studies with the policy sequencing literature in political sciences, thereby contributing to both research fields. The use of supportive, i.e. economic and procedural instruments, and deployment policies, i.e. regulatory instruments, enabled the creation of a favorable environment plus high public and political support for decentralized water technologies. Entrepreneurial actors, such as water utilities, building companies and consultancies, play a key role in particular in initiating a transition process, as they shape policy sequences by facilitating meetings and collaborations between different actors and providing education and information. Other important actors are grassroots initiatives that push for the implementation of decentralized water technologies. This thesis focused on a housing cooperative in the canton of Geneva in Switzerland, which is a case crucial for illuminating bottom-up processes of social and technological innovation through grassroots initiatives. The strategies of activities of such initiatives have not been systematically described and investigated. Hence, this thesis uses the concept of entrepreneurial strategies and applies it to grassroots initiatives to investigate their activities for initiating transitions, thereby contributing conceptually to the grassroots initiative literature. In doing so, it shows that strategies are used in a non-linear order and that strategy choice is impacted by the conduciveness of the local context and the degree of fit between the new ideas and the existing institutions.  By describing and analyzing governance practices in this multi-faceted manner, this thesis identifies opportunities and barriers for sustainable transitions of UWM. Overall, this thesis shows that urban governance arrangements integrate and operate decentralized water technologies as part of transitioning urban water infrastructures toward more sustainable modes by 1) using the whole portfolio of policy instruments by including procedural tools into instrument mixes that are 2) strategically sequenced throughout transition processes, which are 3) increasingly shaped by local actors, such as water utilities, housing cooperatives and technology end-users.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000554583",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/554583","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Urban water governance; urban water; socio-technical transitions; policy instrument mixes; policy sequencing; bottom-up transitions; entrepreneurial actors","Flexibility through hybridity: Governance arrangements for sustainable urban water systems",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::350 - Public administration",,"2022-06-24T12:49:06Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Challenges and Opportunities of Modular water Infrastructures for Greening the Swiss Economy (COMIX)","172366","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 73: Gesuch","28426",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Transdisciplinary research is considered a collaborative and integrative praxis grounded in different ways of knowing, acting and being. However, transdisciplinary research practices differ significantly in the relations between institutions and actors. These differences have an impact on how transdisciplinarity is institutionalised. There is a need to incorporate them into a larger framework of ongoing transformations of scientific timescales and spaces at universities. We present the results of a case study developed at Babes-Bolyai University (Romania). We discuss it against the background of three models of transdisciplinary knowledge production and two approaches of transdisciplinary problem-solving research. We apply a qualitative methodology of micro level analysis that explores research practices and their embeddedness in the institutional environment. We analyse conditions that enable transdisciplinary knowledge production and show how transdisciplinary institutionalisation can be better understood using the proposed framework applied to the case study. It could be shown that taking into consideration the differences in the models of transdisciplinary knowledge production proved to be useful to gain a deeper understanding of processes of institutionalising transdisciplinarity at universities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488020",,,,"10.1080/07294360.2021.1910208","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488020","en","Routledge","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Transdisciplinarity||knowledge production||Institutionalisation||Romanian university||case study","Models of transdisciplinary knowledge production at universities: a Romanian case study",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-02T08:24:22Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85104752172",,"000641369200001",,"5","Higher Education Research & Development","41","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Carbon-neutral transportation is feasible with electric motors powered by rechargeable batteries, though challenging if not impossible for long-haul commercial travel, particularly air travel. A promising solution are drop-in fuels (synthetic alternatives for petroleum-derived liquid hydrocarbon fuels such as kerosene, gasoline or diesel) made from H2O and CO2 by solar-driven processes. Among the many possible approaches, the thermochemical path using concentrated solar radiation as the source of high-temperature process heat offers potentially high production rates and efficiencies and can deliver truly carbon-neutral fuels if the required CO2 is obtained directly from atmospheric air. If H2O is also co-extracted from air, feedstock sourcing and fuel production can be co-located in desert regions with high solar irradiation and limited access to water resources. While individual steps of such a scheme have been implemented, we now demonstrate operation of the entire thermochemical solar fuel production chain, from H2O and CO2 captured directly from ambient air to the synthesis of drop-in transportation fuels (e.g. methanol, kerosene), with a modular 5-kWthermal pilot-scale solar system operated under real field conditions. We further identify the R&D efforts and discuss the economic viability and policies required to bring these solar fuels to market.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515596",,"0028-0836||1476-4687",,"10.1038/s41586-021-04174-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515596","en","Nature","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Drop-in Fuels from Sunlight and Air",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-17T13:13:32Z","2022-05-02",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Solar thermochemical production of fuels||Design of perovskite and doped-ceria redox materials for high performance solar thermochemical splitting of H2O and CO2||The transition to a renewable electricity system and its interactions with other policy aims","320541||162435||715132||320541||162435||715132||320541||162435||715132","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","EC||SNF||EC||EC||SNF||EC||EC||SNF||EC","FP7||Projekte MINT||H2020||FP7||Projekte MINT||H2020||FP7||Projekte MINT||H2020",,"85118492333",,"000734154400001",,"7891","Nature","601","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02130 - Dep.

We conducted a comparative qualitative study, interviewing 20 stakeholders on one of three ecologically disparate model animals. Through thematic analysis, we identified person-specific, species-specific, and overarching factors whose interplay shapes people's reactions to encounters with wildlife. The person-specific factors, individual people's biographic backgrounds and life themes, fuel the polarization of stances towards wildlife. The species-specific factors, people's mental images of wild animals, explain the particular character of different human-wildlife relations. The overarching factors, fundamental questions regarding the place of humans in nature or motivations of control over animal agents, stir the intensity inherent in human encounters with wildlife. This three-layer framework amends existing proposals by providing a cohesive system and an in-depth portrayal of shared and specific factors and processes in various human-wildlife relations and by elucidating their interaction in influencing people's responses to encounters with wild animals.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000568878",,"1424-2818","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/568878||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591201","10.3390/d14080591","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591318","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","human dimensions||wildlife||human-wildlife conflict||human-wildlife coexistence||human-wildlife relations||qualitative research||wolves||value orientations||control","Wolves, Crows, Spiders, and People: A Qualitative Study Yielding a Three-Layer Framework for Understanding Human-Wildlife Relations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-06T02:57:59Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85137359890",,"000845920000001",,"8","Diversity","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While the importance of transdisciplinary (Td) processes as a means to address societal problems is well-established, guidance for the intentional design of stakeholder interactions to meet specific goals, under different conditions and contexts, remains less explored. We propose the concept of critical design moments (CDMs) as a lens through which to identify key processes in the design of stakeholder interactions that affect the relevance and impact of its outcomes. We demonstrate how an approach using CDMs can help to make explicit not only the goals of stakeholder interactions, but also how these goals might be met through the process design of specific activities orienting these interactions. The CDMs were identified as part of the implementation of a Td winter school for early career researchers to provide them with real-world experiences of interacting with stakeholders and local residents of a community.

Due to the technological evolution in recent years, multi-hazard platforms have become common practice to provide real-time information to the public. Multi-hazard platforms allow to disseminate information about cascading effects and eliminate the need for people to download separate apps for the different hazards. However, providing information about multiple hazards on a single platform comes with various challenges: First, multiple messages can overstrain the public, causing confusion or inaction. Second, since hazards are different in their nature, intensity, return period, and the effects they have on society, their comparability is limited, complicating the aim of providing consistent hazard messages. Third, people struggle to understand that they often receive forecasts for weather-related hazards, whereas for earthquakes they mainly receive post-event information. With our study, we addressed these challenges by designing and testing different multi-hazard overviews and specific hazard messages, focusing not only on the actionability of the information but also on providing clear time indications.  For this purpose, we applied a transdisciplinary research approach. We first designed various multi-hazard overviews and hazard messages which were refined during five virtual workshops with scientists and other experts (N=15) from different fields. Second, we conducted a survey (N=601, between-subjects experiment) with the Swiss public to test whether our designs with time and action indications increase people’s intention to take actions and their correct interpretation of the information presented. We further assessed whether the personal factors of the theory of planned behavior also have an influence on people’s action taking and interpretation abilities.  Based on our findings we recommend to design multi-hazarad overviews as followed: a map with a list below containing information about the affected areas, the time and date of the event, and the recommended action (prepare, inform, act). This enhances people’s understanding of the information and intention to access further information. Regarding the hazard messages, we confirm the importance of the information elements: hazard type and level, affected areas, time, behavioral recommendations, possible impacts, and source. Further, we recommend adding a time- and action-related icon since we found that such an icon motivates people to take actions and ensures that they understand whether they should take immediate actions or still have time to prepare for an event. Thus, making sure that they take the right action at the right time. Moreover, a better understanding of the personal factors influencing people’s intention to take actions and their interpretation abilities allows the communication platforms to be tailored to specific needs of various groups.  To conclude, our multi-hazard overviews and specific hazard messages show that making information on multi-hazard platforms more actionable, time-oriented and understandable can prompt effective public response and therewith increases society’s resilience toward disasters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590143",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-244","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590143","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Communicating actionable and understandable event-related information on multi-hazard platforms",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2023-01-04T12:44:49Z",,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23-27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,"Real-time Earthquake Risk Reduction for Europe","821115","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Usually, they optimize the energy mix subject to engineering costs such as equipment and fuel. For onshore wind energy, some of these models use cost-potential curves that indicate how much electricity can be generated at what cost. These curves are upward sloping mainly because windy sites are occupied first and further expanding wind energy means deploying less favorable resources. Meanwhile, real-world wind energy expansion is curbed by local resistance, regulatory constraints, and legal challenges. This presumably reflects the perceived adverse effect that onshore wind energy has on the local human population, as well as other negative external effects. These disamenity costs are at the core of this paper. We provide a comprehensive and consistent set of cost-potential curves of wind energy for all European countries that include disamenity costs, and which can be used in energy system modeling. We combine existing valuation of disamenity costs from the literature that describe the costs as a function of the distance between turbine and households with gridded population data, granular geospatial data of wind speeds, and additional land-use constraints to calculate such curves. We find that disamenity costs are not a game changer: for most countries and assumptions, the marginal levelized cost of onshore wind energy increase by 0.2-12.5 euro/MWh.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000611087",,"0924-6460||1573-1502","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589481||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580466","10.1007/s10640-022-00746-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/611087","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Cost-potential curves||Energy system modeling||Disamenity costs||Onshore wind energy||Setback distances","Cost-Potential Curves of Onshore Wind Energy: the Role of Disamenity Costs",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-10T10:03:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000892899000001","Environ Resource Econ",,"Environmental and Resource Economics",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In both countries, cocoa is the primary perennial crop, providing income to almost two million farmers. Yet precise maps of cocoa planted area are missing, hindering accurate quantification of expansion in protected areas, production and yields, and limiting information available for improved sustainability governance. Here, we combine cocoa plantation data with publicly available satellite imagery in a deep learning framework and create high-resolution maps of cocoa plantations for both countries, validated in situ. Our results suggest that cocoa cultivation is an underlying driver of over 37% and 13% of forest loss in protected areas in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, respectively, and that official reports substantially underestimate the planted area, up to 40% in Ghana. These maps serve as a crucial building block to advance understanding of conservation and economic development in cocoa producing regions.",,,,"2662-1355",,"10.48550/ARXIV.2206.06119","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/592700","en","Nature",,,"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)||Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)||FOS: Computer and information sciences","Satellite-based high-resolution maps of cocoa for Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2023-01-16T13:05:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nat Food",,"Nature Food",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
