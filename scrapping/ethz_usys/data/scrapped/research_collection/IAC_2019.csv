However, stratocumulus are also prevalent in high latitudes, where they often occur as mixed‐phase clouds. Yet little research has been conducted regarding mechanisms of cloud organization in the mixed‐phase regime. In cloud‐resolving model simulations we investigate the processes driving organization in open‐cell mixed‐phase stratocumuli. Similar to warm‐phase clouds, mixed‐phase clouds develop a subcloud circulation of evaporated/sublimated precipitation, cold pool formation, and consecutive updrafts driving new convective cells. For a larger ice to liquid water ratio, we find locally stronger precipitation and larger cloud cells. Hence, a higher concentration of ice nucleating particles can induce a breakup of the stratocumulus organization, with implications for the radiative balance at the surface. A decrease in cloud condensation nuclei concentration is also found to intensify precipitation and impact cloud organization.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000384642",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2019GL084959","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/384642","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Mixed‐phase clouds||Cloud organization||Boundary layer dynamics||Cold pools","Cloud Ice Processes Enhance Spatial Scales of Organization in Arctic Stratocumulus","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-11T11:09:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85076285229",,"000500065500001","Geophys.

Such aerosol–cloud closure experiments are required (a) to better understand aerosol–cloud interaction in the case of mixed-phase clouds, (b) to explore to what extent heterogeneous ice nucleation can contribute to cirrus formation, which is usually controlled by homogeneous freezing, and (c) to check the usefulness of available INPC parameterization schemes, applied to lidar profiles of aerosol optical and microphysical properties up to the tropopause level. The INPC–ICNC closure studies were conducted in Cyprus (Limassol and Nicosia) during a 6-week field campaign in March–April 2015 and during the 17-month CyCARE (Cyprus Clouds Aerosol and Rain Experiment) campaign. The focus was on altocumulus and cirrus layers which developed in pronounced Saharan dust layers at heights from 5 to 11 km. As a highlight, a long-lasting cirrus event was studied which was linked to the development of a very strong dust-infused baroclinic storm (DIBS) over Algeria. The DIBS was associated with strong convective cloud development and lifted large amounts of Saharan dust into the upper troposphere, where the dust influenced the evolution of an unusually large anvil cirrus shield and the subsequent transformation into an cirrus uncinus cloud system extending from the eastern Mediterranean to central Asia, and thus over more than 3500 km. Cloud top temperatures of the three discussed closure study cases ranged from −20 to −57 ∘C. The INPC was estimated from polarization/Raman lidar observations in combination with published INPC parameterization schemes, whereas the ICNC was retrieved from combined Doppler lidar, aerosol lidar, and cloud radar observations of the terminal velocity of falling ice crystals, radar reflectivity, and lidar backscatter in combination with the modeling of backscattering at the 532 and 8.5 mm wavelengths. A good-to-acceptable agreement between INPC (observed before and after the occurrence of the cloud layer under investigation) and ICNC values was found in the discussed three proof-of-concept closure experiments. In these case studies, INPC and ICNC values matched within an order of magnitude (i.e., within the uncertainty ranges of the INPC and ICNC estimates), and they ranged from 0.1 to 10 L−1 in the altocumulus layers and 1 to 50 L−1 in the cirrus layers observed between 8 and 11 km height. The successful closure experiments corroborate the important role of heterogeneous ice nucleation in atmospheric ice formation processes when mineral dust is present. The observed long-lasting cirrus event could be fully explained by the presence of dust, i.e., without the need for homogeneous ice nucleation processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000387236",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-15087-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387236","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ice-nucleating particle versus ice crystal number concentrationin altocumulus and cirrus layers embedded in Saharan dust:a closure study","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-29T15:55:08Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding","603445","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,"85072129265",,"000502996800003","Atmos. chem. phys.","23","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Modelling at convection-permitting scales has been deemed necessary to reproduce extreme summer precipitation at local scale. Here we analyze multi-model ensembles and apply a 3 km horizontal resolution model over four regions across Europe (S. Norway, Denmark, Benelux and Albania) and find very good agreement with observed daily and hourly summer precipitation extremes. Projections show that daily extreme precipitation intensifies compared to the mean in all regions and across a wide range of models and resolutions. Hourly and 10 min extremes intensify at a higher rate in nearly all regions. Unlike most recent studies, we do not find sub-daily precipitation extremes increasing much more than 7%/°C, even for sub-hourly extremes, but this may be due to robust summer drying over large parts of Europe. However, the absolute strongest local daily precipitation event in a 20 year period will increase by 10%–20%/°C. At the same time, model projections strongly indicate that summer drying will be more pronounced for extremely dry years.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000385564",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab549c","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/385564","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Extreme precipitation||Convection-permitting modelling||Summer precipitation||Europe||Regional climate modelling||Global climate modelling||Intensification of extremes","Intensification of summer precipitation with shorter time-scales in Europe","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-13T13:40:20Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000514833200025","Environ.

This study evaluates the representation of blocking in the new global ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic NWP and climate model ICON and links model mean state biases to observed blocking deviations. Blocking is identified using both an anomaly and a flow reversal approach in an eight member ensemble of 15‑year AMIP-type ICON simulations and verified against ERA Interim reanalyses. Either approach demonstrates a good representation of annual blocking frequencies in ICON. Deviations emerge when considering individual seasons. In the anomaly framework, enhanced blocking occurrence in the mid-latitude Pacific domain during winter and spring and a marked underestimation of blocking in the Euro-Atlantic region are found during summer. Moreover, this approach indicates a general underestimation of blocking at higher latitudes. The flow reversal index reveals the often reported underestimation of blocking in the Euro-Atlantic region during winter. Furthermore, increased blocking activity in the Pacific and Greenland region during spring and decreased blocking occurrence at high latitudes in summer are found. Focusing on the anomaly approach, we assess how the model mean state influences blocking identification. A systematically higher tropopause, forced by a cold bias in the lower stratosphere, reduces diagnosed blocking frequencies at higher latitudes especially during summer. This goes along with a reduction in blocking size, duration, and intensity. While confirming an overall good representation of blocking in ICON, this study demonstrates how mean state biases can crucially affect the identification of blocking and that blocking deviations have to be interpreted with caution as they are highly dependent on the exact diagnostic used.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000387051",,"0941-2948||1610-1227",,"10.1127/metz/2019/0967","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387051","en","Borntraeger","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Atmospheric blocking||ICON||Blocking identif cation||Model evaluation||Northern Hemisphere","Representation of atmospheric blocking in the new global non-hydrostatic weather prediction model ICON","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-22T03:17:18Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Diabatic processes in North Atlantic weather systems: synoptic and mesoscale dynamics","165941","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,,"000501530300005","Meteorol.

Metrics are used to aggregate and compare emissions of short- and long-lived GHGs and need to account for the difference in both magnitude and persistence of their climatic effects. Different metrics describe different approaches and perspectives, and hence yield different numerical estimates for aggregated GHG emissions. When interpreting GHG emission reduction targets, being mindful of the underlying metrical choices thus proves to be essential. Here we present the impact a recently proposed GHG metric related to the concept of CO2 forcing-equivalent emissions (called GWP*) would have on the internal consistency and environmental integrity of the Paris Agreement. We show that interpreting the Paris Agreement goals in a metric like GWP* that is significantly different from the standard metric used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report can lead to profound inconsistencies in the mitigation architecture of the Agreement. It could even undermine the integrity of the Agreement's mitigation target altogether by failing to deliver net-zero CO2 emissions and therewith failing to ensure warming is halted. Our results indicate that great care needs to be taken when applying new concepts that appear scientifically favourable to a pre-existing climate policy context.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000389707",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab56e7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/389707","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Global warming potentials||Paris agreement||Net-zero","Inconsistencies when applying novel metrics for emissions accounting to the Paris agreement","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-13T12:40:19Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constraining uncertainty of multi decadal climate projections","820829","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85080144270",,"000514833200030","Environ.

To robustly quantify uncertainty in multi-model ensembles, inter-dependencies between models as well as a models ability to reproduce observations should be considered. Here, a model weighting approach, which accounts for both independence and performance, is applied to European temperature and precipitation projections from the CMIP5 archive. Two future periods representing mid- and end-of-century conditions driven by the high-emission scenario RCP8.5 are investigated. To inform the weighting, six diagnostics based on three observational estimates are used to also account for uncertainty in the observational record. Our findings show that weighting the ensemble can reduce the interquartile spread by more than 20% in some regions, increasing the reliability of projected changes. The mean temperature change is most notably impacted by the weighting in the Mediterranean, where it is found to be 0.35 °C higher than the unweighted mean in the end-of-century period. For precipitation the largest differences are found for Northern Europe, with a relative decrease in precipitation of 2.4% and 3.4% for the two future periods compared to the unweighted case. Based on a perfect model test, it is found that weighting the ensemble leads to an increase in the investigated skill score for temperature and precipitation while minimizing the probability of overfitting.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000384838",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab492f","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/384838","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Model weighting||Climate models||CMIP5||Europe||EUCP||Temperature||Precipitation","Quantifying uncertainty in European climate projections using combined performance-independence weighting","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-11T14:41:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"European Climate Prediction System||Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach","776613||641816","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100007352","EC||SBFI","H2020||H2020",,,,"85081654925",,"000499948800001","Environ.

In such overshoot scenarios, a given temperature limit is first exceeded and later returned to, under the assumption of large‐scale deliberate Carbon Dioxide Removal from the atmosphere (CDR). Here we show that although such strategy might result in a reversal of global mean temperature, the carbon cycle exhibits path‐dependence. After an overshoot, more carbon is stored in the ocean and less on land compared to a scenario with the same cumulative CO2 emissions but no overshoot. The near‐path independence of surface air temperature arises despite the path dependence in the carbon cycle, as it is offset by path dependence in the thermal response of the ocean. Such behaviour has important implications for carbon budgets (i.e. the total amount of CO2 emissions consistent with holding warming to a given level), which do not differ much among scenarios that entail different levels of overshoot. Therefore, the concept of a carbon budget remains robust for scenarios with low levels of overshoot (up to 300 PgC overshoot considered here) but should be used with caution for higher levels of overshoot, particularly for limiting the environmental change in dimensions other than global mean temperature rise.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000373006",,"2328-4277",,"10.1029/2019ef001312","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/373006","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Carbon budgets||Paris Agreement||overshoot scenarios||temperature overshoot||artificial carbon dioxide removal||net‐negative emissions","Path independence of carbon budgets when meeting a stringent global mean temperature target after an overshoot","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-26T10:59:59Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constraining uncertainty of multi decadal climate projections","820829","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85076100112",,"000500396300001",,"12","Earth's Future","7","ETH Zürich||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To assess their predictability and how they are projected to change under global warming, it is crucial to improve our understanding of the underlying processes affecting their occurrence and intensity under present‐day climate conditions. Beside greenhouse gas forcing, processes in the different components of the climate system—in particular the land surface, atmospheric circulation, and the oceans—may play a key role in changing the odds for a particular event. This study aims to identify the role of the individual drivers for five heat waves (and, in some cases, of concurrent droughts) in the recent decade. Simulations are performed with the Community Earth System Model using nudging of horizontal atmospheric circulation and prescription of soil moisture. The fully constrained model accurately reproduces how anomalous an event was. Factorial experiments, which force the model toward observations for one or several key components at a time, allow us to identify how much of the observed temperature anomaly of each event can be attributed to each driver. Considering all analyzed events, atmospheric circulation and soil moisture play similarly important roles, each contributing between 20% and 70% to the events' anomalies. This highlights that the role of thermodynamics can be just as important as that of the dynamics for temperature extremes, a possibly underestimated feature. In addition, recent climate change amplified the events and contributed between 10% and 40% of the events' anomalies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000381735",,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2019JD030635","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/381735","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","heat waves||extreme events||global climate models||atmospheric nudging||soil moisture prescription","Identifying Key Driving Processes of Major Recent Heat Waves","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-01T14:24:03Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate","617518","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,"85075210489",,"000497179800001","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","22","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","124","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study introduces a global gridded monthly reconstruction of runoff covering the period from 1902 to 2014. In situ streamflow observations are used to train a machine learning algorithm that predicts monthly runoff rates based on antecedent precipitation and temperature from an atmospheric reanalysis. The accuracy of this reconstruction is assessed with cross-validation and compared with an independent set of discharge observations for large river basins. The presented dataset agrees on average better with the streamflow observations than an ensemble of 13 state-of-the art global hydrological model runoff simulations. We estimate a global long-term mean runoff of 38 452 km3 yr−1 in agreement with previous assessments. The temporal coverage of the reconstruction offers an unprecedented view on large-scale features of runoff variability in regions with limited data coverage, making it an ideal candidate for large-scale hydro-climatic process studies, water resource assessments, and evaluating and refining existing hydrological models. The paper closes with example applications fostering the understanding of global freshwater dynamics, interannual variability, drought propagation and the response of runoff to atmospheric teleconnections.

To assess if this process is a relevant source for CCN in the atmosphere, the reaction rate at atmospheric conditions must be known. Here we investigate the increase in CCN activity of soot particles rich in organic carbon at O3 concentrations ranging from 0–200 ppb and between 5 and 35 °C. We operated an ∼3 m3 aerosol chamber as a continuous-flow stirred tank reactor which allows for aging times of up to 12 h and beyond and of particle size selection prior to the aging step. We applied the activation time (tact) concept to retrieve kinetic data. It was found that 100 nm soot particles can be CCN-active down to supersaturations of 0.3% after 12 h of exposure to 200 ppb O3 at 35 °C. The reaction rate was found to be not directly proportional to the O3 concentration. Instead, a Langmuir-type reaction kinetic was found to be the best fit to parametrize the reaction rates. The initial reaction step is therefore the adsorption of O3 molecules, which could be detected by an increase in the particle diameter of up to 3.7 nm within several minutes after exposure. The increase in particle diameter agrees well with the calculated change in the O3 surface coverage, which was obtained from CCN activation data under the assumption of a Langmuir-sorption isotherm. Further, we found that a temperature increase from 5 to 35 °C increases the reaction rate by a factor of 5 which corresponds to an activation energy of 38.5 kJ·mol–1. Extrapolation to atmospheric conditions allows for the conclusion that the temperature is as important as the O3 concentration for the CCN activation of soot particles within the atmospheric range.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000381758",,"0743-7463||1520-5827",,"10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b02372","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/381758","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ozone Concentration versus Temperature: Atmospheric Aging of Soot Particles","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-01T14:34:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Soot Particle Ageing Cloud Effects - SPACE","161343||161343||161343","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Ambizione",,,,"85074787215",,"000497262300004","Langmuir","45","Langmuir","35","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Today's flagship supercomputers allow performing simulations at kilometer‐scale resolution on computational domains covering the entire lifecycle of synoptic‐scale systems and thus enable explicit representation of small‐scale disturbances embedded in large‐scale circulations. Here we demonstrate these capabilities in two different types of kilometer‐scale simulations. The first is a 10‐day‐long near‐global simulation of an idealized moist baroclinic wave, performed at 1 km grid spacing and employing 16,001 × 36,006 × 60 grid points. The second is a real‐case simulation of an extratropical low‐pressure system, driven by the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts's operational analysis. At kilometer‐scale resolution, both simulations display clear evidence of embedded mesoscale vortices spawning along frontal systems of mature extratropical cyclones. The vortices appearing in the real‐case simulation can also be identified in satellite imagery of the system. The simulated developments are due to a barotropic instability mechanism and driven by strong low‐level horizontal wind shear. While the simulation of the frontal systems is amenable at model resolutions around 10–50 km, the instability mechanism itself relies on the representation of a narrow shear zone, requiring about 5 times finer resolution. Results suggest that the flow regimes suppressing or fostering barotropic vortices can coexist in the same synoptic system. Far away from the cyclone core, the instability is suppressed by deformation associated with the large‐scale flow, while close to the mature cyclone core, the narrow frontal structure becomes unstable.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000373267",,"1942-2466",,"10.1029/2019ms001847","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/373267","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","barotropic instability||idealized baroclinic wave||mesovortex||convection‐resolving||graphics processing unit||GPU||extratropical cyclones","Barotropic Instability of a Cyclone Core at Kilometer‐Scale Resolution","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-28T13:08:09Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Cloud-resolving climate modeling on future supercomputing platform","154486","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Sinergia",,,,"85074951009",,"000494586900001",,"11","Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A new approach (known as GWP*) has been suggested to compare contributions of long- and short-lived GHGs, providing a close link between cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions and total warming. However, comparison factors for non-CO2 GHGs under the GWP* metric depend on past emissions, and hence raise questions of equity and fairness when applied at any but the global level. The use of GWP* would put most developing countries at a disadvantage compared to developed countries, because when using GWP* countries with high historical emissions of short-lived GHGs are exempted from accounting for avoidable future warming that is caused by sustaining these emissions. We show that when various established equity or fairness criteria are applied to GWP* (defined here as eGWP*), perceived national non-CO2 emissions vary by more than an order of magnitude, particularly in countries with high methane emissions like New Zealand. We show that national emission estimates that use GWP* are very sensitive to arbitrary choices made by countries and therewith facilitate the creation of loopholes when CO2-equivalent emissions based on the GWP* concept are traded between countries that use different approaches. In light of such equity-dependent accounting differences, GHG metrics like GWP* should only be used at the global level. A common, transparent and equity-neutral accounting metric is vital for the Paris Agreement's effectiveness and its environmental integrity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000384659",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab4928","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/384659","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","climate policy||greenhouse gases||emission metrics||equity||fairness||Paris agreement||GWP","Unintentional unfairness when applying new greenhouse gas emissions metrics at country level","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-11T11:12:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000499324200001","Environ.

To test the influence of multiple large-scale drivers on the drying, we sequentially add them to the simulations. We find that the causes of the Mediterranean drying depend on the season. The summer drying results from the land-ocean warming contrast, and from lapse-rate and other thermodynamic changes, but only weakly depends on circulation changes. In contrast, to reproduce the simulated Mediterranean winter drying, additional changes in the circulation and atmospheric state have to be represented in the simulations. Since land-ocean contrast, thermodynamic and lapse-rate changes are more robust in climate simulations than circulation changes, the uncertainty associated with the projected drying should be considered smaller in summer than in winter.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000377732",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab4438","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/377732","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","pseudo-global warming||subtropical precipitation decline||European regional climate modeling||climate change drivers||water stress||land-ocean contrast||circulation changes","Causes of future Mediterranean precipitation decline depend on the season","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-11-14T15:26:18Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000503842000003","Environ.

With the Paris Agreement in mind, we re-analyse available scenario evidence to understand the roles of NETs in 1.5 °C and 2 °C scenarios and, for the first time, link this to a systematic review of findings in the underlying literature. In line with previous research, we find that keeping warming below 1.5 °C requires a rapid large-scale deployment of NETs, while for 2 °C, we can still limit NET deployment substantially by ratcheting up near-term mitigation ambition. Most recent evidence stresses the importance of future socio-economic conditions in determining the flexibility of NET deployment and suggests opportunities for hedging technology risks by adopting portfolios of NETs. Importantly, our thematic review highlights that there is a much richer set of findings on NETs than commonly reflected upon both in scientific assessments and available reviews. In particular, beyond the common findings on NETs underpinned by dozens of studies around early scale-up, the changing shape of net emission pathways or greater flexibility in the timing of climate policies, there is a suite of “niche and emerging findings”, e.g. around innovation needs and rapid technological change, termination of NETs at the end of the twenty-first century or the impacts of climate change on the effectiveness of NETs that have not been widely appreciated. Future research needs to explore the role of climate damages on NET uptake, better understand the geophysical constraints of NET deployment (e.g. water, geological storage, climate feedbacks), and provide a more systematic assessment of NET portfolios in the context of sustainable development goals.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000373034",,"0165-0009||1573-1480",,"10.1007/s10584-019-02516-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/373034","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Negative emission||Carbon dioxide removal||Systematic evidence synthesis||Integrated assessment model||1.5 °C||2 °C","Negative emissions and international climate goals - learning from and about mitigation scenarios","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-27T02:18:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85074617986",,"000490831100001",,"2","Climatic Change","157","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We characterize the regional climatology (1998–2016) of the TC contributions to the atmospheric branch of the hydrological cycle, from May to December. TC contributions to rainfall are quantified using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) product 3B42 and TC tracks derived from three sources: the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS), and an objective feature tracking method applied to the Japanese 55-year and ERA-Interim reanalyses. From July to October, TCs contribute 10–30% of rainfall over the west and east coast of Mexico and central Mexico, with the largest monthly contribution during September over the Baja California Peninsula (up to 90%). TCs are associated with 40–60% of daily extreme rainfall (above the 95th percentile) over the coasts of Mexico. IBTrACS and reanalyses agree on TC contributions over the Atlantic Ocean but disagree over the Eastern Pacific Ocean and continent; differences over the continent are mainly attributed to discrepancies in TC tracks in proximity to the coast and TC lifetime. Reanalysis estimates of TC moisture transports show that TCs are an important moisture source for the regional water budget. TC vertically integrated moisture flux (VIMF) convergence can turn regions of weak VIMF divergence by the mean circulation into regions of weak VIMF convergence. We discuss deficiencies in the observed and reanalysis TC tracks, which limit our ability to quantify robustly the contribution of TCs to the regional hydrological cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000372998",,"0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-019-04920-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/372998","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Tropical cyclones||Middle America||Rainfall||Moisture transport","The contribution of tropical cyclones to the atmospheric branch of Middle America’s hydrological cycle using observed and reanalysis tracks","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-26T03:03:39Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85070300080",,"000493469900056","Clim Dyn","9-10","Climate Dynamics","53","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, recent literature presents contradictory conclusions on this feature: one study concludes that drought recovery time in the tropics and high northern latitudes is shortest (<4 months) but another concludes that it is longest (>12 months) in these regions. Here we explore the reasons for these contradictory results and revisit assessments of drought recovery time. We find that the study period, drought identification method and recovery level definition are main factors contributing to the contradictory conclusions. Further, we emphasize that including droughts that did not decrease ecosystem production or using a period of abnormal water availability to define ecosystem recovery level can strongly bias drought recovery time estimates. Based on our refined methods, we find the drought recovery time is also longest in some tropical regions but not in high northern latitudes during 1901–2010. Our study helps to resolve the recent controversy and provides insight for future drought recovery assessments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000384634",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab4c61","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/384634","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Ecosystem||Gross primary production||Drought||Drought recovery||Recovery level||Global","Revisiting assessments of ecosystem drought recovery","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-11T11:08:23Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000499962400001","Environ.

While richer nations are often home to a variety of climate models, data infrastructures and climate experts, poorer sovereigns often lack these attributes. However, less is known about countries’ capacity to use global climate science and customise it into products informing national adaptation. We use a unique global dataset, the UNFCCC National Communications, to perform a global documentary analysis of scientific submissions from individual countries (n = 189). Comparing countries’ climate projections with their competence in publishing climate science, our research examines the existence of geographical divides. Although countries proficient in publishing climate science use more complex climate modelling techniques, key characteristics of climate projections are highly similar around the globe, including multi-model ensembles of Global Circulation Models (GCMs). This surprising result is made possible because of the use of pre-configured climate modelling software packages. One concern is that these tools restrict customisation, such as country-specific observations, modelling information, and visualisation. Such tools may therefore hide a new geographical divide where countries with higher scientific capacities are able to inform what goes into these software packages, whereas lower scientific capacity countries are dependent upon these choices – whether beneficial for them or not. Our research suggests that free-to-use modelling and training efforts may unwittingly restrict, rather than foster, countries’ capacity to customise global climate science into nationally relevant and legitimate climate information.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000355462",,"1462-9011||1873-6416",,"10.1016/j.envsci.2019.07.015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/355462","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate projections||Climate scenarios||Climate information||Adaptation||Geographical imbalance||Customisation of climate science","Customising global climate science for national adaptation: A case study of climate projections in UNFCCC’s National Communications","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-07-26T14:16:23Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85069694785",,"000497600400003","Environ.

This “zero emissions commitment” (ZEC) is also an important quantity when estimating the remaining carbon budget – a limit on the total amount of CO2 emissions consistent with limiting global mean temperature at a particular level. In the recent IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 ∘C, the carbon budget framework used to calculate the remaining carbon budget for 1.5 ∘C included the assumption that the ZEC due to CO2 emissions is negligible and close to zero. Previous research has shown significant uncertainty even in the sign of the ZEC. To close this knowledge gap, we propose the Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP), which will quantify the amount of unrealized temperature change that occurs after CO2 emissions cease and investigate the geophysical drivers behind this climate response. Quantitative information on ZEC is a key gap in our knowledge, and one that will not be addressed by currently planned CMIP6 simulations, yet it is crucial for verifying whether carbon budgets need to be adjusted to account for any unrealized temperature change resulting from past CO2 emissions. We request only one top-priority simulation from comprehensive general circulation Earth system models (ESMs) and Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) – a branch from the 1 % CO2 run with CO2 emissions set to zero at the point of 1000 PgC of total CO2 emissions in the simulation – with the possibility for additional simulations, if resources allow. ZECMIP is part of CMIP6, under joint sponsorship by C4MIP and CDRMIP, with associated experiment names to enable data submissions to the Earth System Grid Federation.

Models have predicted gradients in condensed phase reactant concentration throughout particles as the result of diffusion and chemical reaction limitations, termed chemical gradients. However, these have never been directly observed for atmospherically relevant particle diameters. We investigated the reaction between ozone and aerosol particles composed of xanthan gum and FeCl2 and observed the in situ chemical reaction that oxidized Fe2+ to Fe3+ using X-ray spectromicroscopy. Iron oxidation state of particles as small as 0.2 μm in diameter were imaged over time with a spatial resolution of tens of nanometers. We found that the loss off Fe2+ accelerated with increasing ozone concentration and relative humidity, RH. Concentric 2-D column integrated profiles of the Fe2+ fraction, α, out of the total iron were derived and demonstrated that particle surfaces became oxidized while particle cores remained unreacted at RH = 0–20%. At higher RH, chemical gradients evolved over time, extended deeper from the particle surface, and Fe2+ became more homogeneously distributed. We used the kinetic multi-layer model for aerosol surface and bulk chemistry (KM-SUB) to simulate ozone reaction constrained with our observations and inferred key parameters as a function of RH including Henry's Law constant for ozone, HO3, and diffusion coefficients for ozone and iron, DO3 and DFe, respectively. We found that HO3 is higher in our xanthan gum/FeCl2 particles than for water and increases when RH decreased from about 80% to dry conditions. This coincided with a decrease in both DO3 and DFe. In order to reproduce observed chemical gradients, our model predicted that ozone could not be present further than a few nanometers from a particle surface indicating near surface reactions were driving changes in iron oxidation state. However, the observed chemical gradients in α observed over hundreds of nanometers must have been the result of iron transport from the particle interior to the surface where ozone oxidation occurred. In the context of our results, we examine the applicability of the reacto-diffusive framework and discuss diffusion limitations for other reactive gas-aerosol systems of atmospheric importance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000367394",,"1463-9084||1463-9076",,"10.1039/c9cp03731d","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/367394","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Visualizing reaction and diffusion in xanthan gum aerosol particles exposed to ozone","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-09-30T17:31:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Feedbacks between atmospheric aerosol microphysics and photochemical aging","163074","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85072627232",,"000489984200005","Phys.

This provides windows of subseasonal predictability beyond the typical weather forecast horizon of about 10 days. Subseasonal forecasts of surface weather are of significant interest in weather‐dependent socio‐economic sectors. For example, demand and supply for electricity and gas are weather dependent and therefore accurate forecasts are important for the energy industry and energy trading. Here we investigate the subseasonal impact of stratospheric conditions on surface weather events relevant to the energy industry in five subregions of Europe in winter. We use a definition of seven Atlantic–European weather regimes to describe the variability of the large‐scale circulation on subseasonal time scales. Results indicate that weather events are often associated with more than one preferred weather regime. In turn, some weather regimes project onto a specific NAO phase, while others are independent of the NAO. As expected, anomalous stratospheric polar vortex states predominantly modulate the occurrence of regimes related to the NAO and affect the likelihood of their associated weather events. In contrast, the occurrence of weather regimes which do not project well onto the NAO is not affected by anomalous stratospheric polar vortex states. These regimes provide pathways to unexpected weather events in extreme stratospheric polar vortex states. For example, weak stratospheric polar vortex states enhance the likelihood of negative NAO. High wind events in Central Europe predominantly occur during the zonal regime, strongly projecting onto positive NAO. However, these events also occur during the Atlantic trough regime, which is unaffected by anomalous stratospheric polar vortex states and thus provides a pathway to Central European high wind events during weak stratospheric polar vortex states. A correct NAO prediction alone is therefore not sufficient to correctly predict surface weather after extreme stratospheric polar vortex states. Moreover, weather regime life cycles independent of the NAO also need to be forecast accurately.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000380424",,"0035-9009||1477-870X",,"10.1002/qj.3653","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/380424","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Energy||Midlatitude||Stratosphere||Teleconnections (AO, NAO, MJO, ENSO, SSW, ONI, ADO, MJO||Weather regimes","Stratospheric modulation of the large-scale circulation in the Atlantic-European region and its implications for surface weather events","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-11-26T03:52:05Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"The mutual interaction of individual weather systems and weather regimes","148177","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,"85074974391",,"000496123700001","Q.

Heat waves are defined using a percentile‐based index and the main processes quantified along trajectories are adiabatic compression by subsidence and local and remote diabatic processes in the upper and lower troposphere. This Lagrangian analysis is complemented by an Eulerian calculation of horizontal temperature advection. During typical summers in Europe, one or two heat waves occur, with an average duration of five days. Whereas high near‐surface temperatures over Scandinavia are accompanied by omega‐like blocking structures at 500 hPa, heat waves over the Mediterranean are connected to comparably flat ridges. Tracing air masses backwards from the heat waves, we identify three trajectory clusters with coherent thermodynamic characteristics, vertical motions, and geographic origins. In all regions, horizontal temperature advection is almost negligible. In two of the three clusters, subsidence in the free atmosphere is very important in establishing high temperatures near the surface, while the air masses in the third cluster are warmed primarily due to diabatic heating near the surface. Large interregional differences occur between the British Isles and western Russia. Over the latter region, near‐surface transport and diabatic heating appear to be very important in determining the intensity of the heat waves, whereas subsidence and adiabatic warming are of first‐order importance for the British Isles. Although the large‐scale pattern is quasistationary during heat wave days, new air masses are entrained steadily into the lower troposphere during the life cycle of a heat wave. Overall, the results of the present study provide a guideline as to which processes and diagnostics weather and climate studies should focus on to understand the severity of heat waves.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000358307",,"0035-9009||1477-870X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/358307||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/377758||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/377522||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/378033||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/378850||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/379257||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/377320||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/379522","10.1002/qj.3599","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/393645","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Adiabatic warming||Climatology||Diabatic processes||Eulerian perspective||Heat waves||Lagrangian perspective","Processes determining heat waves across different European climates","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-14T02:17:27Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85069884765",,"000478264400001||000478264400001","Q.

Attribution results can be highly dependent on the definition of the event and the characteristics assessed, which are part of framing the attribution question. Despite a widely acknowledged sensitivity to framing, little work has been done to document the impacts on attribution and the resulting implications. Here, we use a perfect‐model approach and large ensembles of coupled climate‐model simulations to demonstrate how event attribution depends on the spatial and temporal scales used to define the event. In general, stronger attribution is found for events defined over longer time scales and larger spatial scales due to enhanced signal‐to‐noise ratios. With strong warming trends, most regions see large changes in the likelihood of temperature extremes at all scales, even at low levels of global mean temperature increase. For precipitation extremes, spatial scale plays a strong role. It may be possible to attribute changes in likelihood for extreme precipitation events defined over larger scales, but greater levels of global warming are often required before it is possible to attribute changes in the likelihood of smaller‐scale precipitation events. Care must be taken to understand the scales used in event attribution, in order to properly understand the results.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000377312",,"2328-4277",,"10.1029/2019EF001253","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/377312","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Importance of Framing for Extreme Event Attribution: The Role of Spatial and Temporal Scales","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-11-13T08:38:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85074790698",,"000493421500001",,"10","Earth's Future","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, daily precipitation persistence is assessed in an exhaustive ensemble of observation-based daily precipitation datasets and evaluated in global climate model (GCM) simulations for the period of 2001–2013. Daily precipitation time series are first transformed intocategorical time series of dry and wet spells with a 1 mm d−1precipitation threshold. Subsequently, Pdd(Pww),defined as the probability of a dry(wet)day to be followed by another dry(wet)day is calculated to represent daily precipitation persistence. The analysis focuses on the long-term meanand interannual variability(IAV)of the two indices. Both multi-observation and multi-model meansshow higher values of Pdd thanPww. GCMs overestimate Pww with a relatively homogeneous spatialbias pattern. They overestimate Pdd in the Amazon and Central Africa but underestimate Pdd in several regions such as southern Argentina, western North America and the Tibetan Plateau. The IAV of both Pdd and Pww is generally underestimated in climate models, but more strongly for Pww. Overall, our results highlight systematic model errors in daily precipitation persistence that are substantially larger than the already considerable spread across observational products. These findings also provide insights on how precipitation persistence biases on a daily time scale relate to well-documented persistence biases at longer time scales in state-of-the-art GCMs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000384829",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab4169","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/384829","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Daily precipitation||Precipitation persistence||Climate models||CMIP5","Intercomparison of daily precipitation persistence in multiple global observations and climate models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-11T14:33:28Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate","617518","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,"85084172329",,"000500812000001","Environ.

Following the Montreal Protocol ban of long-lived ozone depleting substances (ODSs), rapid depletion of total column ozone (TCO) ceased in the late 1990s and ozone above 32 km now enjoys a clear recovery. However, there is still no confirmation of TCO recovery, and evidence has emerged that ongoing quasi-global (60° S–60° N) lower stratospheric ozone decreases may be responsible, dominated by low latitudes (30° S–30° N). Chemistry climate models (CCMs) used to project future changes predict that lower stratospheric ozone will decrease in the tropics by 2100, but not at mid-latitudes (30°–60°). Here, we show that CCMs display an ozone decline similar to that observed in the tropics over 1998–2016, likely driven by a increase of tropical upwelling. On the other hand, mid-latitude lower stratospheric ozone is observed to decrease, while CCMs show an increase. Despite opposing lower stratospheric ozone changes, which should induce opposite temperature trends, CCM and observed temperature trends agree; we demonstrate that opposing model-observation stratospheric water vapour (SWV) trends, and their associated radiative effects, explain why temperature changes agree in spite of opposing ozone trends. We provide new evidence that the observed mid-latitude trends can be explained by enhanced mixing between the tropics and extratropics. We further show that the temperature trends are consistent with the observed mid-latitude ozone decrease. Together, our results suggest that large scale circulation changes expected in the future from increased greenhouse gases (GHGs) may now already be underway, but that most CCMs are not simulating well mid-latitude ozone layer changes. The reason CCMs do not exhibit the observed changes urgently needs to be understood to improve confidence in future projections of the ozone layer.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000384699",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-2019-734","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/384699","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Inconsistencies between chemistry climate model and observed lower stratospheric trends since 1998","Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2019-12-11T11:35:56Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atmos. chem. phys. discuss.",,"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Processes like heterogeneous ice nucleation responsible for the formation of first ice in clouds are still not completely understood and contribute to uncertainties in weather and climate modelling. RACLETS (Role of Aerosols and Clouds Enhanced by Topography on Snow) was a field campaign planned in order to investigate the whole formation and deposition pathway of precipitation in Davos, Switzerland, in February and March 2019. The aim of this thesis was to investigate if and how ice nucleating particle concentrations ([INP]) at −8◦C and −15◦C fluctuated over orographic terrain at the measurement site in the valley (Wolfgangpass (WOP), 1631 m a.s.l.) compared to on the mountain top (Weissfluhjoch (WFJ), 2691 m a.s.l.). The [INP] were measured with the drop freezing apparatus DRINCZ (DRoplet Ice Nucleation Counter Zurich) and LINDA (LED-based Ice Nucleation Detection Apparatus). Measurements taken during a clear sky and dry period were compared to a period with frequent occurrence of clouds and precipitation. The influence on the [INP] of a Saharan dust event from long range transport as well as local processes (presence of snowfall, inversion layers and emission of biological particles) were examined. A significant increase of [INP] was observed during the Saharan dust event at −15◦C at WFJ, but not at WOP. During snow- fall as well as sunny and warm periods after midday (12:00 to 14:00 local time), [INP] increased significantly at −8◦C on both sites. Particles enhancing the ice nucleation at −8◦C are thought to be of biological origin. Despite the significant influence on [INP] during hours or days, the mean of the two investigated periods of time did not differ. Therefore, the importance of a correct parameterization with a high temporal resolution of the [INP] for short term applications like weather predictions is proposed, but not for longer time scales of climate modelling.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000563592",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563592","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","aerosol; INP; ice nucleation; Alps; orographic clouds; mixed-phase clouds; snowfall; precipitation","Investigating fluctuations in ice nucleating particle concentrations over orographic terrain","Bachelor Thesis","Open access",,,,"2022-08-14T22:11:04Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Soil moisture can also impact precipitation to amplify soil moisture deficits under dry conditions. These land–atmosphere processes lead to high probability of concurrent soil drought and atmospheric aridity.

In this thesis, orographic precipitation events were analysed with measurement data from the RACLETS field campaign in Davos during winter 2019 in order to investigate microphysical properties of precipitation and MPCs. Precipitation was analysed with Parsivel laser disdrometers, while in-situ cloud measurements were taken with the holographic imager HOLIMO. Remote sensing and meteorological observations furthermore provided information about atmospheric conditions during the measurement period. In a first case study, a cold front precipitation event was analysed. Comparing measurements from two Parsivel disdrometers at different locations, observed differences in accumulated precipitation could be explained with microphysical properties of precipitation. Increased snowfall rates at one measurement site were mostly the result of higher precipitation particle number concentrations and higher particle fall velocity in combination. In MPC measurements mostly ice crystals were found, compared to only small cloud droplet number concentrations. Both, ice crystal and cloud droplet number densities increased over time. High cloud particle number concentrations furthermore were also consistent with high radar reflectivities measured with a cloud radar. During a second precipitation event, a transition from rainfall to snowfall was investigated. Using Parsivel disdrometer measurements, a transition from typical raindrop size-velocity distributions to typical snow particle distributions was observed. Furthermore, co-existing raindrops and snow particles were found during the short transition period, resulting in bimodal particle size-velocity distributions. Additionally, a melting layer could be observed with radar in the lowest few hundred metres above ground, consistent with Parsivel measurements on a mountain above the melting layer, where only snowfall was detected.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000566640",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566640","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Alps; orographic clouds; mixed-phase clouds; snowfall; precipitation; field measurements","Investigating microphysical properties of MPCs and precipitation in mountainous terrain","Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2022-08-26T07:03:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

During February and March 2018, a field campaign was executed over the Iceland and southern Greenland Seas that utilized a range of observing platforms to investigate critical processes in the region, including a research vessel, a research aircraft, moorings, sea gliders, floats, and a meteorological buoy. A remarkable feature of the field campaign was the highly coordinated deployment of the observing platforms, whereby the research vessel and aircraft tracks were planned in concert to allow simultaneous sampling of the atmosphere, the ocean, and their interactions. This joint planning was supported by tailor-made convection-permitting weather forecasts and novel diagnostics from an ensemble prediction system. The scientific aims of the IGP are to characterize the atmospheric forcing and the ocean response of coupled processes; in particular, cold-air outbreaks in the vicinity of the marginal ice zone and their triggering of oceanic heat loss, and the role of freshwater in the generation of dense water masses. The campaign observed the life cycle of a long-lasting cold-air outbreak over the Iceland Sea and the development of a cold-air outbreak over the Greenland Sea. Repeated profiling revealed the immediate impact on the ocean, while a comprehensive hydrographic survey provided a rare picture of these subpolar seas in winter. A joint atmosphere–ocean approach is also being used in the analysis phase, with coupled observational analysis and coordinated numerical modeling activities underway.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000374041",,"0003-0007||1520-0477",,"10.1175/BAMS-D-18-0217.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/374041","en","American Meteorological Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The Iceland Greenland Seas Project","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-30T18:17:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000489716700016","BAMS","9","Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society","100","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We assessed whether a self-built version of the Kennedy sampler is able to collect rainwater consistently without mixing with antecedent collected water. We called the self-built sampler made from honey jars and silicon tubing the Zurich sequential sampler. Two laboratory experiments show that high rainfall intensities can be sampled and that the volume of water in a water sample originating from a different bottle was generally less than 1 ml. Rainwater was collected in 5 mm increments for stable isotope analysis using three (year 2011) and five (years 2015 and 2016) rain samplers in Zurich (Switzerland) during eleven rainfall events. The standard deviation of the total rainfall amounts between the different rain gauges was <1%. The standard deviation of δ18O and δ2H among the different sequential sampler bottles filled at the same time was generally <0.3‰ for δ18O and <2‰ for δ2H (8 out of 11 events). Larger standard deviations could be explained by leaking bottle(s) with subsequent mixing of water with different isotopic composition of at least one out of the five samplers. Our assessment shows that low-cost, low-tech rain samplers, when well maintained, can be used to collect sequential samples of rainfall for stable isotope analysis and are therefore suitable to study the spatio-temporal variability of the isotopic composition of rainfall.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000370461",,"2296-6463",,"10.3389/feart.2019.00244","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/370461","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","rainfall and its isotopic composition||sequential rainwater sampler||laboratory experiments||field test||stable isotopes (18O and 2H)||low-cost/low-tech self-built sampler","Assessing the Sampling Quality of a Low-Tech Low-Budget Volume-Based Rainfall Sampler for Stable Isotope Analysis","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-15T02:21:37Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85073683250",,"000488209400001","Front.

Five polymorph members of K-feldspar (two microclines, orthoclase, adularia and sanidine) and four plagioclase samples (three labradorites and a pericline sample) are tested. Microcline was found to be the most active INP in the immersion mode consistent with previous findings. Samples were selected for their differences in typical feldspar properties such as crystal structure, bulk and trace elemental composition, and ordering of the crystal lattice. The properties mentioned are related to the temperature of feldspar crystallization from the magma during formation. Properties characteristic of low-temperature feldspar formation coincide with an increased ability to nucleate ice. Amongst the samples investigated, ice nucleation is most efficient on the crystallographically ordered, triclinic K-feldspar species microcline, while the intermediate and disordered monoclinic K-feldspar polymorphs orthoclase and sanidine nucleate ice at lower temperatures. The ice nucleation ability of disordered triclinic Na∕Ca-feldspar is comparable to disordered K-feldspar. The conditions of feldspar rock formation also leave a chemical fingerprint with varying abundance of trace elements in the samples. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy analysis was conducted to determine metal oxide and trace elemental composition of the feldspar samples. The analysis revealed a correlation of trace metal abundance with median freezing temperatures (T50) of the K-feldspar samples allowing us to sort them for their ice nucleation efficiency according to the abundance of specific trace elements. A pronounced size dependence of ice nucleation activity for the feldspar samples is observed, with the activity of smaller-sized particles scaling with surface area or being even higher compared to larger particles. The size dependence varies for different feldspar samples. In particular, microcline exhibited immersion freezing even for 50 nm particles which is unique for heterogeneous ice nucleation of mineral dusts. This suggests that small microcline particles that are susceptible to long-range transport can affect cloud properties via immersion freezing far away from the source. The measurements generally imply that temperatures at which feldspars can affect cloud glaciation depend on the transported particle size in addition to the abundance of these particles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000363617",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-10901-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/363617","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ice nucleation properties of K-feldspar polymorphs and plagioclase feldspars","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-09-12T03:33:02Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Laboratory studies on the ice nucleation properties of fresh  and aged mineral dust aerosols","150169","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,"85071613413",,"000483093000002","Atmos. chem. phys.","16","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, higher grid spacing is also a promising feature to improve the simulation of snow cover. In particular, it provides a refined representation of topography and allows for an explicit simulation of convective precipitation processes. In this study we analyze the snow cover in a set of decade-long high-resolution climate simulation with horizontal grid spacing of 2.2 km over the greater Alpine region. Results are compared against observations and lower resolution models (12 and 50 km), which use parameterized convection. The simulations are integrated using the COSMO (Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling) model. The evaluation of snow water equivalent (SWE) in the simulation of present-day climate, driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis, against an observational dataset, reveals that the high-resolution simulation clearly outperforms simulations with grid spacing of 12 and 50 km. The latter simulations underestimate the cumulative amount of SWE over Switzerland over the whole annual cycle by 33% (12 km simulation) and 56% (50 km simulation) while the high-resolution simulation shows a spatially and temporally averaged difference of less than 1%. Scenario simulations driven by GCM MPI-ESM-LR (2081–2090 RCP8.5 vs. 1991–2000) reveal a strong decrease of SWE over the Alps, consistent with previous studies. Previous studies had found that the relative decrease becomes gradually smaller with elevation, but this finding was limited to low and intermediate altitudes (as a 12 km simulation resolves the topography up to 2500 m). In the current study we find that the height gradient reverses sign, and relative reductions in snow cover increases above 3000 m asl, where important parts of the cryosphere are present. In addition, the simulations project a transition from permanent to seasonal snow cover at high altitudes, with potentially important impacts to Alpine permafrost. This transition and the more pronounced decline of SWE emphasize the value of the higher grid spacing. Overall, we show that high-resolution climate models offer a promising approach in improving the simulation of snow cover in Alpine terrain.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000360323",,"2073-4433",,"10.3390/atmos10080463","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/360323","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","snow water equivalent||snow cover||convection-resolving||climate projections","Projections of Alpine snow-cover in a high-resolution climate simulation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-24T03:23:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Towards kilometer-scale climate change scenarios","132614","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,"85070769324",,"000482983500005",,"8","Atmosphere","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

From 2002 to 2017, the satellites of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission have observed changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) with an unprecedented level of accuracy. In this paper, we use a statistical model trained with GRACE observations to reconstruct past climate-driven changes in TWS from historical and near-real-time meteorological datasets at daily and monthly scales. Unlike most hydrological models which represent water reservoirs individually (e.g., snow, soil moisture) and usually provide a single model run, the presented approach directly reconstructs total TWS changes and includes hundreds of ensemble members which can be used to quantify predictive uncertainty. We compare these data-driven TWS estimates with other independent evaluation datasets such as the sea level budget, large-scale water balance from atmospheric reanalysis, and in situ streamflow measurements. We find that the presented approach performs overall as well or better than a set of state-of-the-art global hydrological models (Water Resources Reanalysis version 2). We provide reconstructed TWS anomalies at a spatial resolution of 0.5∘, at both daily and monthly scales over the period 1901 to present, based on two different GRACE products and three different meteorological forcing datasets, resulting in six reconstructed TWS datasets of 100 ensemble members each. Possible user groups and applications include hydrological modeling and model benchmarking, sea level budget studies, assessments of long-term changes in the frequency of droughts, the analysis of climate signals in geodetic time series, and the interpretation of the data gap between the GRACE and GRACE Follow-On missions.

In this study, we focus on the relative importance of different instantaneous aerosol perturbations (cloud condensation nuclei and ice-nucleating particles; CCN and INPs, respectively) on MPC properties in the European Arctic. To address this topic, we performed high-resolution large-eddy simulation (LES) experiments using the Consortium for Small-scale Modeling (COSMO) model and designed a case study for the Aerosol-Cloud Coupling and Climate Interactions in the Arctic (ACCACIA) campaign in March 2013. Motivated by ongoing sea ice retreat, we performed all sensitivity studies over open ocean and sea ice to investigate the effect of changing surface conditions. We find that surface conditions highly impact cloud dynamics, consistent with the ACCACIA observations: over sea ice, a rather homogeneous, optically thin, mixed-phase stratus cloud forms. In contrast, the MPC over the open ocean has a stratocumulus-like cloud structure. With cumuli feeding moisture into the stratus layer, the cloud over the open ocean features a higher liquid (LWP) and ice water path (IWP) and has a lifted cloud base and cloud top compared to the cloud over sea ice. Furthermore, we analyzed the aerosol impact on the sea ice and open ocean cloud regime. Perturbation aerosol concentrations relevant for CCN activation were increased to a range between 100 and 1000 cm−3 and ice-nucleating particle perturbations were increased by 100 % and 300 % compared to the background concentration (at every grid point and at all levels). The perturbations are prognostic to allow for fully interactive aerosol–cloud interactions. Perturbations in the INP concentration increase IWP and decrease LWP consistently in both regimes. The cloud microphysical response to potential CCN perturbations occurs faster in the stratocumulus regime over the ocean, where the increased moisture flux favors rapid cloud droplet formation and growth, leading to an increase in LWP following the aerosol injection. In addition, IWP increases through new ice crystal formation by increased immersion freezing, cloud top rise, and subsequent growth by deposition. Over sea ice, the maximum response in LWP and IWP is delayed and weakened compared to the response over the open ocean surface. Additionally, we find the long-term response to aerosol perturbations to be highly dependent on the cloud regime. Over the open ocean, LWP perturbations are efficiently buffered after 18 h simulation time. Increased ice and precipitation formation relax the LWP back to its unperturbed range. On the contrary, over sea ice the cloud evolution remains substantially perturbed with CCN perturbations ranging from 200 to 1000 CCN cm−3.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000358302",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-9847-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/358302","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Response of Arctic mixed-phase clouds to aerosol perturbations under different surface forcings","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-14T02:16:47Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding","603445","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,"85073886826",,"000478696200007","Atmos. chem. phys.","15","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This feature is not captured by current climate models. Using the Community Land Model 5.0 (CLM5.0), we show that this diurnal behavior can be captured when accounting for biomass heat storage (BHS). The nighttime release of energy absorbed by the vegetation biomass during the day increases both nighttime LST and ambient air temperature in forested regions by more than 1 K. The daytime cooling is weaker than the nighttime warming effect, because the energy uptake by the biomass is compensated by a reduction in the turbulent heat fluxes during day. This diurnal asymmetry of the temperature response to BHS leads to a warming of daily mean temperatures, which is amplified during boreal summer warm extremes. Compared to MODIS, CLM5.0 overestimates the diurnal LST range over forested areas. The inclusion of BHS reduces this bias due to its dampening effect on diurnal LST variations. Further, BHS attenuates the negative bias in the nighttime LST difference of forest minus grassland and cropland, when compared to MODIS observations. These results indicate that it is essential to consider BHS when examining the influence of forests on diurnal temperature variations. BHS should thus be included in land surface models used to assess the climatic consequences of land use changes such as deforestation or afforestation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000368521",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab2b4e","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/368521","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Biomass heat storage||Land use change||Land surface modeling","Biomass heat storage dampens diurnal temperature variations in forests","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-05T03:55:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85072714027",,"000490599900001","Environ.

Ideally, these fluxes can be obtained directly from measurements of solar fluxes at the surface. However, common standard methods to identify clear‐sky conditions require observations of both the total and the diffuse radiative fluxes at very high temporal resolution of minutes, which restricts these methods to a few, well‐equipped sites. Here we propose a simple method to estimate clear‐sky fluxes only from typically available global radiation measurements (Rsd) at (half‐)hourly resolution. Plotting a monthly sample of observed Rsd against the corresponding incoming solar radiation at the top of atmosphere (potential solar radiation) reveals a typical triangle shape with clear‐sky conditions forming a distinct, linear slope in the upper range of observations. This upper slope can be understood as the fractional transmission of solar radiation representative for cloud‐free conditions of the sample period. We estimate this upper slope through quantile regression. We employ data of 42 stations of the worldwide Baseline Surface Radiation Network to compare our monthly estimates with the standard clear‐sky identification method developed by Long and Ackerman (2000, https://doi.org/10.1029/2000JD900077). We find very good agreement of the derived fractional solar transmission (R2 = 0.73) across sites. These results thus provide confidence in applying the proposed method to the larger set of global radiation measurements to obtain further observational constraints on clear‐sky fluxes and cloud radiative effects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000373037",,"2333-5084",,"10.1029/2019EA000686","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/373037","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","cloud‐free||clear‐sky||global radiation||transmission||quantile regression","Estimating Shortwave Clear-Sky Fluxes From Hourly Global Radiation Records by Quantile Regression","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-27T02:25:09Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: temporal variation of solar radiation in the climate system","159938","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85071439216",,"000490955600016",,"8","Earth and Space Science","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For medium viscosities at intermediate relative humidities (∼25–40% RH), we find CO2 diffusivities DCO2 ≈ 10–14 m2 s–1, agreeing with the Stokes–Einstein relationship based on current viscosity data but 10 times lower than that for water. Conversely, under dry high-viscosity conditions, we find that DCO2 ≈ 10–16 m2 s–1, which is 10 times higher than for water. We infer that the chemical degradation of atmospheric SOA particles will likely not be limited by CO2 diffusivity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000361632",,"1948-7185",,"10.1021/acs.jpclett.9b01389","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/361632","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Carbon Dioxide Diffusivity in Single, Levitated Organic Aerosol Particles","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-30T16:42:05Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Feedbacks between atmospheric aerosol microphysics and photochemical aging","163074","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85070560688",,"000487181400047","J.

Days with extreme cold temperatures have decreased by a factor of 2–3 and warmed by more than 3 °C, regionally substantially more than winter mean temperatures. Cold and hot extremes have warmed at about 94% of stations, a climate change signal that cannot be explained by internal variability.

In this study, the factors that have led to the disappearance of the ENSO‐vortex relationship are assessed by comparing this relationship in observational data and in operational subseasonal forecasting models over the past few decades. For reforecasts initialized in December, the models simulate a significantly weaker vortex during El Niño than La Niña (LN) as occurred before 1979, but no such effect was observed to have occurred. The apparent cause of this is the eastern European and western Siberian height anomalies present during ENSO. The observed LN events were associated with persistent ridging over eastern Europe as compared to El Niño. Although the Subseasonal‐to‐Seasonal models are initialized with this ridge, the ridge quickly dissipates. As ridging over this region enhances wave flux entering the stratosphere, the net effect is no robust stratospheric response to ENSO in the observations despite a North Pacific teleconnection that would, in isolation, lead to less wave flux for LN. The anomalies in the eastern European sector in response to ENSO likely reflect unforced internal atmospheric variability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000359523",,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2018jd029961","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/359523","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","El Niño||Arctic vortex||subseasonal forecasting","Weakening of the Teleconnection From El Niño–Southern Oscillation to the Arctic Stratosphere Over the Past Few Decades: What Can Be Learned From Subseasonal Forecast Models?","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-20T14:00:40Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application","170523","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,,,"000481444200014","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","14","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","124","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recently, there have been major advances in constraining these particle impacts through a parametrization of NOy based on high-quality observations. Here we investigate the effects of low (auroral) and middle (radiation belt) energy range electrons, separately and in combination, on reactive nitrogen and hydrogen species as well as on ozone during Southern Hemisphere winters from 2002 to 2010 using the SOCOL3-MPIOM chemistry-climate model. Our results show that, in the absence of solar proton events, low-energy electrons produce the majority of NOy in the polar mesosphere and stratosphere. In the polar vortex, NOy subsides and affects ozone at lower altitudes, down to 10 hPa. Comparing a year with high electron precipitation with a quiescent period, we found large ozone depletion in the mesosphere; as the anomaly propagates downward, 15 % less ozone is found in the stratosphere during winter, which is confirmed by satellite observations. Only with both low- and middle-energy electrons does our model reproduce the observed stratospheric ozone anomaly.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000356385",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-9485-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/356385","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Reactive nitrogen (NOy) and ozone responses to energetic electron precipitation during Southern Hemisphere winter","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-03T02:30:32Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Future and Past Solar Influence on the Terrestrial Climate II","147659","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF: Sonstige",,,,"85069740704",,"000477623500002","Atmos. chem. phys.","14","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

At the same time there is a broad consensus that the correct simulation of cloud phase is imperative for a reliable assessment of Earth's climate sensitivity. At the core of this problem is understanding the causes for the inter-model spread of the predicted cloud phase partitioning. This work introduces a new method to build a sound cause-and-effect relation between the microphysical parameterizations employed in our model and the resulting cloud field by analysing ice formation pathways. We find that freezing processes in supercooled liquid clouds only dominate ice formation in roughly 6 % of the simulated clouds, a small fraction compared to roughly 63 % of the clouds governed by freezing in the cirrus temperature regime below −35 ∘C. This pathway analysis further reveals that even in the mixed-phase temperature regime between −35 and 0 ∘C, the dominant source of ice is the sedimentation of ice crystals that originated in the cirrus regime. The simulated fraction of ice cloud to total cloud amount in our model is lower than that reported by the CALIPSO-GOCCP satellite product. This is most likely caused by structural differences of the cloud and aerosol fields in our model rather than the microphysical parametrizations employed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000355044",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-9061-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/355044","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Elucidating ice formation pathways in the aerosol-climate model ECHAM6-HAM2","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-07-25T04:16:59Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"A new parameterization scheme for ice and snow in climate models","160177","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,"85069226042",,"000475760800004","Atmos. chem. phys.","14","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Our interest lies in classifying these particles in order to compute the statistics needed for understanding clouds. Given the large volume of collected data, this raises the need for an automated classification approach. Traditional classification methods that require extracting features manually (e.g. decision trees and support vector machines) show reasonable performance when trained and tested on data coming from a unique dataset. However, they often have difficulties to generalize to test sets coming from other datasets where the distribution of the features might be significantly different. In practice, we found that each new dataset requires labeling a huge amount of data by hand using those methods. Convolutional neural networks have the potential to overcome this problem due to their ability to learn complex non-linear models directly from the images instead of pre-engineered features, as well as by relying on powerful regularization techniques. We show empirically that a convolutional neural network trained on cloud particles from holographic imagers generalizes well to unseen datasets. Moreover, fine-tuning the same network with a small number (256) of training images improves the classification accuracy. Thus, the automated classification with a convolutional neural network not only reduces the hand-labeling effort for new datasets but is also no longer the main error source for the classification of small particles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000393782",,"1867-8610",,"10.5194/amt-2019-206","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/393782","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A Convolutional Neural Network for Classifying Cloud Particles Recorded by Imaging Probes","Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2020-01-24T11:50:08Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atmos. meas. tech., Pap. open discuss.",,"Atmospheric Measurement Techniques Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02150 - Dep.

ESMs include a large number of additional processes and feedbacks such as biogeochemical cycles that traditional physical climate models do not consider. Yet, some processes such as cloud dynamics and ecosystem functional response still have fairly high uncertainties. In this article, we present an overview of climate feedbacks for Earth system components currently included in state-of-the-art ESMs and discuss the challenges to evaluate and quantify them. Uncertainties in feedback quantification arise from the interdependencies of biogeochemical matter fluxes and physical properties, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of processes, and the lack of long-term continuous observational data to constrain them. We present an outlook for promising approaches that can help to quantify and to constrain the large number of feedbacks in ESMs in the future. The target group for this article includes generalists with a background in natural sciences and an interest in climate change as well as experts working in interdisciplinary climate research (researchers, lecturers, and students).

Model results for the period 2011–2015 are compared with aerosol measurements (aerosol particle number, CCN and aerosol particle composition in the submicron fraction) from nine surface stations located in Europe and Japan. The evaluation focuses on the ability of models to simulate the average across time state in diverse environments and on the seasonal and short-term variability in the aerosol properties.  There is no single model that systematically performs best across all environments represented by the observations. Models tend to underestimate the observed aerosol particle and CCN number concentrations, with average normalized mean bias (NMB) of all models and for all stations, where data are available, of −24 % and −35 % for particles with dry diameters >50 and >120 nm, as well as −36 % and −34 % for CCN at supersaturations of 0.2 % and 1.0 %, respectively. However, they seem to behave differently for particles activating at very low supersaturations (<0.1 %) than at higher ones. A total of 15 models have been used to produce ensemble annual median distributions of relevant parameters. The model diversity (defined as the ratio of standard deviation to mean) is up to about 3 for simulated N3 (number concentration of particles with dry diameters larger than 3 nm) and up to about 1 for simulated CCN in the extra-polar regions. A global mean reduction of a factor of about 2 is found in the model diversity for CCN at a supersaturation of 0.2 % (CCN0.2) compared to that for N3, maximizing over regions where new particle formation is important.  An additional model has been used to investigate potential causes of model diversity in CCN and bias compared to the observations by performing a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) accounting for uncertainties in 26 aerosol-related model input parameters. This PPE suggests that biogenic secondary organic aerosol formation and the hygroscopic properties of the organic material are likely to be the major sources of CCN uncertainty in summer, with dry deposition and cloud processing being dominant in winter.  Models capture the relative amplitude of the seasonal variability of the aerosol particle number concentration for all studied particle sizes with available observations (dry diameters larger than 50, 80 and 120 nm). The short-term persistence time (on the order of a few days) of CCN concentrations, which is a measure of aerosol dynamic behavior in the models, is underestimated on average by the models by 40 % during winter and 20 % in summer.  In contrast to the large spread in simulated aerosol particle and CCN number concentrations, the CDNC derived from simulated CCN spectra is less diverse and in better agreement with CDNC estimates consistently derived from the observations (average NMB −13 % and −22 % for updraft velocities 0.3 and 0.6 m s−1, respectively). In addition, simulated CDNC is in slightly better agreement with observationally derived values at lower than at higher updraft velocities (index of agreement 0.64 vs. 0.65). The reduced spread of CDNC compared to that of CCN is attributed to the sublinear response of CDNC to aerosol particle number variations and the negative correlation between the sensitivities of CDNC to aerosol particle number concentration (∂Nd/∂Na ) and to updraft velocity (∂Nd/∂w). Overall, we find that while CCN is controlled by both aerosol particle number and composition, CDNC is sensitive to CCN at low and moderate CCN concentrations and to the updraft velocity when CCN levels are high. Discrepancies are found in sensitivities ∂Nd/∂Na and ∂Nd/∂w; models may be predisposed to be too “aerosol sensitive” or “aerosol insensitive” in aerosol–cloud–climate interaction studies, even if they may capture average droplet numbers well. This is a subtle but profound finding that only the sensitivities can clearly reveal and may explain inter-model biases on the aerosol indirect effect.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000353115",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-8591-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/353115","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Evaluation of global simulations of aerosol particle and cloud condensation nuclei number, with implications for cloud droplet formation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-07-15T02:26:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding||Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach","603445||641816","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100007352","EC||SBFI","FP7||H2020",,,,"85068570626",,"000474457300001","Atmos. chem. phys.","13","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

An enhanced aerosol layer in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS), with BSR (455 nm) > 1.1 and BSR (940 nm) > 1.4, was observed. The color index (CI) of the enhanced aerosol layer, defined as the ratio of aerosol backscatter ratios (ABSRs) at wavelengths of 940 and 455 nm, varied from 4 to 8, indicating the prevalence of fine particles with a mode radius of less than 0.1 µm. We find that unlike the very small particles (mode radius smaller than 0.04 µm) at low relative humidity (RHi < 40 %), the relatively large particles in the aerosol layer were generally very hydrophilic as their size increased dramatically with relative humidity. This result indicates that water vapor can play a very important role in increasing the size of fine particles in the UTLS over the Tibetan Plateau.

In recent years, many regions on land and in the ocean experienced heat waves with devastating impacts that would have been highly unlikely without human‐induced climate change. Impacts are particularly severe when heat waves occur in regions with high exposure of people or crops. The recent 2018 spring‐to‐summer season was characterized by several major heat and dry extremes. On daily average between May and July 2018 about 22% of the populated and agricultural areas north of 30° latitude experienced concurrent hot temperature extremes. Events of this type were unprecedented prior to 2010, while similar conditions were experienced in the 2010 and 2012 boreal summers. Earth System Model simulations of present‐day climate, that is, at around +1 °C global warming, also display an increase of concurrent heat extremes. Based on Earth System Model simulations, we show that it is virtually certain (using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calibrated uncertainty language) that the 2018 north hemispheric concurrent heat events would not have occurred without human‐induced climate change. Our results further reveal that the average high‐exposure area projected to experience concurrent warm and hot spells in the Northern Hemisphere increases by about 16% per additional +1 °C of global warming. A strong reduction in fossil fuel emissions is paramount to reduce the risks of unprecedented global‐scale heat wave impacts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000360089",,"2328-4277",,"10.1029/2019EF001189","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/360089","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Concurrent 2018 Hot Extremes Across Northern Hemisphere Due to Human-Induced Climate Change","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-23T04:49:44Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate","617518||617518||617518","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC||EC","FP7||FP7||FP7",,,,,,"000479280100001",,"7","Earth's Future","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Both decades had similar global-mean anthropogenic aerosol optical depths but substantially different global distributions. For both years, we quantify (i) the forcing spread due to model-internal variability and (ii) the forcing spread among models. Our assessment is based on new ensembles of atmosphere-only simulations with five state-of-the-art Earth system models. Four of these models will be used in the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6; Eyring et al., 2016). Here, the complexity of the anthropogenic aerosol has been reduced in the participating models. In all our simulations, we prescribe the same patterns of the anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and associated effects on the cloud droplet number concentration. We calculate the instantaneous radiative forcing (RF) and the effective radiative forcing (ERF). Their difference defines the net contribution from rapid adjustments. Our simulations show a model spread in ERF from −0.4 to −0.9 W m−2. The standard deviation in annual ERF is 0.3 W m−2, based on 180 individual estimates from each participating model. This result implies that identifying the model spread in ERF due to systematic differences requires averaging over a sufficiently large number of years. Moreover, we find almost identical ERFs for the mid-1970s and mid-2000s for individual models, although there are major model differences in natural aerosols and clouds. The model-ensemble mean ERF is −0.54 W m−2 for the pre-industrial era to the mid-1970s and −0.59 W m−2 for the pre-industrial era to the mid-2000s. Our result suggests that comparing ERF changes between two observable periods rather than absolute magnitudes relative to a poorly constrained pre-industrial state might provide a better test for a model's ability to represent transient climate changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000344957",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-6821-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/344957","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Anthropogenic aerosol forcing-insights from multiple estimates from aerosol-climate models with reduced complexity","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-06-01T02:29:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding","603445","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,"85066036570",,"000468759000001","Atmos. chem. phys.","10","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These plumes of originally stratospheric air can only occasionally be observed at the surface because (i) stable boundary layers prevent an efficient vertical transport down to the surface, and (ii) even if boundary layer turbulence were strong enough to enable this transport, the originally stratospheric air mass can be diluted by mixing, such that only a weak stratospheric signal can be recorded at the surface. Most documented examples of stratospheric air reaching the surface occurred in mountainous regions. This study investigates two such events, using a passive stratospheric air mass tracer in a mesoscale model to explore the processes that enable the transport down to the surface. The events occurred in early May 2006 in the Rocky Mountains and in mid-June 2006 on the Tibetan Plateau. In both cases, a tropopause fold associated with an upper-level front enabled stratospheric air to enter the troposphere. In our model simulation of the North American case, the strong frontal zone reaches down to 700 hPa and leads to a fairly direct vertical transport of the stratospheric tracer along the tilted isentropes to the surface. In the Tibetan Plateau case, however, no near-surface front exists and a reservoir of high stratospheric tracer concentrations initially forms at 300–400 hPa, without further isentropic descent. However, entrainment at the top of the very deep boundary layer (reaching to 300 hPa over the Tibetan Plateau) and turbulence within the boundary layer allows for downward transport of stratospheric air to the surface. Despite the strongly differing dynamical processes, stratospheric tracer concentrations at the surface reach peak values of 10 %–20 % of the imposed stratospheric value in both cases, corroborating the potential of deep stratosphere-to-troposphere transport events to significantly influence surface ozone concentrations in these regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000343434",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-6535-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/343434","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A numerical process study on the rapid transport of stratospheric air down to the surface over western North America and the Tibetan Plateau","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-05-22T08:06:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85065827452",,"000468245200001","Atmos. chem. phys.","9","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We show here that quartz particles obtain their IN activity from milling and that quartz aged in water loses most of its IN efficiency relative to freshly milled quartz. Since most studies so far reported IN activities of commercial quartz dusts that were milled already by the manufacturer, IN active samples prevailed. Also, the quartz surface – much in contrast to that of feldspars – is not prone to ammonia-induced IN enhancement. In detail we investigate the influence of solutes on the IN efficiency of various silica (SiO2) particles (crystalline and amorphous) with special focus on quartz. We performed immersion freezing experiments and relate the observed variability in IN activity to the influence of milling, the aging time and to the exposure conditions since milling. Immersion freezing with silica particles suspended in pure water or aqueous solutions of NH3, (NH4)2SO4, NH4HSO4, Na2SO4 and NaOH, with solute concentrations corresponding to water activities aw=0.9–1.0, were investigated in emulsified droplets by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and analyzed in terms of the onset temperature of the heterogeneous freezing signal Thet and the heterogeneously frozen water volume fraction Fhet. Quartz particles, which originate from milling coarse samples, show a strong heterogeneous freezing peak in pure water with Thet equal to 247–251 K. This IN activity disappears almost completely after aging for 7 months in pure water in a glass vial. During this time quartz slowly grew by incorporating silicic acid leached from the glass vial. Conversely, the synthesized amorphous silica samples show no discernable heterogeneous freezing signal unless they were milled. This implies that defects provide IN activity to silica surfaces, whereas the IN activity of a natural quartz surface is negligible, when it grew under near-equilibrium conditions. For suspensions containing milled quartz and the solutes (NH4)2SO4, NH4HSO4 or Na2SO4, Thet approximately follows TΔahetwhet(aw), the heterogeneous freezing onset temperatures that obey Δahetw criterion, i.e., TΔahetwhet(aw)=Tmelt(aw+Δahetw) with Δahetw being a constant offset with respect to the ice melting point curve, similar to homogeneous IN. This water-activity-based description is expected to hold when the mineral surface is not altered by the presence of the solutes. On the other hand, we observe a slight enhancement in Fhet in the presence of these solutes, implying that the compliance with the Δahetw criterion does not necessarily imply constant Fhet. In contrast to the sulfates, dilute solutions of NH3 or NaOH (molality ≥5×10−4 mol kg−1) reveal Thet by 3–8 K lower than TΔahetwhet(aw), indicating a significant impact on the mineral surface. The lowering of Thet of quartz suspended in dilute NH3 solutions is opposite to the distinct increase in Thet that we found in emulsion freezing experiments with aluminosilicates, namely feldspars, kaolinite, gibbsite and micas. We ascribe this decrease in IN activity to the increased dissolution of quartz under alkaline conditions. The defects that constitute the active sites appear to be more susceptible to dissolution and therefore disappear first on a dissolving surface.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000342178",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-6035-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/342178","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ice nucleation activity of silicates and aluminosilicates in pure water and aqueous solutions –  Part 2: Quartz and amorphous silica","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-05-15T10:43:54Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85065608812",,"000467412800002","Atmos. chem. phys.","9","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite similarities in structures and surfaces they differ greatly in terms of their ice nucleation (IN) efficiency. Here, we show that determining factors for their IN activity include surface ion exchange, NH3 or NH+4 adsorption, and surface degradation due to the slow dissolution of the minerals. We performed immersion freezing experiments with the (Na-Ca)-feldspar andesine, the K-feldspar sanidine, the clay mineral kaolinite, the micas muscovite and biotite, and gibbsite and compare their IN efficiencies with those of the previously characterized K-feldspar microcline and quartz. Samples were suspended in pure water as well as in aqueous solutions of NH3, (NH4)2SO4, NH4Cl and Na2SO4, with solute concentrations corresponding to water activities aw equal to 0.88–1.0. Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on emulsified micron-sized droplets, we derived onset temperatures of heterogeneous (Thet) and homogeneous (Thom) freezing as well as heterogeneously frozen water volume fractions (Fhet). Suspensions in pure water of andesine, sanidine and kaolinite yield Thet equal to 242.8, 241.2 and 240.3 K, respectively, while no discernable heterogeneous freezing signal is present in the case of the micas or gibbsite (i.e., Thet≈Thom≈237.0 K). The presence of NH3 and/or NH+4 salts as solutes has distinct effects on the IN efficiency of most of the investigated minerals. When feldspars and kaolinite are suspended in very dilute solutions of NH3 or NH+4 salts, Thet shifts to higher temperatures (by 2.6–7.0 K compared to the pure water suspension). Even micas and gibbsite develop weak heterogeneous freezing activities in ammonia solutions. Conversely, suspensions containing Na2SO4 cause the Thet of feldspars to clearly fall below the water-activity-based immersion freezing description (Δaw= const.) even in very dilute Na2SO4 solutions, while Thet of kaolinite follows the Δaw= constant curve. The water activity determines how the freezing temperature is affected by solute concentration alone, i.e., if the surface properties of the ice nucleating particles are not affected by the solute. Therefore, the complex behavior of the IN activities can only be explained in terms of solute-surface-specific processes. We suggest that the immediate exchange of the native cations (K+, Na+, Ca2+) with protons, when feldspars are immersed in water, is a prerequisite for their high IN efficiency. On the other hand, excess cations from dissolved alkali salts prevent surface protonation, thus explaining the decreased IN activity in such solutions. In kaolinite, the lack of exchangeable cations in the crystal lattice explains why the IN activity is insensitive to the presence of alkali salts (Δaw= const.). We hypothesize that adsorption of NH3 and NH+4 on the feldspar surface rather than ion exchange is the main reason for the anomalous increased Thet in dilute solutions of NH3 or NH+4 salts. This is supported by the response of kaolinite to NH3 or NH+4, despite lacking exchangeable ions. Finally, the dissolution of feldspars in water or solutions leads to depletion of Al and formation of an amorphous layer enriched in Si. This hampers the IN activity of andesine the most, followed by sanidine, then eventually microcline, the least soluble feldspar.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000343155",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-6059-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/343155","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ice nucleation activity of silicates and aluminosilicates in pure water and aqueous solutions - Part 3: Aluminosilicates","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-05-21T04:12:26Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Ice freezing on mineral dust samples","156251","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85065611744",,"000467412800003","Atmos. chem. phys.","9","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In an attempt to bridge the gap between previous large-scale and small-scale modeling efforts, atmospheric simulations are being run at an unprecedented range of resolutions. The gray zone is the range of grid resolutions where particular features are neither subgrid nor fully resolved, but rather are partially resolved. The definition of a gray zone depends strongly on the feature being represented and its relationship to the model resolution. This paper explores three gray zones relevant to simulations over complex terrain: turbulence, convection, and topography. Taken together, these may be referred to as the gray continuum. The focus is on horizontal grid resolutions from ∼10 km to ∼10 m. In each case, the challenges are presented together with recent progress in the literature. A common theme is to address cross-scale interaction and scale-awareness in parameterization schemes. How numerical models are designed to cross these gray zones is critical to complex terrain applications in numerical weather prediction, wind resource forecasting, and regional climate modeling, among others.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000353068",,"2073-4433",,"10.3390/atmos10050274","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/353068","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Mesoscale modeling||Microscale modeling||Gray zone||Gray continuum||Terra incognita||Complex terrain","Crossing multiple gray zones in the transition from mesoscale to microscale simulation over complex terrain","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2019-07-13T02:15:04Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85074084459",,"000472677600048",,"5","Atmosphere","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Precipitation patterns are known to be changing across the GHA, but trajectories in land surface variables are much less well known. We simulated the GHA land surface environment to assess the balance between natural cycles and human‐induced climate change. Using a new form of event attribution study where we focused on both climate variables and also directly simulated land surface variables, we combined publicly volunteered distributed computing with land surface simulations to quantify land surface responses. Uncertainty was quantified both for climate model and land surface model outputs. We identified two distinct “drought trajectories” in the GHA bimodal seasonality area during the March–May (Long Rains season) of 2014. Human‐induced climate change may have resulted in regions from Lake Nalubaale (Lake Victoria) to Northern Kenya receiving less precipitation in this season and having up to 20% higher probability of drought‐level evapotranspiration rates (increasing drought). In contrast, the simulated anthropogenic climate change signal for this season induced somewhat wetter conditions and up to 20% lower probability of drought‐level evapotranspiration in Eastern Ethiopia, Southern Somalia, and coastal Kenya (decreasing drought). Uncertainties in our modeling system varied by region and variable of focus, but broadly we found that land surface simulation uncertainty neither added significantly to climate model uncertainty nor significantly reduced it.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000340757",,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2018jd030085","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340757","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","Climate change||Extreme events||Attribution||Land surface science||Evaporation","The impact of human‐induced climate change on regional drought in the Horn of Africa","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-05-06T09:44:52Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85065158751",,"000469071400017","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","8","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","124","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A textbook example was observed around 12 July 2012 (EV69), when almost the entire GrIS was melting, including Summit Station at 3216 m in the dry inland plateau. The melt event coincided with strong meridional air mass transport towards the GrIS followed by a Greenland blocking, which resembles the anomalous synoptic pattern that became increasingly frequent in the North Atlantic region in the last two decades. Here, we investigate the atmospheric forcing of extraordinary melt periods by assessing the main dynamical and thermodynamic processes that cause so-called warm events. We present an ERA-Interim-based climatology of 77 Greenland warm events affecting the high accumulation area in 1979-2017. These events became longer and more frequent during the study period. With Lagrangian backward trajectories started from the lowermost ~500 m above the GrIS, we identify transport from a climatologically warmer region as key process for Greenland warm events. With an about 15° latitude more southerly air mass origin and subsidence-induced adiabatic warming, this process is twice as important as diabatic heating to the final warm anomaly over North and East Greenland. In South and West Greenland, major contributions come from ascending air masses and in the Southwest, warm events are dominated by orographically induced latent heating as opposed to transport. 70-85% of all warm events go along with a Greenland blocking, which we suggest induces additional melt via modulations of the surface energy budget not captured by our Lagrangian methodology. We further qualify the importance of the concurrent US Great Plains heatwave for EV69. In contrast to previous studies, we find that air masses arriving over the GrIS during EV69 mostly originated from the Canadian Arctic, Newfoundland and the subtropical North Atlantic, which were partly also anomalously warm. Given the relevance of atmospheric blocking for Greenland warm events and their link to anomalously warm summers, it is crucial, as we argue, to better understand the modification of inter-annual climate variability by climate change in the North Atlantic region, to more accurately predict future GrIS mass loss. Also, more research on cloud radiative effects is needed to capture the GrIS-wide variability of surface energy budget anomalies during Greenland blocking.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000348060",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/348060","en","ETH Zurich, Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science (IAC)","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","atmospheric dynamics||Greenland||warm events||ERA-Interim||backward trajectories","A Lagrangian Analysis of the Dynamical and Thermodynamic Drivers of Greenland Warm Events during 1979-2017","Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2019-06-18T05:48:53Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we infer complementary reference estimates for its components specifically under cloud-free conditions. While the clear-sky fluxes at the top of atmosphere (TOA) are accurately known from satellite measurements, the corresponding fluxes at the Earth’s surface are not equally well established, as they cannot be directly measured from space. This is also evident in 38 global climate models from CMIP5, which are shown to greatly vary in their clear-sky surface radiation budgets. To better constrain the latter, we established new clear-sky reference climatologies of surface downward shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes from worldwide distributed Baseline Surface Radiation Network sites. 33 out of the 38 CMIP5 models overestimate the clear-sky downward shortwave reference climatologies, whereas both substantial overestimations and underestimations are found in the longwave counterparts in some of the models. From the bias structure of the CMIP5 models we infer best estimates for the global mean surface downward clear-sky shortwave and longwave radiation, at 247 and 314 Wm−2, respectively. With a global mean surface albedo of 13.5% and net shortwave clear-sky flux of 287 Wm−2 at the TOA this results in a global mean clear-sky surface and atmospheric shortwave absorption of 214 and 73 Wm−2, respectively. From the newly-established diagrams of the global energy balance under clear-sky and all-sky conditions, we quantify the cloud radiative effects not only at the TOA, but also within the atmosphere and at the surface.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000315014",,"0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-018-4413-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/315014","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The cloud-free global energy balance and inferred cloud radiative effects: an assessment based on direct observations and climate models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-01-10T16:36:03Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85052554702",,"000467187600054","Clim Dyn","7-8","Climate Dynamics","52","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Nevertheless, recent work suggests that ozone in thelower stratosphere (<24 km) continued to decline over 1998–2016, offsetting recovery at higher altitudes and preventing a statistically significant increase in quasi-global (60◦S – 60◦N) total column ozone. In 2017, a large lower stratospheric ozone resurgence over less than 12 months was estimated (using a chemistry-transport model; CTM) to have wiped out the long-term decline in the quasi-global integrated lower stratospheric ozone column. Here, we extend the analysis of space-based  ozone  observations  to  December  2018  using  the  BASICSG ozone  composite.  We  find  that the observed 2017 resurgence was only around half that modelled by the CTM, was of comparable magnitude to other strong inter-annual changes in the past, and restricted to southern hemispheric mid-latitudes (SH; 60◦S–30◦S). In the SH mid-latitude lower stratosphere, the data suggest that by the end of 2018 ozone is still likely lower than in 1998 (probability∼80%). In contrast, tropical andnorthern hemisphere (NH) ozone continue to display ongoing decreases, exceeding 90% probability. Robust tropical (>95%, 30◦S–30◦N) decreases dominate the quasi-global integrated decrease (99% probability); the integrated tropical stratospheric column (1–100 hPa, 30◦S–30◦N) displays a significant overall decrease, with 95% probability. These decreases do not reveal an inefficacy of the Montreal Protocol. Rather, they suggest other effects to be at work, mainly dynamical variabilityon long or short timescales, counteracting the protocol’s regulation of halogenated ozone depleting substances (hODS). We demonstrate that large inter-annual mid-latitude variations (30◦–60◦),such as the 2017 resurgence, are driven by non-linear QBO phase-dependent seasonal variability. However, this variability is not represented in current regression analyses. To understand if observed lower stratospheric decreases are a transient or long-term phenomenon, progress needs to be made in accounting for this dynamically-driven variability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000384707",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-2019-243","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/384707","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Stratospheric ozone trends for 1985–2018: sensitivity to recent large variability","Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2019-12-11T11:44:38Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atmos. chem. phys. discuss.",,"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we investigate the event-to-event hydroclimatic intensity, where an event is a pair of adjacent wet and dry spells, under future warming scenarios. According to a set of targeted multi-model large ensemble experiments, event-wise intensification will significantly increase globally for an additional 0.5 °C warming beyond 1.5 °C. In high latitudinal regions of the North American continent and Eurasia, this intensification is likely to involve overwhelming increases in wet spell intensity. Western and Eastern North America will likely experience more intense wet spells with negligible changes of dry spells. For the Mediterranean region, enhancement of dry spells seems to be dominating compared to the decrease in wet spell strength, and this will lead to an overall event-wise intensification. Furthermore, the extreme intensification could be 10 times stronger than the mean intensification. The high damage potential of such drastic changes between flood and drought conditions poses a major challenge to adaptation, and the findings suggest that risks could be substantially reduced by achieving a 1.5 °C target.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000331506",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-019-39936-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/331506","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Event-to-event intensification of the hydrologic cycle from 1.5 °C to a 2 °C warmer world","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-03-15T06:38:14Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85062586291",,"000460381600056","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The FIGAERO-HR-ToF-CIMS provides simultaneous molecular information relating to both the gas- and particle-phase samples and has been used to extract vapour pressures (VPs) of the compounds desorbing from the filter whilst giving quantitative concentrations in the particle phase. However, such extraction of vapour pressures of the measured particle-phase components requires use of appropriate, well-defined, reference compounds. Vapour pressures for the homologous series of polyethylene glycols (PEG) ((H−(O−CH2−CH2)n−OH) for n=3 to n=8), covering a range of vapour pressures (VP) (10−1 to 10−7 Pa) that are atmospherically relevant, have been shown to be reproduced well by a range of different techniques, including Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometry (KEMS). This is the first homologous series of compounds for which a number of vapour pressure measurement techniques have been found to be in agreement, indicating the utility as a calibration standard, providing an ideal set of benchmark compounds for accurate characterization of the FIGAERO for extracting vapour pressure of measured compounds in chambers and the real atmosphere. To demonstrate this, single-component and mixture vapour pressure measurements are made using two FIGAERO-HR-ToF-CIMS instruments based on a new calibration determined from the PEG series. VP values extracted from both instruments agree well with those measured by KEMS and reported values from literature, validating this approach for extracting VP data from the FIGAERO. This method is then applied to chamber measurements, and the vapour pressures of known products are estimated.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000331501",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-12-1429-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/331501","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A method for extracting calibrated volatility information from the FIGAERO-HR-ToF-CIMS and its experimental application","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-03-15T06:24:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85062620018",,"000460407300001","Atmos. meas. tech.","3","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Their projections are used in integrated assessments of climate change. Here we test, for the first time, systematically across many important systems, how well such impact models capture the impacts of extreme climate conditions. Using the 2003 European heat wave and drought as a historical analogue for comparable events in the future, we find that a majority of models underestimate the extremeness of impacts in important sectors such as agriculture, terrestrial ecosystems, and heat-related human mortality, while impacts on water resources and hydropower are overestimated in some river basins; and the spread across models is often large. This has important implications for economic assessments of climate change impacts that rely on these models. It also means that societal risks from future extreme events may be greater than previously thought.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000330244",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-019-08745-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/330244","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"State-of-the-art global models underestimate impacts from climate extremes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-03-09T03:41:49Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85062292878",,"000459988600017","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

PPD-HS performs an in-situ analysis of the spatial intensity distribution of near forward scattered light for individual hydrometeors yielding shape properties. Discrimination of spherical and aspherical particles is based on an analysis of the symmetry of the recorded scattering patterns. Scattering patterns are collected onto two linear detector arrays, reducing the complete 2D scattering pattern to scattered light intensities captured onto two linear, one dimensional strips of light sensitive pixels. Using this reduced scattering information, we calculate symmetry indicators that are used for particle shape and ultimately phase analysis. This reduction of information allows for detection rates of a few hundred particles per second.  Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of instrument performance using both spherical and aspherical particles, generated in a well-controlled laboratory setting using a Vibrating Orifice Aerosol Generator (VOAG) and covering a size range of approximately 3–32 micron. We use supervised machine learning to train a random forest model on the VOAG data sets that can be used to classify any particles detected by PPD-HS. Classification results show that the PPD-HS can successfully discriminate between spherical and aspherical particles, with misclassification below 5 % for diameters > 3 micro meter. This phase discrimination method is subsequently applied to classify simulated cloud particles produced in a continuous flow diffusion chamber setup. We report observations of small, near-spherical ice crystals at early stages of the ice nucleation experiments, where shape analysis fails to correctly determine the particle phase. Nevertheless, in case of simultaneous presence of cloud droplets and ice crystals, the introduced particle shape indicators allow for a clear distinction between these two classes independent of optical particle size. We conclude that PPD-HS constitutes a powerful new instrument to size and discriminate phase of cloud hydrometeors and thus study microphysical properties of mixed-phase clouds, that represent a major source of uncertainty in aerosol indirect effect for future climate projections.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000313787",,"1867-8610",,"10.5194/amt-2019-36","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/313787","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A High Speed Particle Phase Discriminator (PPD-HS) for the classification of airborne particles, as tested in a continuous flow diffusion chamber","Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2019-01-04T16:33:04Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atmos. meas. tech., Pap. open discuss.",,"Atmospheric Measurement Techniques Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Marine I and Se emissions and subsequent atmospheric wet deposition has been suggested to be an important source of I and Se to soils and terrestrial food chains. However, the contribution of recycled moisture of continental origin to I and Se to precipitation has never been analyzed. Here we report concentrations and speciation of I and Se, as well as of bromine (Br), sulfur (S), and DOC-δ13C signatures for weekly collected precipitation samples (in the period of April 2015 to September 2016) at two high altitude sites, i.e., Jungfraujoch (JFJ; Switzerland) and Pic du Midi (PDM; France). Analysis of precipitation chemistry and moisture sources indicate combined marine and continental sources of precipitation and Se, I, Br, and S at both sites. At JFJ, concentrations of I and Se were highest when continental moisture sources were dominant, indicating important terrestrial sources for these elements. Furthermore, correlations between investigated elements and DOC-δ13C, particularly when continental moisture source contributions were high, indicate a link between these elements and the source of dissolved organic matter, especially for I (JFJ and PDM) and Se (JFJ).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000322419",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.8b05533","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322419","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Marine versus continental sources of iodine and selenium in rainfall at two European high-altitude locations","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-01T09:11:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85061860435",,"000459642500019","Environ.

A set of three metrics are used to assess the sensitivity of afternoon rainfall occurrence to morning soil moisture in terms of their spatial, temporal, and heterogeneity characteristics. Positive (negative) spatial feedback indicates that the afternoon rainfall occurs more frequently over wetter (drier) land surface than its surroundings. Positive (negative) temporal feedback indicates preference over temporally wetter (drier) conditions, and positive (negative) heterogeneity feedback indicates preference over more spatially heterogeneous (homogeneous) soil moisture conditions. We confirm previous results highlighting a dominantly positive spatial feedback in the models as opposed to observations. On average, models tend to agree better with observations for temporal and heterogeneity feedback characteristics, although intermodel variability is largest for these metrics. The collective influence of the three feedbacks suggests that they may lead to more localized precipitation persistence in models than in observations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000328689",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2018GL080879","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/328689","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","soil moisture‐precipitation feedback||global climate models||subdaily precipitation","Soil Moisture Effects on Afternoon Precipitation Occurrence in Current Climate Models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-03-03T03:31:24Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85061568427",,"000462072800081","Geophys.

To understand the chain of processes and ensure climate models adequately represent them, it is important to detect and quantify an accurate SC ozone response from observations. Chemistry climate models (CCMs) and observations display a range of upper stratosphere (1–10 hPa) zonally averaged spatial responses; this and the recommended data set for comparison remains disputed. Recent data‐merging advancements have led to more robust observational data. Using these data, we show that the observed SC signal exhibits an upper stratosphere U‐shaped spatial structure with lobes emanating from the tropics (5–10 hPa) to high altitudes at midlatitudes (1–3 hPa). We confirm this using two independent chemistry climate models in specified dynamics mode and an idealized timeslice experiment. We recommend the BASICv2 ozone composite to best represent historical upper stratospheric solar variability, and that those based on SBUV alone should not be used.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000328691",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2018GL081501","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/328691","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","solar cycle||stratospheric ozone||climate models||satellite observations||specified dynamics||time series analysis","The Upper Stratospheric Solar Cycle Ozone Response","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-03-03T03:31:24Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"SPARC International Project office","138017||138017","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen||Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,,"85061427102",,"000462072800078","Geophys.

In-situ streamflow observations from the GSIM dataset are used to train a machine learning algorithm that predicts monthly runoff rates based on antecedent precipitation and temperature from the Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3 (GSWP3) meteorological forcing dataset. We thank Prof. Dr. Hyungjun Kim for developing the GSWP3 dataset and providing us with early access to the data. The data is stored in a single NetCDFv4 file at monthly resolution covering the period 1902-2014. The dataset is provided on a 0.5 degrees (WGS84) grid in units of mm/day. The runoff time series correspond to the ensemble mean of 50 reconstructions obtained by training the machine learning model with different subsets of data.

Trends are estimated using the Sen‐Theil slope, and the significance of mean regional trends is established through bootstrapping. Changes in the indices are often regionally consistent, showing that the entire flow distribution is moving either upward or downward. In addition, the analysis confirms the complex nature of hydrological change where drying in some regions (e.g., in the Mediterranean) is contrasted by wetting in other regions (e.g., North Asia). Observed changes are discussed in the context of previous results and with respect to model estimates of the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and human water management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000328047",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2018GL079725","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/328047","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Observed Trends in Global Indicators of Mean and Extreme Streamflow","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-27T11:35:23Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate","617518","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,"85060546001",,"000458607400026","Geophys.

Here we identify a physically meaningful relationship between present‐day mean precipitation and projected changes in water availability. This suggests that the uncertainty can be reduced by conditioning the ensemble on observed precipitation, which is achieved through a novel probabilistic approach that uses Approximate Bayesian Computation. Comparing the constrained with the full ensemble shows that projected extreme changes in water availability, denoted by the 5th and 95th percentile of the full ensemble, are less likely over 73% and 63% of land, respectively. There is also an overall shift toward wetter conditions over Europe, Southern Africa, and Western North America, whereas the opposite occurs over the Amazon.

Most currently used statistical bias-adjustment methods adjust each climate variable separately, even though impacts usually depend on multiple potentially dependent variables. Human heat stress, for instance, depends on temperature and relative humidity, two variables that are often strongly correlated. Whether univariate bias-adjustment methods effectively improve estimates of impacts that depend on multiple drivers is largely unknown, and the lack of long-term impact data prevents a direct comparison between model outputs and observations for many climate-related impacts. Here we use two hazard indicators, heat stress and a simple fire risk indicator, as proxies for more sophisticated impact models. We show that univariate bias-adjustment methods such as univariate quantile mapping often cannot effectively reduce biases in multivariate hazard estimates. In some cases, it even increases biases. These cases typically occur (i) when hazards depend equally strongly on more than one climatic driver, (ii) when models exhibit biases in the dependence structure of drivers and (iii) when univariate biases are relatively small. Using a perfect model approach, we further quantify the uncertainty in bias-adjusted hazard indicators due to internal variability and show how imperfect bias adjustment can amplify this uncertainty. Both issues can be addressed successfully with a statistical bias adjustment that corrects the multivariate dependence structure in addition to the marginal distributions of the climate drivers. Our results suggest that currently many modeled climate impacts are associated with uncertainties related to the choice of bias adjustment. We conclude that in cases where impacts depend on multiple dependent climate variables these uncertainties can be reduced using statistical bias-adjustment approaches that correct the variables' multivariate dependence structure.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000315344",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-10-31-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/315344","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The effect of univariate bias adjustment on multivariate hazard estimates","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-01-14T06:32:35Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach","641816","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,,"85059612184",,"000455085900002",,"1","Earth System Dynamics","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is usually defined in terms of the level of warming above the present for an abrupt halt of emissions. Owing to socioeconomic constraints, this situation is unlikely, so we focus on the committed warming from present-day fossil fuel assets. Here we show that if carbon-intensive infrastructure is phased out at the end of its design lifetime from the end of 2018, there is a 64% chance that peak global mean temperature rise remains below 1.5 °C. Delaying mitigation until 2030 considerably reduces the likelihood that 1.5 °C would be attainable even if the rate of fossil fuel retirement was accelerated. Although the challenges laid out by the Paris Agreement are daunting, we indicate 1.5 °C remains possible and is attainable with ambitious and immediate emission reduction across all sectors.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000319137",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-018-07999-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/319137","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Current fossil fuel infrastructure does not yet commit us to 1.5 degrees C warming","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-01-24T03:36:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060016521",,"000455596700001","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

How often such events occur in a warmer world is however less well established, and the combined effect of changes in frequency and intensity on the total amount of rain falling as extreme precipitation is much less explored, in spite of potentially large societal impacts. Here, we employ observations and climate model simulations to document strong increases in the frequencies of extreme precipitation events occurring on decadal timescales. Based on observations we find that the total precipitation from these intense events almost doubles per degree of warming, mainly due to changes in frequency, while the intensity changes are relatively weak, in accordance to previous studies. This shift towards stronger total precipitation from extreme events is seen in observations and climate models, and increases with the strength – and hence the rareness – of the event. Based on these results, we project that if historical trends continue, the most intense precipitation events observed today are likely to almost double in occurrence for each degree of further global warming. Changes to extreme precipitation of this magnitude are dramatically stronger than the more widely communicated changes to global mean precipitation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000378073",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-019-52277-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/378073","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Frequency of extreme precipitation increases extensively with event rareness under global warming","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-11-17T03:46:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85074742206",,"000494258500083","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it is known that research groups share literature, ideas for representations of processes, parameterisations, evaluation data sets and even sections of model code. Thus, nominally different models might have similar biases because of similarities in the way they represent a subset of processes, or even be near-duplicates of others, weakening the assumption that they constitute independent estimates. If there are near-replicates of some models, then treating all models equally is likely to bias the inferences made using these ensembles. The challenge is to establish the degree to which this might be true for any given application. While this issue is recognised by many in the community, quantifying and accounting for model dependence in anything other than an ad-hoc way is challenging. Here we present a synthesis of the range of disparate attempts to define, quantify and address model dependence in multi-model climate ensembles in a common conceptual framework, and provide guidance on how users can test the efficacy of approaches that move beyond the equally weighted ensemble. In the upcoming Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), several new models that are closely related to existing models are anticipated, as well as large ensembles from some models. We argue that quantitatively accounting for dependence in addition to model performance, and thoroughly testing the effectiveness of the approach used will be key to a sound interpretation of the CMIP ensembles in future scientific studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000325234",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-10-91-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/325234","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"ESD Reviews: Model dependence in multi-model climate ensembles: weighting, sub-selection and out-of-sample testing","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-14T12:59:08Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85061579648",,"000458515500001",,"1","Earth System Dynamics","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Ice crystals are important as surfaces for heterogeneous chemical reactions, influence the hydrological cycle through initiation of precipitation formation and determine climate by impacting Earth's energy balance. Ice crystals can form in cirrus clouds at temperatures below 235 K and in mixed-phase clouds (MPCs), where the temperature (T) range is between 235-273 K and supercooled cloud droplets and ice crystals can co-exists in a thermodynamically metastable state. The initial formation of an ice crystal is usually catalyzed by aerosols that can act as ice nucleating particles (INPs), through lowering of the thermodynamic energy barrier that is associated with forming the ice phase. Despite significant advances in understanding atmospheric ice formation over the past decades, representation of the ice phase in global climate models remains associated with major uncertainties in terms of projected radiative forcing. This mainly results from a lack of understanding the aerosol-cloud interactions and their feedback processes, such as impacts on cloud phase, lifetime and albedo effects. While some aerosol species, such as mineral dust, have been identified as important INPs and environmental conditions required for dust particles to nucleate ice seem to be well understood, research on the ice nucleation activity of soot particles remains inconclusive. This despite soot being considered the second most important radiative forcing agent and constituting a major anthropogenic pollutant from fossil fuel and biomass combustion. The contradictory results of the ice formation ability of soot are mainly based on an insufficient understanding of the relationship between the physicochemical particle properties and ice nucleation activity and mechanism, respectively. In addition, the link of the particle properties to how these can change upon atmospheric aging of the soot particles is largely unknown. As such, understanding of these processes is required to quantify the impacts of anthropogenic climate change. The goal of this thesis is to improve the understanding of soot ice nucleation through an experimental investigation of the cloud formation abilities of different combustion particles in a controlled laboratory setup. Laboratory measurements were performed on six different soot types. The ice nucleation activity was studied using a continuous flow diffusion chamber (CFDC) setup over a temperature range from 218-253 K, covering the MPC and cirrus regime, as a function of relative humidity (RH) and soot particle size. Particle physicochemial properties were characterized by a suite of auxiliary measurements, including water vapor sorption and thermogravimetric analysis. A strong dependence on the temperature regime was found, with ice nucleation being absent for T > 235 K, where only supercooled liquid cloud droplets formed on the soot particles. At cirrus temperatures, a dependence of ice nucleation on the particle size was observed, with larger particles showing ice nucleation activity at lower ice supersaturations at a given T. The ice nucleation was strongly linked to the particle properties, in particular the wettability of the soot. This, along with the dependence on the temperature regime revealed a pore condensation and freezing (PCF) mechanism to be the responsible ice nucleation mechanism. The impact of atmospheric aging on the ice nucleation activity of soot was investigated through two independent studies, addressing the effect of cloud processing and aging of particles in acidic aqueous solutions, respectively. To test the role of cloud processing on soot ice nucleation activity, a new experimental platform was developed, where two CFDCs are coupled in series. The setup allows to mimic different cloud processing scenarios in the first CFDC and subsequently test the ice nucleation activity of the cloud processed aerosol particles within the second CFDC. Upon cloud processing, the soot properties changed with processed particles showing enhanced cloud formation potential at T < 233 K. In particular, the cloud processed particles were found to show a change in wettability and particle morphology, with processed soot aggregates forming more compact clusters with increased total pore volume and wettability. An increased ice nucleation activity was found, independent of the cloud processing scenario. Furthermore, the formation of a cloud hydrometeor was identified to be the key factor for enhancing the ice nucleation activity. Overall the better ice nucleation ability was attributed to an enhanced ice formation via PCF, resulting from the changes in particle properties upon cloud processing. Moreover, the effect on soot ice nucleation by aging of soot particles in acidic aqueous solutions, mimicking aging in cloud and haze droplets was investigated. Aging was achieved through exposure of the soots to slightly acidic and aqueous solutions containing sulfuric acid and pure water only. Aged soot samples showed a significantly enhanced ice nucleation activity, which could be linked to distinct chemical functionalities present on the particles by characterization using near edge X-ray fine structure spectroscopy. Finally, to further the understanding on cloud phase fractionation, a new instrument, the high speed particle phase discriminator (PPD-HS) was tested and characterized. PPD-HS is shown to accurately discriminate the shape of spherical cloud droplets and aspherical ice crystals based on symmetry analysis of the spatial intensity distribution of near-forward scattered light. The lower size limit for particle shape discrimination using PPD-HS was experimentally found to be approximately 3 micrometer, with detection rates of a few hundred particles per second, thus showing enhanced capabilities to previous devices. Deployment of PPD-HS within a CFDC setup was successfully tested and provides an alternative to the previous deployment of a particle size threshold for discriminating cloud droplets and ice crystals at MPC conditions. Hence, phase discrimination can be achieved largely independent of particle size when using of PPD-HS.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000371220",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/371220","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"A burning issue - Soot particles acting as ice cloud seeds","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2019-10-17T11:55:22Z","2020-10-17",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"25922",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Involvement of soot in clouds and their release back into the atmosphere can form residual particles with altered cloud forming potential. The impact and extent of such different cloud processing scenarios on ice nucleation is however not well understood. In this work, we present the impact of cloud processing of soot aerosols on subsequent ice nucleation cycles at T ≤ 233 K. Coupling of two continuous flow diffusion chambers allows the simulation of different cloud processing scenarios and investigation of subsequent ice nucleation activity of the processed particles. The processing scenarios presented here encompass contrail, cirrus and mixed-phase cloud processing, mimicking typical pathways that soot particles can be exposed to in the atmosphere. For all scenarios tested, the processed particles showed an enhanced ice active fraction for T < 233 K. The relative humidity with respect to water for the ice nucleation onset was observed to be on average approximately 10 % (RHi = 16 %) lower for the cloud processed particles compared to the unprocessed soot, for which ice nucleation was observed close to or at homogeneous freezing conditions of solution droplets. We attribute the enhanced ice nucleation abilities of the cloud processed soot to a pore condensation and freezing mechanism and have identified key parameters governing these changes. Enhanced ice nucleation abilities of soot in cirrus clouds can have significant impacts, given the importance of the atmospheric ice phase for precipitation formation and global climate.","text/csv||text/plain","10.3929/ethz-b-000340269",,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340269","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"The Impact of Cloud Processing on the Ice Nucleation Abilities of Soot Particles at Cirrus Temperatures","Dataset","Open access",,,,"2019-04-30T16:26:24Z",,"indefinite","292278994-08-17T07:12:55Z",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recent advances in our understanding of past land use and aerosol–climate interactions make it valuable to revisit the way humans may have affected the climate of the Roman era. Here we estimate the effect of humans on some climate variables in the Roman Empire at its apogee, focusing on the impact of anthropogenic land cover and aerosol emissions. For this we combined existing land use scenarios with novel estimates (low, medium, high) of aerosol emissions from fuel combustion and burning of agricultural land. Aerosol emissions from agricultural burning were greater than those from fuel consumption but of the same order of magnitude.  Using the global aerosol-enabled climate model ECHAM-HAM-SALSA, we conducted simulations with fixed sea-surface temperatures to gain a first impression about the possible climate impact of anthropogenic land cover and aerosols in the Roman Empire. While land use effects induced a regional warming for one of the reconstructions caused by decreases in turbulent flux, aerosol emissions enhanced the cooling effect of clouds and thus led to a cooling in the Roman Empire. Quantifying the anthropogenic influence on climate is, however, challenging since our model likely overestimates aerosol-effective radiative forcing and prescribes the sea-surface temperatures.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000376097",,"1814-9324||1814-9332",,"10.5194/cp-15-1885-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/376097","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Effects of land use and anthropogenic aerosol emissions in the Roman Empire","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-11-08T03:33:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Paleo fires from high-alpine ice cores","CRSII2_154450/1","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Sinergia",,,,"85074423406",,"000492831100001","Clim. past","5","Climate of the Past","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

On one side, atmospheric soot particles have a warming effect since they absorb solar radiation (direct aerosol effect). On the other side, there are indications that soot particles could contribute to the formation of clouds, which would have a cooling effect and might offset their warming effect (indirect aerosol effect). However, there is no consensus on the scale of the cloud formation potential of soot particles. The reasons for this situation are various aging processes soot particles can undergo once they are emitted into the atmosphere. Some of these aging processes can convert initially hydrophobic particles into efficient cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Investigating these aging processes in a laboratory environment is a challenging task since soot particle have an atmospheric lifetime of approximately one week. In an ideal setting, this period should be covered in the experiments. The heterogeneous oxidation with ozone is one of these aging processes. An experimental approach, that is not that prominent in atmospheric sciences yet, was applied to investigate this process by operating a comparatively small (< 3 m3) aerosol chamber as continuousflow stirred tank reactor (CSTR). This approach allows to age soot particles for up to 16 h at atmospheric ozone concentration levels (0 – 200 ppb), and particle number concentrations below 1500 cm-3. Therefore, this approach allows for size resolved aging experiments. Results obtained from experimental studies within such a CSTR setup show that initially CCN inactive soot particles rich in organic carbon (OC; 30 – 60 %) show CCN activity at 0.3 % super saturation (SS) after 10 h of aging at 200 ppb ozone. Soot particles with a lower OC content (10 %) required an approximately four times longer aging time to become CCN activity at the same SS. No influence of a relative humidity below 75 % on the CCN activity was detected. In view of the potential global impact, simulations with the global circulation model (GCM) ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3 were conducted in which the new experimental results were implemented by a new parameterization. It was found that the oxidation of soot particles with ozone can significantly increase the CCN burden and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) especially in northern mid-latitudes (> 60 °N). Experiments conducted at different O3-concentration levels (0 – 200 ppb) show that the reaction rate that leads to the increase in CCN activity is not directly proportional to the O3- concentration. Instead the reaction kinetic can be described best with a Langmuir-type mechanism. The initial step is the fast (several minutes) adsorption of ozone on the particle surface, which was detected experimentally by an increase in the particle diameter by up to 3.7 nm. The second step is a slow reaction (several hours) of the adsorbed ozone with theiv particle itself, which led to an increase in CCN activity. During this slow chemical modification no further change in the particle diameter was detected. A Langmuir-sorption constant (Keq) of 0.0357 ppb-1 was calculated from the CCN activation data. The evolution of the ozone surface coverage (Langmuir-isotherm) based on this Keq agreed well with the change in particle diameter. Further, it was observed that a temperature increase by 30 K (from 5 °C to 35 °C) increases the reaction rate by a factor of 5, which corresponds to an activation energy (EA) of 38.5 ± 1 kJ·mol-1. These results allow for the conclusion that the temperature is as important as the ozone concentration for the CCN activation of soot particles at atmospheric conditions","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000371357",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/371357","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Aerosol particles||atmospheric aging||ozone||CSTR||cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)||black carbon||Soot oxidation","Cloud droplet activity of soot particles after exposure to ozone at atmospheric conditions","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment",,"2019-10-17T15:36:04Z","2020-10-18",,,,"yes",,,,,"Soot Particle Ageing Cloud Effects - SPACE","161343","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione","26011",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Extreme rainfall events can be a threat to the population and challenge the limits of weather monitoring and prediction systems. For practical use, the forecasting techniques at our disposal range from physically-based numerical models to heuristic extrapolation procedures based on weather radars. Radar-based nowcasting models rely on the high spatial and temporal resolution of radar measurements and thus benefit from the best possible initial conditions, but the assumption of persistence leads to a rapid decay of predictive skill with increasing lead time and decreasing spatial scale.  Numerical models provide physically consistent precipitation forecasts, but their practical relevance for nowcasting can be undermined by uncertain initial conditions, spinup issues, model approximations, or simply by their computational limits.   Analyses presented in this study show that, on average, radar-based nowcasting outperforms numerical simulations during the first three hours and that it is particularly useful for forecasting precipitation patterns with a horizontal dimension below 60 kilometers, as state-of-the-art numerical models cannot provide useful skill at those small spatial scales.  An interesting finding is that the predictive uncertainty of numerical predictions relatively to radar nowcasting improves during warm convective days, which is explained by the combined effect of shorter precipitation lifetimes and more effective model assimilation of locally triggered air mass convection. After a lead time of 4.5 hours, we observed that precipitation on all scales below 150 kilometers is poorly predictable by all forecasting means.  Such serious limits to predictability determine the need to represent forecast uncertainty as accurately as possible. In radar nowcasting, ensemble methods use stochastic simulations to perturb a deterministic extrapolation and thus quantify forecast errors.  We found that a more precise representation of the statistical properties of the precipitation field through localization can have a positive impact on the realism of the simulations as well as in terms of probabilistic forecast skill. We showed that localized nowcasts perform better in terms of ensemble reliability and resolution, as well as conditional bias. However, we also found that a too strong a localization can lead to lower skill as it implicitly relies on a stricter assumption of persistence.  The quantitative estimation of forecast uncertainty provided by ensembles was finally used to design a seamless blending procedure that integrates all available sources of predictive skill.  Implemented using a recursive formulation of the Bayesian update equations, the blending scheme involves a prediction step through a stochastic radar extrapolation, while a subsequent correction step updates the extrapolation using information from the most recent numerical model run.  It is found that such an approach is able to capture the flow dependence of both the numerical forecast and the radar nowcast ensemble spreads resulting in an adaptive blending scheme that depends on the relative uncertainty of the individual forecasts. Despite the non-Gaussian nature of rainfall data, we were able to produce blended precipitation forecasts that are at least as skillful as the radar-only or the numerical model-only forecasts at any lead time.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000391932",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/391932","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Rainfall||Nowcasting||Radars/Radar observations||Forecasting and nowcasting||Scale dependence||Verification||Optical flow||STOCHASTIC MODELS + STOCHASTIC SIMULATION (PROBABILITY THEORY)||AUTOREGRESSION (MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS)||Kalman filters","Ensemble precipitation nowcasting: limits to prediction, localization and seamless blending","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2020-01-20T09:10:37Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"26091",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In particular, cloud presence, vertical and horizontal extent, micro- and macrophysical characteristics, temperature, and thermodynamic phase are relevant properties determining the cloud's interaction with its environment. Especially Arctic low-level clouds have been found to strongly interact with atmospheric radiation and to have a net warming effect on the Earth surface during most of the year through the emission of longwave radiation. Low-level clouds reside within the boundary layer and are often mixed-phase, i.e. they contain a mixture of cloud ice and liquid water. Even though the coexistence of ice and liquid is thermodynamically unstable, low-level Arctic mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) have been found to be particularly persistent, a phenomenon that has puzzled the scientific community for decades. Yet, a profound understanding of the processes controlling Arctic MPC persistence, microphysics, and dynamics is so far missing. In order to contribute to the current understanding of processes controlling Arctic low-level MPC properties, semi-idealized cloud-resolving model simulations are explored. At high horizontal (120-200 m) and vertical (25-50 m within the atmospheric boundary layer) resolutions, cloud driven circulations are accurately resolved, while cloud microphysical properties are parameterized. All simulations are based on MPC observations obtained during the Aerosol-Cloud Coupling and Climate Interactions in the Arctic (ACCACIA) campaign in March 2013. In the first part of this work, cloud properties over varying surface conditions (i.e. open ocean and sea ice) are investigated. As sea ice has been retreating in recent years, altered cloud dynamics in response to surface forcing provide valuable insights of future cloud occurrence in the Arctic. In addition, with retreating sea ice the Arctic Ocean becomes more accessible for shipping, such that Arctic clouds are likely to be exposed to higher levels of aerosols. In our simulations, a stratiform MPC forms, which features additional convective structures over the open ocean. Over both surfaces, aerosol perturbations (cloud condensation nuclei and ice-nucleating particles; CCN and INPs, respectively) induce a temporary increase in cloud liquid and ice water content. The MPC over the open ocean shows a faster and stronger response to sudden aerosol perturbations, while the cloud properties over sea ice adjust more slowly to increased levels of aerosols. However, the MPC over sea ice remains perturbed throughout the simulated period (20 h), while the liquid water path of the stratocumulus cloud over the open ocean relaxes back to its unperturbed state. Precipitation and ice formation effectively buffer any cloud-aerosol interactions on timescales beyond half a day and the stratocumulus cloud re-organizes into its original structure. Generally, stratocumulus dynamics in the mixed-phase regime remain relatively unexplored. To investigate cloud morphology changes and regime transitions at high latitudes, simulations of stratocumulus clouds independent of external drivers have been performed. We show that similar to liquid clouds at low latitudes, mixed-phase stratocumulus tend to organize into cellular patterns. The spatial scales of these patterns increase through precipitation enhancement, which can be induced through a reduction in available CCN or an increase in the cloud ice phase. A high (> 50 %) ice to liquid water content ratio as expected for example from increased background INP concentrations, can cause locally intense rain events, which induce subcloud evaporative cooling, cold pool formation and lateral cloud cell growth. This change in spatial organization has implications for the radiative balance at the Earth's surface. Arctic stratocumulus are also substantially impacted by processes acting on the large-scale, such as air mass advection. The advection of warm and moist air masses into the Arctic is a common phenomenon which alters the properties of the whole lower troposphere. In the final chapter, the impact of warm and moist air masses intruding the Arctic at different heights is explored. Boundary layer advection lifts and weakens the temperature inversion, induces a rise of the cloud layer, and leads to a stratocumulus-cumulus transition. The decreased cloud fraction substantially cools the Earth's surface in the absence of incoming shortwave radiation. On the contrary, air mass advection above the inversion layer lowers and reinforces the temperature inversion and cloud cover remains at 100 %. Employing a cloud-resolving modeling approach, this work identifies drivers of Arctic mixed-phase stratocumulus microphysical properties and demonstrates the interplay of cloud microphysics and dynamics. Mixed-phase stratocumulus organization represents one example of precipitation enhancement through aerosol-cloud interactions at the microscale, which drive cloud morphology changes on the mesoscale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000404229",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/404229","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Boundary layer clouds||Arctic clouds||Boundary layer dynamics||Modeling||STRATOCUMULUS (METEOROLOGY)||Aerosols and Clouds","Arctic mixed-phase clouds from the micro- to the mesoscale: insights from high-resolution modeling","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2020-03-10T16:16:11Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"26516",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However little is known about the decadal variation in the frequency of blocks and the activity of storm tracks and their relation to the two most important low-frequency oceanic modes of variability, the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). To address this question, first the representation of blocks, storm tracks and Alpine circulation types is assessed in recently released centennial reanalyses during the 20th century.  While interannual variability is represented similarly in all centennial reanalyses, the trends in particular for storm track activity before 1950 differ substantially between the NOAA 20th century reanalyses (20CR and 20CRv2c) and ECMWF centennial reanalyses (ERA-20C and CERA-20C). Therefore, the analysis of the connection between the AMO and PDO and the mid-latitudinal circulation is restricted to the period 1950–2010. All centennial reanalyses agree on the anomaly patterns associated with the different AMO/PDO phases. We find no significant connections except a southward (northward) shift of the storm track over the North Pacific as well as the North Atlantic during the positive (negative) PDO phase. The ERA-20CM atmosphere-only model ensemble captures this relationship, indicating that the ocean forces the atmosphere in the North Pacific. For studies investigating periods earlier than 1950, we recommend using several reanalysis products to ensure the robustness of results.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000336642",,"0280-6495||1600-0870",,"10.1080/16000870.2019.1586236","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/336642","en","International Meteorological Institute in Stockholm","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","centennial reanalyses||blocks||cyclones||AMO||PDO||circulation types||decadal variability","Decadal variations of blocking and storm tracks in centennial reanalyses","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-04-07T11:32:13Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85063667013",,"000462818600001","Tellus, Ser.

These circulation anomalies disrupt or block the prevailing westerly flow and the eastward progression of synoptic eddies, often causing anomalous, sometimes extreme weather. In spite of the importance of atmospheric blocking for weather and climate, the blocking mechanism is not yet fully understood, and accurately simulating the formation and duration of blocks is a challenge for numerical weather forecasting and climate models. Theories about blocking are based on dry dynamics, describing the dry-adiabatic interactions between transient baroclinic waves and the large-scale diffluent flow, during which air masses with low potential vorticity (PV) are advected poleward, setting up an intense anticyclonic PV anomaly. While moist diabatic processes, and in particular latent heating (LH) due to cloud formation in ascending airstreams, are known to play a significant role in modifying the upper-level large-scale flow, they have been far less considered in theories about blocking. The aim of this thesis is to better understand the role of LH in atmospheric blocking dynamics. This goal is addressed with three different approaches: (i) climatological investigations of diabatic contributions to atmospheric blocking using reanalysis, (ii) detailed model-based sensitivity experiments to study the causal relationship and sensitivity of blocking to changes in LH, and (iii) evaluation of climate simulations and the assessment of projected future changes. To this end, trajectory-based diagnostics along with a combination of statistical analyses are applied to different data sets (reanalysis, weather and climate model output), making extensive use of the PV perspective.  The first part of the thesis describes a comprehensive global climatology of blocking and LH along kinematic 7-day backward trajectories from the upper-level low-PV regions, using the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset between 1979 and 2016. The feature-based climatological analysis, based on 4270 blocking events and ~30 million trajectories, reveals that the flow associated with blocking is actually never perfectly adiabatic. Between 31 - 46% of all blocking air masses have been heated by more than 2K, with a median heating of 8.5K, during the final 3 days before entering the blocking anticyclone, and this number increases to 58 - 67% (12.5K in the median) when considering a 7-day period. The other blocking air masses, which enter the block with the upper-level jet stream, have been mostly cooled by a median -4K in 3 days. While the importance of LH varies considerably between individual blocking events and different regions, in particular between ocean and continents, LH is generally most important during blocking onset and (re-)intensification and in more intense and larger blocks. LH is often connected to upstream baroclinic developments in the mid-latitude storm tracks and provides the required flow amplification in addition to dry-dynamical interaction between synoptic eddies and blocking, thereby contributing to both the high- (fast onset and fluctuation in intensity and size) and low-frequency (maintenance and quasi-stationarity during maturation phase) properties of blocking anticyclones. This amplification of the upper-level circulation by LH is due to a combination of two effects: the direct injection of air masses with low PV into the upper troposphere in strongly ascending `warm conveyor belt' (WCB) airstreams, and the indirect effect owing to the interaction of the associated divergent outflow with the upper-level PV structure. Both effects act to slow down eastward propagation and amplify the intensity of the block.  The second part of the thesis explicitly explores the causal effect of LH on the development of five different blocking cases. Numerical sensitivity experiments are performed with the global weather prediction model IFS in which LH is artificially altered in clouds upstream of the blocks. The elimination of LH has substantial effects on the vertical motion and upper-tropospheric circulation in all case studies, but there is also significant case-to-case variability: some blocking systems do not develop at all without upstream LH, while for others the amplitude of the blocking anticyclone is merely reduced. This sensitivity is related to the state of the background flow. The presence of a large-scale diffluent flow supports the meridional amplification of synoptic-scale Rossby waves also in the absence of LH. These sensitivity experiments demonstrate the complex two-way interaction between moist diabatic and dry baroclinic processes, and the vital role of LH in the formation and maintenance of blocking.  The last part of the thesis presents a systematic and quantitative investigation of the influence of LH on blocking in a warmer and moister climate as projected for the end of the 21th century in CESM-LE large ensemble climate simulations.  Blocking and diabatic processes are reasonably well represented in the present-day reference simulations (1990-2000), although blocking frequencies are underestimated over both the Pacific and Euro-Atlantic sectors when compared to ERA-Interim. In future climate (2091-2100) under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario, the responses of blocking to global warming are projected to be weak with a complex regional and seasonal variation. There is substantial uncertainty in many regions concerning the sign of the change. This is related to the fact that changes in blocking frequencies are influenced by the combined effect of future changes in the jet stream, cyclone activity and diabatic heating. Nevertheless, a robust conclusion is that the increase in temperature and hence moisture in the atmosphere leads to an increase in the importance of LH. This can mainly be attributed to a 50% increase in WCB airmasses with strong diabatic heating, which can initiate Rossby wave amplification and breaking along a stronger future jet stream. However, it is still unclear how enhanced LH will affect blocking intensity and duration.  In conclusion, moist diabatic processes, in particular the release of latent heat in ascending airstreams, are of first-order importance for the formation of prolonged circulation anomalies related to atmospheric blocking. Such moist diabatic processes thus have to be taken into account to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of blocking dynamics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000380041",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/380041","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Atmospheric dynamics||Atmospheric blocking||Diabatic processes||Latent heating/cooling||Extratropical cyclones||Meteorology||Climatology||Climate Change||Climate variability||Numerical modeling||Weather prediction model||Climate modeling||Potential vorticity||Warm conveyor belts||Jet stream||Extreme weather events||Rossby waves||Rossby wave breaking||Moisture||Cloud microphysics","The role of latent heating in atmospheric blocking: climatology and numerical experiments","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2019-11-24T21:13:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"26021",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we use sensitivity experiments to assess the potential of keeping soil moisture conditions at historical levels in the 21st century by “recycling” local water sources (runoff and a reservoir). To this end, we develop a “land water recycling” (LWR) scheme which applies locally available water to the soil if soil moisture drops below a predefined threshold (a historical climatology), and we assess its influence on the hydrology and extreme temperature indices. We run ensemble simulations with the Community Earth System Model for the 21st century and show that our LWR scheme is able to drastically reduce the land area with decreasing soil moisture. Precipitation responds to LWR with increases in mid-latitudes, but decreases in monsoon regions. While effects on global temperature are minimal, there are very substantial regional impacts on climate. Higher evapotranspiration and cloud cover in the simulations both contribute to a decrease in hot temperature extremes. These decreases reach up to about −1 ∘C regionally, and are of similar magnitude to the regional climate changes induced by a 0.5∘C difference in the global mean temperature, e.g. between 1.5 and 2∘C global warming.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000334534",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-10-157-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/334534","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Potential of global land water recycling to mitigate local temperature extremes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-03-29T04:04:47Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85063186514",,"000461622200001",,"1","Earth System Dynamics","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Today, the global long-term annual mean energy fluxes of the global energy balance are reasonably well known. In this thesis, we go beyond the long-term annual mean perspective and focus on temporal variations in the energy balance. Specifically, we study annual cycles and multidecadal changes of the shortwave fluxes of the energy balance in an observation-based framework. To this end, we combine observations of top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes and surface albedo, both obtained from satellites, with surface flux observations. The latter are available from in-situ or satellite observations. In-situ observations are the most robust and accurate way to determine surface solar radiation but their spatial availability is limited. Satellite-derived surface radiation is less accurate but has greater spatial coverage. In this thesis, we use both data sources depending on whether accuracy or spatial coverage is needed.  Using in-situ data – which from a spatial perspective is point data – in combination with other gridded data products requires a thorough assessment of potential methodological uncertainties which arise when combining those two data sets. In Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 of this thesis, different aspects of spatiotemporal representativeness of monthly mean records of surface solar radiation point observations are assessed globally. Although large regional differences in the representativeness of point measurements occur, in most regions they can be considered representative of a larger surrounding. Therefore, examining temporal variations in the shortwave energy fluxes by combining in-situ and colocated gridded flux data is feasible. However, additional uncertainties must be taken into account.  Due to the Earth’s celestial movement around the Sun, large seasonal cycles in the amount and geographic distribution of solar insolation occur. These variations play a key role in the distribution of energy in the climate system and ultimately drive the seasonality of Earth’s general circulation systems, climate, and weather. Nevertheless, as recently shown by Hakuba et al. (2014b), the fraction of the incoming shortwave radiation at the top-of-the-atmosphere which is absorbed within the atmosphere does not substantially vary with season or latitude in Europe. An astonishing result, when considering that various climate elements which potentially influence the shortwave radiative fluxes have notable annual cycles. In Chapter 4 we go beyond Europe and identify several regions with large annual cycles in fractional atmospheric absorption. We find that they are driven mainly by annual cycles of water vapor and different aerosol species. The largest annual cycles in fractional atmospheric absorption are apparent in regions with large annual cycles in aerosol loading related to seasonal biomass burning, which is a strong indication that these annual cycles are anthropogenically intensified or even entirely forced. We also show that the skill of global climate models to simulate the observed patterns in the annual cycles of atmospheric shortwave absorption is limited. It is well known from observations that significant widespread variations in the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface occurred on decadal time scales, known as global dimming and global brightening. According to the principle of energy conservation – the foundation of the energy balance – such changes in surface solar radiation must go along with a change in surface absorption, the TOA net flux, or the atmospheric absorption. In the observation-based energy balance framework, we find that changing atmospheric shortwave absorption is a major cause for the observed trends in Europe and China. The simultaneous trend analysis for surface, atmospheric, and TOA fluxes suggests that changes in aerosols – and in particular absorbing ones – are responsible for the observed trends.  Taken together, this thesis demonstrates that an integrative approach to the shortwave energy balance, in which TOA, atmospheric and surface fluxes are simultaneously analyzed, can lead to valuable insights into key aspects of the climate system.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000353615",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/353615","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","climate||RADIATION (METEOROLOGY)||Energy balance||Shortwave radiation||Temporal variations||Representativity analysis||Surface observations||Satellite observations||Dimming and brightening||Atmospheric absorption||atmosphere","Towards an Improved Understanding of the Global Energy Balance: Temporal Variations of Solar Radiation in the Climate System","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::520 - Astronomy, cartography||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2019-07-17T12:27:43Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: temporal variation of solar radiation in the climate system","159938","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT","25942",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The atmospheric water cycle, in turn, exerts an influence on upwelling intensity via buoyancy forcing induced by fresh- water fluxes. Stable water isotopes (H216O, H218O, HDO) are a powerful tool to constrain processes of the atmospheric water cycle and can therefore help to gain a more comprehensive picture on the Southern Ocean region. In order to fully ex- ploit this potential, simulations with the isotope-enabled, regional numerical model COSMOiso are combined with isotope and meteorological measurements of high temporal resolution, conducted during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) in austral summer 2016/2017. For the first time, the COSMOiso model per- formance with respect to meteorology and stable water isotopes is assessed in the Southern Hemisphere, along Leg 1 and Leg 2 of ACE. The validation confirms a re- liable representation of meteorology and isotope processes over the open ocean, but reveals model shortcomings with respect to isotopic variability in proximity to the Antarctic continent. Non-fractionating snow-atmosphere interactions are identified as a main factor limiting the model performance. Consequently, the implementa- tion of equilibrium fractionation during surface snow sublimation and deposition improves the skill of COSMOiso significantly (correlation increases from 0.1 to 0.7 for d-variables). This points out the potential of further model development in order to reproduce the entire spectrum of processes a↵ecting stable water isotopic variabil- ity in polar regions with COSMOiso. Furthermore, a newly developed Lagrangian budget model for isotopes and humidity is presented. The model framework incorpo- rates the processes of horizontal advection, ocean evaporation and marine boundary layer mixing. In a first, exploratory case study, the air parcel-based box model is used to study the isotopic signal along trajectories associated with a marine cold air outbreak. By comparing the box model simulations to COSMOiso, entrainment of depleted, free-tropospheric air is identified as an important factor, besides ocean evaporation, influencing the observed isotopic variability during the event. Down- ward mixing of air masses from the lower troposphere e ciently replaces the origi- nal Antarctic moisture along the transport pathway. The box model framework is a promising starting point for future e↵orts to further constrain the marine boundary layer moisture budget.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438068",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438068","en","ETH Zurich, Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science (IAC)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Marine boundary layer stable water isotope variability in the Southern Ocean","Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2020-09-02T15:47:07Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The planet’s continuously rising temperature, which is shown by these observations, is predominantly driven by persistent human greenhouse gas emissions. The global warming trend is expected to continue throughout the 21st century as long as greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere. Increased global temperatures threaten humans, life, and ecosystems on the planet by potentially triggering illnesses such as heat strokes, food insecurity, biodiversity loss, and natural hazards. In regions where precipitation is decreasing together with increasing temperature, temperature-related hazards are amplified and additional hazards connected to water scarcity arise. Model simulations of the future climate show substantial regional variations in both temperature and precipitation changes. It is critical to gain further confidence in such projected spatial climate change patterns, especially for vulnerable regions, where there is a risk of amplified warming or strong changes in precipitation. To gain further confidence, there is a need to understand which changes in the climate system cause these spatial patterns. Scientific confidence in the projected patterns is essential for developing effective regional strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The goal of this thesis is to determine the causes of spatial patterns of future temperature and precipitation changes in climate simulations. The focus is on prominent patterns of climate change in Europe, namely on the projected amplified summer warming pattern in the Mediterranean and the projected year-round precipitation decline in the same region. We find that the amplified Mediterranean summer warming is predominantly caused by spatially different lapse-rate changes. Lapse-rate changes are substantial throughout the continent but weakest in the Mediterranean. The influence of Hadley circulation changes on the European summer climate is found to be negligible. The Mediterranean summer precipitation decline can largely be explained by thermodynamic changes including warming contrasts between land and ocean, lapse-rate changes, and changes in atmospheric humidity. Circulation changes further contribute to the summer precipitation decline but are of secondary importance. The situation in winter is different, where circulation changes and connected changes in the atmospheric state are the main cause for the precipitation decline in the Mediterranean. Our results also indicate that lapse-rate changes are not exclusively important for the pattern of summer land temperature changes in Europe but also in many other mid-latitude and tropical regions on the northern and southern hemispheres during summer. The connection of lapse-rate changes to amplified summer warming patterns increases the confidence in the regional projections since lapse-rate changes are a consequence of the well-understood higher moisture-holding capacity of warmer air. The confidence in the Mediterranean precipitation decline should be considered larger in summer than in winter since the influence of uncertain circulation changes is smaller in summer compared to winter.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000402963",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/402963","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Climate||Climate Change||Europe||Atmospheric dynamics||Hotspots||Drivers of change","Disentangling Drivers and Patterns of European Climate Change","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2020-03-04T10:11:32Z","2021-03-04",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"26388",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Their predicted increase in recurrence and intensity poses serious threats to future food security. Still today, the knowledge of how droughts and heatwaves start and evolve remains limited, and so does our understanding of how climate change may affect them. Droughts and heatwaves have been suggested to intensify and propagate via land–atmosphere feedbacks. However, a global capacity to observe these processes is still lacking, and climate and forecast models are immature when it comes to representing the influences of land on temperature and rainfall. Key open questions remain in our goal to uncover the real importance of these feedbacks: What is the impact of the extreme meteorological conditions on ecosystem evaporation? How do these anomalies regulate the atmospheric boundary layer state (event self‐intensification) and contribute to the inflow of heat and moisture to other regions (event self‐propagation)? Can this knowledge on the role of land feedbacks, when available, be exploited to develop geo‐engineering mitigation strategies that prevent these events from aggravating during their early stages? The goal of our perspective is not to present a convincing answer to these questions, but to assess the scientific progress to date, while highlighting new and innovative avenues to keep advancing our understanding in the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000323487",,"0077-8923","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/323487||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/396467","10.1111/nyas.13912","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/396608","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","drought||heatwave||land feedback||land–atmospheric interactions","Land-atmospheric feedbacks during droughts and heatwaves: state of the science and current challenges","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-07T04:28:38Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060813428",,"000457543300002",,"1","Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","1436","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To qualify the role of individual lake characteristics in their response to regionally homogeneous warming, we simulated temperature, ice cover, and mixing in four intensively studied German lakes of varying morphology and mixing regime with a one-dimensional lake model. We forced the model with an ensemble of 12 climate projections (RCP4.5) up to 2100. The lakes were projected to warm at 0.10–0.11 ∘C decade−1, which is 75 %–90 % of the projected air temperature trend. In simulations, surface temperatures increased strongly in winter and spring, but little or not at all in summer and autumn. Mean bottom temperatures were projected to increase in all lakes, with steeper trends in winter and in shallower lakes. Modelled ice thaw and summer stratification advanced by 1.5–2.2 and 1.4–1.8 days decade−1 respectively, whereas autumn turnover and winter freeze timing was less sensitive. The projected summer mixed-layer depth was unaffected by warming but sensitive to changes in water transparency. By mid-century, the frequency of ice and stratification-free winters was projected to increase by about 20 %, making ice cover rare and shifting the two deeper dimictic lakes to a predominantly monomictic regime. The polymictic lake was unlikely to become dimictic by the end of the century. A sensitivity analysis predicted that decreasing transparency would dampen the effect of warming on mean temperature but amplify its effect on stratification. However, this interaction was only predicted to occur in clear lakes, and not in the study lakes at their historical transparency. Not only lake morphology, but also mixing regime determines how heat is stored and ultimately how lakes respond to climate warming. Seasonal differences in climate warming rates are thus important and require more attention.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000334578",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-23-1533-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/334578","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Future projections of temperature and mixing regime of European temperate lakes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-03-29T04:21:05Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85063045910",,"000461585100001","Hydrol.

The data include 92 h of simultaneous measurements of supercooled liquid cloud droplet and ice particle size distributions (PSDs). Average cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC), droplet size (NMD), and liquid water content (LWC) were similar in both years, while ice particle concentration (Ni) and ice water content (IWC) were higher during IFRACS. The consistency of the liquid cloud suggests that SPL is essentially a cloud chamber that produces a consistent cloud under moist, westerly flow during the winter. A variable cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)-related inverse relationship between CDNC and NMD strengthened when the data were stratified by LWC. Some of this variation is due to changes in cloud base height below SPL. While there was a weak inverse correlation between LWC and IWC in the data as a whole, a stronger relationship was demonstrated for a case study on 9 February 2014 during IFRACS. A minimum LWC of 0.05 g m−3 showed that the cloud was not completely glaciated on this day. Erosion of the droplet distribution at high IWC was attributed to the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process as the high IWC was accompanied by a 10-fold increase in Ni. A relationship between large cloud droplet concentration (25–35 µm) and small ice particles (75–200 µm) under cold (<−8 ∘C) but not warm (>−8 ∘C) conditions during IFRACS suggests primary ice particle production by contact or immersion freezing. The effect of blowing snow was evaluated from the relationship between wind speed and Ni and by comparing the relative (percent) ice particle PSDs at high and low wind speeds. These were similar, contrary to expectation for blowing snow. However, the correlation between wind speed and ice crystal concentration may support this explanation for high crystal concentrations at the surface. Secondary processes could have contributed to high crystal concentrations but there was no direct evidence to support this. Further experimental work is needed to resolve these issues.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000341184",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-5387-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/341184","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Mixed-phase orographic cloud microphysics during StormVEx and IFRACS","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-05-08T10:53:55Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064975521",,"000465632500001","Atmos. chem. phys.","8","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We used the SOCOL-AER global aerosol–chemistry–climate model to investigate 21 different SSG scenarios, each with 1.83 Mt S yr−1 injected either in the form of accumulation-mode H2SO4 droplets (AM H2SO4), gas-phase SO2 or as combinations of both. For most scenarios, the sulfur was continuously emitted at an altitude of 50 hPa (≈20 km) in the tropics and subtropics. We assumed emissions to be zonally and latitudinally symmetric around the Equator. The spread of emissions ranged from 3.75∘ S–3.75∘ N to 30∘ S–30∘ N. In the SO2 emission scenarios, continuous production of tiny nucleation-mode particles results in increased coagulation, which together with gaseous H2SO4 condensation, produces coarse-mode particles. These large particles are less effective for backscattering solar radiation and have a shorter stratospheric residence time than AM H2SO4 particles. On average, the stratospheric aerosol burden and corresponding all-sky shortwave radiative forcing for the AM H2SO4 scenarios are about 37 % larger than for the SO2 scenarios. The simulated stratospheric aerosol burdens show a weak dependence on the latitudinal spread of emissions. Emitting at 30∘ N–30∘ S instead of 10∘ N–10∘ S only decreases stratospheric burdens by about 10 %. This is because a decrease in coagulation and the resulting smaller particle size is roughly balanced by faster removal through stratosphere-to-troposphere transport via tropopause folds. Increasing the injection altitude is also ineffective, although it generates a larger stratospheric burden, because enhanced condensation and/or coagulation leads to larger particles, which are less effective scatterers. In the case of gaseous SO2 emissions, limiting the sulfur injections spatially and temporally in the form of point and pulsed emissions reduces the total global annual nucleation, leading to less coagulation and thus smaller particles with increased stratospheric residence times. Pulse or point emissions of AM H2SO4 have the opposite effect: they decrease the stratospheric aerosol burden by increasing coagulation and only slightly decrease clear-sky radiative forcing. This study shows that direct emission of AM H2SO4 results in higher radiative forcing for the same sulfur equivalent mass injection strength than SO2 emissions, and that the sensitivity to different injection strategies varies for different forms of injected sulfur.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000338834",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-4877-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338834","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Exploring accumulation-mode H2SO4 versus SO2 stratospheric sulfate geoengineering in a sectional aerosol-chemistry-climate model","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-04-20T04:15:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064227012",,"000464163000003","Atmos. chem. phys.","7","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Aerosol results from nudged and free-running simulations for the 10-year period 2003 to 2012 are compared to various measurements of aerosol properties. While there are regional deviations between the model and observations, the model performs well overall in terms of aerosol optical thickness, but may underestimate coarse-mode aerosol concentrations to some extent so that the modeled particles are smaller than indicated by the observations. Sulfate aerosol measurements in the US and Europe are reproduced well by the model, while carbonaceous aerosol species are biased low.

However, the strength of this acceleration varies considerably among individual models, which constitutes a notable source of uncertainty for future climate projections. To shed more light upon the magnitude of this uncertainty and on its causes, we analyse the stratospheric mean age of air (AoA) of 10 climate projection simulations from the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative phase 1 (CCMI-I), covering the period between 1960 and 2100. In agreement with previous multi-model studies, we find a large model spread in the magnitude of the AoA trend over the simulation period. Differences between future and past AoA are found to be predominantly due to differences in mixing (reduced aging by mixing and recirculation) rather than differences in residual mean transport. We furthermore analyse the mixing efficiency, a measure of the relative strength of mixing for given residual mean transport, which was previously hypothesised to be a model constant. Here, the mixing efficiency is found to vary not only across models, but also over time in all models. Changes in mixing efficiency are shown to be closely related to changes in AoA and quantified to roughly contribute 10 % to the long-term AoA decrease over the 21st century. Additionally, mixing efficiency variations are shown to considerably enhance model spread in AoA changes. To understand these mixing efficiency variations, we also present a consistent dynamical framework based on diffusive closure, which highlights the role of basic state potential vorticity gradients in controlling mixing efficiency and therefore aging by mixing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000322744",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-921-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322744","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The influence of mixing on the stratospheric age of air changes in the 21st century","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-02T04:15:32Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060522319",,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","2","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They exploit a combination of initial conditions and past meteorological observations, and can often provide useful forecasts of the expected streamflow in the upcoming month. In recent years, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models for subseasonal to seasonal timescales have made large progress and can provide added value to such a traditional ESP approach. Before using such meteorological predictions two major problems need to be solved: the correction of biases, and downscaling to increase the spatial resolution. Various methods exist to overcome these problems, but the potential of using NWP information and the relative merit of the different statistical and modelling steps remain open. To address this question, we compare a traditional ESP system with a subseasonal hydrometeorological ensemble prediction system in three alpine catchments with varying hydroclimatic conditions and areas between 80 and 1700 km2. Uncorrected and corrected (pre-processed) temperature and precipitation reforecasts from the ECMWF subseasonal NWP model are used to run the hydrological simulations and the performance of the resulting streamflow predictions is assessed with commonly used verification scores characterizing different aspects of the forecasts (ensemble mean and spread). Our results indicate that the NWP-based approach can provide superior prediction to the ESP approach, especially at shorter lead times. In snow-dominated catchments the pre-processing of the meteorological input further improves the performance of the predictions. This is most pronounced in late winter and spring when snow melting occurs. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of snow-related processes for subseasonal streamflow predictions in mountainous regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000322787",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-23-493-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322787","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Subseasonal hydrometeorological ensemble predictions in small- and medium-sized mountainous catchments: Benefits of the NWP approach","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-04T03:49:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060676841",,"000456994100001","Hydrol.

The mineralogy of desert dust differs depending on the source region and can further fractionate during the dust emission processes. Mineralogy to a large extent explains the ice nucleation behavior of desert aerosol, but not entirely. Apart from pure mineral dust, desert aerosol particles often exhibit a coating or are mixed with small amounts of biological material. Aging on the ground or during atmospheric transport can deactivate nucleation sites, thus strong ice nucleating minerals may not exhibit their full potential. In the partner paper of this work, it was shown that mineralogy determines most but not all of the ice nucleation behavior in the immersion mode found for desert dust. In this study, the influence of semi-volatile organic compounds and the presence of crystal water on the ice nucleation behavior of desert aerosol is investigated. This work focuses on the deposition and condensation ice nucleation modes at temperatures between 238 and 242 K of 18 dust samples sourced from nine deserts worldwide. Chemical imaging of the particles' surface is used to determine the cause of the observed differences in ice nucleation. It is found that, while the ice nucleation ability of the majority of the dust samples is dominated by their quartz and feldspar content, in one carbonaceous sample it is mostly caused by organic matter, potentially cellulose and/or proteins. In contrast, the ice nucleation ability of an airborne Saharan sample is found to be diminished, likely by semi-volatile species covering ice nucleation active sites of the minerals. This study shows that in addition to mineralogy, other factors such as organics and crystal water content can alter the ice nucleation behavior of desert aerosol during atmospheric transport in various ways.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000323484",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-1059-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/323484","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Heterogeneous ice nucleation on dust particles sourced from nine deserts worldwide - Part 2: Deposition nucleation and condensation freezing","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-07T04:27:52Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Laboratory studies on the ice nucleation properties of fresh  and aged mineral dust aerosols","150169","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,"85060796366",,"000456990800001","Atmos. chem. phys.","2","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They constantly exchange water molecules with the environment and, in sub-saturated air, they evaporate partially or entirely. The latter of these below-cloud processes is important for predicting the resulting surface rainfall amount. It also influences the boundary layer profiles of temperature and moisture through evaporative latent cooling and humidity changes. However, despite its importance, it is very difficult to quantify this process from observations. Stable water isotopes provide such information, as they are influenced by both rain evaporation and equilibration (i.e. the exchange of isotopes between raindrops and ambient air). This study elucidates this option by introducing a novel interpretative framework for stable water isotope measurements performed simultaneously at high temporal resolution in both near-surface vapour and rain. We refer to this viewing device as the ΔδΔd-diagram, which shows the isotopic composition (δ2H, d-excess) of equilibrium vapour from precipitation samples relative to the ambient vapour. It is shown that this diagram facilitates the diagnosis of below-cloud processes and their effects on the isotopic composition of vapour and rain since equilibration and evaporation lead to different pathways in the two-dimensional phase space of the ΔδΔd-diagram, as investigated with a series of sensitivity experiments with an idealized below-cloud interaction model. The analysis of isotope measurements for a specific cold front in central Europe shows that below-cloud processes lead to distinct and temporally variable imprints on the isotope signal in surface rain. The influence of evaporation on this signal is particularly strong during periods with a weak precipitation rate. After the frontal passage, the near-surface atmospheric layer is characterized by higher relative humidity, which leads to weaker below-cloud evaporation. Additionally, a lower melting layer after the frontal passage reduces time for exchange between vapour and rain and leads to weaker equilibration. Measurements from four cold frontal events reveal a surprisingly similar slope of ΔdΔδ=−0.30 in the phase space, indicating a potentially characteristic signature of below-cloud processes for this type of rain event.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000322296",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-747-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322296","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A new interpretative framework for below-cloud effects on stable water isotopes in vapour and rain","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-01T04:42:49Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060377046",,"000456317400001","Atmos. chem. phys.","2","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The event occurred during the Intensive Observation Period (IOP) 13 of the field campaign of the Hydrological Cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX) on 15 and 16 October 2012, and SI experienced intense rainfall of 62.4 mm over 27 h with two precipitation phases during this event. The first one (P1) was induced by convective precipitation ahead of a cold front, while the second one (P2) was mainly associated with precipitation induced by large-scale uplift. The moisture transport and processes responsible for the HPE are analysed using a simulation with the isotope-enabled regional numerical model COSMOiso. The simulation at a horizontal grid spacing of about 7 km over a large domain (about 4300 km ×3500 km) allows the isotopes signal to be distinguished due to local processes or large-scale advection. Backward trajectory analyses based on this simulation show that the air parcels arriving in SI during P1 originate from the North Atlantic and descend within an upper-level trough over the north-western Mediterranean. The descending air parcels reach elevations below 1 km over the sea and bring dry and isotopically depleted air (median δ18O ≤−25 ‰, water vapour mixing ratio q≤2 g kg−1) close to the surface, which induces strong surface evaporation. These air parcels are rapidly enriched in SWIs (δ18O ≥−14 ‰) and moistened (q≥8 g kg−1) over the Tyrrhenian Sea by taking up moisture from surface evaporation and potentially from evaporation of frontal precipitation. Thereafter, the SWI-enriched low-level air masses arriving upstream of SI are convectively pumped to higher altitudes, and the SWI-depleted moisture from higher levels is transported towards the surface within the downdrafts ahead of the cold front over SI, producing a large amount of convective precipitation in SI. Most of the moisture processes (i.e. evaporation, convective mixing) related to the HPE take place during the 18 h before P1 over SI. A period of 4 h later, during the second precipitation phase P2, the air parcels arriving over SI mainly originate from north Africa. The strong cyclonic flow around the eastward-moving upper-level trough induces the advection of a SWI-enriched African moisture plume towards SI and leads to large-scale uplift of the warm air mass along the cold front. This lifts moist and SWI-enriched air (median δ18O ≥−16 ‰, median q≥6 g kg−1) and leads to gradual rain out of the air parcels over Italy. Large-scale ascent in the warm sector ahead of the cold front takes place during the 72 h preceding P2 in SI. This work demonstrates how stable water isotopes can yield additional insights into the variety of thermodynamic mechanisms occurring at the mesoscale and synoptic scale during the formation of a HPE.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000347653",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-7487-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/347653","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Contrasting stable water isotope signals from convective and large-scale precipitation phases of a heavy precipitation event in southern Italy during HyMeX IOP 13: A modelling perspective","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-06-16T18:16:11Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85066869377",,"000470732300005","Atmos. chem. phys.","11","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Soot particles are of special interest since their properties can change significantly due to aging processes once they are emitted into the atmosphere. Probably the largest obstacle for the investigation of these processes in the laboratory is the long atmospheric lifetime of 1 week, requiring tailored experiments that cover this time span. This work presents results on the ability of two types of soot, obtained using a miniCAST soot generator, to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) after exposure to atmospherically relevant levels of ozone (O3) and humidity. Aging times of up to 12 h were achieved by successful application of the continuous-flow stirred tank reactor (CSTR) concept while allowing for size selection of particles prior to the aging step. Particles of 100 nm diameter and rich in organic carbon (OC) that were initially CCN inactive showed significant CCN activity at supersaturations (SS) down to 0.3 % after 10 h of exposure to 200 ppb of O3. While this process was not affected by different levels of relative humidity in the range of 5 %–75 %, a high sensitivity towards the ambient/reaction temperature was observed. Soot particles with a lower OC content required an approximately 4-fold longer aging duration to show CCN activity at the same SS. Prior to the slow change in the CCN activity, a rapid increase in the particle diameter was detected which occurred within several minutes. This study highlights the applicability of the CSTR approach for the simulation of atmospheric aging processes, as aging durations beyond 12 h can be achieved in comparably small aerosol chamber volumes (<3 m3). Implementation of our measurement results in a global aerosol-climate model, ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3, showed a statistically significant increase in the regional and global CCN burden and cloud droplet number concentration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000387470",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-15545-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387470","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Impact of isolated atmospheric aging processes on the cloud condensation nuclei activation of soot particles","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-04T03:33:08Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Soot Particle Ageing Cloud Effects - SPACE","161343","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,"85077125743",,"000503460000004","Atmos. chem. phys.","24","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The model successfully reproduces neutral temperature and total electron content (TEC) observations. Using both model and observational data, we identify a cooling in the tropical lower thermosphere caused by the SSW. This cooling affects the zonal electric field close to the equator, leading to an enhanced vertical plasma drift. We demonstrate that along with a SSW-related wind disturbance, which is the main source to form a dynamo electric field in the ionosphere, perturbations of the ionospheric conductivity also make a significant contribution to the formation of the electric field response to SSW. The post-sunset TEC enhancement and pre-sunrise electron content reduction are revealed as a response to the 2009 SSW. We show that at post-sunset hours the SSW affects low-latitude TEC via a disturbance of the meridional electric field. We also show that the phase change of the semidiurnal migrating solar tide (SW2) in the neutral wind caused by the 2009 SSW at the altitude of the dynamo electric field generation has a crucial importance for the SW2 phase change in the zonal electric field. Such changes lead to the appearance of anomalous diurnal variability of the equatorial electromagnetic plasma drift and subsequent low-latitudinal TEC disturbances in agreement with available observations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000384658",,,,"10.1051/swsc/2019037","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/384658","en","EDP Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","sudden stratospheric warming||thermospheric temperature||TEC||ionosphere||electric field||ionospheric conductivity||mesospheric tides","Identification of the mechanisms responsible for anomalies in the tropical lower thermosphere/ionosphere caused by the January 2009 sudden stratospheric warming","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-11T11:12:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000499709100001",,,"Journal of Space Weather and Space Climate","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It includes a sectional aerosol model that tracks the sulfate particle size distribution in 40 size bins, between 0.39 nm and 3.2 µm. Sheng et al. (2015) showed that SOCOL-AERv1 successfully matched observable quantities related to stratospheric aerosol. In the meantime, SOCOL-AER has undergone significant improvements and more observational datasets have become available. In producing SOCOL-AERv2 we have implemented several updates to the model: adding interactive deposition schemes, improving the sulfate mass and particle number conservation, and expanding the tropospheric chemistry scheme. We compare the two versions of the model with background stratospheric sulfate aerosol observations, stratospheric aerosol evolution after Pinatubo, and ground-based sulfur deposition networks. SOCOL-AERv2 shows similar levels of agreement as SOCOL-AERv1 with satellite-measured extinctions and in situ optical particle counter (OPC) balloon flights. The volcanically quiescent total stratospheric aerosol burden simulated in SOCOL-AERv2 has increased from 109 Gg of sulfur (S) to 160 Gg S, matching the newly available satellite estimate of 165 Gg S. However, SOCOL-AERv2 simulates too high cross-tropopause transport of tropospheric SO2 and/or sulfate aerosol, leading to an overestimation of lower stratospheric aerosol. Due to the current lack of upper tropospheric SO2 measurements and the neglect of organic aerosol in the model, the lower stratospheric bias of SOCOL-AERv2 was not further improved. Model performance under volcanically perturbed conditions has also undergone some changes, resulting in a slightly shorter volcanic aerosol lifetime after the Pinatubo eruption. With the improved deposition schemes of SOCOL-AERv2, simulated sulfur wet deposition fluxes are within a factor of 2 of measured deposition fluxes at 78 % of the measurement stations globally, an agreement which is on par with previous model intercomparison studies. Because of these improvements, SOCOL-AERv2 will be better suited to studying changes in atmospheric sulfur deposition due to variations in climate and emissions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000364139",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-12-3863-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/364139","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Improved tropospheric and stratospheric sulfur cycle in the aerosol-chemistry-climate model SOCOL-AERv2","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-09-16T02:45:27Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85072040521",,"000484164300001","Geosci. model dev.","9","Geoscientific Model Development","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A multi-model ensemble of 14 OH fields was analyzed and aggregated into 64 scenarios to force the offline atmospheric chemistry transport model LMDz (Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique) with a standard CH4 emission scenario over the period 2000–2016. The multi-model simulated global volume-weighted tropospheric mean OH concentration ([OH]) averaged over 2000–2010 ranges between 8.7×105 and 12.8×105 molec cm−3. The inter-model differences in tropospheric OH burden and vertical distributions are mainly determined by the differences in the nitrogen oxide (NO) distributions, while the spatial discrepancies between OH fields are mostly due to differences in natural emissions and volatile organic compound (VOC) chemistry. From 2000 to 2010, most simulated OH fields show an increase of 0.1–0.3×105 molec cm−3 in the tropospheric mean [OH], with year-to-year variations much smaller than during the historical period 1960–2000. Once ingested into the LMDz model, these OH changes translated into a 5 to 15 ppbv reduction in the CH4 mixing ratio in 2010, which represents 7 %–20 % of the model-simulated CH4 increase due to surface emissions. Between 2010 and 2016, the ensemble of simulations showed that OH changes could lead to a CH4 mixing ratio uncertainty of >±30 ppbv. Over the full 2000–2016 time period, using a common state-of-the-art but nonoptimized emission scenario, the impact of [OH] changes tested here can explain up to 54 % of the gap between model simulations and observations. This result emphasizes the importance of better representing OH abundance and variations in CH4 forward simulations and emission optimizations performed by atmospheric inversions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000384704",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-13701-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/384704","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"nter-model comparison of global hydroxyl radical (OH)distributions and their impact on atmospheric methaneover the 2000–2016 period","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-11T11:41:27Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We show here that neither BC nor soluble brC is the major light-absorbing carbon (LAC) species in HFO-combustion PM. Instead, “tar brC” dominates. This tar brC, previously identified only in open-biomass-burning emissions, shares key defining properties with BC: it is insoluble, refractory, and substantially absorbs visible and near-infrared light. Relative to BC, tar brC has a higher Angstrom absorption exponent (AAE) (2.5–6, depending on the considered wavelengths), a moderately-high mass absorption efficiency (up to 50% of that of BC), and a lower ratio of sp2- to sp3-bonded carbon. Based on our results, we present a refined classification of atmospheric LAC into two sub-types of BC and two sub-types of brC. We apply this refined classification to demonstrate that common analytical techniques for BC must be interpreted with care when applied to tar-containing aerosols. The global significance of our results is indicated by field observations which suggest that tar brC already contributes to Arctic snow darkening, an effect which may be magnified over upcoming decades as Arctic shipping continues to intensify.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000390543",,"2397-3722",,"10.1038/s41612-019-0069-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/390543","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Infrared-absorbing carbonaceous tar can dominate light absorption by marine-engine exhaust","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-15T03:24:24Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85074289730",,"000468010000001","npj Clim Atmos Sci",,"npj Climate and Atmospheric Science","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Nevertheless, recent work has suggested that ozone in the lower stratosphere (< 24 km) continued to decline over the 1998–2016 period, offsetting recovery at higher altitudes and preventing a statistically significant increase in quasi-global (60∘ S–60∘ N) total column ozone. In 2017, a large lower stratospheric ozone resurgence over less than 12 months was estimated (using a chemistry transport model; CTM) to have offset the long-term decline in the quasi-global integrated lower stratospheric ozone column. Here, we extend the analysis of space-based ozone observations to December 2018 using the BASICSG ozone composite. We find that the observed 2017 resurgence was only around half that modelled by the CTM, was of comparable magnitude to other strong interannual changes in the past, and was restricted to Southern Hemisphere (SH) midlatitudes (60–30∘ S). In the SH midlatitude lower stratosphere, the data suggest that by the end of 2018 ozone is still likely lower than in 1998 (probability ∼80 %). In contrast, tropical and Northern Hemisphere (NH) ozone continue to display ongoing decreases, exceeding 90 % probability. Robust tropical (>95 %, 30∘ S–30∘ N) decreases dominate the quasi-global integrated decrease (99 % probability); the integrated tropical stratospheric column (1–100 hPa, 30∘ S–30∘ N) displays a significant overall ozone decrease, with 95 % probability. These decreases do not reveal an inefficacy of the Montreal Protocol; rather, they suggest that other effects are at work, mainly dynamical variability on long or short timescales, counteracting the positive effects of the Montreal Protocol on stratospheric ozone recovery. We demonstrate that large interannual midlatitude (30–60∘) variations, such as the 2017 resurgence, are driven by non-linear quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) phase-dependent seasonal variability. However, this variability is not represented in current regression analyses. To understand if observed lower stratospheric ozone decreases are a transient or long-term phenomenon, progress needs to be made in accounting for this dynamically driven variability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000372060",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-12731-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/372060","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Stratospheric ozone trends for 1985-2018: Sensitivity to recent large variability","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-22T02:46:52Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85073381208",,"000489878000001","Atmos. chem. phys.","19","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Since clouds remain one of the largest uncertainties in climate projections, we simulated only the clear-sky UVI. We compared the modelled UVI climatologies against present-day climatological values of UVI derived from both satellite data (the OMI-Aura OMUVBd product) and ground-based measurements (from the NDACC network). Depending on the region, relative differences between the UVI obtained from CCMI/TUV calculations and the ground-based measurements ranged between −5.9 % and 10.6 %.  We then calculated the UVI evolution throughout the 21st century for the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5). Compared to 1960s values, we found an average increase in the UVI in 2100 (of 2 %–4 %) in the tropical belt (30∘ N–30∘ S). For the mid-latitudes, we observed a 1.8 % to 3.4 % increase in the Southern Hemisphere for RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 6.0 and found a 2.3 % decrease in RCP 8.5. Higher increases in UVI are projected in the Northern Hemisphere except for RCP 8.5. At high latitudes, ozone recovery is well identified and induces a complete return of mean UVI levels to 1960 values for RCP 8.5 in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, UVI levels in 2100 are higher by 0.5 % to 5.5 % for RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 6.0 and they are lower by 7.9 % for RCP 8.5.  We analysed the impacts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) on UVI from 1960 by comparing CCMI sensitivity simulations (1960–2100) with fixed GHGs or ODSs at their respective 1960 levels. As expected with ODS fixed at their 1960 levels, there is no large decrease in ozone levels and consequently no sudden increase in UVI levels. With fixed GHG, we observed a delayed return of ozone to 1960 values, with a corresponding pattern of change observed on UVI, and looking at the UVI difference between 2090s values and 1960s values, we found an 8 % increase in the tropical belt during the summer of each hemisphere.  Finally we show that, while in the Southern Hemisphere the UVI is mainly driven by total ozone column, in the Northern Hemisphere both total ozone column and aerosol optical depth drive UVI levels, with aerosol optical depth having twice as much influence on the UVI as total ozone column does.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000359796",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-10087-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/359796","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Clear-sky ultraviolet radiation modelling using output from the Chemistry Climate Model Initiative","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-22T02:51:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85070641398",,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","15","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In E63H23, the amount of low clouds, the liquid and ice water path, and cloud radiative effects are more realistic than in previous model versions. E63H23 has a more physically based aerosol activation scheme, improvements in the cloud cover scheme, changes in the detrainment of convective clouds, changes in the sticking efficiency for the accretion of ice crystals by snow, consistent ice crystal shapes throughout the model, and changes in mixed-phase freezing; an inconsistency in ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) in cirrus clouds was also removed. Common biases in ECHAM and in E63H23 (and in previous ECHAM–HAM versions) are a cloud amount in stratocumulus regions that is too low and deep convective clouds over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that form too close to the continents (while tropical land precipitation is underestimated). There are indications that ICNCs are overestimated in E63H23.  Since clouds are important for effective radiative forcing due to aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFari+aci) and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), differences in ERFari+aci and ECS between the model versions were also analyzed. ERFari+aci is weaker in E63H23 (−1.0 W m−2) than in E61H22 (−1.2 W m−2) (or E55H20; −1.1 W m−2). This is caused by the weaker shortwave ERFari+aci (a new aerosol activation scheme and sea salt emission parameterization in E63H23, more realistic simulation of cloud water) overcompensating for the weaker longwave ERFari+aci (removal of an inconsistency in ICNC in cirrus clouds in E61H22).  The decrease in ECS in E63H23 (2.5 K) compared to E61H22 (2.8 K) is due to changes in the entrainment rate for shallow convection (affecting the cloud amount feedback) and a stronger cloud phase feedback.  Experiments with minimum cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCmin) of 40 cm−3 or 10 cm−3 show that a higher value of CDNCmin reduces ERFari+aci as well as ECS in E63H23.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000361964",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-12-3609-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/361964","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The global aerosol-climate model ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3-Part 2: Cloud evaluation, aerosol radiative forcing, and climate sensitivity","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-09-03T02:30:26Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"A new parameterization scheme for ice and snow in climate models","160177","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,"85071235195",,"000482004500001","Geosci. model dev.","8","Geoscientific Model Development","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Most strategies to address this warming have called for a reduction of emissions and, often, accompanying removal of greenhouse gases. Other proposals suggest masking the increased radiative forcing by an increase in particles and/or clouds to increase scattering of incoming solar radiation. Two related recent proposals have suggested addition of calcite particles to the stratosphere, which one model suggests may enhance ozone. Here we show that the interaction of calcite with acidic materials in the stratosphere results in a more complex aerosol than has been previously considered, including aqueous and hydrate phases that can lead to ozone loss. Our study suggests particle addition to the stratosphere could also perturb global radiative balance by affecting high altitude cloud formation and properties. Experimental and modeling results suggest particles will act as the nucleation sites for polar stratospheric cloud ice and, after sedimentation into the troposphere, impact cirrus clouds in the absence of other efficient ice nucleating particles. These results show that an overly simplistic set of assumptions regarding intentional particle emissions to the atmosphere can lead to incorrect estimates of the radiative effect and fail to identify unintended consequences.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000387036",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-019-53595-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387036","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Unanticipated Side Effects of Stratospheric Albedo Modification Proposals Due to Aerosol Composition and Phase","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-21T03:25:03Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Climate Engineering by Arctic Winter Cirrus Thinning: Risks and Feasibility (AWiCiT)","166726","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85076371338",,"000502591000001","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We examine simulations over the period 1980–2009 from seven models in which the meteorological fields are nudged towards a reanalysis dataset and compare these with their equivalent free-running simulations and the reanalyses themselves. We show that for the current implementations, nudging meteorology does not constrain the mean strength of the stratospheric residual circulation and that the inter-model spread is similar, or even larger, than in the free-running simulations. The nudged models generally show slightly stronger upwelling in the tropical lower stratosphere compared to the free-running versions and exhibit marked differences compared to the directly estimated residual circulation from the reanalysis dataset they are nudged towards. Downward control calculations applied to the nudged simulations reveal substantial differences between the climatological lower-stratospheric tropical upward mass flux (TUMF) computed from the modelled wave forcing and that calculated directly from the residual circulation. This explicitly shows that nudging decouples the wave forcing and the residual circulation so that the divergence of the angular momentum flux due to the mean motion is not balanced by eddy motions, as would typically be expected in the time mean. Overall, nudging meteorological fields leads to increased inter-model spread for most of the measures of the mean climatological stratospheric residual circulation assessed in this study. In contrast, the nudged simulations show a high degree of consistency in the inter-annual variability in the TUMF in the lower stratosphere, which is primarily related to the contribution to variability from the resolved wave forcing. The more consistent inter-annual variability in TUMF in the nudged models also compares more closely with the variability found in the reanalyses, particularly in boreal winter. We apply a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to separate the drivers of inter-annual and long-term variations in the simulated TUMF; this explains up to ∼75 % of the variance in TUMF in the nudged simulations. The MLR model reveals a statistically significant positive trend in TUMF for most models over the period 1980–2009. The TUMF trend magnitude is generally larger in the nudged models compared to their free-running counterparts, but the intermodel range of trends doubles from around a factor of 2 to a factor of 4 due to nudging. Furthermore, the nudged models generally do not match the TUMF trends in the reanalysis they are nudged towards for trends over different periods in the interval 1980–2009. Hence, we conclude that nudging does not strongly constrain long-term trends simulated by the chemistry–climate model (CCM) in the residual circulation. Our findings show that while nudged simulations may, by construction, produce accurate temperatures and realistic representations of fast horizontal transport, this is not typically the case for the slower zonal mean vertical transport in the stratosphere. Consequently, caution is required when using nudged simulations to interpret the behaviour of stratospheric tracers that are affected by the residual circulation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000366527",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-11559-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/366527","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The effect of atmospheric nudging on the stratospheric residual circulation in chemistry-climate models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-09-26T02:43:26Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85072295721",,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","17","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
