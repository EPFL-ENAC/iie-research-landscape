These include small cyclic dipeptides such as the insect feeding deterrent peramine, which is a pyrrolopyrazine (PPZ) produced by grass-endophytic Epichloë fungi. Biosynthesis of peramine is catalyzed by the 2-module NRPS, PpzA-1, which has a C-terminal reductase (R) domain that is required for reductive release and cyclization of the NRPS-tethered dipeptidyl-thioester intermediate. However, some PpzA variants lack this R domain due to insertion of a transposable element into the 3′ end of ppzA. We demonstrate here that these truncated PpzA variants utilize nonenzymatic cyclization of the dipeptidyl thioester to a 2,5-diketopiperazine (DKP) to synthesize a range of novel PPZ products. Truncation of the R domain is sufficient to subfunctionalize PpzA-1 into a dedicated DKP synthetase, exemplified by the truncated variant, PpzA-2, which has also evolved altered substrate specificity and reduced N-methyltransferase activity relative to PpzA-1. Further allelic diversity has been generated by recombination-mediated domain shuffling between ppzA-1 and ppzA-2, resulting in the ppzA-3 and ppzA-4 alleles, each of which encodes synthesis of a unique PPZ metabolite. This research establishes that efficient NRPS-catalyzed DKP biosynthesis can occur in vivo through nonenzymatic dipeptidyl cyclization and presents a remarkably clean example of NRPS evolution through recombinant exchange of functionally divergent domains. This work highlights that allelic variants of a single NRPS can result in a surprising level of secondary metabolite diversity comparable to that observed for some gene clusters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000387234","0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.1913080116","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387234","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Nonribosomal peptide synthetase||Secondary||Metabolism||Diketopiperazine||Pyrrolopyrazine||Allelic neofunctionalization","Efficient nonenzymatic cyclization and domain shuffling drive pyrrolopyrazine diversity from truncated variants of a fungal NRPS","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-12-29T15:54:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85076670383",,"000503281500043","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","51","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","116","::ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung||::ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Global climate change imposes a serious threat to natural populations of many species. Estimates of the effects of climate change‐mediated environmental stresses are, however, often based only on their direct effects on organisms, and neglect the potential transgenerational (e.g. maternal) effects. 2. We tested whether high temperature (i.e. an experimental heatwave), which is known to reduce the performance of adult Lymnaea stagnalis snails, affects the produced offspring (eggs and hatchlings) through maternal effects, and how strong these effects are compared with the effects of direct exposure of offspring to high temperature. We examined the effect of maternal thermal environment (15°C versus 25°C) on per offspring investment (egg size), and the role of both maternal and offspring thermal environments (15°C versus 25°C) on hatching success and developmental time of eggs, offspring survival after hatching, and hatchling size at the age of 5 weeks. 3. Exposure of mothers to high temperature reduced the size of oviposited eggs, increased their hatching success, and also made the onset of hatching earlier. However, high maternal temperature reduced the survival and the final size of hatched juveniles. Direct exposure of offspring to high temperature reduced their survival (both eggs and hatchlings) but increased the developmental rate and growth of those individuals that survived. Interestingly, the magnitude of maternal effects on hatching success of eggs and hatchling survival were similar to the direct effects of high temperature. 4. Our results indicate that heatwaves can affect natural populations through transgenerational maternal effects and that the magnitude of those effects can be equally strong to the direct effects of temperature, although this depends on the trait considered. These findings highlight the importance of considering the transgenerational effects of climate warming when estimating its effects in the wild.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000367062","0046-5070||1365-2427",,"10.1111/fwb.13401","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/367062","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Climate change||Environmental stress||Global warming||Lymnaea stagnalis||Maternal effects","Direct and transgenerational effects of an experimental heatwave on early life stages in a freshwater snail","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-09-28T08:13:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85073798752",,"000486272900001","Freshw. biol.","12","Freshwater Biology","64","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Thereby, species interactions can also feed back on the participating species themselves, and on other members of the community. Complex interaction networks can arise that may influence the stability of ecosystems and potentially make them resilient against external perturbation. However, species interactions are not static: through endlessly recurring interplay with their environment, species, and thus, their interactions with other species, are subject to evolutionary change. It is therefore widely acknowledged that species interactions are not only the foundation for the functioning of all ecosystems, but also contribute to the emergence and maintenance of biological diversity on earth. In the face of rapid global environmental change it is critical to learn more about the nature of species interactions, for example, in the context of their strength (effect sizes), temporal stability (variation, within and between generations) or dimensionality (number of, interactions per species). For this dissertation I have conducted a series of experiments to explore the role of species interactions within different levels of ecological organization and across a range of ecological contexts. Specifically, I investigated i) how species interactions can shape phenotypic distributions of populations, ii) how species interactions shape developmental trajectories of phenotypes, and iii) how species interactions affect resistance and resilience of ecosystems in response to external disturbance. In four chapters I addressed these questions with a series of outdoor and laboratory experiments, which provided compelling evidence for strong effects of species interactions on phenotypes, populations, communities and ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000382508",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/382508","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Ecology and evolution||Ecosystem processes||Evolution||Ecology","Species Interactions - From Phenotypes to Ecosystems","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2019-12-04T09:13:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"26145",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Such priming presumably entails costs—else the primed state should be constitutively expressed—yet those costs remain poorly documented, in part due to a lack of studies conducted under realistic ecological conditions. We explored how defence priming in goldenrod (Solidago altissima) influenced growth and reproduction under semi-natural field conditions by manipulating exposure to priming cues (volatile emissions of a specialist herbivore, Eurosta solidaginis), competition between neighbouring plants, and herbivory (via insecticide application).  Results We found that primed plants grew faster than unprimed plants, but produced fewer rhizomes, suggesting reduced capacity for clonal reproduction. Unexpectedly, this effect was apparent only in the absence of insecticide, prompting a follow-up experiment that revealed direct effects of the pesticide esfenvalerate on plant growth (contrary to previous reports from goldenrod). Meanwhile, even in the absence of pesticide, priming had little effect on herbivore damage levels, likely because herbivores susceptible to the primed defences were rare or absent due to seasonality.  Conclusions Reduced clonal reproduction in primed plants suggest that priming can entail significant costs for plants. These costs, however, may only become apparent when priming cues fail to provide accurate information about prevailing threats, as was the case in this study. Additionally, our insecticide data indicate that pesticides or their carrier compounds can subtly, but significantly, affect plant physiology and may interact with plant defences.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000343882","1471-2229",,"10.1186/s12870-019-1820-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/343882","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Competition||Defence||Fitness||Gall||Goldenrod||Herbivory||Insecticide||Priming","Costs of plant defense priming: exposure tovolatile cues from a specialist herbivoreincreases short-term growth but reducesrhizome production in tall goldenrod(Solidago altissima)","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-05-24T06:31:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Exploring the ecology of plant eavesdropping on insect pheromonal communication","163145","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,"85066410804",,"000468805100001","BMC plant biol.",,"BMC Plant Biology","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, their net effect on bacterial fitness remains unknown. To understand the ecology and evolution between filamentous phages and their hosts, it is important to assess (i) fitness effects of filamentous phages on their hosts and (ii) how these effects depend on the environment. To determine how the net effect on bacterial fitness by filamentous phages changes across environments, we constructed phage–bacteria infection networks at ambient 15 practical salinity units (PSU) and stressful salinities (11 and 7 PSU) using the marine bacterium, Vibrio alginolyticus and its derived filamentous phages as model system. We observed no significant difference in network structure at 15 and 11 PSU. However, at 7 PSU phages significantly reduced bacterial growth changing network structure. This pattern was mainly driven by a significant increase in bacterial susceptibility. Our findings suggest that filamentous phages decrease bacterial growth, an indirect measure of fitness in stressful environmental conditions, which might impact bacterial communities, alter horizontal gene transfer events and possibly favour the emergence of novel pathogens in environmental Vibrios.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000389494","2054-5703","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/394252||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/389494","10.1098/rsos.191669","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/389494","en","Royal Society Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","phage–bacteria infection network||Vibrio||filamentous phages||salinity changes","Filamentous phages reduce bacterial growth in low salinities","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-11T03:28:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85077374171",,"000510010700023","R.

The sex‐determination system and sex‐linked genomic regions are currently identified in a limited number of dioecious plants only. Here, we study the sex‐determination system in a genus of dioecious plants that lack heteromorphic sex chromosomes and are not amenable to controlled breeding: Nepenthes pitcher plants. We genotyped wild populations of flowering males and females of three Nepenthes taxa using ddRAD‐seq and sequenced a male inflorescence transcriptome. We developed a statistical tool (privacy rarefaction) to distinguish true sex specificity from stochastic noise in read coverage of sequencing data from wild populations and identified male‐specific loci and XY‐patterned single nucleotide polymorphsims (SNPs) in all three Nepenthes taxa, suggesting the presence of homomorphic XY sex chromosomes. The male‐specific region of the Y chromosome showed little conservation among the three taxa, except for the essential pollen development gene DYT1 that was confirmed as male specific by PCR in additional Nepenthes taxa. Hence, dioecy and part of the male‐specific region of the Nepenthes Y‐chromosomes likely have a single evolutionary origin.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000370774","2056-3744",,"10.1002/evl3.142","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/370774","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Carnivorous plant||dioecy||molecular sexing||plant sex chromosome||privacy rarefaction||sex‐determination||sex‐specific loci","Sex is determined by XY chromosomes across the radiation of dioecious Nepenthes pitcher plants","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-10-16T02:13:47Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000488512000001",,"6","Evolution Letters","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Aside from its ecological relevance, P. haloplanktis has a potential use for biotechnological applications. Due to its importance, we decided to take advantage of next generation sequencing (Illumina) and third generation sequencing (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore) technologies to resequence its genome. The availability of a reference genome, obtained using whole genome shotgun sequencing, allowed us to study and compare the results obtained by the different technologies and draw useful conclusions for future de novo genome assembly projects. We found that assembly polishing using Illumina reads is needed to achieve a consensus accuracy over 99.9% when using Oxford Nanopore sequencing, but not in PacBio sequencing. However, the dependency of consensus accuracy on coverage is lower in Oxford Nanopore than in PacBio, suggesting that a cost-effective solution might be the use of low coverage Oxford Nanopore sequencing together with Illumina reads. Despite the differences in consensus accuracy, all sequencing technologies revealed the presence of a large plasmid, pMEGA, which was undiscovered until now. Among the most interesting features of pMEGA is the presence of a putative error-prone polymerase regulated through the SOS response. Aside from the characterization of the newly discovered plasmid, we confirmed the sequence of the small plasmid pMtBL and uncovered the presence of a potential partitioning system. Crucially, this study shows that the combination of next and third generation sequencing technologies give us an unprecedented opportunity to characterize our bacterial model organisms at a very detailed level.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000380001","2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-019-52832-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/380001","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"New insights on Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 genome organization and benchmarks of genome assembly applications using next and third generation sequencing technologies","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-11-24T03:17:04Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85074854001",,"000495611100036","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A widespread form of genetic sex determination is haplodiploidy, where unfertilized, haploid eggs develop into males and fertilized diploid eggs into females. One of the molecular mechanisms underlying haplodiploidy in Hymenoptera, the large insect order comprising ants, bees, and wasps, is complementary sex determination (CSD). In species with CSD, heterozygosity at one or several loci induces female development. Here, we identify the genomic regions putatively underlying multilocus CSD in the parasitoid wasp Lysiphlebus fabarum using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing. By analyzing segregation patterns at polymorphic sites among 331 diploid males and females, we identify up to four CSD candidate regions, all on different chromosomes. None of the candidate regions feature evidence for homology with the csd gene from the honey bee, the only species in which CSD has been characterized, suggesting that CSD in L. fabarum is regulated via a novel molecular mechanism. Moreover, no homology is shared between the candidate loci, in contrast to the idea that multilocus CSD should emerge from duplications of an ancestral single-locus system. Taken together, our results suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying CSD in Hymenoptera are not conserved between species, raising the question as to whether CSD may have evolved multiple times independently in the group.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000376115","1759-6653",,"10.1093/gbe/evz219","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/376115","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Hymenoptera||Sex determination||Lysiphlebus fabarum||CSD","Mapping of Multiple Complementary Sex Determination Loci in a Parasitoid Wasp","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-11-08T03:44:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Symbiont-mediated coevolution in an insect host-parasitoid system","146341","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,,,"85074306224",,"000504448300022","Genome Biol Evol","10","Genome Biology and Evolution","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite the potential importance of natural variability such as diurnal temperature fluctuations, most experimental studies on warming are conducted under stable temperatures. Here, we investigated whether the responses of an aquatic invertebrate grazer (Lymnaea stagnalis) to an increased average temperature differ when the thermal regime is either constant or fluctuates diurnally. Using thermal response curves for several life‐history and immune defense traits, we first identified the optimum and near‐critically high temperatures that Lymnaea potentially experience during summer heat waves. We then exposed individuals that originated from three different populations to these two temperatures under constant or fluctuating thermal conditions. After 7 days, we assessed growth, reproduction, and two immune parameters (phenoloxidase‐like activity and antibacterial activity of hemolymph) from each individual. Exposure to the near‐critically high temperature led to increased growth rates and decreased antibacterial activity of hemolymph compared to the optimum temperature, whilst temperature fluctuations had no effect on these traits. The results indicate that the temperature level per se, rather than the variability in temperature was the main driver altering trait responses in our study species. Forecasting responses in temperature‐related responses remains challenging, due to system‐specific properties that can include intraspecific variation. However, our study indicates that experiments examining the effects of warming using constant temperatures can give similar predictions as studies with fluctuating thermal dynamics, and may thus be useful indicators of responses in nature.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000369338","2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.5666","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/369338","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Fluctuating temperature||Invertebrate||Population","Diurnal variation around an optimum and near-critically high temperature does not alter the performance of an ectothermic aquatic grazer","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-10-09T02:27:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85073990405",,"000487784400001","Ecol Evol","20","Ecology and Evolution","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, their interaction with other disturbances and whether their combined effects can impact ecological resilience (i.e., the ability of a system to tolerate disturbances without altering the system's original structure and processes) remain unexplored. Using in situ mesocosms in 2 lakes with different nutrient levels (mesotrophic and eutrophic), we assessed whether a pulse exposure to sublethal concentrations of 12 PPCPs affects the ecological resilience of natural phytoplankton communities that experienced an abrupt environmental change involving the destabilization of the water column through mixing. Such mixing events are predicted to increase as the effects of climate change unfold, leading to more frequent storms, which disrupt stratification in lakes and force communities to restructure. We assessed their combined effects on community metrics (biomass, species richness, and composition) and their relative resilience using 4 indicators (cross‐scale, within‐scale, aggregation length, and gap length), inferred from phytoplankton communities by discontinuity analysis. The mixing disturbance alone had negligible effects on the community metrics, but when combined with chemical contaminants significant changes were measured: reducing total biomass, species richness, and altered community composition of phytoplankton. Once these changes occurred, they persisted until the end of the experiment (day 20), when the communities’ structures from the 2 highest exposure levels diverged from the controls. The resilience indicators were not affected by PPCPs but differed significantly between lakes, with lower resilience found in the eutrophic lake. Thus, PPCPs can significantly alter community structures and reinforce mechanisms that maintain ecosystems in a “degraded state.” Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:2197–2208. © 2019 The Authors.

Despite considerable advances, we still have limited insight into how phenotypic variation arises and is sorted by natural selection. Here we argue that an integrated view, which merges ecology, evolution and developmental biology (eco evo devo) on an equal footing, is needed to understand the multifaceted role of the environment in simultaneously determining the development of the phenotype and the nature of the selective environment, and how organisms in turn affect the environment through eco evo and eco devo feedbacks. To illustrate the usefulness of an integrated eco evo devo perspective, we connect it with the theory of resource polymorphism (i.e. the phenotypic and genetic diversification that occurs in response to variation in available resources). In so doing, we highlight fishes from recently glaciated freshwater systems as exceptionally well‐suited model systems for testing predictions of an eco evo devo framework in studies of diversification. Studies on these fishes show that intraspecific diversity can evolve rapidly, and that this process is jointly facilitated by (i) the availability of diverse environments promoting divergent natural selection; (ii) dynamic developmental processes sensitive to environmental and genetic signals; and (iii) eco evo and eco devo feedbacks influencing the selective and developmental environments of the phenotype. We highlight empirical examples and present a conceptual model for the generation of resource polymorphism – emphasizing eco evo devo, and identify current gaps in knowledge.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000364118","1469-185X||1464-7931||0006-3231",,"10.1111/brv.12534","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/364118","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","divergent evolution||epigenetics||genetics||niche construction||non‐genetic inheritance||phenotype||phenotypic plasticity||natural selection||polymorphic fishes||speciation","A way forward with eco evo devo: an extended theory of resource polymorphism with postglacial fishes as model systems","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-09-15T02:35:50Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85067462518",,,"Biol Rev,","5","Biological Reviews","94","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This claim underpins academic analyses and recommendations about the distribution and prioritization of species and areas for conservation, but evolutionary history is rarely considered in practical conservation activities. One impediment to implementation is that arguments related to the human‐centric benefits of evolutionary history are often vague and the underlying mechanisms poorly explored. Herein we identify the arguments linking the prioritization of evolutionary history with benefits to people, and for each we explicate the purported mechanism, and evaluate its theoretical and empirical support. We find that, even after 25 years of academic research, the strength of evidence linking evolutionary history to human benefits is still fragile.  Most – but not all – arguments rely on the assumption that evolutionary history is a useful surrogate for phenotypic diversity. This surrogacy relationship in turn underlies additional arguments, particularly that, by capturing more phenotypic diversity, evolutionary history will preserve greater ecosystem functioning, capture more of the natural variety that humans prefer, and allow the maintenance of future benefits to humans. A surrogate relationship between evolutionary history and phenotypic diversity appears reasonable given theoretical and empirical results, but the strength of this relationship varies greatly. To the extent that evolutionary history captures unmeasured phenotypic diversity, maximizing the representation of evolutionary history should capture variation in species characteristics that are otherwise unknown, supporting some of the existing arguments. However, there is great variation in the strength and availability of evidence for benefits associated with protecting phenotypic diversity. There are many studies finding positive biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships, but little work exists on the maintenance of future benefits or the degree to which humans prefer sets of species with high phenotypic diversity or evolutionary history. Although several arguments link the protection of evolutionary history directly with the reduction of extinction rates, and with the production of relatively greater future biodiversity via increased adaptation or diversification, there are few direct tests. Several of these putative benefits have mismatches between the relevant spatial scales for conservation actions and the spatial scales at which benefits to humans are realized. It will be important for future work to fill in some of these gaps through direct tests of the arguments we define here.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000389373","1469-185X||1464-7931||0006-3231",,"10.1111/brv.12526","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/389373","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Phylogenetic diversity||Conservation||Prioritization||Phenotypic diversity||Ecosystem function||Extinction||Functional diversity||Benefits to people","Assessing the utility of conserving evolutionary history","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-10T14:35:35Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biol Rev,","5","Biological Reviews","94","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Such constraints have been introduced by implementing ecological assembly rules (EARs) into S‐SDMs, and can be based on patterns of functional traits in communities. Despite being logically valid, this approach has led to a limited improvement in prediction, possibly because of mismatches between the scales of measurement of niche and trait data.  Evidence S‐SDM studies have often related single values of a species’ traits to environmental niches that are captured by abiotic conditions measured at a much finer spatial scale, without accounting for intraspecific trait variation along environmental gradients. Many pieces of evidence show that omitting intraspecific trait variation can hinder the proper inference of EARs from trait patterns, and we further argue that it can therefore also affect our capacity to spatially predict functional properties of communities. In addition, estimates of environmental niches and trait envelopes may vary depending on the scale at which environmental and trait measurements are made.  Conclusion We suggest that to overcome these limitations, surveys sampling both niche and trait measurements should be conducted at fine scales along wide environmental gradients, and integrated at the same scale to test and improve a new generation of spatial community models and their functional properties.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000365577","1466-822X||1466-8238",,"10.1111/geb.12967","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/365577","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Eecological assembly rules||Environmental gradients||Fine‐scale sampling||Microhabitat||Multivariate envelope||Stacked species distribution models","Scaling the linkage between environmental niches and functional traits for improved spatial predictions of biological communities","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-09-20T12:55:32Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Novel`interactions and species’ responses to climate change","678841","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,"85068914287",,,"Glob.

Such tools could greatly benefit resistance breeding, but their adoption is hampered by i) a lack of specificity to disease-related effects and ii) insufficient robustness to variation in reflectance caused by genotypic diversity and varying environmental conditions, which are fundamental elements of resistance breeding. We hypothesized that relying exclusively on temporal changes in canopy reflectance during pathogenesis may allow to specifically detect and quantify crop diseases while minimizing the confounding effects of genotype and environment. To test this hypothesis, we collected time-resolved canopy hyperspectral reflectance data for 18 diverse genotypes on infected and disease-free plots and engineered spectral–temporal features representing this hypothesis. Our results confirm the lack of specificity and robustness of disease assessments based on reflectance spectra at individual time points. We show that changes in spectral reflectance over time are indicative of the presence and severity of Septoria tritici blotch (STB) infections. Furthermore, the proposed time-integrated approach facilitated the delineation of disease from physiological senescence, which is pivotal for efficient selection of STB-resistant material under field conditions. A validation of models based on spectral–temporal features on a diverse panel of 330 wheat genotypes offered evidence for the robustness of the proposed method. This study demonstrates the potential of time-resolved canopy reflectance measurements for robust assessments of foliar diseases in the context of resistance breeding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000378019","1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2019.01355","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/378019","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","high-throughput phenotyping||field-based phenotyping||feature engineering||feature selection||spectral vegetation index","In-Field Detection and Quantification of Septoria Tritici Blotch in Diverse Wheat Germplasm Using Spectral-Temporal Features","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-11-16T03:26:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Epidemiology of major wheat diseases: using eco-evolutionary models to learn from epidemic and genomic data","161453","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,,"85074700778",,"000494463700001","Front.

We developed an automated image analysis to measure quantitative resistance to septoria tritici blotch (STB), a globally important wheat disease, enabling identification of small chromosome intervals containing plausible candidate genes for STB resistance. 335 winter wheat cultivars were included in a replicated field experiment that experienced natural epidemic development by a highly diverse but fungicide-resistant pathogen population. More than 5.4 million automatically generated phenotypes were associated with 13,648 SNP markers to perform the GWAS. We identified 26 chromosome intervals explaining 1.9-10.6% of the variance associated with four independent resistance traits. Sixteen of the intervals overlapped with known STB resistance intervals, suggesting that our phenotyping approach can identify simultaneously (i.e., in a single experiment) many previously defined STB resistance intervals. Seventeen of the intervals were less than 5 Mbp in size and encoded only 173 genes, including many genes associated with disease resistance. Five intervals contained four or fewer genes, providing high priority targets for functional validation. Ten chromosome intervals were not previously associated with STB resistance, perhaps representing resistance to pathogen strains that had not been tested in earlier experiments. The SNP markers associated with these chromosome intervals can be used to recombine different forms of quantitative STB resistance that are likely to be more durable than pyramids of major resistance genes. Our experiment illustrates how high-throughput automated phenotyping can accelerate breeding for quantitative disease resistance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000369259",,,"10.34133/2019/3285904","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/369259","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Precision Phenotyping Reveals Novel Loci for Quantitative Resistance to Septoria Tritici Blotch","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-10-08T14:31:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Genomics of quantitative traits and chromosome instability in Zymoseptoria tritici||QTL mapping of virulence and other quantitative traits in the model plant pathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola||Epidemiology of major wheat diseases: using eco-evolutionary models to learn from epidemic and genomic data","155955||134755||161453","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)||Ambizione||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,,,,,"Plant Phenomics","2019","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Primary and secondary metabolites are essential determinants of fruit organoleptic quality, and some of them, such as carotenoids and phenolics, have been associated with beneficial proprieties for human health. Landraces’ fruit taste and flavour are often preferred by consumers compared to the commercial varieties’ ones. In an autumn-winter greenhouse hydroponic experiment, the response of three Southern-Italy tomato landraces (Ciettaicale, Linosa and Corleone) and one commercial cultivar (UC-82B) to different concentrations of sodium chloride (0 mM, 60 mM or 120 mM NaCl) were evaluated. At harvest, no losses in marketable yield were noticed in any of the tested genotypes. However, under salt stress, fresh fruit yield as well as fruit calcium concentration were higher affected in the commercial cultivar than in the landraces. Furthermore, UC-82B showed a trend of decreasing lycopene and total antioxidant capacity with increasing salt concentration, whereas no changes in these parameters were observed in the landraces under 60 mM NaCl. Landraces under 120 mM NaCl accumulated more fructose and glucose in the fruits, while salt did not affect hexoses levels in UC-82B. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed differential accumulation of glycoalkaloids, phenolic acids, flavonoids and their derivatives in the fruits of all genotypes under stress. Overall, the investigated Italian landraces showed a different behaviour compared to the commercial variety UC-82B under moderate salinity stress, showing a tolerable compromise between yield and quality attributes. Our results point to the feasible use of tomato landraces as a target to select interesting genetic traits to improve fruit quality under stress conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000369340","1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2019.01078","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/369340","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","tomato||landraces||off-season||salinity||fruit quality||metabolites","Salinity in Autumn-Winter Season and Fruit Quality of Tomato Landraces","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-10-09T02:27:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85073012975",,"000487643400001","Front.

Here we report how predator-prey interactions alter the evolution of fitness, genomes and phenotypic diversity in coevolving bacterial communities composed of Myxococcus xanthus as predator and Escherichia coli as prey, relative to single-species controls. We show evidence of reciprocal adaptation and demonstrate accelerated genomic evolution specific to coevolving communities, including the rapid appearance of mutator genotypes. Strong parallel evolution unique to the predator-prey communities occurs in both parties, with predators driving adaptation at two prey traits associated with virulence in bacterial pathogens—mucoidy and the outer-membrane protease OmpT. Our results suggest that generalist predatory bacteria are important determinants of how complex microbial communities and their interaction networks evolve in natural habitats.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000367075","2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-019-12140-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/367075","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Bacterial predator-prey coevolution accelerates genome evolution and selects on virulence-associated prey defences","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-09-28T08:35:33Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85072536032",,"000486995200011","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this field experiment we tested whether a single pulse exposure to a mixture of 12 pharmaceuticals and personal care products, which are commonly found in European inland waters, can influence the size distributions of natural lake phytoplankton communities. Size is one of the most influential determinants of community structure and functioning, particularly in planktonic communities and food webs. Using an in-situ microcosm approach, phytoplankton communities in two lakes with different nutrient levels (mesotrophic and eutrophic) were exposed to a concentration gradient of the PPCPs mixture at five levels. We tested whether sub-lethal PPCPs doses affect the scaling of organisms' abundances with their size, and the slope of these size spectra, which describe changes in the abundances of small relative to large phytoplankton. Our results showed that a large proportion (approximately 80%) of the dataset followed a power-law distribution, thus suggesting evidence of scale invariance of abundances, as expected in steady state ecosystems. PPCPs were however found to induce significant changes in the size spectra and community structure of natural phytoplankton assemblages. The two highest treatment levels of PPCPs were associated with decreased abundance of the most dominant size class (nano-phytoplankton: 2–5 μm), leading to a flattening of the size spectra slope. These results suggest that a pulse exposure to PPCPs induce changes that potentially lead to unsteady ecosystem states and cascading effects in the aquatic food webs, by favoring larger non-edible algae at the expense of small edible species. We propose higher susceptibility due to higher surface to volume ratio in small species as the likely cause of these structural changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000346450","0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.229","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/346450","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs)||Micropollutants||Scaling law||Size abundance relationship||Phytoplankton communities||Field experiment","A single pulse of diffuse contaminants alters the size distribution of natural phytoplankton communities","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-06-08T12:19:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85066280848",,"000471657600059","Sci.

Microorganisms support the existence of all higher trophic life forms. To understand how humans and other life forms on Earth (including those we are yet to discover) can withstand anthropogenic climate change, it is vital to incorporate knowledge of the microbial ‘unseen majority’. We must learn not just how microorganisms affect climate change (including production and consumption of greenhouse gases) but also how they will be affected by climate change and other human activities. This Consensus Statement documents the central role and global importance of microorganisms in climate change biology. It also puts humanity on notice that the impact of climate change will depend heavily on responses of microorganisms, which are essential for achieving an environmentally sustainable future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000350779","1740-1526||1740-1534",,"10.1038/s41579-019-0222-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/350779","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Scientists’ warning to humanity: microorganisms and climate change","Review Article","Open access",,,"2019-07-02T06:51:09Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85068129345",,"000480437300008","Nat Rev Microbiol","9","Nature Reviews Microbiology","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Objectives To characterize the genetic context of Tn5801 to define its transfer dynamics and impact on the evolution of Enterococcus faecalis (Efs).  Methods WGS (Illumina HiSeq 2500) was performed on the Efs clinical strain Ef1 and primary and secondary transconjugants of Efs strains JH2-2 [which naturally contains Tn5801.B23, an unusual variant that lacks tet(M)], OG1RF and OG1SS carrying different copies of Tn5801-like elements. The transposon structures were analysed using a range of bioinformatics tools allowing us to identify the context of Tn5801-like elements. Growth rates at different tetracycline concentrations (0.5–20 mg/L) were estimated using a Synergy HTX plate reader.  Results Tn5801.B15 [tet(M), 20.3 kb] exists and can be transferred either singly or within Tn6648 (53.2 kb), a composite element that comprises Tn5801.B15 and Tn6647, a newly identified 32.8 kb transposon that contains the prgABCT operon of pheromone-responsive plasmids. These transposons are able to integrate at specific 11 nt sequences at the 3′ end of guaA and at other chromosomal sites in Efs genomes, thus being able to generate tandem accretions. These events may increase the number of tet(M) copies, enhancing tetracycline resistance in the recipient strain.  Conclusions This study describes Tn6647 and Tn6648 (comprising Tn6647 and Tn5801.B15) and highlights the diversity of mechanisms for conjugative mobilization and chromosomal insertion of these elements, which can result in tandem accretion. This strategy would facilitate the adaptation of Efs clones to environmental challenges.",,,"0305-7453||1460-2091",,"10.1093/jac/dkz239","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473464","en","Oxford University Press",,,,"Transfer dynamics of Tn6648, a composite integrative conjugative element generated by tandem accretion of Tn5801 and Tn6647 in Enterococcus faecalis","Journal Article||Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-03-08T15:47:01Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,"58722216",,,,,,"J Antimicrob Chemother","9","Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy","74","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Plant survival under these conditions requires soil-specific adaptations. Arabidopsis arenosa, a relative of A. thaliana, is an obligate outcrosser that occurs on both metalliferous and non-metalliferous soils. We are interested in adaptive differences between populations from metalliferous (M) and non-metalliferous (NM) sites, from a genomic and a functional perspective. From natural M and NM populations, we collected leaves, soil and seeds of individual plants, determined leaf and soil TME content and performed genomic divergence scans and environmental association analyses. In a greenhouse reciprocal transplant experiment, we tested for local adaptation and differences in gene transcription (RNAseq). Further, to perform a bulked segregant analysis, we created a segregating F2 population by crossing M and NM individuals from one soil contrast. Here, we demonstrate that M populations are adapted to metalliferous soils and that metalliferous soils exert a strong selection pressure manifesting in differing survival rates of M and NM plants on metalliferous soil. We present how we identify candidate loci underlying adaptive differences between M and NM populations, by integrating population genomics (genome scans, association analyses), quantitative genetics (bulked segregant analysis, RNAseq) and in the near future molecular biology (cloning of alleles, characterisation of knock-out mutants). To date, our approach identified well characterised metal-adaptation genes (e.g. HMA4, MTP1) next to a majority of undescribed and (so far) non-metal related candidate loci.",,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/385625","en","ESEB 2019",,,,"Adaptation to high soil trace metal element concentrations in Arabidopsis arenosa","Other Conference Item","Metadata only","Online Program and Abstracts: 17th Congress of the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB 2019)",,"2019-12-13T15:15:13Z",,,,"yes","17th Congress of the European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB 2019)","August 19-24, 2019","Turku, Finland","The functional basis of edaphic adaptation to high metal concentrations","171523","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Rückkehr CH Advanced Postdoc.Mobility",,,,,,"https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/events/653/program-app/submission/122303",,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

There is a pressing need to adopt more efficient treatment strategies in order to prevent the emergence and spread of resistant strains. The common approach is to treat patients with high drug doses, both to clear the infection quickly and to reduce the risk of de novo resistance. Recently, several studies have argued that, at least in some cases, low-dose treatments could be more suitable to reduce the within-host emergence of antimicrobial resistance. However, the choice of a drug dose may have consequences at the population level, which has received little attention so far. Here, we study the influence of the drug dose on resistance and disease management at the host and population levels. We develop a nested two-strain model and unravel trade-offs in treatment benefits between an individual and the community. We use several measures to evaluate the benefits of any dose choice. Two measures focus on the emergence of resistance, at the host level and at the population level. The other two focus on the overall treatment success: the outbreak probability and the disease burden. We find that different measures can suggest different dosing strategies. In particular, we identify situations where low doses minimize the risk of emergence of resistance at the individual level, while high or intermediate doses prove most beneficial to improve the treatment efficiency or even to reduce the risk of resistance in the population.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000365427","1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007223","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/365427","en","PLoS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Aggressive or moderate drug therapy for infectious diseases?

Similar mechanisms may mediate the sharing of information (e.g., about herbivory or other environmental stressors) among ramets via molecular or biochemical signals. The storage of such information in belowground structures could facilitate the transmission of appropriate phenotypic responses across growing seasons in perennial species. However, few previous studies have explored the potential transfer of ecologically relevant information within such networks. This study addresses the effects of foliar herbivory and belowground overwintering on the growth and flowering, physical defenses, and herbivore resistance in the clonally spreading species Solanum carolinense L. (Solanaceae). We used rhizomes from inbred and outbred plants that were repeatedly exposed to feeding damage by Manduca sexta L. (Sphingidae) caterpillars and rhizomes from undamaged control plants. These rhizomes were either planted immediately or exposed to overwintering conditions and allowed to produce new ramets (rhizomatous offshoots). We then assessed offshoot emergence, flowering, physical defense traits, and herbivore performance. Relative to controls, offshoots of herbivore-damaged plants exhibited greater spine and trichome densities, and reduced performance of M. sexta larvae. However, they also emerged and flowered significantly later, and produced fewer flowers than offshoots of undamaged plants. Inbreeding also negatively affected offshoot emergence, flowering, trichome production, and herbivore resistance. These effects of parental herbivory were more pronounced in outbred offshoots, indicating that inbreeding may compromise the trans-seasonal induction of plant defenses. Finally, exposure to overwintering conditions increased trichome production and reduced caterpillar performance on offshoots. Together, these results show that induced defenses can be transmitted through rhizomes and affect offshoot growth, flowering, defensive traits, and herbivore resistance. They also document fitness-related costs associated with defense induction in offshoots and suggest that the transfer of defenses across seasons can be compromised by inbreeding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000355052","0269-7653||1573-8477",,"10.1007/s10682-019-09997-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/355052","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Clonal plants||Herbivory||Inducible defenses||Inbreeding||Manduca sexta||Solanum carolinense","Herbivory and inbreeding affect growth, reproduction, and resistance in the rhizomatous offshoots of Solanum carolinense (Solanaceae)","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-07-25T04:18:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85068175171",,"000475796800003","Evol Ecol","4","Evolutionary Ecology","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Nine colonised patients were detected in the Neurosurgery ward between September 2015 and February 2016 during the R-GNOSIS European Project. NDM-1-Kp isolates from clinical samples were also recovered in three of these patients. Surveillance culture at admission was negative in the index case, but NDM-1-Kp colonisation was detected 27 days later after receiving antibiotic treatment. Co-colonisation with a second NDM-1-Kp isolate was identified in this patient 61 days post-admission. Overall length of stay (LOS = 75 days) (P < 0.01) and LOS until carbapenemase detection (LOS-1 = 36 days) was longer in NDM-1-Kp carriers than in patients with other carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales. Intervention strategies were implemented after the outbreak declaration and NDM-1-Kp transmission was contained. Among the NDM-1-Kp isolates, two clones [ST437 (index case and Patient 2) and ST101 (index case and Patients 3-9)] with different IncFIB NDM-1-containing plasmids were identified. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a high content of antimicrobial resistance genes in both isolates in addition to a large number of virulence factors. Colonisation with other epidemic (OXA-48-ST11-K. pneumoniae and VIM-1-ST54-K. pneumoniae) and non-epidemic (VIM-1-ST908-K. pneumoniae and VIM-ST431-Escherichia coli) clones was also detected in two NDM-1 carriers.

Here, we analysed the clonal and plasmid diversity of 97 Efs isolates from wild migratory birds. We found a high diversity, with most sequence types (STs) being firstly described here, while others were found in other hosts including some predominant in poultry. We found that pheromone‐responsive plasmids predominate in wild bird Efs while 35% of the isolates entirely lack plasmids. Then, to better understand the ecology of the species, the whole genome of fivestrains with known STs (ST82, ST170, ST16 and ST55) were sequenced and compared with all the Efs genomes available in public databases. Using several methods to analyse core and accessory genomes (AccNET, PLACNET, hierBAPS and PANINI), we detected differences in the accessory genome of some lineages (e.g. ST82) demonstrating specific associations with birds. Conversely, the genomes of other Efs lineages exhibited divergence in core and accessory genomes, reflecting different adaptive trajectories in various hosts. This pangenome divergence, horizontal gene transfer events and occasional epidemic peaks could explain the population structure of the species. © 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,"1462-2912||1462-2920",,"10.1111/1462-2920.14702","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473473","en","Wiley",,,,"Phylogenomics of Enterococcus faecalis from wild birds: new insights into host‐associated differences in core and accessory genomes of the species","Journal Article||Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-03-08T16:00:32Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,"58144098",,,,,,"Environ. microbiol.","8","Environmental Microbiology","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

ROS concentration is normally low, but it increases under stress conditions. To stand ROS exposure, organisms evolved series of responsive mechanisms. One such mechanism is protein S-glutathionylation. S-glutathionylation is a post-translational modification typically occurring in response to oxidative stress, in which a glutathione reacts with cysteinyl residues, protecting them from overoxidation. α-Amylases are glucan hydrolases that cleave α-1,4-glucosidic bonds in starch. The Arabidopsis genome contains three genes encoding α-amylases. The sole chloroplastic member, AtAMY3, is involved in osmotic stress response and stomatal opening and is redox-regulated by thioredoxins. Here we show that AtAMY3 activity was sensitive to ROS, such as H2O2. Treatments with H2O2 inhibited enzyme activity and part of the inhibition was irreversible. However, in the presence of glutathione this irreversible inhibition was prevented through S-glutathionylation. The activity of oxidized AtAMY3 was completely restored by simultaneous reduction by both glutaredoxin (specific for the removal of glutathione-mixed disulfide) and thioredoxin (specific for the reduction of protein disulfide), supporting a possible liaison between both redox modifications. By comparing free cysteine residues between reduced and GSSG-treated AtAMY3 and performing oxidation experiments of Cys-to-Ser variants of AtAMY3 using biotin-conjugated GSSG, we could demonstrate that at least three distinct cysteinyl residues can be oxidized/glutathionylated, among those the two previously identified catalytic cysteines, Cys499 and Cys587. Measuring the pKa values of the catalytic cysteines by alkylation at different pHs and enzyme activity measurement (pKa1 = 5.70 ± 0.28; pKa2 = 7.83 ± 0.12) showed the tendency of one of the two catalytic cysteines to deprotonation, even at physiological pHs, supporting its propensity to undergo redox post-translational modifications. Taking into account previous and present findings, a functional model for redox regulation of AtAMY3 is proposed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000355155","1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2019.00993","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/355155","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","α-amylase 3||Post-translational redox modifications||S-glutathionylation||Disulfide||Cysteine pKa||Glutaredoxin||Thioredoxin","The thioredoxin-regulated α-amylase 3 of Arabidopsis thaliana is a target of S-glutathionylation","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-07-25T08:55:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Mechanistic insights into the adaptive plasticity of plant starch metabolism","166539","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,,"000478017100001","Front.

Separating the components of phenotypic divergence is notoriously difficult, particularly for multivariate phenotypes. Here, we assessed phenotypic divergence of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) across 19 semi‐interconnected ponds within a small geographic region (~7.5 km2) using comparisons of multivariate phenotypic divergence (PST), neutral genetic (FST), and environmental (EST) variation. We found phenotypic divergence across the ponds in a suite of functionally relevant phenotypic traits, including feeding, defense, and swimming traits, and body shape (geometric morphometric). Comparisons of PSTs with FSTs suggest that phenotypic divergence is predominantly driven by neutral processes or stabilizing selection, whereas phenotypic divergence in defensive traits is in accordance with divergent selection. Comparisons of population pairwise PSTs with ESTs suggest that phenotypic divergence in swimming traits is correlated with prey availability, whereas there were no clear associations between phenotypic divergence and environmental difference in the other phenotypic groups. Overall, our results suggest that phenotypic divergence of these small populations at small geographic scales is largely driven by neutral processes (gene flow, drift), although environmental determinants (natural selection or phenotypic plasticity) may play a role.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000356724","2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.5381","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/356724","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","adaptive divergence||FST||multivariate phenotype||plasticity||PST||stickleback","Drift versus selection as drivers of phenotypic divergence at small spatial scales: The case of Belgjarskógur threespine stickleback","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-08-06T02:57:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85068114841",,,"Ecol Evol","14","Ecology and Evolution","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

O objetivo do presente estudo foi determinar o efeito do estresse térmico na evolucionabilidade para crescimento micelial de duas populações hospedeiro-distintas de Rhizocctonia solani AG-1 IA infectando arroz (OS6) ou Urochloa (BBT1) e compará-las a uma população de R. oryzae-sativae de arroz (OS5), espécie adaptada a temperaturas mais elevadas. As populações foram submetidas a duas temperaturas de crescimento: 25°C e 35°C (temperatura ótima e de estresse para R. solani AG-1 IA). Baseando-se em medidas do crescimento micelial, estimaram-se os coeficientes de variância genotípica (IG), variância ambiental (IE) e herdabilidade no sentido amplo (h2) como medidas de evolucionabilidade. Enquanto a população OS5 de R. oryzae-sativae foi pouco influenciada pelo estresse térmico, a 35oC detectou-se redução de h2 nas populações BBT1 e OS6 de R. solani AG-1 IA. Entretanto, os valores relativamente altos de h2 a 35oC (0,63 ± 0,07) indicaram que tanto a população BBT1 quanto a OS6 de R. solani AG-1 IA têm potencial de adaptação ao estresse térmico.||A large number of widely distributed plant pathogens such as the phytopathogenic fungi of the genus Rhizoctonia are subject to extreme temperature fluctuations in their habitats.

However, systematic testing of this is scarce. Here we examine this hypothesis in two closely related plant species, Arabidopsis halleri and Arabidopsis arenosa, which co-occur at two calamine metalliferous (M) sites harbouring toxic levels of the heavy metals zinc and cadmium. We conduct individual genome resequencing alongside soil elemental analysis for 64 plants from eight populations on M and non-metalliferous (NM) soils, and identify genomic footprints of selection and local adaptation. Selective sweep and environmental association analyses indicate a modest degree of gene as well as functional network convergence, whereby the proximal molecular factors mediating this convergence mostly differ between site pairs and species. Notably, we observe repeated selection on identical single nucleotide polymorphisms in several A. halleri genes at two independently colonized M sites. Our data suggest that species-specific metal handling and other biological features could explain a low degree of convergence between species. The parallel establishment of plant populations on calamine M soils involves convergent evolution, which will probably be more pervasive across sites purposely chosen for maximal similarity in soil composition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000345383","0962-8436||1471-2970||0080-4622",,"10.1098/rstb.2018.0243","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/345383","en","Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Convergence||adaptation||evolution||selective sweep||selection","Convergent evolution in Arabidopsis halleri and Arabidopsis arenosa on calamine metalliferous soils","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-06-04T09:03:08Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"58075553",,,,,"000472215500009","Phil.

Recent studies on endophytes have shown the beneficial roles of host-endophyte associations as protection against insect herbivores in agriculturally important grasses. However, large-scale screenings are crucial to identify animal friendly strains suitable for agricultural use. In this study we analyzed collected populations of meadow fescue (Schedonorus pratensis) from 135 different locations across Europe, 255 accessions from the United States Department of Agriculture and 96 accessions from The Nordic Genetic Resource Centre. The analysis also included representatives of S. arundinaceus, S. giganteus, and Lolium perenne. All plants were screened for the presence of Epichloë endophytes, resulting in a nursery of about 2500 infected plants from 176 different locations. Genetic diversity was investigated on 250 isolates using a microsatellite-based PCR fingerprinting assay at 7 loci, 5 of which were uncharacterized for these species. Phylogenetic and principal components analysis showed a strong interspecific genetic differentiation among isolates, and, with E. uncinata isolates, a small but significant correlation between genetic diversity and geographical effect (r = 0.227) was detected. Concentrations of loline alkaloids were measured in 218 infected meadow fescue plants. Average amount of total loline and the proportions of the single loline alkaloids differed significantly among endophyte haplotypes (P < 0.005). This study provides insight into endophyte genetic diversity and geographic variation in Europe and a reference database of allele sizes for fast discrimination of isolates. We also discuss the possibility of multiple hybridization events as a source of genetic and alkaloid variation observed in E. uncinata.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000349771","1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2019.00765","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/349771","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Epichloe||Genetic diversity||Grass endophytes||Interspecific hybrids||Microsatellite markers||Schedonorus||Loline","Large Scale Screening of Epichloë Endophytes Infecting Schedonorus pratensis and Other Forage Grasses Reveals a Relation Between Microsatellite-Based Haplotypes and Loline Alkaloid Levels","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-06-26T07:09:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85068457822",,"000471135200001","Front.

In cranberries, phytoplasma infection causes false blossom disease, which is transmitted by leafhoppers. We hypothesized that changes in plant chemistry induced by phytoplasma infection might affect the performance and feeding behavior not only of vectors but also of other phytophagous insects. To test this, we measured growth, survival, and the number of leaves damaged by larvae of three common non-vector herbivores: spotted fireworm (Choristoneura parallela Robinson), Sparganothis fruitworm (Sparganothis sulfureana Clemens), and gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) on phytoplasma-infected and uninfected cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.). We also assessed the effects of phytoplasma infection on nutrients and phytochemistry related to defenses. In general, larvae of all three herbivore species grew 2–3 times bigger, and damaged 1.5–3.5 times more leaves, while feeding on infected vs. uninfected plants. Survival of Sparganothis fruitworm larvae was also ~1.5 times higher on infected plants, while spotted fireworm and gypsy moth larval survival was not affected. In a long-term (5-week) assay, gypsy moth larval survival and mass were enhanced when feeding on phytoplasma-infected leaves. Levels of important plant nutrients (e.g., N, P, K, Ca, S, Mn, Fe, B, Al, and Na) were higher in infected plants, while levels of defensive proanthocyanidins were reduced by 20–40% compared to uninfected plants. In contrast, levels of Mg were lower in infected plants, while concentrations of Cu, Zn, and defensive flavonols were not affected. Taken together, these findings suggest that phytoplasma infection enhances plant nutritional quality, while reducing plant defenses in cranberries. These effects, in turn, may explain the observed enhancement of non-vector herbivore performance, as well as the higher number of damaged leaves, on infected plants. Improved understanding of the ecology of pathogen-plant-herbivore interactions could aid efforts to enhance plant resistance and suppress disease transmission in agricultural settings.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000346143","2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2019.00181","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/346143","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Vaccinium macrocarpon||spotted fireworm||Sparganothis fruitworm||gypsy moth||host manipulation||nutrients||flavonoids","Phytoplasma Infection of Cranberries Benefits Non-vector Phytophagous Insects","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-06-07T03:02:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000468790700001","Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, demonstrating the role of transition bias in adaptive evolution remains challenging. In particular, it is unclear whether such biases direct the evolution of bacterial pathogens adapting to treatment. We addressed this challenge by analyzing adaptive antibiotic-resistance mutations in the major human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). We found strong evidence for transition bias in two independently curated data sets comprising 152 and 208 antibiotic-resistance mutations. This was true at the level of mutational paths (distinct adaptive DNA sequence changes) and events (individual instances of the adaptive DNA sequence changes) and across different genes and gene promoters conferring resistance to a diversity of antibiotics. It was also true for mutations that do not code for amino acid changes (in gene promoters and the 16S ribosomal RNA gene rrs) and for mutations that are synonymous to each other and are therefore likely to have similar fitness effects, suggesting that transition bias can be caused by a bias in mutation supply. These results point to a central role for transition bias in determining which mutations drive adaptive antibiotic resistance evolution in a key pathogen.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000344220","1544-9173||1545-7885",,"10.1371/journal.pbio.3000265","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/344220","en","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Transition bias influences the evolution of antibiotic resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-05-27T12:18:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85066917863",,"000470189800026","PLoS biol.","5","PLoS Biology","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This pursuit is complicated by the difficulties of mapping functional roles and interactions onto communities with immense taxonomic diversity and of identifying the scale at which microbes interact [1]. To address this challenge, here, we focused on the bacterial communities that colonize and degrade particulate organic matter in the ocean [2, 3, 4]. We show that the assembly of these communities can be simplified as a linear combination of functional modules. Using synthetic polysaccharide particles immersed in natural bacterioplankton assemblages [1, 5], we showed that successional particle colonization dynamics are driven by the interaction of two types of modules: a first type made of narrowly specialized primary degraders, whose dynamics are controlled by particle polysaccharide composition, and a second type containing substrate-independent taxa whose dynamics are controlled by interspecific interactions—in particular, cross-feeding via organic acids, amino acids, and other metabolic byproducts. We show that, as a consequence of this trophic structure, communities can assemble modularly—i.e., by a simple sum of substrate-specific primary degrader modules, one for each complex polysaccharide in the particle, connected to a single broad-niche range consumer module. Consistent with this model, a linear combination of the communities on single-polysaccharide particles accurately predicts community composition on mixed-polysaccharide particles. Our results suggest that the assembly of heterotrophic communities that degrade complex organic materials follows simple design principles that could be exploited to engineer heterotrophic microbiomes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000341313","0960-9822||1879-0445",,"10.1016/j.cub.2019.03.047","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/341313","en","Cell Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Modular Assembly of Polysaccharide-Degrading Marine Microbial Communities","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-05-09T00:53:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064877364",,"000467138100028","Curr Biol","9","Current Biology","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we aim to investigate sapwood‐to‐stem proportions and differences therein between tree genera and derive a sapwood biomass map. Location  Northern Hemisphere boreal and temperate forests. Time period  2010. Major taxa studied  Twenty‐five common tree genera. Methods  First, we develop a theoretical framework to estimate sapwood biomass for a given stem biomass by applying relationships between sapwood cross‐sectional area (CSA) and stem CSA and between stem CSA and stem biomass. These measurements are extracted from a biomass and allometry database (BAAD), an extensive literature review and our own studies. The established allometric relationships are applied to a remote sensing‐based stem biomass product in order to derive a spatially continuous sapwood biomass map. The application of new products on the distribution of stand density and tree genera facilitates the synergy of satellite and forest inventory data. Results  Sapwood‐to‐stem CSA relationships can be modelled with moderate to very high modelling efficiency for different genera. The total estimated sapwood biomass equals 12.87 ± 6.56 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in boreal (mean carbon density: 1.13 ± 0.58 kgC m−2) and 15.80 ± 9.10 PgC in temperate (2.03 ± 1.17 kgC m−2) forests. Spatial patterns of sapwood‐to‐stem biomass proportions are crucially driven by the distribution of genera (spanning from 20–30% in Larix to > 70% in Pinus and Betula forests). Main conclusions  The presented sapwood biomass map will be the basis for large‐scale estimates of plant respiration and transpiration. The enormous spatial differences in sapwood biomass proportions reveal the need to consider the functionally more important sapwood instead of the entire stem biomass in global carbon and water cycle studies. Alterations in tree species distribution, induced by forest management or climate change, can strongly affect the available sapwood biomass even if stem biomass remains unchanged.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000340610","1466-822X||1466-8238",,"10.1111/geb.12883","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340610","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","biomass allometry||boreal forest||heartwood biomass||sapwood biomass||sapwood cross‐sectional area||stand density||stem biomass||temperate forest||tree species distribution","Sapwood biomass carbon in northern boreal and temperate forests","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-05-04T01:09:21Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85062325786",,"000465964000008","Glob.

Model forecasting error (FE) is the usual measure of success; however model predictions provide no insights into the potential for improvement. In short, the realized predictability of a specific model is uninformative about whether the system is inherently predictable or whether the chosen model is a poor match for the system and our observations thereof. Ideally, model proficiency would be judged with respect to the systems’ intrinsic predictability, the highest achievable predictability given the degree to which system dynamics are the result of deterministic vs. stochastic processes. Intrinsic predictability may be quantified with permutation entropy (PE), a model‐free, information‐theoretic measure of the complexity of a time series. By means of simulations, we show that a correlation exists between estimated PE and FE and show how stochasticity, process error, and chaotic dynamics affect the relationship. This relationship is verified for a data set of 461 empirical ecological time series. We show how deviations from the expected PE–FE relationship are related to covariates of data quality and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics. These results demonstrate a theoretically grounded basis for a model‐free evaluation of a system's intrinsic predictability. Identifying the gap between the intrinsic and realized predictability of time series will enable researchers to understand whether forecasting proficiency is limited by the quality and quantity of their data or the ability of the chosen forecasting model to explain the data. Intrinsic predictability also provides a model‐free baseline of forecasting proficiency against which modeling efforts can be evaluated.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000393006","0012-9615||1557-7015||1741-7015",,"10.1002/ecm.1359","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/393006","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Empirical dynamic modelling||Forecasting||Information theory||Permutation entropy||Population dynamics||Time series analysis","The intrinsic predictability of ecological time series and its potential to guide forecasting","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-22T10:59:12Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecol. monogr.","2","Ecological Monographs","89","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite the economic importance of these highly specialized pathogens, many aspects of their biology remain obscure, largely because rust fungi are obligate biotrophs. The rise of genomics and advances in high-throughput sequencing technology have presented new options for identifying candidate effector genes involved in pathogenicity mechanisms of rust fungi. Transcriptome analysis and integrated bioinformatics tools have led to the identification of key genetic determinants of host susceptibility to infection by rusts. Thousands of genes encoding secreted proteins highly expressed during host infection have been reported for different rust species, which represents significant potential towards understanding rust effector function. Recent high-throughput in planta expression screen approaches (effectoromics) have pushed the field ahead even further towards predicting high-priority effectors and identifying avirulence genes.

Two alternative models outline how new microsatellite alleles evolve. Infinite alleles model (IAM) assumes that all possible alleles are equally likely to result from a mutation, while stepwise mutation model (SMM) describes microsatellite evolution as stepwise adding or subtracting single repeat units. Genetic relationships between individuals can be analyzed in higher precision when assuming the SMM scenario with allele size differences as a proxy of genetic distance. If population structure is not predetermined in advance, an empirical data analysis usually includes (a) estimating proximity between individual SSR profiles with a selected dissimilarity measure and (b) determining putative genetic structure of a given set of individuals using methods of clustering and/or ordination for the obtained dissimilarity matrix. We developed new dissimilarity indices between SSR profiles of haploid, diploid, or polyploid organisms assuming different mutation models and compared the performance of these indices for determining genetic structure with population data and with simulations. More specifically, we compared SMM with a constant or variable mutation rate at different SSR loci to IAM using data from natural populations of a freshwater bryozoan Cristatella mucedo (diploid), wheat leaf rust Puccinia triticina (dikaryon), and wheat powdery mildew Blumeria graminis (monokaryon). We show that inferences about population genetic structure are sensitive to the assumed mutation model. With simulations, we found that Bruvo's distance performs generally poorly, while the new metrics are capturing the differences in the genetic structure of the populations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000340549","2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.5032","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340549","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bruvo's distance||genetic dissimilarity of individuals||infinite alleles model||population structure||SSR markers||stepwise mutation model","Dissimilarity of individual microsatellite profiles under different mutation models: Empirical approach","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-05-04T00:48:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064516184",,"000465089500030","Ecol Evol","7","Ecology and Evolution","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The evolutionarily young Silene acaulis species complex consists of perennial alpine cushion plants with an almost circumpolar distribution across the northern hemisphere. The different species of the Silene acaulis complex show different geographic distributions, edaphic preferences, genome sizes or sex system evolution levels. In the European Alps at least two distinct species co-exist in sympatry, S. acaulis and S. exscapa. The two species are adapted to different soil and bedrock types, i.e. calcareous and siliceous, respectively. Additionally, the two species have evolved different sex systems, trioecious and dioecious, respectively. The different sex systems might be a by-product of local edaphic adaption or might be a by-product or even a driver of speciation. This species complex therefore is an ideal model system to study the genomic signatures of local adaption, speciation and early stages of sex-chromosomes evolution as well as their interactions. To get a first impression of genomic variation within this species complex, I genetically screened 400 individuals from the Swiss Alps, Norway, Svalbard and Greenland. I used flow cytometry to infer genome size differences among the species, which might be linked to the evolution of young sex chromosomes. Then, I used ddRADseq, an NGS approach ideal for non-model organism with large genomes, to explore population genetic structure, species delimitation and sex chromosome evolution. The different species have also been phenotyped using plants grown in a common garden experiment and herbarium specimens. Finally, I have started assembling the 1.5 Gbp genome using the Oxford NanoPore long read sequencing technology. Together, the different analyses suggest that the Silene acaulis species complex consist of several well- separated species of very young origin and hybridization events, both historical and recent, are important for the evolution of these species and their divergent sex chromosome systems.",,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/386020","en",,,,,"Evolutionary genomics in the Alpine and Holarctic Silene acaulis species complex","Presentation","Metadata only",,,"2019-12-17T09:44:53Z",,,,"yes","Seminar at the University of Salzburg","March 15, 2019","Salzburg, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A common way for bacteria to acquire this nutrient is through the secretion of siderophores, which are secondary metabolites that scavenge iron from environmental stocks and deliver it to cells via specific receptors. While there has been tremendous interest in understanding the molecular basis of siderophore synthesis, uptake and regulation, questions about the ecological and evolutionary consequences of siderophore secretion have only recently received increasing attention. In this Review, we outline how eco-evolutionary questions can complement the mechanistic perspective and help to obtain a more integrated view of siderophores. In particular, we explain how secreted diffusible siderophores can affect other community members, leading to cooperative, exploitative and competitive interactions between individuals. These social interactions in turn can spur co-evolutionary arms races between strains and species, lead to ecological dependencies between them and potentially contribute to the formation of stable communities. In brief, this Review shows that siderophores are much more than just iron carriers: they are important mediators of interactions between members of microbial assemblies and the eukaryotic hosts they inhabit.",,,"1740-1526||1740-1534",,"10.1038/s41579-019-0284-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551358","en","Nature",,,"Bacterial evolution||Bacterial pathogenesis||Bacterial physiology||Bacterial secretion","Bacterial siderophores in community and host interactions","Review Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-06-08T11:14:49Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85075344886",,"000514142000006","Nat Rev Microbiol","3","Nature Reviews Microbiology","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Functional trait studies in the plant and animal literature have burgeoned in the past 20 years, highlighting a need for standardized ways to measure ecologically meaningful traits across taxa and ecosystems. However, standardized measurements of functional traits are lacking for many organisms and ecosystems, including fungi. Basidiomycete wood fungi occur in all forest ecosystems world-wide, where they are decomposers and also provide food or habitat for other species, or act as tree pathogens. Despite their major role in the functioning of forest ecosystems, the understanding and application of functional traits in studies of communities of wood fungi lags behind other disciplines. As the research field of fungal functional ecology is growing, there is a need for standardized ways to measure fungal traits within and across taxa and spatial scales. This handbook reviews pre-existing fungal trait measurements, proposes new core fungal traits, discusses trait ecology in fungi and highlights areas for future work on basidiomycete wood fungi. We propose standard and potential future methodologies for collecting traits to be used across studies, ensuring replicability and fostering between-study comparison. Combining concepts from fungal ecology and functional trait ecology, methodologies covered here can be related to fungal performance within a community and environmental setting. This manuscript is titled “a start with” as we only cover a subset of the fungal community here, with the aim of encouraging and facilitating the writing of handbooks for other members of the macrofungal community, for example, mycorrhizal fungi.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000316428","0269-8463||1365-2435",,"10.1111/1365-2435.13239","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316428","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","characteristics||community ecology||lignicolous||methods||protocols","Handbook for the measurement of macrofungal functional traits: a start with basidiomycete wood fungi","Review Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-16T14:59:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85058842269",,"000460189400001","Funct.

A new generic delimitation of Rostania is thus proposed, in which the genus is monophyletic, and three species (Rostania coccophylla, R. paramensis, R. quadrifida) are excluded and transferred to other genera. Rostania occultata is further non-monophyletic, and a more detailed investigation of species delimitations in Rostania s. str. is needed.

One factor thought to be potentially important is demographic stochasticity. Here we provide a general theoretical analysis of the role of demographic stochasticity in social evolution. We show that the evolutionary impact of stochasticity depends on how the social action alters the recipient’s life cycle. If the action alters the recipient’s death rate, then demographic stochasticity always favours altruism and disfavours spite. On the other hand, if the action alters the recipient’s birth rate, then stochasticity can either favour or disfavour both altruism and spite depending on the ratio of the rate of population turnover to the population size. Finally, we also show that this ratio is critical to determining if demographic stochasticity can reverse the direction of selection upon social traits. Our analysis thus provides a general understanding of the role of demographic stochasticity in social evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000325765","1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006739","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/325765","en","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Social evolution under demographic stochasticity","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-02-18T12:47:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85061596202",,"000460276500021","PLOS comput. biol.","2","PLoS Computational Biology","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This cost of resistance is expected to be a key parameter for understanding how resistance spreads and persists in pathogen populations. Analysis of individual resistance alleles from laboratory evolution and natural isolates has shown they are typically costly, but these costs are highly variable and influenced by genetic variation at other loci. It therefore remains unclear how strongly resistance is linked to impaired antibiotic-free growth in bacteria from natural and clinical scenarios, where resistance alleles are likely to coincide with other types of genetic variation. To investigate this, we measured the growth of 92 natural and clinical Escherichia coli isolates across three antibiotic-free environments. We then tested whether variation of antibiotic-free growth among isolates was predicted by their resistance to 10 antibiotics, while accounting for the phylogenetic structure of the data. We found that isolates with similar resistance profiles had similar antibiotic-free growth profiles, but it was not simply that higher average resistance was associated with impaired growth. Next, we used whole-genome sequences to identify antibiotic resistance genes and found that isolates carrying a greater number of resistance gene types grew relatively poorly in antibiotic-free conditions, even when the resistance genes they carried were different. This suggests that the resistance of bacterial pathogens is linked to growth costs in nature, but it is the total genetic burden and multivariate resistance phenotype that predict these costs, rather than individual alleles or mean resistance across antibiotics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000326332","0099-2240||1098-5336",,"10.1128/AEM.02111-18","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/326332","en","American Society for Microbiology","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Escherichia coli||fitness||antibiotic resistance","Resistance Gene Carriage Predicts Growth of Natural and Clinical Escherichia coli Isolates in the Absence of Antibiotics","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-02-20T05:48:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85061990412",,"000457934800004","Appl.

IRES are widespread, abundant and increasing in extent, but developing biomonitoring programmes to determine their ecological quality is challenging. To date, quality assessments have focused on the aquatic organisms present during wet phases, whereas dry-phase communities remain poorly characterized. We examined multiple biotic groups present in dry IRES channels, to compare assemblages at sites impacted and unimpacted by human activity and to evaluate the potential of each group as an ecological quality indicator. We explored existing, unpublished data for three biotic groups: an aquatic microflora (diatoms), an aquatic fauna (the invertebrate ‘seedbank’), and a mixed flora (aquatic and terrestrial plants); notably, we did not source data for terrestrial assemblages with high potential to act as indicators. Diatom and plant assemblage composition differed between impacted and unimpacted sites, and the latter assemblages were more diverse and included more indicator taxa. Invertebrate seedbank taxa richness was higher at unimpacted sites but compositional differences were not detected, probably due to the coarse taxonomic resolution to which abundant taxa were identified. Performance of standard indices of ecological quality was variable, but differences were identified between impacted and unimpacted conditions for all biotic groups. Our results can inform the enhancement of biomonitoring programmes designed to characterize IRES ecological quality in relation to legislative targets. We highlight the need to integrate wet- and dry-phase survey data in holistic quality assessments. Although we suggest diatoms, aquatic plants and the aquatic invertebrate seedbank as having the potential to inform assessment of dry-phase ecological quality, we highlight the need for research to further characterize these aquatic groups and, crucially, to explore terrestrial assemblages with high potential to act as dry-phase quality indicators.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000316077","1470-160X||1872-7034",,"10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.09.061","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316077","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bioassessment||Bioindication||Ecological status assessment||Dry riverbeds||Flow intermittence||River condition||Temporary rivers and streams","A comparison of biotic groups as dry-phase indicators of ecological quality in intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-15T15:41:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecological Indicators","97","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Our current understanding of family life, however, is almost exclusively based on studies that (i) focus on parental care and associated family interactions (such as those arising from sibling rivalry and parent-offspring conflict), and (ii) investigate these phenomena in the advanced family systems of mammals, birds, and eusocial insects. Here, we argue that these historical biases have fostered the neglect of key processes shaping social life in ancestral family systems, and thus profoundly hamper our understanding of the (early) evolution of family life. Based on a comprehensive survey of the literature, we first illustrate that the strong focus on parental care in advanced social systems has deflected scrutiny of other important social processes such as sibling cooperation, parent–offspring competition and offspring assistance. We then show that accounting for these neglected processes – and their changing role over time – could profoundly alter our understanding of the origin and subsequent evolution of family life. Finally, we outline how this ‘diachronic’ perspective on the evolution of family living provides novel insights into general processes driving the evolution of animal sociality. Overall, we infer that the explicit consideration of thus-far neglected facets of family life, together with their study across the whole diversity of family systems, are crucial to advance our understanding of the processes that shape the evolution of social life.",,,"1469-185X||1464-7931||0006-3231",,"10.1111/brv.12443","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551348","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,,"family life||parental care||group-living||evolutionary transition||sociality||precocial||altricial||parent–offspring conflict||sibling rivalry||sexual conflict","The other facets of family life and their role in the evolution of animal sociality","Review Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-06-08T11:08:20Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85050594958",,"000456071400010","Biol Rev,","1","Biological Reviews","94","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For example, they have been widely used for the study of ecological and biogeographic questions, testing hypotheses regarding patterns of community assembly, species co-occurrence and biodiversity. However, to our knowledge we remain without a general and flexible approach to study the mechanisms explaining such structures. Here, we provide a method for generating ‘correlation-informed’ null models, which combine the classic concept of null models and tools from community ecology, like joint statistical modelling. Generally, this model allows us to assess whether the information encoded within any given correlation matrix is predictive for explaining structural patterns observed within an incidence matrix. To demonstrate its utility, we apply our approach to two different case studies that represent examples of common scenarios encountered in community ecology. First, we use a phylogenetically informed null model to detect a strong evolutionary fingerprint within empirically observed food webs, reflecting key differences in the impact of shared evolutionary history when shaping the interactions of predators or prey. Second, we use multiple informed null models to identify which factors determine structural patterns of species assemblages, focusing in on the study of nestedness and the influence of site size, isolation, species range and species richness. In addition to offering a versatile way to study the mechanisms shaping the structure of any incidence matrix, including those describing ecological communities, our approach can also be adapted further to test even more sophisticated hypotheses.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000394379","1742-5689||1742-5662",,"10.1098/rsif.2018.0747","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/394379","en","Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Null models||ecological networks||Species assemblages||structural patterns||Network motifs||nestedness","Unmasking structural patterns in incidence matrices: an application to ecological data","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-27T13:36:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"J.

In addition, they are capable of invading and killing agriculturally important plant pest insects that makes them promising candidates for biocontrol applications. Here we assessed the role of type VI secretion system (T6SS) components of type strain CHA0 during interaction with larvae of the cabbage pest Pieris brassicae. We show that the T6SS core apparatus and two VgrG modules, encompassing the respective T6SS spikes (VgrG1a and VgrG1b) and associated effectors (RhsA and Ghh 1), contribute significantly to insect pathogenicity of P. protegens in oral infection assays but not when bacteria are injected directly into the hemolymph. Monitoring of the colonization levels of P. protegens in the gut, hemolymph, and excrements of the insect larvae revealed that the invader relies on T6SS and VgrG1a module function to promote hemocoel invasion. A 16S metagenomic analysis demonstrated that T6SS-supported invasion by P. protegens induces significant changes in the insect gut microbiome affecting notably Enterobacteriaceae, a dominant group of the commensal gut bacteria. Our study supports the concept that pathogens deploy T6SS-based strategies to disrupt the commensal microbiota in order to promote host colonization and pathogenesis.",,,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-019-0353-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340292","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"T6SS contributes to gut microbiome invasion and killing of an herbivorous pest insect by plant-beneficial Pseudomonas protegens","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2019-05-02T01:12:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060649608",,"000464960400016","ISME J","5","The ISME Journal","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The diversity and distribution of non-photosynthetic cyanobacteria (NCY) across aquatic environments are currently unknown, including their ecology. Here, we report about composition and phylogenetic diversity of two clades of NCY in ten lakes of the European peri-Alpine region, over the past ∼100 years. Using 16S rDNA sequences obtained from dated sediment cores, we found almost equal proportion of taxa assigned to Melainabacteria and the deepest-branching group Sericytochromatia (ML635J-21) (63 total detected taxa). The topology of our reconstructed phylogenies reflected evolutionary relationships expected from previous work, that is, a clear separation between the deepest branching Sericytochromatia, the Melainabacteria, and the photosynthetic cyanobacteria clades. While different lakes harbored distinct NCY communities, the diversity of NCY assemblages within and between lakes (alpha and beta diversity) did not significantly change over the last century. This is in contrast with what was previously reported for photosynthetic cyanobacteria. Unchanged community phylogenetic similarity over geographic distance indicated no dispersal limitation of NCY at the regional scale. Our results solicit studies linking in-lake environmental factors to the composition of these microorganisms’ communities, whose assembly appeared not to have been influenced by large-scale anthropogenic environmental changes. This is the first attempt to study the diversity and distribution of NCY taxa across temperate lakes. It provides a first step towards understanding their distribution and ecological function in pelagic aquatic habitats, where these organisms seem to be prevalent.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000320053","1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2018.03344","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/320053","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Melainabacteria||ML635J-21||Sericytochromatia||metabarcoding||sedimentary DNA||distance-decay relationship||meta-community||Anthropocene","Long Term Diversity and Distribution of Non-photosynthetic Cyanobacteria in Peri-Alpine Lakes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-26T15:32:27Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000455629400001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, the extent of intraspecific variation in defense investment along elevation gradients, and its effects on both herbivore preference and performance, remain relatively unexplored. Using populations of Arabidopsis halleri (Brassicaceae) occurring at different elevations in the Alps, we tested for associations between elevation, herbivore damage in the field, and constitutive chemical defense traits (glucosinolates) assayed under common-garden conditions. Additionally, we examined the feeding preferences and performance of a specialist herbivore, the butterfly Pieris brassicae, on plants from different elevations in the Alps. Although we found no effect of elevation on the overall levels of constitutive glucosinolates in leaves, relative amounts of indole glucosinolates increased significantly with elevation and were negatively correlated with herbivore damage in the field. In oviposition preference assays, P. brassicae females laid fewer eggs on plants from high-elevation populations, although larval performance was similar on populations from different elevations. Taken together, these results support the prediction that species distributed along elevation gradients exhibit genetic variation in chemical defenses, which can have consequences for interactions with herbivores in the field.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000314722","1422-0067",,"10.3390/ijms20010174","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/314722","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Elevation gradient||Herbivore preference||GLUCOSINOLATES (BIOCHEMISTRY)||Oviposition preference||Defense||Arabidopsis halleri||Pieris brassicae","Divergence in Glucosinolate Profiles between High- and Low-Elevation Populations of <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> Correspond to Variation in Field Herbivory and Herbivore Behavioral Preferences","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-10T08:02:11Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"52449931",,,"85059689782",,"000459747700174","Int. j. mol. sci.","1","International Journal of Molecular Sciences","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Variation in and controls of processing rates, however, are poorly characterized at the global scale. In response, we used a peer-sourced research network and a highly standardized carbon processing assay to conduct a global-scale field experiment in greater than 1000 river and riparian sites. We found that Earth’s biomes have distinct carbon processing signatures. Slow processing is evident across latitudes, whereas rapid rates are restricted to lower latitudes. Both the mean rate and variability decline with latitude, suggesting temperature constraints toward the poles and greater roles for other environmental drivers (e.g., nutrient loading) toward the equator. These results and data set the stage for unprecedented “next-generation biomonitoring” by establishing baselines to help quantify environmental impacts to the functioning of ecosystems at a global scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000392994","2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.aav0486","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/392994","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Global patterns and drivers of ecosystem functioning in rivers and riparian zones","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-22T10:57:21Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sci Adv","1","Science Advances","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Its subterranean larval stages are hard to reach with pesticides and it has evolved resistance to conventional management practices. The application of beneficial soil organisms is being considered as a sustainable and environmental friendly alternative. In a previous study, the combined application in wheat fields of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, entomopathogenic Pseudomonas bacteria, and entomopathogenic nematodes was found to promote growth and protection against a natural pest infestation, without negative cross effects. Because of the insect-killing capacity of the bacteria and nematodes, we hypothesized that the application of these organisms would have similar or even greater beneficial effects in WCR-infested maize fields. During three consecutive years (2015–2017), we conducted trials in Missouri (USA) in which we applied the three organisms, alone or in combinations, in plots that were artificially infested with WCR and in non-infested control plots. For two of the three trials, we found that in plots treated with entomopathogenic nematodes and/or entomopathogenic Pseudomonas bacteria, roots were less damaged than the roots of plants in control plots. During one year, WCR survival was significantly lower in plots treated with Pseudomonas than in control plots, and the surviving larvae that were recovered from these plots were lighter. The bacterial and nematodes treatments also enhanced yield, assessed as total grain weight, in one of the trials. The effects of the treatments varied considerable among the three years, but they were always positive for the plants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000330427","2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-019-39753-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/330427","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Protecting maize from rootworm damage with the combined application of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Pseudomonas bacteria and entomopathogenic nematodes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-03-11T11:43:35Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85062350571",,"000459897600061","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

BAMs have been extensively studied in Arabidopsis thaliana where they show a surprising level of complexity in terms of specialization within the different isoforms as well as regulatory functions played by at least three catalytically inactive members. Despite the importance of BAMs and the fact that multiple BAM proteins are also present in other angiosperms, little is known about their phylogenetic history or functional relationship.  Results Here, we examined 961 β-amylase sequences from 136 different algae and land plant species, including 66 sequenced genomes and many transcriptomes. The extraordinary number and the diversity of organisms examined allowed us to reconstruct the main patterns of β-amylase evolution in land plants. We identified eight distinct clades in angiosperms, which results from extensive gene duplications and sub- or neo-functionalization. We discovered a novel clade of BAM, absent in Arabidopsis, which we called BAM10. BAM10 emerged before the radiation of seed plants and has the feature of an inactive enzyme. Furthermore, we report that BAM4 – an important protein regulating Arabidopsis starch metabolism – is absent in many relevant starch-accumulating crop species, suggesting that starch degradation may be differently regulated between species.  Conclusions BAM proteins originated sometime more than 400 million years ago and expanded together with the differentiation of plants into organisms of increasing complexity. Our phylogenetic analyses provide essential insights for future functional studies of this important class of storage glucan hydrolases and regulatory proteins.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000331222","1471-2148",,"10.1186/s12862-019-1395-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/331222","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Green plants||Phylogenetic analysis||β-Amylase||Gene duplication||Functional diversification||Starch","The evolution of functional complexity within the -amylase gene family in land plants","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-03-14T04:32:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000459964400002","BMC evol. biol.",,"BMC Evolutionary Biology","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02030 - Dep.

Although embryonic gene expression can have lasting effects on developmental trajectories, few studies consider the role of maternal effects, such as egg size, on gene expression. Using qPCR, we characterize relative expression of 14 growth and/or skeletal promoting genes across embryonic development in Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). We test to what extent their relative expression is correlated with egg size and size at early life-stages within the study population. We predict smaller individuals to have higher expression of growth and skeletal promoting genes, due to less maternal resources (i.e., yolk) and prioritization of energy toward ossification. We found expression levels to vary across developmental stages and only three genes (Mmp9, Star, and Sgk1) correlated with individual size at a given developmental stage. Contrary to our hypothesis, expression of Mmp9 and Star showed a non-linear relationship with size (at post fertilization and hatching, respectively), whilst Sgk1 was higher in larger embryos at hatching. Interestingly, these genes are also associated with craniofacial divergence of Arctic charr morphs. Our results indicate that early life-stage variation in gene expression, concomitant to maternal effects, can influence developmental plasticity and potentially the evolution of resource polymorphism in fishes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000316048","1520-541X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316048||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/317566","10.1111/ede.12275","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/323653","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Gene expression in the phenotypically plastic Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus): A focus on growth and ossification at early stages of development","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-15T15:37:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85057443302",,"000455554800002","Evolut. develop.","1","Evolution & Development","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Following egg hatch, larval flies consume fungal tissue and spores. Thus, Epichloë individuals with traits that limit larval consumption could be at a selective advantage. We assessed Botanophila fly larvae from sites within the United States and Europe for infection by the bacterial sexual parasite Wolbachia through amplification of the Wolbachia surface protein gene (wsp). Nearly 70% of fly larvae in our samples were infected by Wolbachia. This is the first record of infection by Wolbachia within Botanophila and could have far reaching effects on not only the fly host, but also the Epichloë fungi upon which Botanophila feeds as well as the grass host within which the fungi live. For example, infection by Wolbachia could limit consumption of Epichloë spores by Botanophila larvae if the bacteria promoted premature larval death.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000328708",,,"10.1080/21501203.2018.1515119","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/328708","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Ascomycota||Diptera||Fungal endophytes||sexual parasite","Botanophila flies, vectors of Epichloë fungal spores, are infected by Wolbachia","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-03-04T03:50:33Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85053246906",,,,"1","Mycology","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Morphological transitions are one of the least understood of the many strategies employed by fungal plant pathogens to adapt to constantly changing environments, even though different morphotypes may play important biological roles. Here, we first show that blastospores (the “yeast-like” form of the pathogen typically known only under laboratory conditions) can form from germinated pycnidiospores (asexual spores) on the surface of wheat leaves, suggesting that this morphotype can play an important role in the natural history of Z. tritici. Next, we characterized the morphological responses of this fungus to a series of environmental stresses to understand the effects of changing environments on fungal morphology and adaptation. All tested stresses induced morphological changes, but different responses were found among four strains. We discovered that Z. tritici forms chlamydospores and demonstrated that these structures are better able to survive extreme cold, heat and drought than other cell types. Finally, a transcriptomic analysis showed that morphogenesis and the expression of virulence factors are co-regulated in this pathogen. Our findings illustrate how changing environmental conditions can affect cellular morphology and lead to the formation of new morphotypes, with each morphotype having a potential impact on both pathogen survival and disease epidemiology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000353672","2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-019-45994-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/353672","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Morphological changes in response to environmental stresses in the fungal plant pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-07-17T18:35:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85069268126",,"000473610500005","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The important forest pest Lymantria dispar (gypsy moth) has three recognised subspecies: the European, Asian, and Japanese gypsy moth. Unlike the other two subspecies, the European subspecies is characterised by a loss of female flight ability, which might impose a selective pressure on larvae to actively engage in host-plant selection. We therefore explored the interactions of early-instar larvae from laboratory colonies of each subspecies with four potential hosts of differing quality: oak, beech, maple, and pine—measuring larval survival and performance, feeding preferences, responses to host-derived odour cues, and the propensity to disperse from hosts via ballooning. Compared to larvae from the Asian and Japanese subspecies, larvae from the (American-originated) European gypsy moth colony exhibited (i) significantly lower survival on the poorest quality host (pine), (ii) an ability to discriminate among hosts via olfactory cues; and (iii) higher propensity to disperse from sub-optimal hosts. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that larvae from flightless female European Gypsy moth subspecies play a more active role in host-plant selection.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000351253","2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-019-45201-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/351253","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Divergent behavioural responses of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) caterpillars from three different subspecies to potential host trees","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-07-04T02:17:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85067622259",,"000472137700049","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The primary benefits of such outer membrane exchange (OME) in natural populations are unclear, but in some OME interactions, transferred OM content can include SitA toxins that kill OME participants lacking an appropriate immunity gene. Such OME-dependent toxin transfer across Myxococcus xanthus strains that differ only in their sitBAI toxin/antitoxin cassette can mediate inter-strain killing and generate colony-merger incompatibilities (CMIs)–inter-colony border phenotypes between distinct genotypes that differ from respective self-self colony interfaces. Here we ask whether OME-dependent toxin transfer is a common cause of prevalent CMIs and antagonisms between M. xanthus natural isolates identical at TraA. We disrupted traA in eleven isolates from a cm-scale soil population and assayed whether traA disruption eliminated or reduced CMIs between swarming colonies or antagonisms between strains in mixed cultures. Among 33 isolate pairs identical at traA that form clear CMIs, in no case did functional disruption of traA in one partner detectably alter CMI phenotypes. Further, traA disruption did not alleviate strong antagonisms observed during starvation-induced fruiting-body development in seven pairs of strains identical at traA. Collectively, our results suggest that most mechanisms of interference competition and inter-colony kin discrimination in natural populations of myxobacteria do not require OME. Finally, our experiments also indicate that several closely related laboratory reference strains kill some natural isolates by toxins delivered by a shared, OME-independent type VI secretion system (T6SS), suggesting that some antagonisms between sympatric natural isolates may also involve T6SS toxins.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000394428","1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0224817","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/394428","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Kin discrimination and outer membrane exchange in Myxococcus xanthus: Experimental analysis of a natural population","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-27T14:38:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000533896400019","PLoS ONE","11","PLoS ONE","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we investigate genetic diversity, spontaneous mutation rate and Ne in the giant duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza). Despite its large census population size, whole-genome sequencing of 68 globally sampled individuals reveals extremely low intraspecific genetic diversity. Assessed under natural conditions, the genome-wide spontaneous mutation rate is at least seven times lower than estimates made for other multicellular eukaryotes, whereas Ne is large. These results demonstrate that low genetic diversity can be associated with large-Ne species, where selection can reduce mutation rates to very low levels. This study also highlights that accurate estimates of mutation rate can help to explain seemingly unexpected patterns of genome-wide variation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000334546","2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-019-09235-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/334546","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Low genetic variation is associated with low mutation rate in the giant duckweed","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-03-29T04:06:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85063034332",,"000461757000001","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The ability of organisms to cope with these environmental changes can, however, depend on their genetic properties. For instance, genetic load owing to inbreeding could alter organisms’ responses to climate change-mediated environmental changes but such effects are often overlooked. We investigated the effects of an experimental heat wave (25°C versus 15°C) on life history (reproduction, size) and constitutive immune defence traits (phenoloxidase-like and antibacterial activity of haemolymph) in relation to inbreeding by manipulating the mating type (outcrossing, self-fertilization) in two populations of a hermaphroditic freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. High temperature increased reproduction and size of snails but impaired their immune function. In one of the two study populations, inbreeding reduced reproductive output of snails indicating inbreeding depression. Furthermore, this effect did not depend on the temperature snails were exposed to. Our results suggest that L. stagnalis snails can be negatively affected by inbreeding but it may not alter their responses to heat waves.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000366476","1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0220669","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/366476","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Inbreeding does not alter the response to an experimental heat wave in a freshwater snail","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-09-26T02:21:27Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000485002500050","PLoS ONE","8","PLoS ONE","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we used 16S rDNA sequence data from lake sediments to test for community assembly patterns in cyanobacterial phylogenies across ten European peri-Alpine lakes and over a century of eutrophication and climate warming. We studied phylogenetic similarity in cyanobacterial assemblages over spatial and temporal distance, and over environmental gradients, comparing detected patterns with theoretical expectations from deterministic and stochastic processes. We found limited evidence for deviation of lake communities from a random assembly model and no significant effects of geographic distance on phylogenetic similarity, suggesting no dispersal limitation and high levels of stochastic assembly. We detected a weak influence of phosphorus, but no significant effect of nitrogen levels on deviation of community phylogenies from random. We found however a significant decay of phylogenetic similarity for non-random communities over a gradient of air temperature and water column stability. We show how phylogenetic data from sedimentary archives can improve our understanding of microbial community assembly processes, and support previous evidence that climate warming has been the strongest environmental driver of cyanobacterial community assembly over the past century.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000344049","2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-019-43814-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/344049","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"High dispersal levels and lake warming are emergent drivers of cyanobacterial community assembly in peri-Alpine lakes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-05-25T02:43:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85065774824",,"000467839800037","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The inundative application of an entomopathogenic fungal strain in biological control results in high densities of fungal propagules in the soil which can potentially affect soil microbial communities and their multiple functions in soil. The objective of the present study was to assess potential effects of M. brunneum on soil fungal and prokaryotic communities in a pot experiment over a time course of 4 months using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of ribosomal markers. The application of M. brunneum formulated as fungus colonised barley kernels (FCBK) led to a significant increase of the applied strain in soil, as assessed by cultivation-dependent (plating on selective medium followed by genotyping of Metarhizium isolates) and cultivation-independent (HTS of ribosomal markers) approaches. Data revealed that soil fungal and prokaryotic community structures did not change after the application of M. brunneum. Temporal changes of the fungal and prokaryotic communities were observed and the prokaryotic communities showed minor changes to barley kernels (BK), the matrix of the formulation. Results of this study are in accordance with other investigations lacking any evidence for adverse effects on microbial communities caused by applied entomopathogenic fungi.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000338806",,,"10.1080/09583157.2019.1566953","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338806","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Inoculation||Western corn rootworm||non-target effects||inundative application||pot experiment","Response of soil microbial communities to the application of a formulated Metarhizium brunneum biocontrol strain","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-04-19T01:44:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060016303",,"000463790000003",,"6","Biocontrol Science and Technology","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

One widespread method is to combine antibiotics with synergistically acting adjuvants that inhibit resistance mechanisms, allowing drug killing. Here we use co-amoxiclav (a clinically important combination of the β-lactam antibiotic amoxicillin and the β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanate) to ask whether treatment efficacy and resistance evolution can be decoupled via component dosing modifications. A simple mathematical model predicts that different ratios of these two drug components can produce distinct evolutionary responses irrespective of the initial efficacy. We test this hypothesis by selecting Escherichia coli with a plasmid-encoded β-lactamase (CTX-M-14), against different concentrations of amoxicillin and clavulanate. Consistent with our theory, we found that while resistance evolved under all conditions, the component ratio influenced both the rate and mechanism of resistance evolution. Specifically, we found that the current clinical practice of high amoxicillin-to-clavulanate ratios resulted in the most rapid adaptation to antibiotics via gene dosing responses. Increased plasmid copy number allowed E. coli to increase β-lactamase dosing and effectively titrate out low quantities of clavulanate, restoring amoxicillin resistance. In contrast, high clavulanate ratios were more robust—plasmid copy number did not increase, although porin or efflux resistance mechanisms were found, as for all drug ratios. Our results indicate that by changing the ratio of adjuvant to antibiotic we can slow and steer the path of resistance evolution. We therefore suggest using increased adjuvant dosing regimens to slow the rate of resistance evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000366519","2150-7511||2161-2129",,"10.1128/mBio.01831-19","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/366519","en","American Society for Microbiology","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","antimicrobial chemotherapy||adjuvants||antibiotic resistance||antimicrobial combinations||beta-lactamases||evolution||plasmid-mediated resistance","Modified Antibiotic Adjuvant Ratios Can Slow and Steer the Evolution of Resistance: Co-amoxiclav as a Case Study","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-09-26T02:42:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85072290599",,"000493915800033",,"5","mBio","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

During the dry phase, channels of IRES consist mainly of dry riverbeds (DRBs), prevalent yet widely unexplored ecotones between dry and wet phases that can strongly influence the biogeochemistry of fluvial networks. DRBs are often overlooked because they do not strictly belong to either domain of soil or freshwater science. Due to this dual character of DRBs, we suggest that concepts and knowledge from soil science can be used to expand the understanding of IRES biogeochemistry. Based on this idea, we propose that DRBs can be conceptually understood as early stage soils exhibiting many similarities with soils through two main forces: i) time since last sediment transport event, and ii) the development status of stabilizing structures (e.g. soil crusts and/or vascular plants). Our analysis suggests that while DRBs and soils may differ in master physical attributes (e.g. soil horizons vs fluvial sedimentary facies), they become rapidly comparable in terms of microbial communities and biogeochemical processes. We further propose that drivers of DRBs biogeochemistry are similar to those of soils and, hence, concepts and methods used in soil science are transferable to DRBs research. Finally, our paper presents future research directions to advance the knowledge of DRBs and to understand their role in the biogeochemistry of intermittent fluvial networks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000313387","0012-8252||1872-6828",,"10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.12.001","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/313387","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cross-ecosystem research||Drought||Sediments||Aquatic-terrestrial interfaces||Temporary||Non-perennial","A conceptual framework for understanding the biogeochemistry of dry riverbeds through the lens of soil science","Review Article","Open access",,,"2018-12-30T03:43:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85058954427",,"000463462500018","Earth-sci. rev.",,"Earth-Science Reviews","188","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, a two-year return flood was released from an upstream reservoir and combined with sediment replenishment to enhance instream habitat conditions downstream of Rossens hydropower dam on the Sarine River in western Switzerland. Sediment replenishment consisted of four sediment deposits distributed as alternate bars along the river banks, a solution which was previously tested in laboratory. The morphological evolution of the replenishment and of the downstream riverbed were surveyed including pre- and post-flood topography. A hydro-morphological index to evaluate the quality of riverine habitats, based on the variability of flow depth and flow velocity in the analyzed reach, was investigated. The combination of the artificial flood with sediment replenishment proved to be a robust measure to supply a river with sediment and to enhance hydraulic habitat suitability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000393000","2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-019-41575-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/393000","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Sediment replenishment combined with an artificial flood improves river habitats downstream of a dam","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-22T10:58:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, this collective action is precluded by the ‘consensus gap’ between scientific knowledge and public opinion. Here, we test the extent to which the iconic cities around the world are likely to shift in response to climate change. By analyzing city pairs for 520 major cities of the world, we test if their climate in 2050 will resemble more closely to their own current climate conditions or to the current conditions of other cities in different bioclimatic regions. Even under an optimistic climate scenario (RCP 4.5), we found that 77% of future cities are very likely to experience a climate that is closer to that of another existing city than to its own current climate. In addition, 22% of cities will experience climate conditions that are not currently experienced by any existing major cities. As a general trend, we found that all the cities tend to shift towards the sub-tropics, with cities from the Northern hemisphere shifting to warmer conditions, on average ~1000 km south (velocity ~20 km.year-1), and cities from the tropics shifting to drier conditions. We notably predict that Madrid’s climate in 2050 will resemble Marrakech’s climate today, Stockholm will resemble Budapest, London to Barcelona, Moscow to Sofia, Seattle to San Francisco, Tokyo to Changsha. Our approach illustrates how complex climate data can be packaged to provide tangible information. The global assessment of city analogues can facilitate the understanding of climate change at a global level but also help land managers and city planners to visualize the climate futures of their respective cities, which can facilitate effective decision-making in response to on-going climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000367406","1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0217592","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/367406","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Understanding climate change from a global analysis of city analogues","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-10-01T02:31:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000484947800013","PLoS ONE","7","PLoS ONE","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We used three elevation gradients and a reciprocal transplant experiment to show that temperature causes genetic change in the sedge Eriophorum vaginatum. We demonstrate that plants originating from warmer climate produce fewer secondary compounds, grow faster and accelerate carbon dioxide (CO2) release to the atmosphere. However, warmer climate also caused plasticity in E. vaginatum, inhibiting nitrogen metabolism, photosynthesis and growth and slowing CO2 release into the atmosphere. Genetic differentiation and plasticity in E. vaginatum thus had opposing effects on CO2 fluxes, suggesting that warming over many generations may buffer, or reverse, the short‐term influence of this species over carbon cycle processes. Our findings demonstrate the capacity for plant evolution to impact ecosystem processes, and reveal a further mechanism through which plants will shape ecosystem responses to climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000389378","1461-023X||1461-0248",,"10.1111/ele.13178","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/389378","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Carbon cycle||Climate feedbacks||Climate warming||Eriophorum vaginatum||Genetic adaptation||Natural selection||Phenotypic plasticity||Plant ecophysiology||Plant metabolism","Plastic and genetic responses of a common sedge to warming have contrasting effects on carbon cycle processes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-10T14:39:05Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecol. lett.","1","Ecology Letters","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
