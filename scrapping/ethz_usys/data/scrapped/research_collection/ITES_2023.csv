In recent years, political agendas worldwide have recognized the importance of forests’ cultural ecosystem services, such as recreation. However, the inclusion of such values in management plans is challenging, and forest managers require novel methodologies and indicators to characterize forest recreation demand and provision. To this end, in this study, we combine remote sensing technologies and crowdsourced social media data to map and value the forest recreational potential of BC’s provincial parks system. We trained and deployed convolutional neural networks to automatically classify the content of over 60,000 Flickr images, we then created a random forest model to identify the variables that influence the visitors’ choice of recreational activity. These models allowed us to map the most likely recreational activities to occur in BC’s provincial parks and perform a spatially explicit assessment of the consumer surplus that these activities generate with a benefit transfer approach. Our findings suggest that the most influential variables in determining the choice of forest recreational activities are topographic, while anthropogenic impacts and forest biometrics variables have less effect. Furthermore, the outcomes of our study support the proposition that the integration of social media and remote sensing technologies allow, in the future, park managers to tailor the management of recreational services to forest visitors’ needs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000604746",,"1470-160X||1872-7034","10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110165","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/604746","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Forest recreation||Cultural ecosystem services||Flickr||Big data||Remote sensing","Assessing forest recreational potential from social media data and remote sensing technologies data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-03-23T14:46:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85150752694",,,,"Ecological Indicators","149","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In recognition, both governments and the private sector have pledged to restore landscapes through planting millions of hectares of forests. Private sector investment is to play a critical role in meeting these goals, through instruments such as biodiversity offsetting, philanthropy, voluntary carbon markets, sustainability funds, and climate bonds. Such instruments allow for the value of place-based ecosystems, such as standing forests, to be circulated globally. No longer are forests horizontal (in terms of their extent on a map); they are also vertical, in terms of their entanglements with institutions, and actors, operating at various scales. An overarching emphasis on the private sector however obscures the role of state institutions in engaging these multi-scalar institutions and actors. Bringing the dimension of scale to tree planting, we examine the ways in which woodland creation, a ‘national’ policy priority for the Scottish government, brings together actors, both ‘local’ and ‘global’, in an unequal context. Our analysis uncovers that in retreating from directly creating and managing woodlands to playing a supportive regulatory role, Scottish Government's forest policies increasingly rescale forest and landscape governance to private and non-profit sectors, and to individual landowners and communities. These actors, who are differently endowed in terms of resources, participate in forestry developments on an uneven playing field. Moreover, questions around power and distribution of benefits arise as woodland expansion increasingly becomes part of green investment portfolios, environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) commitments, offsetting, and individual philanthropy. A relational view of scale that examines prevailing relations of power and resources in given socio-political contexts can both animate and inform current discourses and policies on tree planting for climate change mitigation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000589994",,"0264-8377||1873-5754","10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106524","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589994","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Rescaling||Scotland||Natural capital||Tree planting||Restoration||Forestry","Glocal woodlands – The rescaling of forest governance in Scotland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-04T04:58:12Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85144946272",,"Land Use Policy",,"Land Use Policy","126","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

One such issue is the potential underestimation of ET when relative humidity (RH) is high (>70%), due to low-pass filtering with some EC systems. Yet, this underestimation for different types of EC systems (e.g. open-path or closed-path sensors) has not been characterized for synthesis datasets such as the widely used FLUXNET2015 dataset. Here, we assess the RH-associated underestimation of latent heat fluxes (LE, or ET) from different EC systems for 163 sites in the FLUXNET2015 dataset. We found that the LE underestimation is most apparent during hours when RH is higher than 70%, predominantly observed at sites using closed-path EC systems, but the extent of the LE underestimation is highly site-specific. We then propose a machine learning based method to correct for this underestimation, and compare it to two energy balance closure based LE correction approaches (Bowen ratio correction, BRC, and attributing all errors to LE). Our correction increases LE by 189% for closed-path sites at high RH (>90%), while BRC increases LE by around 30% for all RH conditions. Additionally, we assess the influence of these corrections on ET-based transpiration (T) estimates using two different ET partitioning methods. Results show opposite responses (increasing vs. slightly decreasing T-to-ET ratios, T/ET) between the two methods when comparing T based on corrected and uncorrected LE. Overall, our results demonstrate the existence of a high RH bias in water fluxes in the FLUXNET2015 dataset and suggest that this bias is a pronounced source of uncertainty in ET measurements to be considered when estimating ecosystem T/ET and WUE.",,,,"0168-1923||1873-2240","10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109305","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/592371","en","Elsevier",,,"Evapotranspiration||Energy balance closure||Latent energy||FLUXNET||Eddy covariance","The effect of relative humidity on eddy covariance latent heat flux measurements and its implication for partitioning into transpiration and evaporation",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2023-01-14T04:19:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85145820336","000922693400001","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","330","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

After stand replacing events (e.g., wind storm, forest fire), understorey vegetation can expand very quickly and compete with tree regeneration. This can severely reduce and retard tree regeneration due to competition for resources (e.g., light, water, nutrients). However, understorey vegetation is often not explicitly taken into account in forest succession models. The forest succession model ForClim was developed to study forest succession dynamics in Central Europe, but it has never been tested with regard to the effects of understorey vegetation on tree regeneration. This bachelor’s thesis investigates whether ForClim is able to reproduce the dynamics of a secondary forest succession with competition from understorey vegetation after a stand replacing disturbance event. For the evaluation of the model performance, inventory data from the Habsburg Forest 20 years after the wind storm Lothar were used. ForClim has eight model variants with two different establishment routines for tree ingrowth. For each model variant, a simulation was initialized, and the results were compared to observed stand characteristics. For both establishment routines, the model variant with the smallest deviation from the observed stem number and basal area was selected for the further analyses.  The old establishment routine E0 reproduced the observed stand characteristics better than the new routine. Within the two establishment routines, model variants 02 and 12 had the lowest deviation from the observed stand characteristics. By adjusting the model parameter for the establishment probability of young trees, the simulation performance of model variants 02 and 12 could be improved by 2 % and 208 %, respectively. Despite the large improvement of model variant 12, model variant 02 still reproduced the observed data more accurately by 12 %. Subsequently, the simulated succession dynamics were compared with the expected forest development using long-term simulations. Model variant 02 and 12 simulated the expected successional phases of the long-term succession well, but they both overestimated the time span for a full succession cycle and the maximum basal area. Overall, model variant 12 reproduced the expected long-term forest succession better. Additionally, the impact of implementing a plant functional type for understorey vegetation into ForClim’s species list was tested. It could be shown that it is technically possible to implement a plant functional type to qualitatively emulate competition from understorey vegetation. The results of this bachelor’s thesis show that ForClim can be adapted to the observed forest succession, with competition from herbaceous and shrubby understorey vegetation. Additionally, the results indicate that the implementation of understorey vegetation could be a promising approach to improve ForClim’s succession dynamics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000604119",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/604119","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","ForClim||sensitivity analysis||tree establishment probability||forest gap model||forest succession||Habsburg Forest||wind throw||wind storm Lothar","Analyses of tree regeneration after wind throw in a central Swiss forest: testing a forest succession model’s abilities",,"Bachelor Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::600 - Technology (applied sciences)",,"2023-03-20T14:56:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, litter layer wetting/drying dynamics are often overlooked when estimating forest water budgets. Here, we present field and laboratory experiments characterizing water cycling in the forest-floor litter layer and outline its implications for subcanopy microclimatic conditions and for estimates of transpiration and recharge. Storage capacities of spruce needle litter and beech broadleaf litter averaged 3.1 and 1.9 mm, respectively, with drainage/evaporation timescales exceeding 2 days. Litter-removal experiments showed that litter reduced soil water recharge, reduced soil evaporation rates, and insulated against ground heat fluxes that impacted snowmelt. Deadwood stored similar to 0.7 mm of water, increasing with more advanced states of decomposition, and retained water for >7 days. Observed daily cycles in deadwood weight revealed decreasing water storage during daytime as evaporation progressed and increasing storage at night from condensation or absorption. Water evaporating from the forest-floor litter layer modulates the subcanopy microclimate by increasing humidity, decreasing temperature, and reducing VPD. Despite the relatively small litter storage capacity (<3.1 mm in comparison to similar to 10(2) mm for typical forest soil rooting zones), the litter layer alone retained and cycled 18% of annual precipitation, or 1/3 of annual evapotranspiration. These results suggest that overlooking litter interception may lead to substantial overestimates of recharge and transpiration in many forest ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000582214",,"1936-0592||1936-0584","10.1002/eco.2493","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/582214","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","deadwood||evaporation||forest||interception||litter||precipitation partitioning||storage||water cycle","Potential for significant precipitation cycling by forest-floor litter and deadwood",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-22T04:02:35Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85141588620","000880360000001",,"2","Ecohydrology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Methods: We investigated the short-term fate (24 h) of five 33P-labelled Po compounds (teichoic acids, phospholipids, DNA, RNA and soluble organophosphates) and 33P-labelled inorganic P (Pi) in two soils.   Results: We found indications that soil microbial breakdown of phosphodiesters was limited by the depolymerization step, and that direct microbial uptake of Po occurred to a substantial extent.   Discussion: We postulate a trade-off between direct Po uptake and complete extracellular Po mineralization. These findings have profound consequences for our understanding of microbial P cycling in soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000600210",,"2673-8619","10.3389/fsoil.2023.1097965","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/600210","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Organic phosphorus||Soil microbes||Phosphorus uptake||Decomposition||Depolymerization||Microbial activity||Phosphatase||Soil phosphorus cycle","Tracing 33P-labelled organic phosphorus compounds in two soils: New insights into decomposition dynamics and direct use by microbes",,"Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-02-23T10:07:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"129487631",,,"Front.

Although species' eco-physiological properties determine their response to environmental change, most trait-based studies focus on a small subset of easily measured morphological traits as proxies for physiology. This choice may limit our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on species' demography, and obscure the underlying mechanisms. We conducted a transplantation experiment along a 1000-m elevation gradient in the Alps to quantify the degree to which changes in plant abundance due to climate warming were predicted by eco-physiological performance versus common morphological traits. Physiological measurements revealed that warming favoured species with a conservative leaf-level water use strategy whereas species whose leaf-level water use was more ‘wasteful’ were more likely to suffer from the warmer and drier climate. Nevertheless, the predictive power of physiological traits did not exceed that of morphological traits. Our results, therefore, show that while easily measured morphological traits can successfully predict plant abundance responses to climate, eco-physiological approaches are needed to understand the underlying mechanism.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000587865",,"0269-8463||1365-2435","10.1111/1365-2435.14228","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587865","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","alpine||altitude||climate change||ecophysiology||functional traits||plant||translocation||water-use efficiency","Eco-physiological and morphological traits explain alpine plant species' response to warming",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-17T08:54:31Z",,,,"yes","Timescales of changing species interactions under warming climate||Novel`interactions and species’ responses to climate change","173210||678841","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||H2020",,,"85142244952","000888825100001","Funct.

But whether root hairs can offset the negative impacts of drought on microbial activity remains unknown.  Soil zymography, 14C imaging and neutron radiography were combined to identify how root hairs and soil moisture affect rhizosphere biochemical properties. To achieve this, we cultivated two maize genotypes (wild-type and root-hair-defective rth3 mutant) under ambient and drought conditions.  Root hairs and optimal soil moisture increased hotspot area, rhizosphere extent and kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) of β-glucosidase activities. Drought enlarged the rhizosphere extent of root exudates and water content. Colocalization analysis showed that enzymatic hotspots were more colocalized with root exudate hotspots under optimal moisture, whereas they showed higher dependency on water hotspots when soil water and carbon were scarce.  We conclude that root hairs are essential in adapting rhizosphere properties under drought to maintain plant nutrition when a continuous mass flow of water transporting nutrients to the root is interrupted. In the rhizosphere, soil water was more important than root exudates for hydrolytic enzyme activities under water and carbon colimitation.",,,,"0028-646X||1469-8137","10.1111/nph.18409","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566956","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,,"enzyme activity||in situ imaging techniques||rhizodeposition||root hairs||root morphology||soil water scarcity||spatial correlation","The spatial distribution of rhizosphere microbial activities under drought: water availability is more important than root-hair-controlled exudation",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-08-28T05:28:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85136919708","000842328900001","New Phytol.","3","New Phytologist","237","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, our understanding of the impact of above and belowground hydraulic traits on stomatal regulation remains incomplete. The objective of this study was to investigate how key plant hydraulic traits impact transpiration of maize during soil drying. We hypothesize that the stomatal response to soil drying is related to a loss in soil hydraulic conductivity at the root–soil interface, which in turn depends on plant hydraulic traits.  Methods We investigate the response of 48 contrasting maize (Zea mays) genotypes to soil drying, utilizing a novel phenotyping facility. In this context, we measure the relationship between leaf water potential, soil water potential, soil water content and transpiration, as well as root, rhizosphere and aboveground plant traits.  Key Results Genotypes differed in their responsiveness to soil drying. The critical soil water potential at which plants started decreasing transpiration was related to a combination of above and belowground traits: genotypes with a higher maximum transpiration and plant hydraulic conductance as well as a smaller root and rhizosphere system closed stomata at less negative soil water potentials.  Conclusions Our results demonstrate the importance of belowground hydraulics for stomatal regulation and hence drought responsiveness during soil drying. Furthermore, this finding supports the hypothesis that stomata start to close when soil hydraulic conductivity drops at the root–soil interface.",,,,"1095-8290||0305-7364","10.1093/aob/mcac147","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/593287","en","Oxford University Press",,,"Critical soil water potential||transpiration||leaf water potential||rhizosheath||rhizosphere||plant hydraulic conductance||root length||soil drying||Zea mays||phenotyping","Above and belowground traits impacting transpiration decline during soil drying in 48 maize (Zea mays) genotypes",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2023-01-18T11:12:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85149999769","000913672700001","Ann Bot","2","Annals of Botany","131","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Drawing from existing case studies, we show how projects that align with local people's preferences and are implemented through inclusive governance are more likely to lead to improved social, ecological, and environmental outcomes. To underscore the importance of social considerations in restoration, we overlay existing global restoration priority maps, population, and the Human Development Index (HDI) to show that approximately 1.4 billion people, disproportionately belonging to groups with low HDI, live in areas identified by previous studies as being of high restoration priority.

To delay soil drying locally and related adverse effects, bacteria and plants modify their surroundings by releasing extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). As a result, the physical properties of hotspots like biological soil crusts or the rhizosphere differ from those of the surrounding bulk soil. Specifically, the presence of EPS delays evaporative soil drying. Despite the evidence of reduced evaporation from EPS-amended soils, the mechanisms controlling soil water content dynamics remain elusive. Thus, our study aimed to elucidate the potential of bacteria to modify their local environment when exposed to oscillations in soil water content induced by evaporative drying. We incubated sand microcosms with two contrasting strains of Bacillus subtilis for one week in a flow cabinet. At the end of the incubation period, local water loss was quantified and spatially resolved using time-series neutron radiography. Strain NCIB 3610, a complex biofilm producer steadily modified soil evaporation dynamics during the incubation period resulting in a substantial delay in soil drying due to hydraulic decoupling of the evaporation front from the soil surface. Evaporation dynamics remained largely unaltered in the microcosms inoculated with the domesticated strain 168 trp+ compared to the control treatment. The mechanism of hydraulic decoupling induced by NCIB 3610 was verified by estimates of diffusive fluxes and the position of the evaporation plane in the microcosm. Additionally, the role of polymeric substances in hydraulic decoupling was confirmed by an evaporation experiment using xanthan as an EPS analogue.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590628",,"0309-1708||1872-9657","10.1016/j.advwatres.2022.104364","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590628","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bacillus subtilis||Hydraulic decoupling||Time-series neutron radiography||Soil microcosms||Oscillating soil water content||Local soil water dynamics","Extracellular polymeric substances from soil-grown bacteria delay evaporative drying",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-06T07:54:44Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85145975748","000960679000001","Adv.

Long-term temporal trends towards earlier leaf unfolding are observed across Northern Hemisphere forests. Phenological dates also vary between years, whereby end-of-season (EOS) dates correlate positively with start-of-season (SOS) dates and negatively with growing-season total net CO2 assimilation (Anet). These associations have been interpreted as the effect of a constrained leaf longevity or of premature carbon (C) sink saturation—with far-reaching consequences for long-term phenology projections under climate change and rising CO2. Here, we use multidecadal ground and remote-sensing observations to show that the relationships between Anet and EOS are opposite at the interannual and the decadal time scales. A decadal trend towards later EOS persists in parallel with a trend towards increasing Anet—in spite of the negative Anet–EOS relationship at the interannual scale. This finding is robust against the use of diverse observations and models. Results indicate that acclimation of phenology has enabled plants to transcend a constrained leaf longevity or premature C sink saturation over the course of several decades, leading to a more effective use of available light and a sustained extension of the vegetation CO2 uptake season over time.",,,,"2397-334X","10.1038/s41559-022-01946-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/592021","en","Nature",,,"Carbon cycle||Forest ecology||Plant ecology","Acclimation of phenology relieves leaf longevity constraints in deciduous forests",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2023-01-12T19:25:03Z",,,,"yes","next-generation Modelling of the biosphere - Including New Data streams and optimality approaches||Forest growth and carbon balance in a warming world: Predicting the growing season lengths of temperate forests","181115||193646","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Eccellenza||Ambizione",,,"85146170245","000927114200001","Nat Ecol Evol",,"Nature Ecology & Evolution","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Since autumn leaf phenology responds to climatic conditions, climate change affects the length of the growing season. Thus, autumn leaf phenology is often modelled to assess possible climate change effects on future CO2 mitigating capacities and species compositions of forests. Projected trends have been mainly discussed with regards to model performance and climate change scenarios. However, there has been no systematic and thorough evaluation of how performance and projections are affected by the calibration approach. Here, we analyzed >2.3 million performances and 39 million projections across 21 models, 5 optimization algorithms, ≥7 sampling procedures, and 26 climate model chains from two representative concentration pathways. Calibration and validation were based on >45 000 observations for beech, oak, and larch from 500 Central European sites each.  Phenology models had the largest influence on model performance. The best performing models were (1) driven by daily temperature, day length, and partly by seasonal temperature or spring leaf phenology and (2) calibrated with the Generalized Simulated Annealing algorithm (3) based on systematically balanced or stratified samples. Assuming an advancing spring phenology, projected autumn phenology shifts between 13 and +20 days by 2080–2099, resulting in a lengthening of the growing season by 7–40 days. Climate scenarios and sites explained more than 80 % of the variance in these shifts and thus had eight to 22 times the influence of phenology models. Warmer climate scenarios and better performing models predominantly extended the growing season more than cooler scenarios and poorer models.  Our results justify inferences from comparisons of process-oriented phenology models to phenology-driving processes and we advocate species-specific models for such analyses and subsequent projections. For sound calibration, we recommend a combination of cross-validations and independent tests, using randomly selected sites from stratified bins based on mean annual temperature and average autumn phenology, respectively. Poor performance and little influence of phenology models on autumn phenology projections suggest that the models are overlooking relevant drivers.

Result-based agri-environmental schemes can be more effective and efficient than the more commonly used action-based schemes. The efficiency of result-based schemes, and thus their likely inclusion in agricultural policy frameworks, depends critically on the indicators used to measure biodiversity.  OBJECTIVE We investigate how biodiversity indicators for result-based schemes might be designed and implemented.  METHODS To this end, we first conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature to identify the range of proposed biodiversity indicators. Second, we synthesize the currently used biodiversity indicators in existing result-based agri-environmental schemes. Third, we compare the proposed and implemented indicators. Fourth, we provide an overview of planned result-based schemes under the 2023–27 reform of the EU Common Agricultural policy. Fifth, we propose how the schemes and indicators might be improved by drawing from technological advances.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Our analysis of proposed schemes shows that most schemes use vascular plants as indicators, representing plant species diversity in grassland. These indicators are designed and applied uniformly for large regions such as states or countries. Recently published papers propose more often indicators that consider more biodiversity aspects and are adapted to conditions at smaller scales. We observe similar patterns for currently implemented as for proposed schemes: They are using mostly vascular plants to represent grassland plant species diversity. Moreover, implemented schemes and their indicators are also rather simple in their design and not adapted to smaller regional conditions. More recently implemented schemes are taking both dimensions increasingly into account.  Policymakers need to consider their objectives when choosing and designing biodiversity indicators and result-based schemes. They often face trade-offs between improving biodiversity and costs. Therefore, they need to decide which aspects of biodiversity should be considered and how many thresholds that trigger payments should be established. However, studies showed that some indicator designs allow policymakers to cost-effectively consider different aspects of biodiversity. Furthermore, policymakers need to select the indicators based on whether they want to conserve existing or restore lost biodiversity. Finally, new technologies can help improve the design and monitoring of biodiversity in the future.  SIGNIFICANCE Our insights into proposed and implemented biodiversity indicators for result-based schemes provide guidelines for future policy design. Moreover, we show how technological advances can potentially improve biodiversity-oriented result-based agri-environmental schemes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000578532",,"0308-521X","10.1016/j.agsy.2022.103538","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/578532","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biodiversity indicators||Agri environmetnal schemes||Result based||Biodiversity conservation||Systematic review||Digitalization","Biodiversity indicators for result-based agri-environmental schemes – Current state and future prospects",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-31T07:54:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85140804904","000880816800005",,,"Agricultural Systems","204","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02120 - Dep.

While the pattern of reduced tree-ring widths is frequently described the processes underlying such legacy effects, i.e., whether it is due to shorter growth periods or lower growth rates, remains unclear and is investigated in this study. To elucidate these post-drought effects, we examined radial stem growth dynamics monitored with precision band-dendrometers on 144 Douglas fir, Norway spruce and silver fir sample trees distributed along four elevational gradients in the Black Forest (Southwest Germany) during the post-drought years 2019 and 2020. Growth onset of all investigated species occurred between 11 and 24 days significantly earlier in 2020 compared to 2019. Modelling growth onset based on chilling and forcing units and taking the study year into account explained 88–98 % of the variance in the growth onset data. The highly significant effect of the study year (p < 0.001) led to the conclusion, that other factors than the prevailing site conditions (chilling and forcing units) must have triggered the earlier growth onset in 2020. On the other hand, for Douglas fir growth rates were significantly higher in 2020 compared to 2019 (2.9 μm d−1) and marginally significantly higher for silver fir (1.3 μm d−1), underlining the explanatory power of growth rate on recovery processes in general and suggesting that Douglas fir copes better with droughts, as it recovered faster. Growth dynamics at the beginning of the year showed limited growth for earlier growth onsets, which, however, could not explain the difference between the investigated years. Our results provide evidence that legacy effects of drought events are expressed by a delayed growth onset and a reduced growth rate in the post-drought year and that Douglas fir has a superior recovery potential.",,,,"0048-9697||1879-1026","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158703","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/573825","en","Elsevier",,,"Legacy effects||Tree ring||Intra-annual growth||Drought stress||Cambial activity||Recovery||Pseudotsuga menziesii||Picea abies||Abies alba","Later growth onsets or reduced growth rates: What characterises legacy effects at the tree-ring level in conifers after the severe 2018 drought?",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-10-01T03:26:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85138383634","000862758300002","Sci.

However, it is unclear how microbes adjust nutrient acquisition strategies to changing geochemical properties across deeply weathered soils developed from geochemically contrasting parent material. Here we show that along a geochemical gradient in forest and cropland, a proxy variable, the chemical index of alteration (CIA), is sufficiently sensitive to reflect geochemical controls on microbial nutrient acquisition in tropical soils. We found that the CIA negatively correlates with rock-derived nutrient concentrations and pH, but positively with clay content, iron oxides, as well as total iron, aluminum, and manganese concentrations. Thus, using the CIA, which integrates effects of soil fertility and C stabilization by minerals, reduced the complexity of relating microbial nutrient acquisition to geochemical soil properties. Effects of the CIA on microbial C and phosphorus (P) acquisition were stronger in cropland than in forest soil. Microbial nutrient acquisition strategy shifted with increasing CIA from predominating C demand to P. Changes in soil properties at higher CIA (less rich in rock-derived nutrients) were favorable to fungi, which pursue a conservative nutrient allocation strategy to cope with acidic and nutrient-depleted soil conditions, reducing C loss through respiration. In low CIA soils (more rock-derived nutrients), bacteria-dominated communities increasingly invested in C acquisition at the expense of the community biomass, with subsequent greater C loss through respiration. We conclude that microbial communities adapt nutrient acquisition strategies to changing geochemical soil properties in a way that might affect C input versus C storage and release in tropical soils. Here, high soil fertility may favor plants to build up more C in biomass, thus increasing C input, whereas, it may also favor the establishment of microbial communities whose nutrient acquisition and allocation strategies limit long-term soil C storage.",,,,"0929-1393||1873-0272","10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.104653","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/573490","en","Elsevier",,,"African tropical soil||Weathering index||Microbial biomass||Enzyme activity||Nutrient limitation","Relationships between geochemical properties and microbial nutrient acquisition in tropical forest and cropland soils",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-09-30T03:25:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85137296624","000855180400006","Appl. soil ecol.",,"Applied Soil Ecology","181","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Due to their depths (−30–−150 m), accessibility is challenging, and the structure of mesophotic fish assemblages is generally less known than either shallow reefs or deep zones with soft bottoms which are generally trawled. Environmental DNA metabarcoding from seawater filtered in situ could improve our ability to monitor the diversity of mesophotic ecosystems. Here, we developed and tested a submersible standalone pumping device allowing targeted marine water filtering to explore the biodiversity of two mesophotic ecosystems, one temperate along the Provence coast in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea and one tropical at the seamount La Pérouse in the Western Indian Ocean. We filtered water samples from depths ranging between 0 and 200 m in the Mediterranean Sea and between 60 and 140 m in the Indian Ocean and applied a metabarcoding protocol using the teleo primer pair targeting the 12S mitochondrial rDNA (Actinopterygii and Chondrichthyes). For both study regions, our eDNA surveys were able to recover highly diverse fish assemblages, and the compositional analysis of eDNA samples showed both a marked signal of fish compositional turnover and overlapping taxa between depth zones. Further, we observed that a substantial number of species were found in samples collected in depths beyond their reported depth range suggesting an underestimation of species' depth tolerances. eDNA metabarcoding should thus complement existing knowledge of species' geographic distributions across space and depth. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential of eDNA metabarcoding for future mesophotic surveys as it allows fast and broad biodiversity assessment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594914",,"2637-4943","10.1002/edn3.358","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594914","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Environmental DNA highlights fish biodiversity in mesophotic ecosystems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-26T00:15:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85138622371",,,"1","Environmental DNA","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Agricultural intensification can lead to changes in land covers and livelihood opportunities and it remains unclear how such changes align or misalign with the desires of local communities. Using participatry mapping, we assessed ES uses and desires of Indigenous people and local communities provided by different land cover types along a gradient of agricultural intensification (forest subsistence, agroforestry mosaic, and monoculture and market-dependence) in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We found that mapped ES use diversity was highest in the forest-dependent zone and lowest near monoculture agricultural systems. The expressed ES uses and desires varied greatly among land cover types amidst loss of old-growth forest and greater reliance on secondary forest and shrub land. The spatial analysis showed that high priority areas of ES use was related to access in the landscape, demonstrating the importance of attending to place-based social values in ES assessments. From this study, we call for a people-centric spatial modelling approach to address the divergence of social and cultural ES values associated with land covers under different intensification contexts. Participatory mapping clarifies the ES desires of local communities, which state policy often fails to address. We recommend a place specific management strategy to reduce ES trade-offs of specific land use practices, which are currently apparent with agrarian change in Indonesia and relevant for other tropical developing countries.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000588212",,"2639-5908||2639-5916","10.1080/26395916.2023.2174685","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588212","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Agrarian change||Multifunctional landscapes||Land use change||Valuation of ecosystem services||Synergies and trade-offs||Land use planning","Participatory mapping of ecosystem services across a gradient of agricultural intensification in West Kalimantan, Indonesia",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-19T14:47:30Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"1","Ecosystems and People","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, little is known about the implications of MP on soil physical properties. We hypothesize that low wettability of MP induces soil water repellency, depending on MP content and size of MP and soil particles. We quantified wettability of mixtures of MP and sand. The sessile drop method (SDM) was applied to measure static contact angle (CA) of MP and glass beads at contents ranging from 0 to 100% (w/w). The results are extrapolated to varying combinations of MP and soil particle sizes based on specific surface area. Capillary rise was imaged with neutron radiography quantifying the effect of MP on dynamic CA, water imbibition, and water saturation distribution in sand. At 5% (w/w) MP content, static CA exhibited a steep increase to 80.2 degrees for MP 20-75 mu m and 59.7 degrees for MP 75-125 mu m. Dynamic CAs were approximately 40% lower than static CAs. Capillary rise experiments showed that MP 20-75 mu m reduced water imbibition into sand columns (700-1,200 mu m), with average dynamic CA of 40.3 degrees at 0.35% (w/w) MP content and 51.8 degrees at 1.05%. Decreased water saturation and increased tortuosity of flow paths were observed during imbibition peaking at 3.5% (w/w) local MP content. We conclude, in regions with high MP content. water infiltration and thus MP transport are hindered. Local low wettability induced by MP is expected to limit soil wettability and impede capillary rise.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000561767",,"1539-1663","10.1002/vzj2.20215","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/561767","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Microplastic induces soil water repellency and limits capillary flow",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-04T04:56:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85135200189","000830866900001","Vadose Zone J.","1","Vadose Zone Journal","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Urban ecosystems can host richer wild bee communities than highly intensified agricultural areas, specifically in resource-rich urban green spaces such as allotments and family gardens. At the same time, urban beekeeping has boomed in many European cities, raising concerns that the fast addition of a large number of managed bees could deplete the existing floral resources, triggering competition between wild bees and honeybees. Here, we studied the interplay between resource availability and the number of honeybees at local and landscape scales and how this relationship influences wild bee diversity. We collected wild bees and honeybees in a pollination experiment using four standardized plant species with distinct floral morphologies. We performed the experiment in 23 urban gardens in the city of Zurich (Switzerland), distributed along gradients of urban and local management intensity, and measured functional traits related to resource use. At each site, we quantified the feeding niche partitioning (calculated as the average distance in the multidimensional trait space) between the wild bee community and the honeybee population. Using multilevel structural equation models (SEM), we tested direct and indirect effects of resource availability, urban beekeeping, and wild bees on the community feeding niche partitioning. We found an increase in feeding niche partitioning with increasing wild bee species richness. Moreover, feeding niche partitioning tended to increase in experimental sites with lower resource availability at the landscape scale, which had lower abundances of honeybees. However, beekeeping intensity at the local and landscape scales did not directly influence community feeding niche partitioning or wild bee species richness. In addition, wild bee species richness was positively influenced by local resource availability, whereas local honeybee abundance was positively affected by landscape resource availability. Overall, these results suggest that direct competition for resources was not a main driver of the wild bee community. Due to the key role of resource availability in maintaining a diverse bee community, our study encourages cities to monitor floral resources to better manage urban beekeeping and help support urban pollinators.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576727",,"1051-0761||1939-5582","10.1002/eap.2727","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576727","en","Ecological Society of America","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","competition||intraspecific trait variability||pollinator||species interaction||urban biodiversity||urbanization","Low resource availability drives feeding niche partitioning between wild bees and honeybees in a European city",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-19T03:01:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85140095942","000866118800001","Ecol.

Changes in forest structure through removal of trees affects ecosystem functionality on multiple levels. For instance, the carbon cycle is being altered, not only by the removal of biomass, but also by changing environmental conditions, leading to changes in, for example, decomposition processes. This lowers the carbon storage density of forests. Forest degradation also affects the hydrological cycle: interception and evapotranspiration change, and soils of degraded forests might not be equally capable of infiltrating rainfall. This can lead to overland flow, soil erosion, and to reduced recharge of the ground water. It has further been warned that forest degradation reduces biodiversity, which in turn is an important driver for various ecosystem functions.  Consequently, the restoration of ecosystems is on political agendas, as well as in eco-market mechanisms in private industry, directed by individual customers. Successful ecosystem restoration can address multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at once: alleviation of poverty, increase in crop yield and fuelwood, reduction of involuntary migration and conflicts, and regeneration of biodiversity. Ecosystem restoration can be conducted in different forms, but generally it is differentiated into two categories. Natural regeneration (also known as “passive restoration”) describes the regrowth of forests with relatively little assistance, mainly focusing on prevention of further degradation (i.e., cessation of logging). Active restoration promotes forest restoration through various silvicultural restoration mechanisms, such as enrichment planting (i.e., tree planting), liana and climber cutting, or the creation of more favorable environmental conditions (e.g., light availability).  This PhD thesis aimed to better understand the recovery of selected ecosystem functions after degradation in tropical rainforests in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Namely, I compared the recovery of species community composition and diversity between actively restored and naturally regenerating forest sites (15 forest plots per restoration type) which were selectively logged between 1981 to 1991. Half of the forest plots were actively restored between 1993-2004 through enrichment planting and climber cutting. I assessed whether traces of silvicultural restoration interventions are detectable in the forest structure nowadays (i.e., higher density of species that were used during enrichment planting, and lower climber/liana density). This observational study was conducted for adult trees and seedlings to allow the assessment of long-term trajectories of forest recovery. I observed that adult tree diversity (expressed with the Shannon Diversity Index) was significantly higher in actively restored forest plots compared to naturally regenerating forest plots, and that rare species were more common in restored plots. Species communities of both, adult trees and seedlings, were dominated by late-succession species for both management practices and did not differ significantly between active restoration and natural regeneration. I further observed a higher number of adult tree individuals of species that were planted and a lower density of liana seedlings in actively restored than naturally regenerating forest sites. These results highlight the successful restoration of a key ecosystem function (i.e., biodiversity) and the effective implementation of silvicultural measures in the framework of forest restoration.  I measured throughfall in a landscape of logged-over, regenerating forest and identified influential structural forest characteristics. With throughfall being an influential factor on rainfall partitioning, it is important to understand how the recovery of formerly degraded forests might affect the regional water balance. I therefore monitored throughfall for seven months in twelve forest plots located in two areas with a different restoration history (i.e., active restoration and passive regeneration in one area for about 30-40 years, and natural regeneration in the other area for about 10-15 years). When describing throughfall models (i.e., relationship between throughfall and structural forest characteristics), I was particularly interested whether throughfall models perform better when measures of forest heterogeneity (i.e., tree diversity or coefficient of variation in DBH) were included. I also explored whether throughfall could be predicted with LiDAR-derived Top of Canopy (TCH) maps. I identified multiple influential forest characteristics on throughfall (i.e., tree density, basal area, Shannon Diversity Index, coefficient of variation of diameter at breast height (DBH)), but including measures of forest heterogeneity did not lead to a better in throughfall-model performance. I did not find a relationship between TCH and throughfall. The overall best performing throughfall-model simply included tree density. This finding will hopefully generate more awareness on how forest structure, and associated effects of restoration, influences throughfall.  Lastly, I assessed in an experimental study the influence of dung beetles as bioturbating insects on infiltration – a hydrological process relevant to prevent overland flow and to recharge soil and ground water. Using mesocosms and three treatments (control, dung only, dung and dung beetles) I assessed the increase in infiltration rates in three time steps (after 1 day, 5 days, or 10 days of dung beetle presence). I also assessed infiltration patterns by using a blue dye tracer to visualize the infiltration pathways. The novel implementation of blue dye tracer is widely used in hydrological method, but not yet in macrofauna-soil interaction studies. I indeed found an increase in infiltration rates after dung beetles were present for 10 days, and that water infiltrated to greater soil depth (measured after 5 days). These results emphasize the important role of dung beetles as ecosystem engineers and their potential as nature-based solutions in restoring hydrological processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000606319",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/606319","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Functioning and Resilience of Ecosystem Services in Tropical Rainforests",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2023-04-03T09:03:25Z",,,,"yes","""FORESTeR: Functioning & Resilience of Ecosystem Services in Tropical Rainforests""","ETH-36 16-2","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants","29093",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We use a systematic review to explore the role of behavioural factors and opportunity costs in farmers' decisions to participate in AESs in Australia, Europe and North America. Behavioural factors influence how farmers value and perceive options, while opportunity costs relate to farmers' forgone utility when choosing to participate in schemes. We synthesise insights from 79 articles and over 700 factors explaining the participation in AESs. We find that a set of behavioural factors seem consistently connected to participation, including agricultural training, advice and having positive attitudes towards AESs. Moreover, several factors related to opportunity costs also have a rather consistent relationship with AES participation, including market conditions, implementation efforts, profitability, and management and contract flexibility. However, many relationships of behavioural factors and opportunity costs with AES participation are not as consistent and generalizable as sometimes portrayed and require context-specific interpretation. Those factors with mixed results can still provide insights into farmers' participation decisions as several of them are either ‘positively and insignificantly’ or ‘negatively and insignificantly’ related to participation, such as environmental attitude, trust and farm size. These results suggest that their relationship with AES participation depends on other factors or the setting, highlighting interactions and raising important new research questions. Overall, our results provide several entry points for both researchers and policy-makers, highlighting uncertainties in relationships between factors and participation that should be considered when designing policies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000604818",,"0021-857X||1477-9552","10.1111/1477-9552.12538","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/604818","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Agri-environmental schemes||Australia||Behavioural factors||Europe||North America||Opportunity costs||Systematic review","The role of behavioural factors and opportunity costs in farmers' participation in voluntary agri‐environmental schemes: A systematic review",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"JEL - JEL::D - Microeconomics::D0 - General::D01 - Microeconomic Behavior: Underlying Principles||JEL - JEL::D - Microeconomics::D9 - Micro-Based Behavioral Economics::D90 - General||JEL - JEL::H - Public Economics::H3 - Fiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents::H31 - Household||JEL - JEL::H - Public Economics::H3 - Fiscal Policies and Behavior of Economic Agents::H32 - Firm||JEL - JEL::Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics::Q0 - General::Q01 - Sustainable Development||JEL - JEL::Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics::Q1 - Agriculture::Q12 - Micro Analysis of Farm Firms, Farm Households, and Farm Input Markets||JEL - JEL::Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics::Q2 - Renewable Resources and Conservation::Q20 - General","2023-03-24T09:35:47Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"000955326400001","J. agric. econ.",,"Journal of Agricultural Economics",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The complex mechanisms that control the timescales of C persistence in soil are still not fully understood. Quantifying the sensitivity of soil C pools to climate and land use change is critical for predictions of future ecosystem response. More comprehensive understanding requires a set of methods to characterize C persistence in the context of soil processes. By combining laboratory methods and models that describe soil C dynamics with radiocarbon (14C), a powerful tracer, this thesis seeks to broaden knowledge of controls on soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics.  In Chapter 1, I provide a general introduction to the challenges and uncertainties facing soil C science under changing climate. I then describe current methods for separating SOM along functional boundaries that determine its persistence and describe how various soil minerals act as strong controls on SOM cycling, as well as a recent thermal analysis method for resolving the ages of C in various soil “pools”. Applications of 14C and soil C modeling are laid out as powerful tools for tracing biogeochemical processes and testing hypotheses. Finally, the conceptual framework and research questions of this thesis are described.  To begin addressing these research questions, in Chapter 2 I analyze long-term soil archives at the Winchmore Irrigation Research Station in New Zealand. Two-pool soil models are constrained with nearly 60 years of annual SOC and 13 discrete 14C measurements over the duration of the experiment. Two experimental pasture production trials were investigated: an irrigation trial and a phosphorus fertilizer trial, each with respective controls and two levels of treatment. Previous analysis had shown that intensification of management increased pasture production, and thus C inputs, but C concentrations in soil had increased at a consistent rate in all trials over the course of the experiment. By applying 14C constraints and calculations of C transit times in each system, I observe that greater inputs were more rapidly respired so that the time to respire 50% of inputs decreased from 6 - 7 years to about 4 years, and that consistent storage of 0.18 to 0.22 T ha-1 yr-1 of C was stabilized in all trials over longer timescales. Management did not influence the processes causing long-term C accumulation in these topsoils.  In Chapter 3, I adapt and develop a laboratory method for separating SOM into pools with diverse controls on C persistence. Thermal fractionation is a relatively new method that applies ramped heating as a proxy for increasing activation energy input to break SOM bonds. The resulting profiles of C release describe thermal stability as a proxy for biogeochemical stability in soil. In addition, discrete 14C measurements associated with pools of C released across temperature reveal the age of C “fractions” with varying stability. To test the capacity of this method to capture the range of 14C contents in SOM, I thermally fractionate bulk soils as well as component density and chemical residue fractions. All samples released older C at higher temperatures. In topsoil, free and occluded particulate SOM fractions were found to be young (0 - ~100 years) and fairly homogenous in 14C content while mineral-associated SOM, containing 85% of total C, contained both recent (post- 1950) and centuries-old C. However, the mineral-associated fraction in subsoil was much older and more homogeneous in age. Results confirm that soil mineral characteristics have strong effects on persistence, and that thermal fractionation can be an effective tool for precisely resolving SOM age structure. Due to overlapping activation energies and varying 14C contents between density fractions, I recommend removing particulate SOM from mineral-associated SOM prior to thermal fractionation.  In Chapter 4 I expand my investigation of soil mineral effects on SOM persistence across a broader set of soil types. Specifically, from subsoil B horizons where minerals play a more dominant role than in topsoils. Mineralogies are classified by the minerals that act as dominant controls on C dynamics in each soil, including metal oxides, primary minerals, clays, and quartz sand. Mineral-associated SOM fractions were thermally fractionated to highlight mineral effects on thermal stability and 14C age distribution. I found that soils without 2:1 layer clays showed mostly similar, relatively low thermal stability, while 2:1 clay-bearing soils showed a distinct C pool that was more thermally stable. I observed that 14C contents varied less in samples without 2:1 clay, while those with 2:1 clay minerals had similar pools of younger and older C relative to the average. I concluded that the age structure of SOM bound to soil minerals is dependent on the clay-sized minerals present. The assessment of soil C age structure was combined with an analysis of SOM chemistry in each thermal fraction using pyrolysis gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS) to identify the influence of minerals and SOM chemistry on persistence. Soils with limited stabilization capacity released only labile (recently added/sequestered) polysaccharides and (older, more resilient) aromatic compounds. Highly diverse SOM was found in soils containing amorphous “short- range order” (SRO) non-crystalline oxides. Nitrogen-bearing C, known to form strong SOM-mineral bonds, was detected in soils containing SRO minerals and 2:1 clays, the latter of which corresponded to high activation energy and older C ages. I concluded that the absolute age of soil C is determined by the factors controlling soil processes, but soil minerals influence the range of cycling timescales and type of C that can persist in soil.  In Chapter 5, the fundamental aspects of the previous three science chapters are discussed in the context of how the presented findings help to answer overarching research questions. I introduce future avenues of research to further our knowledge of C dynamics and persistence in soil and suggest a “proof-of-concept” approach that builds on laboratory and modeling methods advanced in this thesis to bridge the gap between laboratory “fractions” and model “pools”. By interpolating 14C and C data collected during thermal fractionation, one can estimate continuous, mass- weighted distributions of 14C that can be compared with, and potentially act as a constraint on, model outputs. Refinement of this method is an important step forward in conceptualizing, characterizing, and calculating SOM dynamics. Further advancement of these tools will serve to predict the amount and rate at which soil C responds to global change in coming decades and centuries.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000612991",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/612991","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","soil carbon||Soil minerals||radiocarbon||Soil modeling||fractionation","Quantifying Relevant Time Scales of Soil Carbon Cycling Through Long-Term Modeling and Novel Fractionation Techniques",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2023-05-22T13:50:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,"29150",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
