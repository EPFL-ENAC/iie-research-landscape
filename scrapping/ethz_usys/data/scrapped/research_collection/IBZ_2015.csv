However, extracting information from raw movement data requires advanced analysis techniques, for instance to infer behaviors expressed during a certain period of the recorded trajectory, or gender or species identity in case data is obtained from remote tracking. In this paper, we address how different movement features affect the ability to automatically classify the species identity, using a dataset of unicellular microbes (i.e., ciliates). Previously, morphological attributes and simple movement metrics, such as speed, were used for classifying ciliate species. Here, we demonstrate that adding advanced movement features, in particular such based on discrete wavelet transform, to morphological features can improve classification. These results may have practical applications in automated monitoring of waste water facilities as well as environmental monitoring of aquatic systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000125394",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0145345","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/125394","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Developing and Integrating Advanced Movement Features Improves Automated Classification of Ciliate Species","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T18:04:26Z",,"pub:187995",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936550f6dea137999","010850889",,,,,"PLoS ONE","12","PLoS ONE","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

PARylation regulates a wide variety of biological processes in most eukaryotic cells including energy metabolism and cell death, maintenance of genomic stability, chromatin structure and transcription. Inside the nucleus, cross-talk between PARylation and other epigenetic modifications, such as DNA and histone methylation, was already described. In the present work, using PJ34 or ABT888 to inhibit PARP activity or over-expressing poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), we show decrease of global histone H3 and H4 acetylation. This effect is accompanied by a reduction of the steady state mRNA level of p300, Pcaf, and Tnfα, but not of Dnmt1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses, performed at the level of the Transcription Start Site (TSS) of these four genes, reveal that changes in histone acetylation are specific for each promoter. Finally, we demonstrate an increase of global deacetylase activity in nuclear extracts from cells treated with PJ34, whereas global acetyltransferase activity is not affected, suggesting a role for PARP in the inhibition of histone deacetylases. Taken together, these results show an important link between PARylation and histone acetylation regulated transcription.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000235228",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0144287","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/235228","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Poly(ADP-Ribosyl)ation Affects Histone Acetylation and Transcription","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-26T12:54:56Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"PLoS ONE","12","PLoS ONE","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This HIV-1 subtype C epidemic has a predominantly heterosexual mode of virus transmission and high (>15%) HIV prevalence among adults. The epidemiological dynamics of the HIV-1C epidemic in southern Africa are still poorly understood. Here, we aim at a better understanding of HIV transmission dynamics by analyzing HIV-1 subtype C sequences from Mochudi, a peri-urban village in Botswana.  HIV-1C env gene sequences (gp120 V1C5) were obtained through enhanced household-based HIV testing and counseling in Mochudi. More than 1200 sequences were generated and phylogenetically distinct sub-epidemics within Mochudi identified. The Bayesian birth-death skyline plot was used to estimate the effective reproductive number, R, and the timing of virus transmission, to classify sub-epidemics as “acute” (those with recent viral transmissions) or “historic” (those without recent viral transmissions).  We identified two of the 15 sub-epidemics as “acute.” The median estimates of R among the clusters ranged from 0.72 to 1.77. The majority of HIV lineages, 11 out of 15 clusters with 5+ members, appear to have been introduced to Mochudi between 1996 and 2002. The median peak duration of viral transmissions was 7.1 years (range 2.9–9.7 years). The median life span of identified HIV sub-epidemics, i.e., the time between the inferred epidemic origin and its most recent sample, was 13.1 years (range 10.2–22.1 years). Most viral transmissions within the sub-epidemics occurred between 1997 and 2007. The time period during which infected people are infectious appears to have decreased since the introduction of the national ART program in Botswana.  Real-time HIV genotyping and breaking down local HIV epidemics into phylogenetically distinct sub-epidemics may help to reveal the structure and dynamics of HIV transmission networks in communities, and aid in the design of targeted interventions for members of the acute sub-epidemics that likely fuel local HIV/AIDS epidemics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000108846",,"1878-0067||1755-4365",,"10.1016/j.epidem.2015.07.002","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/108846","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","HIV-1 subtype C||V1C5 sequences||HIV sub-epidemics||Effective reproductive number R||Botswana","Phylodynamic analysis of HIV sub-epidemics in Mochudi, Botswana","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T22:12:03Z",,"pub:169863",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653d6c053e79971","010242500",,"8494162294",,"000365890900006",,,"Epidemics","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02060 - Dep.

Such resistant genotypes are currently developed by conventional breeding, but novel breeding technologies including cisgenesis could be an alternative approach. A cisgenic apple line C44.4.146 was regenerated using the cisgene FB_MR5 from wild apple Malus ×robusta 5 (Mr5), and the previously established method involving A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation of the fire blight susceptible cultivar ‘Gala Galaxy’ using the binary vector p9-Dao-FLPi. The line C44.4.146 was shown to carry only the cisgene FB_MR5, controlled by its native regulatory sequences and no transgenes were detected by PCR or Southern blot following heat induced recombinase-mediated elimination of the selectable markers. Although this line contains up to 452 bp of vector sequences, it still matches the original definition of cisgenesis. A single insertion of T-DNA into the genome of 'Gala Galaxy' in chromosome 16 was identified. Transcription of FB_MR5 in line C44.4.146 was similar to the transcription in classically bred descendants of Mr5. Three independent shoot inoculation experiments with a Mr5 avirulent strain of Erwinia amylovora were performed using scissors or syringe. Significantly lower disease symptoms were detected on shoots of the cisgenic line compared to those of untransformed 'Gala Galaxy'. Despite the fact that the pathogen can overcome this resistance by a single nucleotide mutation, this is, to our knowledge, the first prototype of a cisgenic apple with increased resistance to fire blight.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000108845",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0143980","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/108845","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Development of the First Cisgenic Apple with Increased Resistance to Fire Blight","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T22:12:03Z",,"pub:169862",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653d6bae0575812","006206116",,"84955559620",,"000365891600083","PLoS ONE","12","PLoS ONE","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although there is considerable knowledge on the taxonomic diversity of these ciliates, their species-specific interactions with other microorganisms are still not well understood. Here we present the succession patterns of 20 morphotypes of ciliates during spring in Lake Zurich, Switzerland, and we relate their abundances to phytoplankton genera, flagellates, heterotrophic bacteria, and abiotic parameters. Interspecific relationships were analyzed by contemporaneous correlations and time-lagged co-occurrence and visualized as association networks. The contemporaneous network pointed to the pivotal role of distinct ciliate species (e.g., Balanion planctonicum, Rimostrombidium humile) as primary consumers of cryptomonads, revealed a clear overclustering of mixotrophic/omnivorous species, and highlighted the role of Halteria/Pelagohalteria as important bacterivores. By contrast, time-lagged statistical approaches (like local similarity analyses, LSA) proved to be inadequate for the evaluation of high-frequency sampling data. LSA led to a conspicuous inflation of significant associations, making it difficult to establish ecologically plausible interactions between ciliates and other microorganisms. Nevertheless, if adequate statistical procedures are selected, association networks can be powerful tools to formulate testable hypotheses about the autecology of only recently described ciliate species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000110933",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2015.01289","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/110933","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Ciliate morphotypes||Ciliophora||Local similarity analysis||Phytoplankton spring bloom||Network analysis","Network of Interactions Between Ciliates and Phytoplankton During Spring","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T23:22:47Z",,"pub:172235",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653fd3c33c46734","010181524",,,,,"Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, responses to global change can be highly species‐ and context‐dependent. We examined community‐level and species‐specific responses to a six‐year factorial temperature and nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) amendment experiment in two alpine plant communities in northern Sweden: a species‐poor dwarf shrub heath, and a more species‐rich meadow. We hypothesized that abundance responses to global change would be variable within commonly defined vascular plant functional groups (e.g., forbs, evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrubs) and that new species would appear in experimental plots over time due to the ameliorated growing conditions. We found that within most functional groups, species were highly individualistic with respect to the global change simulation, particularly within the forbs, whereas within the shrubs, responses were neutral to negative and widely variable in magnitude. In the heath community the response of the graminoid functional group was driven almost entirely by the grass Calamagrostis lapponica, which increased in abundance by an order of magnitude in the combined temperature and nutrient treatment. Furthermore, community context was important for species' responses to the simulations. Abundance of the pan‐arctic species Carex bigelowii and Vaccinium vitis‐idaea responded primarily to the temperature treatment in the meadow community whereas the nutrient treatment had stronger effects in the heath community. Over six growing seasons, more new species appeared in the experimental plots than in control plots in the meadow community, whereas in the heath community only one new species appeared. Our results from two closely situated but different plant communities show that functional groups do not predict individual species responses to simulated global change, and that these responses depend to a large extent on pre‐existing physical conditions as well as biotic interactions such as competition and facilitation. It may be difficult to apply general trends of global change responses to specific local communities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000110920",,"2150-8925",,"10.1890/ES14-00427.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/110920","en","ESA","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Calamagrostis lapponica||Carex bigelowii||Global change||Heath||Latnjajaure, Sweden||Meadow||Nutrient addition||Plant community composition||Subalpine tundra||Vaccinium vitis-idaea||Warming","Community and species-specific responses to simulated global change in two subarctic-alpine plant communities","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T23:22:47Z",,"pub:172217",,"no",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653fce357a63572","006204548",,,,,,"11","Ecosphere","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Stacking of multiple Cry toxins not only increase the environmental load of toxins but also raise the question on how possible interactions of the toxins can be assessed for risk assessment, which is mandatory for GM crops. However, no operational guidelines for a testing strategy or testing procedures exist. From the developers point of view, little data testing for combinatorial effects of Cry toxins is necessary as the range of possibly affected organisms focuses on pest species and no evidence is claimed to exist pointing to combinatorial effects on non-target organisms. We have examined this rationale critically using information reported in the scientific literature. To do so, we address the hypothesis of narrow specificity of Cry toxins subdivided into three underlying different conceptual conditions (i) “efficacy” in target pests as indicator for “narrow specificity,” (ii) lack of reported adverse effects of Cry toxins on non-target organisms, and (iii) proposed modes of action of Cry toxins (or the lack thereof) as mechanisms underlying the reported activity/efficacy/specificity of Cry toxins. Complementary to this information, we evaluate reports about outcomes of combinatorial effect testing of Cry toxins in the scientific literature and relate those findings to the practice of environmental risk assessment of Bt-crops in general and of stacked Bt-events in particular.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000107288",,"2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2015.00071","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/107288","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bt toxins||Non-target organisms||Target organisms||Synergistic effects||Mode of action||Adverse effects","Specificity and combinatorial effects of bacillus thuringiensis cry toxins in the context of GMO Environmental Risk Assessment","Review Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T21:22:32Z",,"pub:167861",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653b84ae0042023","010261182",,,,,"Front.

The ecological and evolutionary responses of natural populations to environmental stress at early life-stages are often mediated via maternal effects. During early life-stages, maternal effects commonly arise from egg coats (the extracellular structures surrounding the embryo), but the role of egg coats has rarely been studied in the context of adaptation to environmental stress. Previous studies on the moor frog Rana arvalis found that the egg coat mediated adaptive divergence along an acidification gradient in embryonic acid stress tolerance. However, the exact mechanisms underlying these adaptive maternal effects remain unknown. Here, we investigated the role of water balance and charge state (zeta potential) of egg jelly coats in embryonic adaptation to acid stress in three populations of R. arvalis. We found that acidic pH causes severe water loss in the egg jelly coat, but that jelly coats from an acid-adapted population retained more water than jelly coats from populations not adapted to acidity. Moreover, embryonic acid tolerance (survival at pH 4.0) correlated with both water loss and charge state of the jelly, indicating that negatively charged glycans influence jelly water balance and contribute to embryonic adaptation to acidity. These results indicate that egg coats can harbor extensive intra-specific variation, probably facilitated in part via strong selection on water balance and glycosylation status of egg jelly coats. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms of environmental stress tolerance and adaptive maternal effects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000101187",,"0029-8549||1432-1939",,"10.1007/s00442-015-3332-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/101187","en","Springer","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Adaptive divergence||Amphibians||Environmental stress||Jelly glycan||Water balance||Zeta potential||Egg coat","Mechanistic basis of adaptive maternal effects: egg jelly water balance mediates embryonic adaptation to acidity in Rana arvalis","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:40:12Z",,"pub:158841",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653337ec9a74682","000985960",,"84945473018",,"000363559800001","Oecologia","3","Oecologia","179","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Large annual yield losses and contamination of foodstuffs with harmful mycotoxins make Fg one of the most-studied plant pathogens. Analyses of natural field populations can lead to a better understanding of the evolutionary processes affecting this pathogen. Restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) was used to conduct population genomics analyses including 213 pathogen isolates from 13 German field populations of Fg.  Results High genetic diversity was found within Fg field populations and low differentiation (FST = 0.003) was found among populations. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) decayed rapidly over a distance of 1000 bp. The low multilocus LD indicates that significant sexual recombination occurs in all populations. Several recombination hotspots were detected on each chromosome, but different chromosomes showed different levels of recombination. There was some evidence for selection hotspots.  Conclusions The population genomic structure of Fg is consistent with a high degree of sexual recombination that is not equally distributed across the chromosomes. The high gene flow found among these field populations should enable this pathogen to adapt rapidly to changes in its environment, including deployment of resistant cultivars, applications of fungicides and a warming climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000107466",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-015-2166-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/107466","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Genetic diversity||Fixation index||Index of association||Linkage disequilibrium","Genome-wide analysis of Fusarium graminearum field populations reveals hotspots of recombination","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T21:27:42Z",,"pub:168066",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653bb94e3b85852",,,"84947939994",,"000365285700001","BMC Genomics",,"BMC Genomics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it is unknown whether these costs arise when parental care is facultative, thus questioning their fundamental importance in the early evolution of family life. Here, we investigated the short-term, long-term and transgenerational effects of maternal loss in the European earwig Forficula auricularia, an insect with facultative post-hatching maternal care. We showed that maternal loss did not influence the developmental time and survival rate of juveniles, but surprisingly yielded adults of larger body and forceps size, two traits associated with fitness benefits. In a cross-breeding/cross-fostering experiment, we then demonstrated that maternal loss impaired the expression of maternal care in adult offspring. Interestingly, the resulting transgenerational costs were not only mediated by the early-life experience of tending mothers, but also by inherited, parent-of-origin-specific effects expressed in juveniles. Orphaned females abandoned their juveniles for longer and fed them less than maternally-tended females, while foster mothers defended juveniles of orphaned females less well than juveniles of maternally-tended females. Overall, these findings reveal the key importance of transgenerational effects in the early evolution of family life.",,,,"0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2015.1617","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551347","en","The Royal Society",,,"Insect||Parental care||Familiy life||Orphaning||Social evolution||Inheritance","Short-term benefits, but transgenerational costs of maternal loss in an insect with facultative maternal care","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-06-08T11:06:56Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,"84945218928",,"000363485700011","Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1817","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","282","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Such expression differences may also underlie sex-specific responses of hosts to pathogen infections, most notably when pathogens induce partial sex reversal in infected hosts. The genetic changes associated with sex-specific responses to pathogen infections on the one hand, and sexual dimorphism on the other hand, remain poorly understood. The dioecious White Campion (Silene latifolia) displays sexual dimorphism in floral traits and infection with the smut fungus Micobrotryum lychnidis-dioicae induces a partial sex reversal in females. We find strong sex-specific responses to pathogen infection and reduced sexual dimorphism in infected S. latifolia. This provides a direct link between pathogen-mediated changes in sex-biased gene expression and altered sexual dimorphism in the host. Expression changes following infection affected mainly genes with male-biased expression in healthy plants. In females, these genes were up-regulated, leading to a masculinization of the transcriptome. In contrast, infection in males was associated with down-regulation of these genes, leading to a demasculinization of the transcriptome. To a lesser extent, genes with female-biased expression in healthy plants were also affected in opposite directions in the two sexes. These genes were overall down-regulated in females and up-regulated in males, causing, respectively, a defeminization in infected females and a feminization of the transcriptome in infected males. Our results reveal strong sex-specific responses to pathogen infection in a dioecious plant and provide a link between pathogen-induced changes in sex-biased gene expression and sexual dimorphism.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000106106",,"1553-7390||1553-7404",,"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005536","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/106106","en","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Fungal infection induces sex-specific transcriptional changes and alters sexual dimorphism in the dioecious plant Silene latifolia","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T20:28:05Z",,"pub:166059",,"yes",,,,"Genomic divergence in plants: exploring the consequences of ecological adaptation for plant divergence and speciation||Genomics of adaptation in the context of a rapid plant radiation","141260||160123","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,"imp593653a04a38244036","005410305",,"84946615811",,"000364401600014","PLoS Genet","10","PLoS Genetics","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

If these traits display a phylogenetic signal, phylogenetic distance (PD) can be used as a proxy for trait variation. We provide the first investigation of the degree of phylogenetic signal in traits related to competition in freshwater green phytoplankton. We measured 17 traits related to competition and tested whether they displayed a phylogenetic signal across a molecular phylogeny of 59 species of green algae. We also assessed the fit of five models of trait evolution to trait variation across the phylogeny. There was no significant phylogenetic signal for 13 out of 17 ecological traits. For 7 traits, a non-phylogenetic model provided the best fit. For another 7 traits, a phylogenetic model was selected, but parameter values indicated that trait variation evolved recently, diminishing the importance of common ancestry. This study suggests that traits related to competition in freshwater green algae are not generally well-predicted by patterns of common ancestry. We discuss the mechanisms by which the link between phylogenetic distance and phenotypic differentiation may be broken.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000110925",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0137085","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/110925","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Common Ancestry Is a Poor Predictor of Competitive Traits in Freshwater Green Algae","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T23:22:47Z",,"pub:172222",,"no",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653fd09f5580547","006206116",,,,,"PLoS ONE","9","PLoS ONE","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To control this devastating disease, various chemical and biological treatments are commonly applied in Switzerland, but they fail to keep the infection at an acceptable level in years of heavy disease pressure. The Swiss authorities therefore currently allow the controlled use of the antibiotic streptomycin against FB in years that are predicted to have heavy infection periods, but only one treatment per season is permitted. Another strategy for controlling Erwinia is to breed resistant/tolerant apple cultivars. One way of accelerating the breeding process is to obtain resistant cultivars by inserting one or several major resistance genes, using genetic engineering. To date, no study summarizing the impact of different FB control measures on the environment and on human health has been performed. This study consequently aims to compare different disease-control measures (biological control, chemical control, control by antibiotics and by resistant/tolerant apple cultivars obtained through conventional or molecular breeding) applied against E. amylovora, considering different protection goals (protection of human health, environment, agricultural diversity and economic interest), with special emphasis on biosafety aspects. Information on each FB control measure in relation to the specified protection goal was assessed by literature searches and by interviews with experts. Based on our results it can be concluded that the FB control measures currently applied in Switzerland are safe for consumers, workers and the environment. However, there are several gaps in our knowledge of the human health and environmental impacts analyzed: data are missing (1) on long term studies on the efficacy of most of the analyzed FB control measures; (2) on the safety of operators handling streptomycin; (3) on residue analyses of Equisetum plant extract, the copper and aluminum compounds used in apple production; and (4) on the effect of biological and chemical control measures on non-target fauna and flora. These gaps urgently need to be addressed in the near future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000110081",,"1660-4601||1661-7827",,"10.3390/ijerph120911422","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/110081","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Erwinia amylovora||Disease control||Pesticides||Breeding||Genetic engineering||Biosafety","Fire blight control: the struggle goes on.

Study sites were above 3100 m a.s.l. and all above treeline except for one site representing a forested headwater stream. Physico-chemistry grouped sites by sub-basin and glacial influence. Seston levels were higher in the forested stream and a side-slope tributary (> 227 mg m–3) than the other streams (< 100 mg m–3). Periphyton levels were higher (> 2.7 mg m–2) in streams in the Heap Steep sub-basin fed by a remnant hanging glacier (active ice field) than in the other streams (< 1.0 mg m–2). Macroinvertebrate abundances (range = 140–2400 individuals per 5-min kick sample) and taxa richness were generally low (2–8 taxa at most sites), although being higher in lower-basin sites and the forested stream than at sites nearest the glaciers. Macroinvertebrate trophic structures were simple, consisting of primary consumers and predators, including two riparian spiders. Macroinvertebrate δ15N values ranged from ca. –2.54 to –5.41, whereas δ13C values ranged from –24.23 to –16.08. Individual taxa varied widely in δ13C among sites, suggesting carbon sources differed among sites. Carbon isotope ratios also increased from upper sites to lower sites in the same sub-basin, suggesting a glacial carbon source at sites near the glacier to an instream carbon source at lower glacial sites lacking substantial riparian inputs. The upper glacial sites also had carbon isotope ratios similar to that of the forested headwater stream. These data suggest a highly heterogeneous spatial structure in alpine landscapes concomitant with the longitudinal development of glacial streams that is reflected in the trophic structure of local macroinvertebrates.",,,,"1863-9135||2363-7110","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/106059||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/164448","10.1127/fal/2015/0730","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572127","en","Schweizerbart",,,"Stable isotopes||Glacial streams||Macroinvertebrates||Water quality||Periphyton||Seston||Food webs","A note on the trophic structure of alpine streams in the Wind River Mountains, Wyoming, USA","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2017-06-11T20:28:06Z",,"pub:166008||pub:172237",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936539f4ceda26999||imp593653fd4698e74611",,,,,"000363001000005",,"1","Fundamental and Applied Limnology","187","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Diet is also known to alter the microbial composition of the gut, although it is not clear whether such alteration contributes to the development of metabolic syndrome. The aim of this work was to assess the possible link between the gut microbiota and the development of diet-induced metabolic syndrome in a rat model of obesity. Rats were fed either a standard or high-fructose diet. Groups of fructose-fed rats were treated with either antibiotics or faecal samples from control rats by oral gavage. Body composition, plasma metabolic parameters and markers of tissue oxidative stress were measured in all groups. A 16S DNA-sequencing approach was used to evaluate the bacterial composition of the gut of animals under different diets. The fructose-rich diet induced markers of metabolic syndrome, inflammation and oxidative stress, that were all significantly reduced when the animals were treated with antibiotic or faecal samples. The number of members of two bacterial genera, Coprococcus and Ruminococcus, was increased by the fructose-rich diet and reduced by both antibiotic and faecal treatments, pointing to a correlation between their abundance and the development of the metabolic syndrome. Our data indicate that in rats fed a fructose-rich diet the development of metabolic syndrome is directly correlated with variations of the gut content of specific bacterial taxa.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103864",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0134893","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103864","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Rescue of Fructose-Induced Metabolic Syndrome by Antibiotics or Faecal Transplantation in a Rat Model of Obesity","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T19:09:27Z",,"pub:162403",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653713408e93372","006206116",,"84941975667",,"000359061400124","PLoS ONE","8","PLoS ONE","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Some of these bacteria produce an insecticidal toxin (Fit) suggesting that they may exploit insect hosts as a secondary niche. However, the ecological relevance of insect toxicity and the mechanisms driving the evolution of toxin production remain puzzling.  Results Screening a large collection of plant-associated pseudomonads for insecticidal activity and presence of the Fit toxin revealed that Fit is highly indicative of insecticidal activity and predicts that Pseudomonas protegens and P. chlororaphis are exclusive Fit producers. A comparative evolutionary analysis of Fit toxin-producing Pseudomonas including the insect-pathogenic bacteria Photorhabdus and Xenorhadus, which produce the Fit related Mcf toxin, showed that fit genes are part of a dynamic genomic region with substantial presence/absence polymorphism and local variation in GC base composition. The patchy distribution and phylogenetic incongruence of fit genes indicate that the Fit cluster evolved via horizontal transfer, followed by functional integration of vertically transmitted genes, generating a unique Pseudomonas-specific insect toxin cluster.  Conclusions Our findings suggest that multiple independent evolutionary events led to formation of at least three versions of the Mcf/Fit toxin highlighting the dynamic nature of insect toxin evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103833",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-015-1763-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103833","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Pseudomonas||Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus||Insecticidal activity||Toxin evolution","Evolutionary patchwork of an insecticidal toxin shared between plant-associated pseudomonads and the insect pathogens Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T19:09:27Z",,"pub:162371",,"yes",,,,"Insecticidal activity in root-colonizing plant-beneficial pseudomonads: Molecular mechanisms and exploitation for pest control","138248","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,"imp5936537079ba930165",,,,,"000359526400002","BMC Genomics",,"BMC Genomics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, our ability to detect changes in biological communities across these ecosystems, or to understand their environmental drivers, can be hampered when different sampling methods are required to characterize biological communities of the adjacent but ecologically different ecosystems. Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) have been shown to be particularly sensitive to changes in temperature and vegetation and they require different sampling methods in closed vs. open habitats. We compared ant assemblages of closed-forests (beech- or oak-dominated) and open forest-steppe habitats in southwestern Carpathians using methods for closed-forest (litter sifting) and open habitats (pitfall trapping), and developed an integrated sampling approach to characterize changes in ant assemblages across these adjacent ecosystems. Using both methods, we collected 5,328 individual ant workers from 28 species. Neither method represented ant communities completely, but pitfall trapping accounted for more species (24) than litter sifting (16). Although pitfall trapping characterized differences in species richness and composition among the ecosystems better, with beech forest being most species poor and ecotone most species rich, litter sifting was more successful in identifying characteristic litter-dwelling species in oak-dominated forest. The integrated sampling approach using both methods yielded more accurate characterization of species richness and composition, and particularly so in species-rich forest-steppe habitat where the combined sample identified significantly higher number of species compared to either of the two methods on their own. Thus, an integrated sampling approach should be used to fully characterize changes in ant assemblages across ecosystem boundaries, or with vegetation change over time, and particularly so in species-rich habitats such as forest-steppe ecotones.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000110947",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0134502","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/110947","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Identifying Shifts in Leaf-Litter Ant Assemblages (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) across Ecosystem Boundaries Using Multiple Sampling Methods","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T23:22:47Z",,"pub:172257",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653fd92ba643105","006206116",,,,,"PLoS ONE","7","PLoS ONE","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A new approach using RNA-seq data has recently identified hundreds of new sex-linked genes in this species. However, this approach is expected to miss genes that are either not expressed or are expressed at low levels in the tissue(s) used for RNA-seq. Therefore other independent approaches are needed to discover such sex-linked genes.  Results Here we used 10 well-characterized S. latifolia sex-linked genes and their homologs in Silene vulgaris, a species without sex chromosomes, to screen BAC libraries of both species. We isolated and sequenced 4 Mb of BAC clones of S. latifolia X and Y and S. vulgaris genomic regions, which yielded 59 new sex-linked genes (with S. vulgaris homologs for some of them). We assembled sequences that we believe represent the tip of the Xq arm. These sequences are clearly not pseudoautosomal, so we infer that the S. latifolia X has a single pseudoautosomal region (PAR) on the Xp arm. The estimated mean gene density in X BACs is 2.2 times lower than that in S. vulgaris BACs, agreeing with the genome size difference between these species. Gene density was estimated to be extremely low in the Y BAC clones. We compared our BAC-located genes with the sex-linked genes identified in previous RNA-seq studies, and found that about half of them (those with low expression in flower buds) were not identified as sex-linked in previous RNA-seq studies. We compiled a set of ~70 validated X/Y genes and X-hemizygous genes (without Y copies) from the literature, and used these genes to show that X-hemizygous genes have a higher probability of being undetected by the RNA-seq approach, compared with X/Y genes; we used this to estimate that about 30 % of our BAC-located genes must be X-hemizygous. The estimate is similar when we use BAC-located genes that have S. vulgaris homologs, which excludes genes that were gained by the X chromosome.  Conclusions Our BAC sequencing identified 59 new sex-linked genes, and our analysis of these BAC-located genes, in combination with RNA-seq data suggests that gene losses from the S. latifolia Y chromosome could be as high as 30 %, higher than previous estimates of 10-20 %.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103266",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-015-1698-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103266","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sex chromosomes||Sex-linked genes||Plant||BAC||RNA-seq||Gene loss||Y degeneration||Silene latifolia||Silene vulgaris","Identifying new sex-linked genes through BAC sequencing in the dioecious plant Silene latifolia","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:46:08Z",,"pub:161477",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365363b1f9975218",,,,,"000358638500001","BMC Genomics",,"BMC Genomics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we aimed to quantify the spatial patterns of flow regime alterations along a river network in the Sagami River, Japan, by estimating river discharge under natural and altered flow conditions. We used a distributed hydrological model, which simulates hydrological processes spatiotemporally, to estimate 20-year daily river discharge along the river network. Then, 33 hydrologic indices (i.e., Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration) were calculated from the simulated discharge to estimate the spatial patterns of their alterations. Some hydrologic indices were relatively well estimated such as the magnitude and timing of maximum flows, monthly median flows, and the frequency of low and high flow pulses. The accuracy was evaluated with correlation analysis (r > 0.4) and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (α = 0.05) by comparing these indices calculated from both observed and simulated discharge. The spatial patterns of the flow regime alterations varied depending on the hydrologic indices. For example, both the median flow in August and the frequency of high flow pulses were reduced by the maximum of approximately 70%, but these strongest alterations were detected at different locations (i.e., on the mainstream and the tributary, respectively). These results are likely caused by different operational purposes of multiple water control facilities. The results imply that the evaluation only at discharge gauges is insufficient to capture the alteration of the flow regime. Our findings clearly emphasize the importance of evaluating the spatial pattern of flow regime alteration on a river network where its discharge is affected by multiple water control facilities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000110936",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0133833","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/110936","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Evaluation of Spatial Pattern of Altered Flow Regimes on a River Network Using a Distributed Hydrological Model","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T23:22:47Z",,"pub:172240",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653fd52e9f99527","006206116",,,,,"PLoS ONE","7","PLoS ONE","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

From the diverse roles microbes play in natural ecosystems, high levels of functional diversity result. Quantifying this diversity is challenging, because it is weakly associated with morphological differentiation. In addition, the small size of microbes hinders morphological and behavioral measurements at the individual level, as well as interactions between individuals. Advances in microbial community genetics and genomics, flow cytometry and digital analysis of still images are promising approaches. They miss out, however, on a very important aspect of populations and communities: the behavior of individuals. Video analysis complements these methods by providing in addition to abundance and trait measurements, detailed behavioral information, capturing dynamic processes such as movement, and hence has the potential to describe the interactions between individuals. We introduce BEMOVI, a package using the R and ImageJ software, to extract abundance, morphology, and movement data for tens to thousands of individuals in a video. Through a set of functions BEMOVI identifies individuals present in a video, reconstructs their movement trajectories through space and time, and merges this information into a single database. BEMOVI is a modular set of functions, which can be customized to allow for peculiarities of the videos to be analyzed, in terms of organisms features (e.g., morphology or movement) and how they can be distinguished from the background. We illustrate the validity and accuracy of the method with an example on experimental multispecies communities of aquatic protists. We show high correspondence between manual and automatic counts and illustrate how simultaneous time series of abundance, morphology, and behavior are obtained from BEMOVI. We further demonstrate how the trait data can be used with machine learning to automatically classify individuals into species and that information on movement behavior improves the predictive ability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000110930",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.1529","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/110930","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Microbial ecology||Microcosm||Trait-based ecology||Video analysis","BEMOVI, software for extracting behavior and morphology from videos, illustrated with analyses of microbes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T23:22:47Z",,"pub:172228",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653fd2699112031","007041168",,,,,"Ecol Evol","13","Ecology and Evolution","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Host specificity is thought to constitute an effective mechanism for the formation of barriers in different genera of Fungi, but evidence for endophytes is so far lacking. Sexual Epichloë species (Ascomycota, Clavicipitaceae) represent an ideal study system to investigate the mechanisms underlying speciation as mediated by host specificity because they include species complexes with several host-specific taxa. Here, we studied genetic differentiation of three host-specific Epichloë species using microsatellite markers that were newly in silico identified on the genome of Epichloë poae. Among these, 15 were experimentally tested and applied to study an extensive sampling of isolates representing Epichloë typhina infecting Dactylis glomerata and Epichloë clarkii infecting Holcus lanatus from a site with sympatric populations in Switzerland, as well as a reduced sampling of E. poae infecting Poa nemoralis to create a three-taxon dataset. Both principal coordinate analysis and Bayesian clustering algorithm showed three genetically distinct groups representing the three host-specific species. High pairwise F ST values among the three species, as well as sequencing data of the tefA gene revealing diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), further support the hypothesis of genetic discontinuities among the taxa. These results provide genotypic evidence of the maintenance of reproductive isolation of the species in a context of sympatry. In silico testing of 885 discovered microsatellites on the genome of Epichloë festucae extend their applicability to a wider taxonomic range of Epichloë.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000101909",,"1432-184X||0095-3628",,"10.1007/s00248-014-0556-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/101909","en","Springer","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Endophytes||Microsatellites||Population structure||Reproductive isolation||Sympatry","Genetic evidence for reproductive isolation among sympatric Epichloë endophytes as inferred from newly developed microsatellite markers","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:01:00Z",,"pub:160021",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365343d204c20158","000050784",,,,"000355694900006","Microb. ecol.","1","Microbial Ecology","70","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, an additional source of benefits for offspring is often overlooked: cooperative interactions among juvenile siblings. In this study, we examined how sibling cooperation and parental care could jointly contribute to the early evolution of family life. Specifically, we tested whether the level of food transferred among siblings (sibling cooperation) in the European earwig Forficula auricularia (1) depends on the level of maternal food provisioning (parental care) and (2) is translated into offspring survival, as well as female investment into future reproduction. We show that higher levels of sibling food transfer were associated with lower levels of maternal food provisioning, possibly reflecting a compensatory relationship between sibling cooperation and maternal care. Furthermore, the level of sibling food transfer did not influence offspring survival, but was associated with negative effects on the production of the second and terminal clutch by the tending mothers. These findings indicate that sibling cooperation could mitigate the detrimental effects on offspring survival that result from being tended by low-quality mothers. More generally, they are in line with the hypothesis that sibling cooperation is an ancestral behaviour that can be retained to compensate for insufficient levels of parental investment.",,,,"1010-061X||1420-9101",,"10.1111/jeb.12655","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551353","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,,"Forficula auricularia||insects||maternal care||precocial species||sibling rivalry||social evolution","Negative association between parental care and sibling cooperation in earwigs: a new perspective on the early evolution of family life?","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-06-08T11:09:48Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,"84936181638",,"000357584900001","J. evol. biol.","7","Journal of Evolutionary Biology","28","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Understanding the population dynamics of these viruses and their hosts can provide important insights for epidemiology and virus evolution. Puumala virus (PUUV) is a European hantavirus that may cause regional outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in humans. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of PUUV circulating in local populations of its rodent reservoir host, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) during eight years. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of all three genome segments of PUUV showed strong geographical structuring at a very local scale. There was a high temporal turnover of virus strains in the local bank vole populations, but several virus strains persisted through multiple years. Phylodynamic analyses showed no significant changes in the local effective population sizes of PUUV, although vole numbers and virus prevalence fluctuated widely. Microsatellite data demonstrated also a temporally persisting subdivision between local vole populations, but these groups did not correspond to the subdivision in the virus strains. We conclude that restricted transmission between vole populations and genetic drift play important roles in shaping the genetic structure and temporal dynamics of PUUV in its natural host which has several implications for zoonotic risks of the human population.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000102070",,"1752-4571||1752-4563",,"10.1111/eva.12263","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/102070","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","bank vole||genetic structure||hantavirus||host–parasite evolution||nephropathia epidemica||population dynamics||rodent‐borne disease||zoonosis","Spatiotemporal dynamics of Puumala hantavirus associated with its rodent host, Myodes glareolus","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:04:44Z",,"pub:160194",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936534766b6321512","006994734",,"84931956192",,"000356682200004","Evol.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques nowadays provide a powerful approach to overcome this limitation. We present a flexible and inexpensive method to identify large numbers of nuclear primer pairs that amplify in most Brassicaceae species. We first obtained and mapped NGS transcriptome sequencing reads from two of the distantly related Brassicaceae species, Cardamine hirsuta and Arabis alpina, onto the Arabidopsis thaliana reference genome, and then identified short conserved sequence motifs among the three species bioinformatically. From these, primer pairs to amplify coding regions (nuclear protein coding loci, NPCL) and exon-primed intron-crossing sequences (EPIC) were developed. We identified 2,334 universally applicable primer pairs, targeting 1,164 genes, which provide a large pool of markers as readily usable genomic resource that will help addressing novel questions in the Brassicaceae family. Testing a subset of the newly designed nuclear primer pairs revealed that a great majority yielded a single amplicon in all of the 30 investigated Brassicaceae taxa. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction with a subset of these markers on different levels of phylogenetic divergence in the mustard family were compared with previous studies. The results corroborate the usefulness of the newly developed primer pairs, e.g., for phylogenetic analyses or population genetic studies. Thus, our method provides a cost-effective approach for designing nuclear loci across a broad range of taxa and is compatible with current NGS technologies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000102431",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0128181","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/102431","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Efficient Detection of Novel Nuclear Markers for Brassicaceae by Transcriptome Sequencing","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:20:34Z",,"pub:160566",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653504eb5e87270","006206116",,,,"000355979500076","PLoS ONE","6","PLoS ONE","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet few studies have explored the indirect, host-mediated, effects of plant viruses on non-vector insects. We examined how infection of Cucurbita pepo plants by Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) impacted the susceptibility of aphids (Myzus persicae) to attack by the parasitoid wasp Aphidius colemani. In semi-natural foraging assays, we observed higher rates of aphid parasitism on infected plants compared to healthy plants. Subsequent experiments revealed that this difference is not explained by different attack rates on plants differing in infection status, but rather by the fact that parasitoid larvae successfully complete their development more often when aphid hosts feed on infected plants. This suggests that the reduced nutritional quality of infected plants as host for aphids—documented in previous studies—compromises their ability to mount effective defenses against parasitism. Furthermore, our current findings indicate that the aphid diet during parasitoid development (rather than prior to wasp oviposition) is a key factor influencing resistance. These findings complement our previous work showing that CMV-induced changes in host plant chemistry alter patterns of aphid recruitment and dispersal in ways conducive to virus transmission.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103685",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/srep10963","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103685","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Behavioural ecology||Chemical ecology||virology","Infection of host plants by Cucumber mosaic virus increases the susceptibility of Myzus persicae aphids to the parasitoid Aphidius colemani","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T19:06:44Z",,"pub:162085",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936536d9b00612677","006751867",,,,"000355724700002","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

External fluorescent marking is relatively inexpensive and can be readily employed to quickly mark large numbers of individuals; however, the ability to detect marked organisms in the field at night has been hampered by the limited detection distances provided by portable fluorescent ultraviolet lamps. In recent years, significant advances in LED lamp and laser technology have led to development of powerful, low-cost ultraviolet light sources. In this study, we evaluate the potential of these new technologies to improve detection of fluorescent-marked organisms in the field and to create new possibilities for tracking marked organisms in visually challenging environments such as tree canopies and aquatic habitats. Using handheld lasers, we document a method that provides a fivefold increase in detection distance over previously available technologies. This method allows easy scouting of tree canopies (from the ground), as well as shallow aquatic systems. This novel detection method for fluorescent-marked organisms thus promises to significantly enhance the use of fluorescent marking as a non-destructive technique for tracking organisms in natural environments, facilitating field studies that aim to document otherwise inaccessible aspects of the movement, behavior, and population dynamics of study organisms, including species with significant economic impacts or relevance for ecology and human health.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000102226",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0129175","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/102226","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Handheld Lasers Allow Efficient Detection of Fluorescent Marked Organisms in the Field","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:11:47Z",,"pub:160354",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936534b7434d85829","006206116",,,,"000355699100069","PLoS ONE","6","PLoS ONE","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using experimental inoculations of five trypanosomatid strains into groups of its natural host, the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, we investigate the effects of the initial parasite strain distribution across group members on the establishment and transmission success of the different strains to new hosts. For a given number of parasite strains circulating within a host group, transmission to new hosts was increased when the strains were initially inoculated as mixed infections (as opposed to separate single infections), presumably because mixed infections generally favored fast replicating strains. In contrast, separate single infections reduced transmission at least in part through a precedence effect, whereby weak strains appeared to persist by making their host unavailable to superinfection. These results suggest that host groups could benefit from ‘compartmentalizing’ infections by different parasite strains across different group members, which might be achieved in social insects, for example, by division of labor.",,,,"1567-7257||1567-1348",,"10.1016/j.meegid.2015.04.002","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/447999","en","Elsevier",,,"Mixed infection||Transmission||Prevalence||Social insect","The distribution of parasite strains among hosts affects disease spread in a social insect","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-10-26T15:53:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Infect Genet Evol",,"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","32","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recently developed experimental methods allow the estimation of the CTL's efficacy in detecting and clearing infected host cells. One method, the in vivo killing assay, utilizes the adoptive transfer of antigen displaying target cells into the bloodstream of mice. Surprisingly, killing efficacies measured by this method are often much higher than estimates obtained by other methods based on, for instance, the dynamics of escape mutations. In this study, we investigated what fraction of this variation can be explained by differences in peptide loads employed in in vivo killing assays. We addressed this question in mice immunized with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). We conducted in vivo killing assays varying the loads of the immunodominant epitope GP33 on target cells. Using a mathematical model, we determined the efficacy of effector and memory CTL, as well as CTL in chronically infected mice. We found that the killing efficacy is substantially reduced at lower peptide loads. For physiological peptide loads, our analysis predicts more than a factor 10 lower CTL efficacies than at maximum peptide loads. Assuming that the efficacy scales linearly with the frequency of CTL, a clear hierarchy emerges among the groups across all peptide antigen concentrations. The group of mice with chronic LCMV infections shows a consistently higher killing efficacy per CTL than the acutely infected mouse group, which in turn has a consistently larger efficacy than the memory mouse group. We conclude that CTL killing efficacy dependence on surface epitope frequencies can only partially explain the variation in in vivo killing efficacy estimates across experimental methods and viral systems, which vary about four orders of magnitude. In contrast, peptide load differences can explain at most two orders of magnitude.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000102411",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004178","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/102411","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Estimating the In Vivo Killing Efficacy of Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes across Different Peptide-MHC Complex Densities","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:20:34Z",,"pub:160544",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936534fc7d1875086","005410277",,,,"000356700200010","PLOS comput. biol.","5","PLoS Computational Biology","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Fitness costs associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are thought to constrain HGT, but our understanding of these costs remains fragmentary, making it difficult to predict the success of HGT events. Here we use the interaction between P. aeruginosa and a costly plasmid (pNUK73) to investigate the molecular basis of the cost of HGT. Using RNA-Seq, we show that the acquisition of pNUK73 results in a profound alteration of the transcriptional profile of chromosomal genes. Mutations that inactivate two genes encoded on chromosomally integrated MGEs recover these fitness costs and transcriptional changes by decreasing the expression of the pNUK73 replication gene. Our study demonstrates that interactions between MGEs can compromise bacterial fitness via altered gene expression, and we argue that conflicts between mobile elements impose a general constraint on evolution by HGT.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000469302",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/ncomms7845","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/469302","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Interactions between horizontally acquired genes create a fitness cost in Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-02-12T15:09:46Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it is unknown whether and how Bt protein content correlates with transgene expression, and whether this relationship is influenced by stressful environmental conditions. Two Bt maize varieties containing the same transgene cassette (MON 810) were grown under optimal and stressful conditions. Before and during stress exposure, the upper leaves were analysed for transgene expression using quantitative RT-PCR and for Bt content using ELISA. Under optimal conditions there was no significant difference in the transgene expression between the two investigated Bt maize varieties whereas Bt protein content differed significantly. Transgene expression was correlated with Bt protein content in only one of the varieties. Under stressful environmental conditions we found similar transgene expressions as under optimal conditions but Bt content responded differently. These results suggest that Bt content is not only controlled by the transgene expression but is also dependent on the genetic background of the maize variety. Under stressful conditions the concentration of Bt protein is even more difficult to predict.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000100630",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0123011","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/100630","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Transgene Expression and Bt Protein Content in Transgenic Bt Maize (MON810) under Optimal and Stressful Environmental Conditions","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:19:22Z",,"pub:157982",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365326bce7160080","006206116",,,,"000352478400091","PLoS ONE","4","PLoS ONE","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Seeking to optimise the simultaneous use of two antibiotics, we use the minimal dose at which clearance is observed in an in vitro experimental model of antibiotic treatment as a criterion to distinguish the best and worst treatments of a bacterium, Escherichia coli. Our aim is to compare a combination treatment consisting of two synergistic antibiotics to so-called sequential treatments in which the choice of antibiotic to administer can change with each round of treatment. Using mathematical predictions validated by the E. coli treatment model, we show that clearance of the bacterium can be achieved using sequential treatments at antibiotic dosages so low that the equivalent two-drug combination treatments are ineffective. Seeking to treat the bacterium in testing circumstances, we purposefully study an E. coli strain that has a multidrug pump encoded in its chromosome that effluxes both antibiotics. Genomic amplifications that increase the number of pumps expressed per cell can cause the failure of high-dose combination treatments, yet, as we show, sequentially treated populations can still collapse. However, dual resistance due to the pump means that the antibiotics must be carefully deployed and not all sublethal sequential treatments succeed. A screen of 136 96-h-long sequential treatments determined five of these that could clear the bacterium at sublethal dosages in all replicate populations, even though none had done so by 24 h. These successes can be attributed to a collateral sensitivity whereby cross-resistance due to the duplicated pump proves insufficient to stop a reduction in E. coli growth rate following drug exchanges, a reduction that proves large enough for appropriately chosen drug switches to clear the bacterium.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000108234",,"1544-9173||1545-7885",,"10.1371/journal.pbio.1002104","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/108234","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Using a Sequential Regimen to Eliminate Bacteria at Sub-Lethal Antibiotic Dosages","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T21:51:44Z",,"pub:169031",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653caa890c62016","004606893",,,,,"PLoS biol.","4","PLoS Biology","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This pattern, referred to as isolation asymmetry or Darwin's corollary to Haldane's rule, is a general feature of reproductive isolation in plants, yet factors determining its magnitude and direction remain unclear. We evaluated reciprocal species crosses between two naturally hybridizing diploid species of Arabidopsis to assess the degree of isolation asymmetry at different postmating life stages. We found that pollen from Arabidopsis arenosa will usually fertilize ovules from Arabidopsis lyrata; the reverse receptivity being less complete. Maternal A. lyrata parents set more F1 hybrid seed, but germinate at lower frequency, reversing the asymmetry. As predicted by theory, A. lyrata (the maternal parent with lower seed viability in crosses) exhibited accelerated chloroplast evolution, indicating that cytonuclear incompatibilities may play a role in reproductive isolation. However, this direction of asymmetrical reproductive isolation is not replicated in natural suture zones, where delayed hybrid breakdown of fertility at later developmental stages, or later‐acting selection against A. arenosa maternal hybrids (unrelated to hybrid fertility, e.g., substrate adaptation) may be responsible for an excess of A. lyrata maternal hybrids. Exogenous selection rather than cytonuclear incompatibilities thus shapes the asymmetrical postmating isolation in nature.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000100478",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.1474","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/100478","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Asymmetric reproductive isolation||Cytonuclear incompatibilities||Darwin's corollary to Haldane's rule||Hybrid inviability||Postzygotic selection","Exogenous selection rather than cytonuclear incompatibilities shapes asymmetrical fitness of reciprocal Arabidopsis hybrids","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:12:50Z",,"pub:157682",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653231b5fb86453","007041168",,"84928197145",,"000354209300016","Ecol Evol","8","Ecology and Evolution","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) can persist in the absence of drugs for considerable time. It is generally believed that differential TDRM-persistence is caused, at least partially, by variations in TDRM-fitness-costs. However, in vivo epidemiological evidence for the impact of fitness costs on TDRM-persistence is rare.  Here, we studied the persistence of TDRM in HIV-1 using longitudinally-sampled nucleotide sequences from the Swiss-HIV-Cohort-Study (SHCS). All treatment-naïve individuals with TDRM at baseline were included. Persistence of TDRM was quantified via reversion rates (RR) determined with interval-censored survival models. Fitness costs of TDRM were estimated in the genetic background in which they occurred using a previously published and validated machine-learning algorithm (based on in vitro replicative capacities) and were included in the survival models as explanatory variables.  In 857 sequential samples from 168 treatment-naïve patients, 17 TDRM were analyzed. RR varied substantially and ranged from 174.0/100-person-years;CI=[51.4, 588.8] (for 184V) to 2.7/100-person-years;[0.7, 10.9] (for 215D). RR increased significantly with fitness cost (increase by 1.6[1.3,2.0] per standard deviation of fitness costs). When subdividing fitness costs into the average fitness cost of a given mutation and the deviation from the average fitness cost of a mutation in a given genetic background, we found that both components were significantly associated with reversion-rates.  Our results show that the substantial variations of TDRM persistence in the absence of drugs are associated with fitness-cost differences both among mutations and among different genetic backgrounds for the same mutation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000100422",,"1553-7374||1553-7366",,"10.1371/journal.ppat.1004722","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/100422","en","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Persistence of Transmitted HIV-1 Drug Resistance Mutations Associated with Fitness Costs and Viral Genetic Backgrounds","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:12:50Z",,"pub:157487",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365321d768b23456","005409548",,"84926435102",,"000352201900043","PLoS Pathog","3","PLoS Pathogens","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The development of resistance is commonly attributed to genetic heterogeneity. However, heterogeneity of drug penetration of the tumor microenvironment both on the microscopic level within solid tumors as well as on the macroscopic level across metastases may also contribute to acquired drug resistance. Here we use mathematical models to investigate the effect of drug heterogeneity on the probability of escape from treatment and the time to resistance. Specifically we address scenarios with sufficiently potent therapies that suppress growth of all preexisting genetic variants in the compartment with the highest possible drug concentration. To study the joint effect of drug heterogeneity, growth rate, and evolution of resistance, we analyze a multi-type stochastic branching process describing growth of cancer cells in multiple compartments with different drug concentrations and limited migration between compartments. We show that resistance is likely to arise first in the sanctuary compartment with poor drug penetrations and from there populate non-sanctuary compartments with high drug concentrations. Moreover, we show that only below a threshold rate of cell migration does spatial heterogeneity accelerate resistance evolution, otherwise deterring drug resistance with excessively high migration rates. Our results provide new insights into understanding why cancers tend to quickly become resistant, and that cell migration and the presence of sanctuary sites with little drug exposure are essential to this end.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000100667",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004142","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/100667","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Spatial Heterogeneity in Drug Concentrations Can Facilitate the Emergence of Resistance to Cancer Therapy","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:19:22Z",,"pub:158024",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365327a0ba371306","005410277",,,,"000352195700036","PLOS comput. biol.","3","PLoS Computational Biology","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Theory and experiments emphasize the importance of such effects for the distribution of resistance in pathogenic populations. However, recent work shows that costs of resistance are highly variable depending on environmental factors such as nutrient supply and population structure, as well as genetic factors including the mechanism of resistance and genetic background. Here, we suggest that such variation can be better understood by distinguishing between the effects of resistance mechanisms on individual traits such as growth rate or yield (‘trait effects’) and effects on genotype frequencies over time (‘selective effects’). We first give a brief overview of the biological basis of costs of resistance and how trait effects may translate to selective effects in different environmental conditions. We then review empirical evidence of genetic and environmental variation of both types of effects and how such variation may be understood by combining molecular microbiological information with concepts from evolution and ecology. Ultimately, disentangling different types of costs may permit the identification of interventions that maximize the cost of resistance and therefore accelerate its decline.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000088915",,"1752-4571||1752-4563",,"10.1111/eva.12187","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/88915","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","antibiotic resistance||cost of resistance||epistasis||experimental evolution||genotype‐by‐environment interaction","Costs of antibiotic resistance – separating trait effects and selective effects","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T12:17:41Z",,"pub:139968",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365244bb41c54695","006994734",,,,"000351682500005","Evol.

Studies need to incorporate these factors with long-term data in order to link climate change to population abundance. We used 40 years of lizard abundance data and local climate data from Barro Colorado Island to ask how climate, total lizard abundance and cohort-specific abundance have changed over time, and how total and cohort-specific abundance relate to climate variables including those predicted to make the species vulnerable to climate change (i.e. temperatures exceeding preferred body temperature). We documented a decrease in lizard abundance over the last 40 years, and changes in the local climate. Population growth rate was related to the previous years’ southern oscillation index; increasing following cooler-wetter, la niña years, decreasing following warmer-drier, el nino years. Within-year recruitment was negatively related to rainfall and minimum temperature. This study simultaneously identified climatic factors driving long-term population fluctuations and climate variables influencing short-term annual recruitment, both of which may be contributing to the population decline and influence the population’s future persistence.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000108737",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0115450","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/108737","en","Public Library of Science","CC0 1.0 Universal","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/",,"Long-term data reveal a population decline of the Tropical lizard Anolis apletophallus, and a negative affect of El Nino years on population growth rate","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T22:08:08Z",,"pub:169749",,"no",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653d490be328254","006206116",,,,,"PLoS ONE","2","PLoS ONE","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A number of recent studies have reported high heritability of set point viral load implying that viral genetic factors contribute substantially to the overall variation in viral load. The high heritability is surprising given the diversity of host factors associated with controlling viral infection. Here we develop an analytical model that describes the temporal changes of the distribution of set point viral load as a function of heritability. This model shows that high heritability is the most parsimonious explanation for the observed variance of set point viral load. Our results thus not only reinforce the credibility of previous estimates of heritability but also shed new light onto mechanisms of viral pathogenesis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000099678",,"1553-7374||1553-7366",,"10.1371/journal.ppat.1004634","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/99678","en","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"High Heritability Is Compatible with the Broad Distribution of Set Point Viral Load in HIV Carriers","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T16:48:41Z",,"pub:155990",,"yes",,,,"The population biology of drug resistance: Key principles for a more sustainable use of drugs","268540","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,"imp593653107ac3642834","005409548",,"84924368507",,"000352083400022","PLoS Pathog","2","PLoS Pathogens","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We also assess the contribution of recent RNA sequencing datasets toward identifying pathogen genes and mechanisms critical for disease. While these studies have yet to report a major effector gene, they illustrate that assembling reads to the reference genome is a robust method to identify fungal transcripts from in planta infections. They also highlight the strong influence that the wheat cultivar has on effector gene expression. Lastly, we suggest future directions for NGS-guided approaches to address largely unanswered questions related to cultivar and lifecycle dependent gene expression and propose that future experiments with Z. tritici be conducted on a single wheat cultivar to enable comparisons across experiments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000098645",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2015.00102","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/98645","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","wheat pathogen||Mycosphaerella graminicola||necrotroph||effector||RNA-seq||comparative genomics","Recent advances in the Zymoseptoria tritici – wheat interaction: insights from pathogenomics","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T16:24:33Z",,"pub:154268",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593652f95580790900","010181292",,,,,"Front.

However, transitions to asexual reproduction may complicate this relationship because asexual lineages capture and freeze parts of the phenotypic variation of the sexual populations from which they derive. Parasitoid wasps belonging to the genus Lysiphlebus Foerster (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) are composed of over 20 species that exploit over a hundred species of aphid hosts, including many important agricultural pests. Within Lysiphlebus, two genetically and morphologically well-defined species groups are recognised: the “fabarum” and the “testaceipes” groups. Yet within each group, sexual as well as asexual lineages occur, and in L. fabarum different morphs of unknown origin and status have been recognised. In this study, we selected a broad sample of specimens from the genus Lysiphlebus to explore the relationship between genetic divergence, reproductive mode and morphological variation in wing size and shape (quantified by geometric morphometrics).  Results The analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences revealed a clear separation between the “testaceipes” and “fabarum” groups of Lysiphlebus, as well as three well-defined phylogenetic lineages within the “fabarum” species group and two lineages within the “testaceipes” group. Divergence in wing shape was concordant with the deep split between the “testaceipes” and “fabarum” species groups, but within groups no clear association between genetic divergence and wing shape variation was observed. On the other hand, we found significant and consistent differences in the shape of the wing between sexual and asexual lineages, even when they were closely related.  Conclusions Mapping wing shape data onto an independently derived molecular phylogeny of Lysiphlebus revealed an association between genetic and morphological divergence only for the deepest phylogenetic split. In more recently diverged taxa, much of the variation in wing shape was explained by differences between sexual and asexual lineages, suggesting a mechanistic link between wing shape and reproductive mode in these parasitoid wasps.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000100101",,"1471-2148",,"10.1186/s12862-015-0293-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/100101","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Parasitoid wasps||Wing shape||Reproductive mode||COI","Genetic and morphological variation in sexual and asexual parasitoids of the genus Lysiphlebus - an apparent link between wing shape and reproductive mode","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:02:46Z",,"pub:156841",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936531a4e5bc30830",,,"84926451975",,"000350500800001","BMC evol. biol.",,"BMC Evolutionary Biology","15","03838 - Vorburger, Christoph (SNF-Professur)||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The later an escape mutation emerges, the slower it outgrows its competition, i.e., the escape rate is lower. This pattern could indicate that the strength of the CD8+ cell responses is waning, or that later viral escape mutants carry a larger fitness cost. In this paper, we investigate whether the pattern of decreasing escape rates could also be caused by genetic interference among different escape strains. To this end, we developed a mathematical multi-epitope model of HIV dynamics, which incorporates stochastic effects, recombination, and mutation. We used cumulative linkage disequilibrium measures to quantify the amount of interference. We found that nearly synchronous, similarly strong immune responses in two-locus systems enhance the generation of genetic interference. This effect, combined with a scheme of densely spaced sampling times at the beginning of infection and sparse sampling times later, leads to decreasing successive escape rate estimates, even when there were no selection differences among alleles. These predictions are supported by empirical data from one HIV-infected patient. Thus, interference could explain why later escapes are slower. Considering escape mutations in isolation, neglecting their genetic linkage, conceals the underlying haplotype dynamics and can affect the estimation of the selective pressure exerted by CD8+ cells. In systems in which multiple escape mutations appear, the occurrence of interference dynamics should be assessed by measuring the linkage between different escape mutations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000101339",,"1664-3224",,"10.3389/fimmu.2014.00661","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/101339","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Theoretical biology||Mathematical modeling||HIV dynamics||Interference||Cytotoxic T lymphocytes||Escape","The effect of interference on the CD8(+) T cell escape rates in HIV","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:42:55Z",,"pub:159138",,"yes",,,,"Population dynamical and statistical modelling of the interaction between viruses and immune responses","130855","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,"imp593653369342c22919","010194167",,,,"000354601100001","Front Immunol",,"Frontiers in Immunology","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

How many trimers are required to interact with target cell receptors to mediate virus entry, the HIV entry stoichiometry, still awaits clarification. Here, we provide estimates of the HIV entry stoichiometry utilizing a combined approach of experimental analyses and mathematical modeling. We demonstrate that divergent HIV strains differ in their stoichiometry of entry and require between 1 to 7 trimers, with most strains depending on 2 to 3 trimers to complete infection. Envelope modifications that perturb trimer structure lead to an increase in the entry stoichiometry, as did naturally occurring antibody or entry inhibitor escape mutations. Highlighting the physiological relevance of our findings, a high entry stoichiometry correlated with low virus infectivity and slow virus entry kinetics. The entry stoichiometry therefore directly influences HIV transmission, as trimer number requirements will dictate the infectivity of virus populations and efficacy of neutralizing antibodies. Thereby our results render consideration of stoichiometric concepts relevant for developing antibody-based vaccines and therapeutics against HIV.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000099517",,"1553-7374||1553-7366",,"10.1371/journal.ppat.1004595","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/99517","en","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Different Infectivity of HIV-1 Strains Is Linked to Number of Envelope Trimers Required for Entry","Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2017-06-11T16:46:17Z",,"pub:155663",,"yes",,,,"Population dynamical and statistical modelling of the interaction between viruses and immune responses","130855","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,"imp5936530c7d8ef91196","005409548",,"84923851915||84964314302",,"000349106100027","PLoS Pathog","1","PLoS Pathogens","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Over longer timescales, both ecological and evolutionary responses to new environments could alter productivity and diversity–productivity relationships. In turn, diversity might affect how component species adapt to new conditions. We tested these ideas by culturing artificial microbial communities containing between 1 and 12 species in three different environments for ∼60 generations. The relationship between community yields and diversity became steeper over time in one environment. This occurred despite a general tendency for the separate yields of isolates of constituent species to be lower at the end if they had evolved in a more diverse community. Statistical comparisons of community and species yields showed that species interactions had evolved to be less negative over time, especially in more diverse communities. Diversity and evolution therefore interacted to enhance community productivity in a new environment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000094271",,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/ismej.2014.215","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/94271","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Evolution of species interactions determines microbial community productivity in new environments","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T14:35:43Z",,"pub:148159",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593652a8eb22259264","005502685",,,,,"ISME J",,"The ISME Journal","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Revealing the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of EV-A71 through time and space is central to understanding its outbreak potential. We generated the full genome sequences of 200 EV-A71 strains sampled from various locations in Viet Nam between 2011 and 2013 and used these sequence data to determine the evolutionary history and phylodynamics of EV-A71 in Viet Nam, providing estimates of the effective reproduction number (Re) of the infection through time. In addition, we described the phylogeography of EV-A71 throughout Southeast Asia, documenting patterns of viral gene flow. Accordingly, our analysis reveals that a rapid genogroup switch from C4 to B5 likely took place during 2012 in Viet Nam. We show that the Re of subgenogroup C4 decreased during the time frame of sampling, whereas that of B5 increased and remained >1 at the end of 2013, corresponding to a rise in B5 prevalence. Our study reveals that the subgenogroup B5 virus that emerged into Viet Nam is closely related to variants that were responsible for large epidemics in Malaysia and Taiwan and therefore extends our knowledge regarding its associated area of endemicity. Subgenogroup B5 evidently has the potential to cause more widespread outbreaks across Southeast Asia.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103873",,"0022-538X||1098-5514",,"10.1128/JVI.00706-15","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103873","en","American Society for Microbiology Journals","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Phylodynamics of Enterovirus A71-Associated Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease in Viet Nam","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T19:12:07Z",,"pub:162412",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365371631d236039",,,"84938934501",,"000360703900019","J Virol","17","Journal of Virology","89","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The central finding is that heterogeneity in contact networks, such as the presence of ‘superspreaders’, accelerates infectious disease spread in real epidemics. Disease control is also complicated by the continuous evolution of pathogens in response to changing environments and medical interventions. It remains unclear, however, how population structure influences these adaptive processes. Here we examine the evolution of infectious disease in empirical and theoretical networks. We show that the heterogeneity in contact structure, which facilitates the spread of a single disease, surprisingly renders a resident strain more resilient to invasion by new variants. Our results suggest that many host contact structures suppress invasion of new strains and may slow disease adaptation. These findings are important to the natural history of disease evolution and the spread of drug-resistant strains.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000098802",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/ncomms7101","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/98802","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Evolution and emergence of infectious diseases in theoretical and real-world networks","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T16:26:42Z",,"pub:154591",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593652fc4a73975027","007044158",,"84922751993",,"000348828900004","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the underlying assumption that the stable isotopic composition of the ephippia reflects the stable isotopic composition of the parent Daphnia, of their diet and of the environmental water have yet to be confirmed in a controlled experimental setting. We performed experiments with Daphnia pulicaria cultures, which included a control treatment conducted at 12 °C in filtered lake water and with a diet of fresh algae and three treatments in which we manipulated the stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13C value) of the algae, stable oxygen isotopic composition (δ18O value) of the water and the water temperature, respectively. The stable nitrogen isotopic composition (δ15N value) of the algae was similar for all treatments. At 12 °C, differences in algal δ13C values and in δ18O values of water were reflected in those of Daphnia. The differences between ephippia and Daphnia stable isotope ratios were similar in the different treatments (δ13C: +0.2 ± 0.4 ‰ (standard deviation); δ15N: −1.6 ± 0.4 ‰; δ18O: −0.9 ± 0.4 ‰), indicating that changes in dietary δ13C values and in δ18O values of water are passed on to these fossilizing structures. A higher water temperature (20 °C) resulted in lower δ13C values in Daphnia and ephippia than in the other treatments with the same food source and in a minor change in the difference between δ13C values of ephippia and Daphnia (to −1.3 ± 0.3 ‰). This may have been due to microbial processes or increased algal respiration rates in the experimental containers, which may not affect Daphnia in natural environments. There was no significant difference in the offset between δ18O and δ15N values of ephippia and Daphnia between the 12 and 20 °C treatments, but the δ18O values of Daphnia and ephippia were on average 1.2 ‰ lower at 20 °C than at 12 °C. We conclude that the stable isotopic composition of Daphnia ephippia provides information on that of the parent Daphnia and of the food and water they were exposed to, with small offsets between Daphnia and ephippia relative to variations in Daphnia stable isotopic composition reported from downcore studies. However, our experiments also indicate that temperature may have a minor influence on the δ13C, δ15N and δ18O values of Daphnia body tissue and ephippia. This aspect deserves attention in further controlled experiments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000102546",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-12-3819-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/102546","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The stable isotopic composition of Daphnia ephippia reflects changes in delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of food and water","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:24:04Z",,"pub:160686",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653531606f23187","006289717",,,,"000357119000011",,"12","Biogeosciences","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although considerable attention has been paid to influenza A viruses, a lack of equivalent data means that an integrated evolutionary and epidemiological framework has until now not been available for influenza B viruses, despite their significant disease burden. Through the analysis of over 900 full genomes from an epidemiological collection of more than 26,000 strains from Australia and New Zealand, we reveal fundamental differences in the phylodynamics of the two co-circulating lineages of influenza B virus (Victoria and Yamagata), showing that their individual dynamics are determined by a complex relationship between virus transmission, age of infection, and receptor binding preference. In sum, this work identifies new factors that are important determinants of influenza B evolution and epidemiology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000098273",,"2050-084X",,"10.7554/eLife.05055","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/98273","en","eLife Sciences Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The contrasting phylodynamics of human influenza B viruses","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T16:14:39Z",,"pub:153723",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593652f0ec8ef13882",,,"84922021071",,"000347918300001",,,"eLife","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02060 - Dep.

In this study, we aimed at estimating pollen‐mediated gene flow between cultivated sunflower and a weedy conspecific sunflower population growing in the same field and at quantifying, how it is affected by the weeds' flowering time. For that purpose, we extended an existing mating model by including a temporal distance (i.e. flowering time difference between potential parents) effect on mating probabilities. Using phenological and genotypic data gathered on the crop and on a sample of the weedy population and its offspring, we estimated an average hybridization rate of approximately 10%. This rate varied strongly from 30% on average for weeds flowering at the crop flowering peak to 0% when the crop finished flowering and was affected by the local density of weeds. Our result also suggested the occurrence of other factors limiting crop‐to‐weed gene flow. This level of gene flow and its dependence on flowering time might influence the evolutionary fate of weedy sunflower populations sympatric to their crop relative.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000091091",,"1752-4571||1752-4563",,"10.1111/eva.12222","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/91091","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","crop‐to‐weed gene flow||paternity analysis||phenology||pollen dispersal||sunflower (Helianthus annuus)||temporal isolation","Quantifying temporal isolation: a modelling approach assessing the effect of flowering time differences on crop-to-weed pollen flow in sunflower","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T13:10:13Z",,"pub:143293",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936526d95cdd52241","006994734",,"84921439712",,,"Evol.

The cyclic-AMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signal transduction pathway regulates the production of extracellular virulence factors in C. neoformans, but the influence of the pathway on the secretome has not been investigated. In this study, we performed quantitative proteomics using galactose-inducible and glucose-repressible expression of the PKA1 gene encoding the catalytic subunit of PKA to identify regulated proteins in the secretome.  Methods The proteins in the supernatants of cultures of C. neoformans were precipitated and identified using liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry. We also employed multiple reaction monitoring in a targeted approach to identify fungal proteins in samples from macrophages after phagocytosis of C. neoformans cells, as well as from the blood and bronchoalveolar fluid of infected mice.  Results We identified 61 secreted proteins and found that changes in PKA1 expression influenced the extracellular abundance of five proteins, including the Cig1 and Aph1 proteins with known roles in virulence. We also observed a change in the secretome profile upon induction of Pka1 from proteins primarily involved in catabolic and metabolic processes to an expanded set that included proteins for translational regulation and the response to stress. We further characterized the secretome data using enrichment analysis and by predicting conventional versus non-conventional secretion. Targeted proteomics of the Pka1-regulated proteins allowed us to identify the secreted proteins in lysates of phagocytic cells containing C. neoformans, and in samples from infected mice. This analysis also revealed that modulation of PKA1 expression influences the intracellular survival of cryptococcal cells upon phagocytosis.  Conclusions Overall, we found that the cAMP/PKA pathway regulates specific components of the secretome including proteins that affect the virulence of C. neoformans. The detection of secreted cryptococcal proteins from infected phagocytic cells and tissue samples suggests their potential utility as biomarkers of infection.

Despite this risk, honeybees and other sequenced social insects have far fewer canonical immune genes relative to solitary insects. Social protection from infection, including behavioral responses, may explain this depauperate immune repertoire. Here, based on full genome sequences, we describe the immune repertoire of two ecologically and commercially important bumblebee species that diverged approximately 18 million years ago, the North American Bombus impatiens and European Bombus terrestris.  Results We find that the immune systems of these bumblebees, two species of honeybee, and a solitary leafcutting bee, are strikingly similar. Transcriptional assays confirm the expression of many of these genes in an immunological context and more strongly in young queens than males, affirming Bateman’s principle of greater investment in female immunity. We find evidence of positive selection in genes encoding antiviral responses, components of the Toll and JAK/STAT pathways, and serine protease inhibitors in both social and solitary bees. Finally, we detect many genes across pathways that differ in selection between bumblebees and honeybees, or between the social and solitary clades.  Conclusions The similarity in immune complement across a gradient of sociality suggests that a reduced immune repertoire predates the evolution of sociality in bees. The differences in selection on immune genes likely reflect divergent pressures exerted by parasites across social contexts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000101058",,"1474-760X",,"10.1186/s13059-015-0628-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/101058","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Social Insect||Orthologous Group||Immune Gene||Bumblebee Species||Toll Pathway","A depauperate immune repertoire precedes evolution of sociality in bees","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:31:56Z",,"pub:158709",,"yes",,,,"Resistance systems and population structure of parasites","268853","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,"imp593653308866488675",,,,,"000353375000001","Genome Biol",,"Genome Biology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02060 - Dep.

Primitively eusocial bumblebees are uniquely placed to illuminate the evolution of highly eusocial insect societies. Bumblebees are also invaluable natural and agricultural pollinators, and there is widespread concern over recent population declines in some species. High-quality genomic data will inform key aspects of bumblebee biology, including susceptibility to implicated population viability threats.  Results We report the high quality draft genome sequences of Bombus terrestris and Bombus impatiens, two ecologically dominant bumblebees and widely utilized study species. Comparing these new genomes to those of the highly eusocial honeybee Apis mellifera and other Hymenoptera, we identify deeply conserved similarities, as well as novelties key to the biology of these organisms. Some honeybee genome features thought to underpin advanced eusociality are also present in bumblebees, indicating an earlier evolution in the bee lineage. Xenobiotic detoxification and immune genes are similarly depauperate in bumblebees and honeybees, and multiple categories of genes linked to social organization, including development and behavior, show high conservation. Key differences identified include a bias in bumblebee chemoreception towards gustation from olfaction, and striking differences in microRNAs, potentially responsible for gene regulation underlying social and other traits.  Conclusions These two bumblebee genomes provide a foundation for post-genomic research on these key pollinators and insect societies. Overall, gene repertoires suggest that the route to advanced eusociality in bees was mediated by many small changes in many genes and processes, and not by notable expansion or depauperation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000101054",,"1474-760X",,"10.1186/s13059-015-0623-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/101054","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Transposable Element||Long Terminal Repeat||Odorant Receptor||Bumblebee Species||Synteny Block","The genomes of two key bumbleblee species with primitive eusocial organization","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:31:56Z",,"pub:158705",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936533069c2953455",,,,,"000353676700001","Genome Biol",,"Genome Biology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02060 - Dep.
