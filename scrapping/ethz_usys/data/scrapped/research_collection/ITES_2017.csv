Skies were generally clear over the Swiss Alps due to a persistent high-pressure band between the UK and Russia associated with a rather weak pressure gradient over the continent. To assess the effects of penumbral shading on near-surface meteorology across Switzerland, air temperature data measured at 10 min intervals at 184 MeteoSwiss weather stations were used. Wind speed and direction data were available from 165 of these stations. Additionally, six Swiss FluxNet eddy covariance flux (ECF) sites provided turbulent measurements at 20 Hz resolution. During maximum occultation, the temperature drop was up to 5.8 K at a mountain site where cold air can pool in a topographic depression. The bootstrapped average of the maximum temperature drops of all 184 MeteoSwiss sites during the solar eclipse was 1.51 ± 0.02 K (mean ± SE). A detailed comparison with literature values since 1834 showed a temperature decrease of 2.6 ± 1.7 K (average of all reports), with extreme values up to 11 K. On fair weather days under weak larger-scale pressure gradients, local thermo-topographic wind systems develop that are driven by small-scale pressure and temperature gradients. At one ECF site, the penumbral shading delayed the morning transition from down-valley to up-valley wind conditions. At another site, it prevented this transition from occurring at all. Data from the 165 MeteoSwiss sites measuring wind direction did not show a consistent pattern of wind direction response to the passing of the penumbral shadow. These results suggest that the local topographic setting had an important influence on the temperature drop and the wind flow patterns during the eclipse. A significant cyclonic effect of the passing penumbral shadow was found in the elevation range ≈ 1700–2700 m a. s. l., but not at lower elevations of the Swiss Plateau. This contrasts with an earlier theory that the anticyclonic outflow should reach as far as ≈ 2400 km from the center of the eclipse, which would have included all of Switzerland during the 2015 eclipse. Thus, measurable effects of penumbral shading on the local wind system could be even found at ≈ 2000 km from the path of the eclipse (that is, Switzerland during the 2015 eclipse), and our results tend to lend support to a newer theory that the anticyclonic cold-air outflow from the center of the eclipse only extends ≈ 1600 km outwards, with cyclonic flow beyond that distance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000224845",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/233300||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/224845","10.5194/acp-17-14887-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/244783","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Effects of vernal equinox solar eclipse on temperature and wind direction in Switzerland","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-12-29T03:42:45Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85038615661",,"000418198000001","Atmos. chem. phys.","24","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These characteristics are often in conflict as increasing yield through fertilization can lead to biodiversity loss. Thus, the challenge in grassland management is to sustain both yield and diversity. Biodiversity–ecosystem functioning experiments typically reveal a positive relationship between manipulated species diversity and productivity. In contrast, observations of the effect of increasing productivity via fertilization suggest a negative association with biodiversity. Using a mathematical model simulating species co-existence along a resource gradient, we show that trade-offs and species pool structure (size and trait distribution) determines the shape of the productivity-diversity relationship. At a constant resource level, over-yielding drives a positive relationship between biodiversity and productivity. In contrast, along a resource gradient, the shape of the productivity-diversity relationship is determined by the distribution of species along trade-off axes and often resulted in a bell-shaped relationship. In accordance to this theoretical result, we then explain the general trend of plant biodiversity loss with fertilisation in the European flora, by showing empirical evidence that trait distribution of plant species pools throughout Europe is biased toward species preferring poorer soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000217112",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-017-15334-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/217112","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Theoretical ecology||Grassland ecology||Community ecology","Species pool distributions along functional trade-offs shape plant productivity-diversity relationships","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-12-05T05:45:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Lif3web: The present and future spatial structure of tri-trophic networks","162604","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85034069088",,"000415022900041","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Ecotourism is often proposed as a “win–win” solution for developing countries to meet both economic and conservation needs. With the highest number of bird species of any country, including 443 rare species highly valued by bird-watchers, Colombia has a unique opportunity to develop a lucrative and conservation-friendly bird-watching tourism industry in postconflict areas. Through geospatial analysis of conflict zones, bird distributions, protected areas, forest cover, and bird-watching activity, we identify areas of Colombia with unrealized bird-watching potential that are ripe for the development of synergistic conservation-ecotourism projects. An investment in ecotourism infrastructure and training by the Colombian government may be a conservation-friendly alternative to natural resource extraction that could alleviate poverty without degrading natural capital in postconflict Colombia.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000235639",,"1940-0829",,"10.1177/1940082917733862","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/235639","en","Sage","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Colombia||bird-watching||ecotourism||conservation||birds||postconflict||Andes","Economic and Conservation Potential of Bird-Watching Tourism in Postconflict Colombia","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-28T02:22:07Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000422704800001","Trop. conserv. sci",,"Tropical Conservation Science","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To develop appropriate management strategies, we need to understand the reasons for reduced recruitment in degraded ecosystems. The dioecious coco de mer palm (Lodoicea maldivica) produces by far the largest seeds of any plant. It is a keystone species in an ancient palm forest that occurs only on two small islands in the Seychelles, yet contemporary rates of seed production are low, especially in fragmented populations. We developed a method to infer the recent reproductive history of female trees from morphological evidence present on their inflorescences. We then applied this method to investigate the effects of habitat disturbance and soil nutrient conditions on flower and fruit production. The 57 female trees in our sample showed a 19.5-fold variation in flower production among individuals over a seven-year period. Only 77.2% of trees bore developing fruits (or had recently shed fruits), with the number per tree ranging from zero to 43. Flower production was positively correlated with concentrations of available soil nitrogen and potassium and did not differ significantly between closed and degraded habitat. Fruiting success was positively correlated with pollen availability, as measured by numbers and distance of neighboring male trees. Fruit set was lower in degraded habitat than in closed forest, while the proportion of abnormal fruits that failed to develop was higher in degraded habitat. Seed size recorded for a large sample of seeds collected by forest wardens varied widely, with fresh weights ranging from 1 to 18 kg. Synthesis: Shortages of both nutrients and pollen appear to limit seed production of Lodoicea in its natural habitat, with these factors affecting different stages of the reproductive process. Flower production varies widely amongst trees, while seed production is especially low in degraded habitat. The size of seeds is also very variable. We discuss the implications of these findings for managing this ecologically and economically important species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000197769",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.3312","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/197769","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","flower production||fruit abortion||Fruit set||habitat degradation||Lodoicea maldivica||nutrient allocation||Pollen limitation||reproductive ecology||seed size||Seychelles islands","Tracing coco de mer's reproductive history: Pollen and nutrient limitations reduce fecundity","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-19T02:15:06Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85030720158",,"000412523700018","Ecol Evol","19","Ecology and Evolution","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Changes in growth conditions at these ecotones have wide-ranging implications for the provision of ecosystem services in densely populated mountain regions like the European Alps. We quantify climate effects on short- and long-term tree growth responses, focusing on among-tree variability and potential feedback effects. Although among-tree variability is thought to be substantial, it has not been considered systematically yet in studies on growth–climate relationships. We compiled tree-ring data including almost 600 trees of major treeline species (Larix decidua, Picea abies, Pinus cembra, and Pinus mugo) from three climate regions of the Swiss Alps. We further acquired tree size distribution data using unmanned aerial vehicles. To account for among-tree variability, we employed information-theoretic model selections based on linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) with flexible choice of monthly temperature effects on growth. We isolated long-term trends in ring-width indices (RWI) in interaction with elevation. The LMMs revealed substantial amounts of previously unquantified among-tree variability, indicating different strategies of single trees regarding when and to what extent to invest assimilates into growth. Furthermore, the LMMs indicated strongly positive temperature effects on growth during short summer periods across all species, and significant contributions of fall (L. decidua) and current year's spring (L. decidua, P. abies). In the longer term, all species showed consistently positive RWI trends at highest elevations, but different patterns with decreasing elevation. L. decidua exhibited even negative RWI trends compared to the highest treeline sites, whereas P. abies, P. cembra, and P. mugo showed steeper or flatter trends with decreasing elevation. This does not only reflect effects of ameliorated climate conditions on tree growth over time, but also reveals first signs of long-suspected negative and positive feedback of climate change on stand dynamics at treeline.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000197759",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.3290","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/197759","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Among-tree variability||Climate change||climate change feedback||climate–growth relationships||growth increase||Growth trends||treeline","Among-tree variability and feedback effects result in different growth responses to climate change at the upper treeline in the Swiss Alps","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-19T02:14:24Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85030665168",,"000412523700032","Ecol Evol","19","Ecology and Evolution","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Taxonomists and conservationists are engaged in vigorous discussions over the necessity of killing animals for specimen sampling, but quantitative data on taxonomic trends and specimen sampling over time, which could inform these debates, are lacking.  Methods  We interrogated a long-term research database documenting 2,723 land vertebrate and 419 invertebrate taxa from Madagascar, and their associated specimens conserved in the major natural history museums. We further compared specimen collection and species description rates for the birds, mammals and scorpions over the last two centuries, to identify trends and links to taxon descriptions.  Results  We located 15,364 specimens documenting endemic mammals and 11,666 specimens documenting endemic birds collected between 1820 and 2010. Most specimens were collected at the time of the Mission Zoologique Franco-Anglo-Américaine (MZFAA) in the 1930s and during the last two decades, with major differences according to the groups considered. The small mammal and bat collections date primarily from recent years, and are paralleled by the description of new species. Lemur specimens were collected during the MZFAA but the descriptions of new taxa are recent, with the type series limited to non-killed specimens. Bird specimens, particularly of non-passerines, are mainly from the time of the MZFAA. The passerines have also been intensely collected during the last two decades; the new material has been used to solve the phylogeny of the groups and only two new endemic taxa of passerine birds have been described over the last two decades.  Conclusions  Our data show that specimen collection has been critical for advancing our understanding of the taxonomy of Madagascar’s biodiversity at the onset of zoological work in Madagascar, but less so in recent decades. It is crucial to look for alternatives to avoid killing animals in the name of documenting life, and encourage all efforts to share the information attached to historical and recent collections held in natural history museums. In times of conservation crisis and the advancement in digital technologies and open source sharing, it seems obsolete to kill animals in well-known taxonomic groups for the sake of enriching natural history collections around the world.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191724",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0183903","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191724","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"On specimen killing in the era of conservation crisis - A quantitative case for modernizing taxonomy and biodiversity inventories","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:34:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85029408742",,"000410669200023","PLoS ONE","9","PLoS ONE","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we investigate the responses of two co-occurring pines (Pinus nigra and Pinus sylvestris) to interannual drought in east-central Spain by dendrochronological and wood anatomical features integrated with isotopic ratios of carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) in tree rings. Our results showed that drought induces both species to allocate less carbon to build tracheid cell-walls but increases tracheid lumen diameters, particularly in the transition wood between early and latewood, potentially maximizing hydraulic conductivity but reducing resistance to embolism at a critical phase during the growing season. The thicker cell-wall-to-lumen ratio in P. nigra could imply that its xylem may be more resistant to bending stress and drought-induced cavitation than P. sylvestris. In contrast, the higher intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) in P. sylvestris suggests that it relies more on a water-saving strategy. Our results suggest that narrower cell-walls and reduced growth under drought are not necessarily linked to increased iWUE. At our site P. nigra showed a higher growth plasticity, grew faster and was more competitive than P. sylvestris.

The underlying physiological mechanisms are poorly understood, however, particularly regarding chronic effects of long-term drought and the response to increasing temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). We combined analyses of radial growth and stable carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) in tree rings in a mature Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest over the 20th century to elucidate causes of tree mortality in one of the driest parts of the European Alps (Pfynwald, Switzerland). We further compared trees that have recently died with living trees in a 10-year irrigation experiment, where annual precipitation was doubled. We found a sustained growth increase and immediate depletion of δ13C values for irrigated trees, indicating higher stomatal conductance and thus indeed demonstrating that water is a key limiting factor for growth. Growth of the now-dead trees started declining in the mid-1980s, when both mean temperature and VPD increased strongly. But growth of these trees was reduced to some extent already several decades earlier, while intrinsic water-use efficiency derived from δ13C values was higher. This indicates a more conservative water-use strategy compared with surviving trees, possibly at the cost of low carbon uptake and long-term reduction of the needle mass. We observed reduced climatic sensitivity of raw tree-ring δ13C for the now-dead in contrast to surviving trees, indicating impaired stomatal regulation, although this difference between the tree groups was smaller after detrending the data. Higher autocorrelation and a lower inter-annual δ13C variability of the now-dead trees further indicates a strong dependence on (low) carbon reserves. We conclude that the recent increase in atmospheric moisture demand in combination with insufficient soil water supply was the main trigger for mortality of those trees that were weakened by long-term reduced carbon uptake.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190975",,"0829-318X||1758-4469",,"10.1093/treephys/tpx041","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190975","en","Oxford University Press","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Climate change||tree decline||tree mortality||vapor pressure deficit||water-use efficiency","Long-term effects of drought on tree-ring growth and carbon isotope variability in Scots pine in a dry environment","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:42:44Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85031928597",,"000409249000005",,"8","Tree Physiology","37","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we report the high rate of molecular evolution in Lycaenidae and Riodinidae compared to other families of butterflies (Papilionoidea). We assembled a phylogeny of butterflies using eight molecular markers and comprising 4,891 species. We found that the rate of molecular evolution is higher in Lycaenidae and Riodinidae compared to the other families, but only the nuclear protein coding sequence Wingless showed a marked difference, while Elongation factor 1-alpha showed a more moderate difference. In contrast, Cytochrome Oxidase subunit 1 showed no difference between Lyacenidae and Riodinidae, and other butterflies. In parallel, we calculated the rates of diversification in all subfamilies of the Papilionoidea using the method-of-moments estimator for stem-group ages, which does not require a fully solved phylogeny for the target clades. We found that the Lycaeninae lineage, from the Lycaenidae family had the highest rate of diversification among all lineages. Among the life-history traits that could explain differences in molecular evolution and diversification rate, lycaenids display mutualistic or antagonistic interactions with ants, a higher level of host plant specialization and reduced dispersal abilities compared to other butterfly families. Since the current study is limited by a unique contrast, the relationship with traits cannot be evaluated statistically. Future studies should measure myrmecophily and dispersal abilities quantitatively across a more detailed phylogeny of lycaenids to test for an association between shifts in the strength of mutualism, rates of molecular evolution and the diversification of lineages.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000201935",,"2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2017.00090","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/201935","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","myrmecophily||diversification rate||molecular evolution||population size||mutualism","High rate of protein coding sequence evolution and species diversification in the lycaenids","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-28T02:33:35Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Lif3web: The present and future spatial structure of tri-trophic networks","162604","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85031750680",,,"Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Skies were generally clear over the Swiss Alps due to a persistent high-pressure band between the UK and Russia associated with a rather weak pressure gradient over the continent. To assess the effects of penumbral shading on near-surface meteorology across Switzerland, air temperature data measured at 10-minute intervals at 184 MeteoSwiss weather stations that reported air temperature at 10-minute intervals were used. Wind speed and direction data were available from 165 of these stations. Additionally, six Swiss FluxNet eddy covariance flux (ECF) sites provided turbulent measurements at 20 Hz resolution.  During maximum occultation the temperature drop was up to 5.8 K at a mountain site where cold air can pool in the topographic depression of the weather station. The bootstrapped average of the maximum temperature drops of all 184 MeteoSwiss sites during the solar eclipse was 1.51 ± 0.02 K (mean ± SE). A detailed comparison with literature values since 1834 showed a temperature decrease by 2.6 ± 1.7 K (average of all reports) with extreme values up to 11 K. On fair weather days under weak larger scale pressure gradients, local thermo-topographic wind systems develop that are driven by small-scale pressure and temperature gradients. At one ECF site, the penumbral shading delayed the morning transition from down-valley to up-valley wind conditions, and at another site, it prevented this transition from occurring at all. Data from the 165 MeteoSwiss sites measuring wind direction did not show a consistent pattern of wind direction response to the passing of the penumbral shadow.  These results suggest that the local topographic setting had an important influence on the temperature drop and the wind flow patterns during the eclipse. Still, results tend to lend support to a recent theory that the anticyclonic cold-air outflow from the center of the eclipse only extends ≈ 1600 km outwards, with cyclonic flow beyond that distance. This contrasts with an earlier theory that the anticyclonic outflow should reach as far as ≈ 2400 km from the center of the eclipse, which would have included all of Switzerland during the 2015 eclipse. Nevertheless, a significant cyclonic effect of the passing penumbral shadow was found in the elevation range ≈ 1700–2700 m a.s.l., but not at lower elevations of the Swiss Plateau. Thus, measurable effects of penumbral shading on the local wind system could be even found at ≈ 2000 km from the path of the eclipse (that is, Switzerland during the 2015 eclipse).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000211219",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-2017-321","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/211219","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Effects of vernal equinox solar eclipse on temperatures and wind directions in Switzerland","Working Paper","Open access",,,"2017-11-21T12:26:55Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atmos. chem. phys. discuss.",,"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, this common methodology is potentially biased because the number of collisions may simply reflect prevalence of species at the study site rather than species-specific vulnerability. Building on recent studies of abundance and collision rates, we offered a complementary methodology based on point count data that could be widely applied alongside carcass surveys. Additionally, we broadened our analysis beyond previously applied taxonomic and migratory classifications to include functional classifications of feeding guild, breeding status, and synanthropy. Our null hypothesis was that collision frequencies reflect a species’ or classification group’s prevalence at study sites. To test this possibility, we used collision data collected at three sites in the Research Triangle Area of North Carolina, United States. At one of these sites, Duke University’s Main Campus, we also gathered relative abundances from the local bird community to develop a case study assessment of how background prevalence compared to number of collisions. Using the larger, three-site dataset, we developed an initial picture of collision susceptibility based solely on frequency, the standard practice. Then, by bootstrapping our Duke abundance data, we generated confidence intervals that simulated collision based on chance versus prevalence. We identified several instances where collision tallies produced misleading perception of species-specific vulnerability. In the most extreme case, frequencies from our Triangle Area dataset indicated locally breeding species were highly vulnerable to collisions while our abundance-based case study suggested this same group was actually adept at avoiding collisions. Through our case study, we also found that foliage gleaning was linked to increased risk, and omnivory and ground foraging were associated with decreased risk. Although our results are based on a limited sample, we argue that abundance needs to be incorporated into future studies and recommend point counts as a noninvasive and adaptable alternative to area-searches and mist netting.    Traits spécifiques à l'espèce et abondance affectent la fréquence des collisions d'oiseaux aux fenêtres   Les études sur les collisions d'oiseaux aux fenêtres infèrent généralement la vulnérabilité d'une espèce à partir des décomptes de collisions. Toutefois, cette méthodologie fréquemment utilisée est potentiellement biaisée parce que le nombre de collision reflète simplement la prévalence de certaines espèces au site d'étude plutôt que la vulnérabilité réelle de l'espèce. À partir des récentes études d'abondance et de taux de collision, nous offrons une méthodologie complémentaire basée sur des recensements ponctuels qui pourrait être appliquée à large échelle en parallèle avec les décomptes de carcasses. De plus, nous avons élargit nos analyses au-delà des classifications taxonomiques et migratoires utilisées auparavant, afin d'inclure les classifications fonctionnelles de guilde alimentaire, statut de reproduction, et le facteur de synanthropie. Notre hypothèse nulle est que la fréquence des collisions reflète une prévalence d'une espèce ou d'un groupe de même classe au site d'étude. Afin de tester cette possibilité, nous avons utilisé les données de collision collectées sur trois sites dans la Zone Triangle de Recherche en Caroline du Nord, aux États-Unis. Sur l'un des sites, le Campus Principal de l'Université de Duke, nous avons aussi amassé les abondances relatives de la communauté locale aviaire, afin de développer une étude de cas sur la comparaison de la prévalence en arrière-plan et le nombre de collision. Utilisant la banque de donnée des trois sites, plus vaste, nous avons développé une image initiale de susceptibilité de collision basée seulement sur la fréquence, la méthode courante. Ensuite, en utilisant le bootstrap sur nos données d'abondance de Duke, nous avons généré des intervalles de confiance simulant les collisions basées par chance comparé à la prévalence. Nous avons identifié plusieurs instances où les totaux de collisions ont produit une fausse perception de vulnérabilité spécifique due à l'espèce. Dans les cas les plus extrêmes, nos données de la Zone Triangle indiquèrent que les espèces se reproduisant localement étaient grandement vulnérable aux collisions, alors que notre étude de cas basée sur l'abondance suggérait que ce même groupe était adepte à éviter les collisions. À partir de notre étude de cas, nous avons aussi découvert que les glaneurs de feuillage étaient liés à un risque plus élevé, alors que l'omnivorisme et l'alimentation au sol étaient associés à une diminution du risque. Malgré que nos résultats soient basés sur un échantillon limité, nous avançons que l'abondance devrait être incluse dans les études futures et recommandons l'utilisation de recensements ponctuels comme alternative adaptable et non-invasive au-lieu de d'aires de décomptes ou de filets japonais.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000178648",,,,"10.5751/ace-01014-120117","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/178648","en","Resilience Alliance","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","carcass survey||classifications||collision vulnerability||local abundance||point count||window strikes","Species traits and local abundance affect bird-window collision frequency","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-08-18T11:46:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000404117000017",,"1","Avian Conservation and Ecology","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

CO2) concentration, and atmospheric pollutants will impact carbon sequestration in forested ecosystems. Although the individual roles of these environmental factors on tree growth are understood, analyses examining their simultaneous effects are lacking. We used tree-ring isotopic data and structural equation modeling to examine the concurrent and interacting effects of water availability, atm. CO2 concentration, and SO4 and nitrogen deposition on two broadleaf tree species in a temperate mesic forest in the northeastern US. Water availability was the strongest driver of gas exchange and tree growth. Wetter conditions since the 1980s have enhanced stomatal conductance, photosynthetic assimilation rates and, to a lesser extent, tree radial growth. Increased water availability seemingly overrides responses to reduced acid deposition, CO2 fertilization, and nitrogen deposition. Our results indicate that water availability as a driver of ecosystem productivity in mesic temperate forests is not adequately represented in DGVMs, while CO2 fertilization is likely overrepresented. This study emphasizes the importance to simultaneously consider interacting climatic and biogeochemical drivers when assessing forest responses to global environmental changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000241201",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/srep46158","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/241201","en","Springer Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Water availability drives gas exchange and growth of trees in northeastern US, not elevated CO2 and reduced acid deposition","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-02-15T13:35:03Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we explore the spectrum of current practice in hypothesis formulation and testing in hydrology, based on a random sample of recent research papers. This analysis suggests that in hydrology, as in other fields, hypothesis formulation and testing rarely correspond to the idealized model of the scientific method. Practices such as “p-hacking” or “HARKing” (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) are major obstacles to more rigorous hypothesis testing in hydrology, along with the well-known problem of confirmation bias—the tendency to value and trust confirmations more than refutations—among both researchers and reviewers. Nonetheless, as several examples illustrate, hypothesis tests have played an essential role in spurring major advances in hydrological theory. Hypothesis testing is not the only recipe for scientific progress, however. Exploratory research, driven by innovations in measurement and observation, has also underlain many key advances. Further improvements in observation and measurement will be vital to both exploratory research and hypothesis testing, and thus to advancing the science of hydrology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000130308",,"0043-1397||1944-7973",,"10.1002/2016WR020116","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/130308","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Debates-Hypothesis testing in hydrology: Theory and practice","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:47:14Z",,,,"pub:193314","yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365565d055625867","010838393","85016926550",,"000400160500005","Water Resour.

However, productivity and disturbances are intrinsically linked because 1) disturbances directly affect forest productivity (e.g. via a reduction in leaf area, growing stock or resource-use efficiency), and 2) disturbance susceptibility is often coupled to a certain development phase of the forest with productivity determining the time a forest is in this specific phase of susceptibility. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of forest productivity changes in different forest regions in Europe under climate change, and partition these changes into effects induced by climate change alone and by climate change and disturbances. We present projections of climate change impacts on forest productivity from state-of-the-art forest models that dynamically simulate forest productivity and the effects of the main European disturbance agents (fire, storm, insects), driven by the same climate scenario in seven forest case studies along a large climatic gradient throughout Europe. Our study shows that, in most cases, including disturbances in the simulations exaggerate ongoing productivity declines or cancel out productivity gains in response to climate change. In fewer cases, disturbances also increase productivity or buffer climate-change induced productivity losses, e.g. because low severity fires can alleviate resource competition and increase fertilization. Even though our results cannot simply be extrapolated to other types of forests and disturbances, we argue that it is necessary to interpret climate change-induced productivity and disturbance changes jointly to capture the full range of climate change impacts on forests and to plan adaptation measures.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191870",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aa5ef1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191870","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Fire||forest models||forest productivity-disturbances-climate change interactions||insects||storms||trade-offs","Are forest disturbances amplifying or canceling out climate change-induced productivity changes in European forests?","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:47:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85021024065",,"000397803200007","Environ.

Unravelling species responses to past climatic variations might provide clues on the consequence of ongoing changes. Here, we tested the relationship between changes in sea surface temperature and sea levels during the Quaternary and present-day distributions of coral reef fish species. We investigated whether species-specific responses are associated with life-history traits. We collected a database of coral reef fish distribution together with life-history traits for the Indo-Pacific Ocean. We ran species distribution models (SDMs) on 3,725 tropical reef fish species using contemporary environmental factors together with a variable describing isolation from stable coral reef areas during the Quaternary. We quantified the variance explained independently by isolation from stable areas in the SDMs and related it to a set of species traits including body size and mobility. The variance purely explained by isolation from stable coral reef areas on the distribution of extant coral reef fish species largely varied across species. We observed a triangular relationship between the contribution of isolation from stable areas in the SDMs and body size. Species, whose distribution is more associated with historical changes, occurred predominantly in the Indo-Australian archipelago, where the mean size of fish assemblages is the lowest. Our results suggest that the legacy of habitat changes of the Quaternary is still detectable in the extant distribution of many fish species, especially those with small body size and the most sedentary. Because they were the least able to colonize distant habitats in the past, fish species with smaller body size might have the most pronounced lags in tracking ongoing climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000129147",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.2800","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/129147","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Dispersal||Indo-Pacific Ocean||Species distribution models","Responses of coral reef fishes to past climate changes are related to life-history traits","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:12:19Z",,,,"pub:192106","yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936554fd74fc77922","010851048","85013761156",,"000397458000030","Ecol Evol","6","Ecology and Evolution","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We undertook a systematic review of the scientific literature to illuminate this relationship and found a limited scientific basis for policymaking. Our results indicate that knowledge on the sustainable development impacts of bioenergy production is concentrated in a few well-studied countries, focuses on environmental and economic impacts, and mostly relates to dedicated agricultural biomass plantations. The scope and methodological approaches in studies differ widely and only a small share of the studies sufficiently reports on context and/or baseline conditions, which makes it difficult to get a general understanding of the attribution of impacts. Nevertheless, we identified regional patterns of positive or negative impacts for all categories – environmental, economic, institutional, social and technological. In general, economic and technological impacts were more frequently reported as positive, while social and environmental impacts were more frequently reported as negative (with the exception of impacts on direct substitution of GHG emission from fossil fuel). More focused and transparent research is needed to validate these patterns and develop a strong science underpinning for establishing policies and governance agreements that prevent/mitigate negative and promote positive impacts from bioenergy production.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000115182",,"1757-1693||1757-1707","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/199896||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/115182","10.1111/gcbb.12338","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/206678","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Agriculture||Bioenergy||Food Security||Forestry||Mitigation||Sustainable development","Bioenergy production and sustainable development: Science base for policymaking remains limited","Review Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture","2017-06-12T04:17:33Z",,,,"pub:177000","yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936544e93eac37645",,"84962628854",,"000402740900005","Glob.

This is especially true for United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) biosphere reserves, which are expected to function as models for sustainable development. Economic development has been achieved in many places through nature-based tourism. Sale of products labeled as coming from protected areas is considered promising in this respect too, especially in Europe, but their economic impact has not been assessed so far. This study estimated the gross added value generated by labeled products from the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Entlebuch—a rural, mountainous region in Switzerland. After a management-guided phase of building up credibility, identity, and innovations, labeled products generated a remarkable gross added value of US$ 5.8 million in 2014, 13 years after the product label was introduced. This corresponds to 4% of the jobs in agriculture and forestry and 1% of all jobs in the region. Given potential synergies with biodiversity, tourism, individual well-being, and other assets, labeled products can be true advantages for protected areas and their managers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000129090",,"0276-4741||1994-7151",,"10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-16-00067.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/129090","en","International Mountain Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Added value||Agriculture||Biosphere reserve||Forestry||Labeled products||Regional economy||Switzerland||UNESCO","The Economic Impact of Labeled Regional Products: The Experience of the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Entlebuch","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:09:34Z",,,,"pub:192049","yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936554e9a82159691","010844439","85014096025",,,"Mt. res. dev.","1","Mountain Research and Development","37","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Etna (Italy), an enhanced Normalized Difference in Vegetation Index (NDVI) signature was detected in the summers of 2001 and 2002 along a distinct line where, in November 2002, a flank eruption subsequently occurred. These observations suggest that pre-eruptive volcanic activity may have enhanced photosynthesis along the future eruptive fissure. If a direct relation between NDVI and future volcanic eruptions could be established, it would provide a straightforward and low-cost method for early detection of upcoming eruptions. However, it is unclear if, or to what extent, the observed enhancement of NDVI can be attributed to volcanic activity prior to the subsequent eruption. We consequently aimed at determining whether an increase in ambient temperature or additional water availability owing to the rise of magma and degassing of water vapour prior to the eruption could have increased photosynthesis of Mt. Etna's trees. Using dendro-climatic analyses we quantified the sensitivity of tree ring widths to temperature and precipitation at high elevation stands on Mt. Etna. Our findings suggest that tree growth at high elevation on Mt. Etna is weakly influenced by climate, and that neither an increase in water availability nor an increase in temperature induced by pre-eruptive activity is a plausible mechanism for enhanced photosynthesis before the 2002/2003 flank eruption. Our findings thus imply that other, yet unknown, factors must be sought as causes of the pre-eruption enhancement of NDVI on Mt. Etna.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000126858",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0169297","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/126858","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate||Environmental temperature||Italy||Photosynthesis||Precipitation||Quantitative study||Summer||Tree growth||Vegetation||Volcano||Water availability||Water vapor","Insensitivity of Tree-Ring Growth to Temperature and Precipitation Sharpens the Puzzle of Enhanced Pre-Eruption NDVI on Mt.

One sub-population of the capercaillie is located in the Entlebuch UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. The margins of one of its territories are increasingly used by snowshoe hikers and ski tourers at the capercaillie’s most vulnerable time, during winter. In order to identify and monitor possible interferences, we tested whether drones can help to detect snowshoe and ski tourer tracks in the winter landscape and whether there is any reaction of wildlife to the drones. Results indicate that certain environmental conditions are needed to carry out accurate drone flights, but that with optimal technical and aeronautical settings, it is possible to gain aerial images that allow winter activities by humans to be identified, and even quantified. No disturbances to wildlife were identified. The findings indicate that drones can be used as a low-cost monitoring tool for detecting human winter activities in remote places, which represent a fast-growing threat to wildlife in mountain areas.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000128888",,"2073-106X||2073-1558",,"10.1553/eco.mont-9-1s30","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128888","en","Innsbruck University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Capercaillie||Drone||Monitoring||Ski touring||Snowshoe||UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Entlebuch||Unmanned Aerial Vehicle||Winter","Using drones as a monitoring tool to detect evidence of winter sports activities in a protected mountain area","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:03:34Z",,,,"pub:191817","yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936554a6b72538276","010850272","85011994890",,"000394856300005",,"1","eco.mont: Journal on Protected Mountain Areas Research and Management","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These models also typically ignore topographically driven lateral redistribution of water (either as groundwater or surface flows), both within and between model grid cells. Here, we present a first attempt to quantify the effects of spatial heterogeneity and lateral redistribution on grid-cell-averaged evapotranspiration (ET) as seen from the atmosphere over heterogeneous landscapes. Our approach uses Budyko curves, as a simple model of ET as a function of atmospheric forcing by P and PET. From these Budyko curves, we derive a simple sub-grid closure relation that quantifies how spatial heterogeneity affects average ET as seen from the atmosphere. We show that averaging over sub-grid heterogeneity in P and PET, as typical Earth system models do, leads to overestimations of average ET. For a sample high-relief grid cell in the Himalayas, this overestimation bias is shown to be roughly 12%; for adjacent lower-relief grid cells, it is substantially smaller. We use a similar approach to derive sub-grid closure relations that quantify how lateral redistribution of water could alter average ET as seen from the atmosphere. We derive expressions for the maximum possible effect of lateral redistribution on average ET, and the amount of lateral redistribution required to achieve this effect, using only estimates of P and PET in possible source and recipient locations as inputs. We show that where the aridity index P/PET increases with altitude, gravitationally driven lateral redistribution will increase average ET (and models that overlook lateral redistribution will underestimate average ET). Conversely, where the aridity index P/PET decreases with altitude, gravitationally driven lateral redistribution will decrease average ET. The effects of both sub-grid heterogeneity and lateral redistribution will be most pronounced where P is inversely correlated with PET across the landscape. Our analysis provides first-order estimates of the magnitudes of these sub-grid effects, as a guide for more detailed modeling and analysis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000126791",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-21-217-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/126791","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"A Budyko framework for estimating how spatial heterogeneity and lateral moisture redistribution affect average evapotranspiration rates as seen from the atmosphere","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T19:03:39Z",,,,"pub:189574","yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365525e11c631298",,"85009291537",,"000393786300002","Hydrol.

Coffee is one of the main tropical agroforestry crops and of global economic importance. Over recent decades, coffee agroforestry systems have been increasingly intensified by the replacement of native shade tree diversity with one or few, often non-native, tree species. Such reduction in tree diversity might have implications for ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling, soil fertility, pest control, and coffee production, and ultimately negative effects for the systems’ resilience to climate change.  The overall aim of this thesis is to investigate the direct and indirect effects of tree diversity reduction on ecosystem services, to understand the arising management trade-offs for Coffea canephora production in the face of climate change. We therefore studied 25 agroforestry systems in Kodagu, India, across a broad rainfall and management gradient, which experience a gradual transformation of native diverse shade tree canopy to Grevillea robusta dominated shade. Climate change is expected to alter the intense monsoon rainfalls during the short, wet season by an increase in the east and a reduction in the west.  The results show that the transformation towards G. robusta dominated shade has not only highly negative effects for tree diversity but also for coffee production and quality. Both coffee production and quality were lower under G. robusta dominating shade. This resulted mainly from the increased development of single-seeded fruits (pea-beans), likely a result from reduced pollination success, and higher infestation rates of the coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei. This suggests that pest control and pollination services are reduced in monospecific agroforestry systems.   Grevillea robusta shade reduced nutrient cycling and long-term soil fertility. In contrast to native trees, G. robusta leaf litter shedding was more dependent on the annual rainfall, which reduced litterfall in wet sites to negligible amounts. Low litter quality and reduced decomposition rates characterize G. robusta dominated agroforests, and this led to low soil fertility and a decline in soil carbon contents, particularly in wet sites. The specific characteristic of G. robusta, being a Proteaceae, reduced phosphor cycling by increasing the immobilization of the same. Although, we did not find evidence for increased nutrient limitation in C. canephora leaves under G. robusta shade, the loss of soil carbon reduces soil fertility and nutrient availability over the long-term, which will likely demand higher nutrient inputs in the future.  Microclimate and soil moisture was negatively altered under G. robusta monospecific shade compared to native diverse agroforests. Low soil carbon was one of the main drivers for lower soil moisture under G. robusta, which increased nutrient leaching. This, together with higher relative air humidity, reduced coffee production in monospecific shade. While high monsoon rainfall reduced coffee production in all agroforestry types, throughfall reduction benefitted coffee plants less under G. robusta dominated shade, in which high nutrient leaching resulted in a lower final berry-set.  In conclusion, we provide strong evidence that there are no trade-offs, but synergies between tree diversity, coffee production and resilience to climate change. A shade cover dominated by G. robusta affects ecosystem resilience by causing: (1) increased pest attacks likely due to a loss of complex multi-trophic interactions; (2) reduced nutrient cycling and loss of soil carbon, reducing soil fertility in the long-term; (3) reduction of soil moisture and increase of nutrient leaching likely via runoff; (4) increased relative humidity potentially due to higher transpiration of the fast-growing G. robusta. These characteristics of G. robusta dominance negatively affect coffee production and quality, and reduce the agroforestry systems’ resilience to climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000239904",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/239904","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Coffea canephora||ecosystem services||India||Kodagu||climate change||tree diversity||Grevillea robusta||nutrient cycle||rainfall gradient","Managing Trade-Offs in Coffee Agroforests","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences","2018-02-10T16:28:48Z","2019-02-12",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24800",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The two ecosystems that are separated by this ecotone – the subalpine forest and the alpine tundra – provide essential ecosystem goods and services (EGS) in densely populated mountain regions like the European Alps. Ongoing global climate change with its temperature increase affects the major limiting factor of tree growth close to treeline. Moreover, mountain regions have experienced a more pronounced temperature increase than the global average, and this is expected to continue into the future, with far-reaching consequences for forest dynamics at treeline and therefore also for the EGS provided by both ecosystem types. Although the alpine treeline has attracted scientific interest for centuries, understanding the interplay between factors influencing treeline formation and subalpine forest dynamics, especially at the regional to local scale, remains a challenge. To reliably quantify the consequences of global warming for subalpine forests approaching treeline, an in-depth understanding of the large-scale drivers is required, but also of the regional- to local-scale modulators of tree population dynamics.   The aim of this PhD thesis is to enhance this understanding by means of empirical analyses of the past and simulations of future treeline dynamics. In particular, I wanted to (i) identify the climatic drivers of short-term tree growth dynamics, reveal the underlying functional form of the growthtemperature relationship, and elucidate the role of inter- and intra-species variability in modulating the growth response of trees; (ii) scrutinize the relative importance of air and soil temperature variables for determining individual tree growth; (iii) assess treeline dynamics at larger spatial and temporal scales, by exploring the causes of population-wide long-term growth trends, and by isolating important regional- to local-scale drivers of tree population dynamics; and (iv) synoptically validate all these findings regarding their importance as drivers of treeline dynamics, which then allows to robustly explore the development of forest dynamics at and directly below treeline under changing climatic conditions. All analyses of my PhD thesis use the three study sites Bosco/Gurin, Hohgant and Zermatt. They experience three distinct climate regimes of the Swiss Alps (Southern, Northern and Central Alps) and are representative for a variety of prevailing growth conditions.  In Part I, I analyzed the effects of past climate variability on short- to long-term tree growth dynamics, with a focus on among-tree variability and potential climate change feedback effects. Even though previous research had suggested among-tree variability to be of large significance, it has not yet been systematically considered in studies of tree growth dynamics. Thus, I conducted a dendroecological study of four major tree species (Picea abies, Larix decidua, Pinus cembra, Pinus mugo) and employed linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) to quantify climate influences on short- and long-term growth dynamics. LMMs simultaneously capture among-tree variability and feedback effects due to inter-species competition. These results were complemented with stand-level analyses of size and age structure using a combination of remotely sensed and field-sampled data. The LMMs revealed large amounts of previously unquantified among-tree variability regarding when and to what extent individual trees invest assimilates into growth. Furthermore, the LMMs indicated strongly positive temperature effects on growth during short summer periods across all species, and significant contributions of fall conditions (L. decidua). Furthermore, the influence of snow was implicitly indicated by current year’s spring effects (L. decidua, P. abies). In the longer term, all species showed positive growth trends at the highest elevations, but indifferent patterns with just slightly decreasing elevation. Larix decidua exhibited even negative growth trends just below treeline, whereas P. abies, P. cembra, and P. mugo showed a range of positive trends with decreasing elevation. Clearly, the population-wide positive response at the highest elevations reflected the effects of ameliorated climatic conditions over time, but at the same time it revealed the prominent role of among-tree variability in controlling the response of treeline growth dynamics to climate change. Due to increased competition, first signs of long-suspected negative feedback effects of climate change on stand dynamics at treeline emerged.   In Part II, I further scrutinized the role of temperature as the most important determinant of tree growth as the cold edge of a species’ distribution is approached. Both radial and height growth of trees are determined by several interlinked processes, which exhibit different reactions to temperature. I unraveled the relative importance of (i) soil vs. air temperature, (ii) absolute temperatures vs. time-integrated temperatures, and (iii) reserves from the previous growing season for annual radial tree growth, and I attempted to capture the form of the functional relationship between temperature and growth. To this end, I measured long-term, high-resolution (both spatially and temporally) air and soil temperature along elevational transects at each study site and paired them with basal area increment (BAI) data. In addition, I covered the temporal component, i.e. past and present climate variability. Hence, I was able to quantify the growth reactions to temporal as opposed to spatial variability. Close to treeline, BAI of all species depended on integrated rather than absolute temperatures. While BAI was best explained by combining air temperature of the previous and current growing seasons, soil temperature was important only at Bosco/Gurin, a site with extensive snow cover in late winter/spring. When moving down from upper treeline, the temperature-growth relationship was strongly non-linear, showing a rapid decrease of temperature limitation and an increasing importance of other growth-determining factors. For the last 50 years, temperatures have been rising substantially at all sites, with isotherms moving upward 160–260m in elevation. The threshold-dependence of growth to temperature has led to a positive trend of BAI over time, which consequently was consistent throughout the population only at highest elevations.  In Part III, I employed the dynamic forest succession model ForClim to assess the ecological relevance of different abiotic and biotic factors driving subalpine forest dynamics, which were partly derived from the first two parts. To this end, I evaluated different model variants based on their capability to reproduce observed individual-tree and stand-scale properties derived from (i) my dendroecological data, (ii) forest size structure as remotely sensed and measured in the field, and (iii) in-situ temperature data from the study sites. Subsequently, using the best model and climate change scenarios, I projected the future development of treeline elevation, growth dynamics of the subalpine forest and its species composition. This mechanistic approach revealed a pivotal role of the precipitation regime in modulating growth conditions at treeline. Precipitation mainly controlled incoming radiation and, via the snow melt date, determined the start of the growing season. Projections of subalpine forest dynamics under future climate suggested substantial changes compared to present-day conditions in all three Alpine regions that I studied. Only after a lag of ca. 100 years, the subalpine forest moved uphill by several 100m even under the low-end climate change scenario. Simultaneously, a strong immigration of montane forest species at the lower end of the present-day subalpine forest became apparent.   Overall, I showed that the reaction of treeline forest dynamics to past and future climates is strongly influenced by temperature variability. At the same time, it is significantly modulated by other abiotic forcings such as the precipitation regime and biotic drivers like the substantial among-tree growth variability or competition effects. These drivers act on different spatial scales, from climatic regions down to the individual tree and tree-specific structures such as roots vs. needles. Consequently, it is a misconception to assume that increased temperatures due to climate change generally ameliorate growth conditions at treeline. The highly non-linear relationship between radial tree growth and temperature leads to a pronounced increase in growth variability, just after the temperature limitation is overcome. This behavior is due to other growth-limiting factors setting in, but also partly founded in the previously unquantified among-tree variability. Declining growth trends with decreasing elevation may indicate negative feedback effects of climate change on tree growth due to increased stem density. In addition, the precipitation regime significantly modulates growth conditions at treeline, first by controlling cloud cover, air humidity and therefore the direct radiation energy available to the trees, and second through the amount of snow, thus restricting the period during which trees can actually grow.   In summary, the growth of trees at treeline reacts strongly to climate variability but is also decisively modulated by regional- to local-scale drivers. This can go as far as reversing the per se positive implications of increasing temperatures for tree growth close to its cold limit. Consequently, considering the above-mentioned population-internal and -external processes on smaller spatial scales allows for a significantly more reliable assessment of climate impacts on tree growth.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000264159",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/264159","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Forest Ecology||Dendrochronology||Mountain forest dynamics||Mountain forest||Treeline||Swiss Alps||Forest succession model||ForClim||Forest succession||Mountain forest ecology||Treeline dynamics||Tree rings","Treelines in the Swiss Alps: Growth Dynamics and Forest Succession in a Changing Climate","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2018-05-14T20:07:48Z","2019-05-15",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24759",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Higher recovery ratios were observed in central, northeast and southwest China, with lower recovery ratios seen in east, south and northwest China, and the recovery in central China significantly reached the primary forests (reference) level. Concerning logging histories, the recovery ratios showed two peak values, with one at 21–40 years after clear cutting and the other at 61–80 years.

It is therefore of crucial importance to understand the effects of a changing climate and changing disturbance regimes on forest dynamics. To date, most studies of forest dynamics have focused on trees, thus neglecting the herbaceous understorey (e.g., grass, ferns, herbs) although an increasing number of empirical studies suggest that the interaction between herbs and trees can profoundly alter forest dynamics. In particular, competition for light and water by the herbaceous understorey has been shown to change the structure and composition of tree regeneration, and thus to delay and potentially even arrest forest succession. When ignoring this interaction, thresholds in ecosystem responses to changing climate and disturbance regimes may remain undetected. However, due to the restrictions of empirical studies little is known on the implications of overstorey-understorey interactions for forest dynamics at larger spatio-temporal scales.  Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) have been developed to overcome this restriction and explore vegetation dynamics at large temporal scales (>100 years). Among the various types of DVMs, forest landscape models (FLMs) are specifically designed to investigate vegetation interactions under changing climate and disturbance regimes at large spatial scales. I used the process-based FLM LandClim to investigate the long-term effect of overstorey-understorey interactions on forest dynamics in central European landscapes, specifically focusing on (1) competition for light in mesic forest landscapes, (2) competition for water under present and future climate conditions in a drought-prone landscape, and (3) the potential of disturbances (browsing, windthrow, timber harvest) to promote delayed and arrested succession.  In Chapter I, I implemented an understorey component in the FLM LandClim, with a focus on competition for light as the main mode of interaction. Simulation results for two mesic landscapes in Central Europe (Feldberg in the Black Forest and Dischma valley in the central Alps) showed spatio-temporal patterns that were in line with trends reported in empirical studies from chronosequences and species elevation distributions. The presence of an herbaceous understorey had a strong impact on tree regeneration and forest growth during early succession, but a much smaller effect on the late-successional stage. Also, the strength of overstorey-understorey interactions varied considerably across the landscape, causing large delays in forest growth at low and mid-elevations. Furthermore, the understorey was found to act as a differential filter for tree establishment, inducing a shift towards more shade-tolerant species, which translated into altered overstorey composition for up to 200 years. I was thus able to upscale the effects of understorey competition that are evident from empirical studies at the plot level (i.e., a few square metres) and at the short time scale (<10 years), and provide support for the long-standing claim that herbaceous vegetation can alter successional trajectories also at large spatio-temporal scales.  In Chapter II, I extended the water balance model of LandClim to explore the long-term implications of competition for water between herbs, saplings and adult trees for forest structure and composition under present and future climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The new water balance model captured the main empirical patterns of the understorey contribution to stand evapotranspiration across a European gradient. When applied to the drought-prone study landscape Valais in southwestern Switzerland, the new version of LandClim produced changes in regeneration density and biomass as well as shifts in tree species that were consistent with empirical data and expected trends for the region. Under present climate, herbaceous understorey affected tree regeneration mainly at the most drought-prone landscape positions (i.e., south-facing, low-elevation slopes). Under future climate change, in particular under the RCP8.5 scenario, extreme drought events caused extensive overstorey mortality and induced a phase of intensive competition between trees and herbaceous vegetation. At the driest landscape positions, this led to the formation of an open, savannah-like vegetation. Overall, I demonstrated in this chapter that water competition by the herbaceous understorey can cause long-lasting legacy effects on forest structure and composition, and thus I conclude that DVMs that do not consider the herbaceous understorey are at risk of underestimating the impacts of severe drought events.  In Chapter III, I used this new LandClim version to systematically explore the effect of different disturbances on competition between herbaceous vegetation and trees across four study landscapes representing a trans-Alpine environmental gradient. Specifically, I investigated which abiotic, biotic and disturbance conditions are most important for causing arrested succession, and which time scale needs to be considered to differentiate between delayed and arrested succession. The results suggest that arrested succession as a stable herbaceous state is indeed possible in temperate forests, particularly when herbaceous competition and browsing jointly induce a strong establishment filter. Overall, abiotic conditions consistently influenced the probability of arrested succession, which became increasingly likely towards warmer, drier conditions. Furthermore, I was able to identify a time scale to distinguish between arrested and delayed succession: if a forested state (in terms of ≥ 10% canopy cover) is not reached within 100 years after a disturbance, there is a high likelihood of permanently arrested succession. This chapter thus provides an important step towards resolving the controversy about the existence of arrested succession in temperate forests, and clarifying its distinction from delayed succession.  In this thesis, I was able to demonstrate the importance of the often neglected herbaceous understorey by bridging the gap between the small-scale vegetation interaction between herbs and trees and its large-scale implication for forest landscape dynamics. Based on my results, I recommend considering herbaceous understorey in DVMs, particularly if they are applied in the context of (1) early successional dynamics, (2) impacts of climatic extreme events, particularly drought, (3) the long-term effect of browsing, and (4) effects of overstorey disturbances. Herbaceous vegetation is an integral component of forest ecosystems, and studies neglecting its influence are likely to overlook an essential vegetation interaction which can lead to drastically different forest responses to changing climate and disturbance regimes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000213888",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/213888","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","SUCCESSION + VEGETATION DYNAMICS (PLANT SOCIOLOGY)||Forest Ecology||Vegetation dynamics||Herbaceous vegetation||Arrested succession||Browsing||Windthrow||HARVESTING OF FOREST PRODUCTS, LOGGING, ETC.

Skies were generally clear over the Swiss Alps due to a persistent high-pressure band between the UK and Russia associated with a rather weak pressure gradient over the continent. To assess the effects of penumbral shading on near-surface meteorology across Switzerland, air temperature data measured at 10-minute intervals at 184 MeteoSwiss weather stations that reported air temperature at 10-minute intervals were used. Wind speed and direction data were available from 165 of these stations. Additionally, six Swiss FluxNet eddy covariance flux (ECF) sites provided turbulent measurements at 20 Hz resolution.  During maximum occultation the temperature drop was up to 5.8 K at a mountain site where cold air can pool in a topographic depression. The bootstrapped average of the maximum temperature drops of all 184 MeteoSwiss sites during the solar eclipse was 1.51 ± 0.02 K (mean ± SE). A detailed comparison with literature values since 1834 showed a temperature decrease by 2.6 ± 1.7 K (average of all reports), with extreme values up to 11 K. On fair weather days under weak larger scale pressure gradients, local thermo-topographic wind systems develop that are driven by small-scale pressure and temperature gradients. At one ECF site, the penumbral shading delayed the morning transition from down-valley to up-valley wind conditions. At another site, it prevented this transition from occurring at all. Data from the 165 MeteoSwiss sites measuring wind direction did not show a consistent pattern of wind direction response to the passing of the penumbral shadow. These results suggest that the local topographic setting had an important influence on the temperature drop and the wind flow patterns during the eclipse. A significant cyclonic effect of the passing penumbral shadow was found in the elevation range ≈1700–2700 m a.s.l., but not at lower elevations of the Swiss Plateau. This contrasts with an earlier theory that the anticyclonic outflow should reach as far as ≈2400 km from the center of the eclipse, which would have included all of Switzerland during the 2015 eclipse. Thus, measurable effects of penumbral shading on the local wind system could be even found at ≈2000 km from the path of the eclipse (that is, Switzerland during the 2015 eclipse), and our results tend to lend support to a newer theory that the anticyclonic cold-air outflow from the center of the eclipse only extends ≈1600 km outwards, with cyclonic flow beyond that distance.","text/plain||text/csv||application/zip||image/jpeg","10.3929/ethz-b-000204632",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/204632","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","solar eclipse||temperature drop||wind direction change||Switzerland","Supplement to: Effects of vernal equinox solar eclipse on temperature and wind direction in Switzerland","Dataset","Open access",,,"2017-11-05T15:44:39Z",,"indefinite","292278994-08-17T07:12:55Z",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Agricultural intensification affects the long-term sustainability of these landscapes by weakening natural processes that are indirectly important to agriculture, such as pollination, biological control of pest or soil retention. In response, agro-ecological intensification has appeared as an approach to ensure the sustainability of agricultural landscapes. This approach is based on the active management of ecosystem services. However, implementation of this approach remains a challenge given there is insufficient information on the functioning of ecosystem services, trade-offs between different land management strategies and decisions, as well as other socio-economic barriers. Pollination services provide significant contributions to agricultural production. In recent years, wild pollinators have received increased attention. Pollination services depend on the interactions between various spatially separated elements of the landscape, such as nesting and foraging resources, and are influenced by interventions from various actors, such as agricultural practices. As a result, the evaluation and planning of pollination services requires adopting a socio-ecological landscape approach. This thesis aims to explore the effectiveness and implications of different strategies of landscape management for pollination services and agricultural production. It focuses on a coffee tropical agroforestry landscape in Kodagu district in India where the wild honeybee species, Apis dorsata, is the main pollinator species. In the first two results chapters, I explore the ecosystem services cascade by showing the interactions between landscape patterns, management practices and ecosystem service delivery across temporal and spatial scales. In the next chapter, I propose two landscape management strategies aimed at optimizing pollination services for agricultural production. In the last chapter, I discuss how both social and ecological factors interact to co-produce pollination services. After a general introduction, in Chapter 2, I examine the interactions between landscape patterns, in particular land cover and resource heterogeneity, and the distribution of wild nests of Apis dorsata. I reveal scaling and non-uniform effects by combining two different approaches of spatial analysis, the point-pattern analysis and the cutting-edge surface-pattern analysis. I conclude that both forest fragments and the agroforestry matrix influence the presence of nests, although the scale of the interactions vary across the two land covers (fine scales for forest fragments, and broad scales for agroforests) and are not uniform across the study zone. The results demonstrate how maintaining structurally complex landscapes at multiple scales help to preserve bee populations. In Chapter 3, I develop a landscape-scale probabilistic pollination model of dispersion of Apis dorsata, from their nesting habitats, mostly in forest patches, to surrounding coffee plantations. Using the electrical circuit theory, the model indicates that honeybees are highly sensitive to temporal changes in coffee flower availability at landscape scales, and that their movement is not limited by fragmentation of tree cover. The flowering of individual coffee plantations is controlled by irrigation decisions from farmers. The results show that the aggregation of individual decisions creates an emergent dynamic landscape-scale pattern of flowering to which honeybees are responding. The pollination model has broad relevance for other complex mosaic landscapes where floral resources are dynamic. In Chapter 4, I explore optimal landscape management strategies that maximize pollination services and simultaneously increase agricultural production. Using the pollination model in Chapter 2 and an optimization algorithm, I compare the potential benefits of two alternative management strategies: a spatio-temporal management of coffee flowering (via the coordination of irrigation dates), versus habitat conservation, which impacts the spatial distribution of nests. Coordinated efforts on irrigation allow greater gains in terms of pollinator visits than a redistribution of nests in different nesting sites. However, both scenarios lead to similar significant increases in fruit set. While irrigation coordination aims to minimize inter-plantation competitions, conservation of multiple nesting sites redistributes bee individuals more effectively across plantations. Given each strategy involves different stakeholders and different types of decision, I assess the challenges associated to the implementation of each scenario and possible trade-offs with other management options. In Chapter 5, I use a socio-ecological approach for assessing alternatives to ecosystem service management. I compare pollination services supported by wild bees versus managed bees, using ecological data and interviews with farmers. I demonstrate that Apis dorsata is more abundant in coffee plantations and also supports more heterogeneous pollination services in space and time than the managed pollinator, Apis cerana. I highlight the interrelationships between different human factors that influence the mobilization of hives or the management of wild nesting sites by coffee farmers. These ”mediating factors“ include individual farmer’s assets, institutions and policies, values and perceptions. This approach is useful to understand to which extent recommendations on pollination services are relevant for local actors.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000294175",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/294175","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Pollination services||Landscape ecology||Landscape management||Ecosystem services mapping||Modeling||Landscape scale effects","Landscape strategies for pollination services and agricultural production","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::590 - Zoological sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2018-10-09T10:39:24Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"IDP Bridging Plant Science and Policy","608422","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7","24702",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

(2016), simulating both laboratory-scale and large-scale debris-flow experiments. The new solver combines a Coulomb viscoplastic rheological model with a Herschel–Bulkley model based on material properties and rheological characteristics of the analyzed debris flow. For the selected experiments in this study, all necessary material properties were known – the content of sand, clay (including its mineral composition) and gravel as well as the water content and the angle of repose of the gravel. Given these properties, two model parameters are sufficient for calibration, and a range of experiments with different material compositions can be reproduced by the model without recalibration. One calibration parameter, the Herschel–Bulkley exponent, was kept constant for all simulations. The model validation focuses on different case studies illustrating the sensitivity of debris flows to water and clay content, channel curvature, channel roughness and the angle of repose. We characterize the accuracy of the model using experimental observations of flow head positions, front velocities, run-out patterns and basal pressures.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000211935",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-10-3963-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/211935","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"DebrisInterMixing-2.3: A finite volume solver for three-dimensional debris-flow simulations with two calibration parameters - Part 2: Model validation with experiments","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-11-22T08:56:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85032922152",,"000414345200001","Geosci. model dev.","11","Geoscientific Model Development","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To mitigate impacts of rapid population increases, population control by increasing harvest has been attempted. In this study we seek to guide the design of a regional autumn goose hunting organisation in agricultural landscapes by identifying areas suitable for hunting, which have high probability of occurrence of pinkfooted geese Anser brachyrhynchus and/or a short return time by geese to fields subject to hunting. To identify areas suitable for hunting in Nord-Trøndelag County, mid-Norway, we used species distributions models (SDMs), a broadly accepted tool in conservation planning for spatial refuge organisation. The prediction was that the highest probability of goose occurrence exists for large fields, away from small roads and near water bodies serving as safe roosting sites. Additionally, return time was predicted to be shortest for large fields near roosting sites and away from big roads. A combined map of goose occurrence and return time showed similar prediction for high goose occurrence and short return time; hence areas most suitable for hunting are large fields, close to roost sites and away from roads. If hunters and landowners are willing to coordinate goose hunting at a landscape level, they can use the prediction maps as guidance, with the likely benefit that they collectively can shoot more geese. Such local and regional organisation can become a powerful tool in the harvest management of geese.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000128596",,"0909-6396||1903-220X",,"10.2981/wlb.00192","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128596","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/",,"Landscape selection by migratory geese: Implications for hunting organisation","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T19:50:50Z",,,,"pub:191507","yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936554458d1983620","010846543","85011317261",,"000402075200001",,"1","Wildlife Biology","2017","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Hopes for the simultaneous achievement of conservation goals and poverty alleviation are therefore increasingly placed on forests used for timber extraction. Most timber exploitation is carried out unsustainably, which causes forest degradation. Two important mechanisms have emerged to promote sustainable forest management: certification and community-based forest management (CFM). We synthesize the published information about how forest certification and CFM perform in terms of environmental, social, and economic variables. With the caveat that very few published studies meet the standards for formal impact evaluation, we found that certification has substantial environmental benefits, typically achieved at a cost of reduced short-term financial profit, and accompanied by some improvement to the welfare of neighboring communities. We found that the economic and environmental benefits of CFM are understudied, but that the social impacts are controversial, with both positive and negative changes reported. We identify the trade-offs that likely caused these conflicting results and that, if addressed, would help both CFM and certification deliver the hoped-for benefits.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000115102",,"1755-263X",,"10.1111/conl.12244","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/115102","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biodiversity||Certification||Community-based forest management||Forest degradation||Forest Stewardship Council||Price premium||Reduced-impact logging||Social capital||Trade-offs||Welfare","A Critical Comparison of Conventional, Certified, and Community Management of Tropical Forests for Timber in Terms of Environmental, Economic, and Social Variables","Review Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment","2017-06-12T04:08:34Z",,,,"pub:176917","yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936544cc8c5450806",,"84963632007",,"000396046700001","Conserv. lett.","1","Conservation Letters","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
