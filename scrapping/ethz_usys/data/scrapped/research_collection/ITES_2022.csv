In the South American genus Petunia, the R2R3-MYB transcription factor MYB-FL regulates the biosynthesis of UV-absorbing flavonol pigments, a major determinant of pollinator preference. MYB-FL is highly expressed in the hawkmoth-pollinated P. axillaris, but independent losses of its activity in sister taxa P. secreta and P. exserta led to UV-reflective flowers and associated pollinator shifts in each lineage (bees and hummingbirds, respectively). We created a myb-fl CRISPR mutant in P. axillaris and studied the effect of this single gene on innate pollinator preference. The mutation strongly reduced the expression of the two key flavonol-related biosynthetic genes but only affected the expression of few other genes. The mutant flowers were UV reflective as expected but additionally contained low levels of visible anthocyanin pigments. Hawkmoths strongly preferred the wild-type P. axillaris over the myb-fl mutant, whereas both social and solitary bee preference depended on the level of visible color of the mutants. MYB-FL, with its specific expression pattern, small number of target genes, and key position at the nexus of flavonol and anthocyanin biosynthetic pathways, provides a striking example of evolution by single mutations of large phenotypic effect.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591935",,"0960-9822||1879-0445",,"10.1016/j.cub.2022.11.006","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591935","en","Cell Press",,,"speciation||Pollination syndromes||hawkmoths and bees||MYB transcription factor||UV color||CRISPR mutants||behavioral assays","Single gene mutation in a plant MYB transcription factor causes a major shift in pollinator preference",,"Journal Article","Embargoed",,,"2023-01-12T10:49:00Z","2023-12-31",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"000919691800001","Curr Biol","24","Current Biology","32","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the extent to which diversified management actions could lead to quantitatively important changes in carbon sequestration and stocking capacity at the tree level remains to be thoroughly assessed. To that end, we used a state-of-the-science bio-geochemically based forest growth model to simulate effects of multiple forest management scenarios on net primary productivity (NPP) and potential carbon woody stocks (pCWS) under twenty scenarios of climate change in a suite of observed and virtual forest stands in temperate and boreal European forests. Previous modelling experiments indicated that the capacity of forests to assimilate and store atmospheric CO2 in woody biomass is already being attained under business-as-usual forest management practices across a range of climate change scenarios. Nevertheless, we find that on the long-term, with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and warming, managed forests show both higher productivity capacity and a larger potential pool size of stored carbon than unmanaged forests as long as thinning and tree harvesting are of moderate intensity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000579760",,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109203","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/579760","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Adaptive forest management||modeling||virtual forests||climate change||carbon sequestration","Feasibility of enhancing carbon sequestration and stock capacity in temperate and boreal European forests via changes to management regimes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-11-07T09:30:33Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85140321111",,"000936942400003","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","327","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Biodiversity-based ecological indicators (EIs) can be used for this, as biodiversity is the basis of ecosystem structure, composition, and function. In previous studies, lichens have been used as EIs to monitor the effects of global change drivers in an urban context, but only in single-city studies. Thus, we currently do not understand how lichens are affected by drivers that work on a broader scale. Therefore, our aim was to quantify the variance in lichen biodiversity-based metrics (taxonomic and trait-based) that can be explained by environmental drivers working on a broad spatial scale, in an urban context where local drivers are superimposed. To this end, we performed an unprecedented effort to sample epiphytic lichens in 219 green spaces across a continental gradient from Portugal to Estonia. Twenty-six broad-scale drivers were retrieved, including air pollution and bio-climatic variables, and their dimensionality reduced by means of a principal component analysis (PCA). Thirty-eight lichen metrics were then modelled against the scores of the first two axes of each PCA, and their variance partitioned into pollution and climate components. For the first time, we determined that 15% of the metric variance was explained by broad-scale drivers, with broad-scale air pollution showing more importance than climate across the majority of metrics. Taxonomic metrics were better explained by air pollution, as expected, while climate did not surpass air pollution in any of the trait-based metric groups. Consequently, 85% of the metric variance was shown to occur at the local scale. This suggests that further work is necessary to decipher the effects of climate change. Furthermore, although drivers working within cities are prevailing, both spatial scales must be considered simultaneously if we are to use lichens as EIs in cities at continental to global scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000578399",,"0269-7491||1878-2450||1873-6424",,"10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120330","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/578399","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Urban macroecology||Spatial scales||Atmospheric pollution||Ecological indicator||Biodiversity-based metrics||Trait-based diversity","Modelling the response of urban lichens to broad-scale changes in air pollution and climate",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-10-29T05:40:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85140237581",,"000880771700009","Environ Pollut",,"Environmental Pollution","315","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Such an exceptional hot drought occurred in Central Europe in 2018 and caused widespread defoliation in mid-summer in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests.  Here, we recorded crown damage in 2021 in nine mature even-aged beech-dominated stands in northwestern Switzerland along a crown damage severity gradient (low, medium, high) and analyzed tree-ring widths of 21 mature trees per stand. We aimed at identifying predisposing factors responsible for differences in crown damage across and within stands such as tree growth characteristics (average growth rates and year-to-year variability) and site-level variables (mean canopy height, soil properties).  We found that stand-level crown damage severity was strongly related to soil water availability, inferred from tree canopy height and plant available soil water storage capacity (AWC). Trees were shorter in drier stands, had higher year-to-year variability in radial growth, and showed higher growth sensitivity to moisture conditions of previous late summer than trees growing on soils with sufficient AWC, indicating that radial growth in these forests is principally limited by soil water availability. Within-stand variation of post-drought crown damage corresponded to growth rate and tree size (diameter at breast height, DBH), i.e., smaller and slower-growing trees that face more competition, were associated with increased crown damage after the 2018 drought. These findings point to tree vigor before the extreme 2018 drought (long-term relative growth rate) as an important driver of damage severity within and across stands. Our results suggest that European beech is less likely to be able to cope with future climate change-induced extreme droughts on shallow soils with limited water retention capacity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000567792",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157926","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/567792","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Tree rings||Competition||Tree size||Climate sensitivity||European beech||Crown damage","Long-term soil water limitation and previous tree vigor drive local variability of drought-induced crown dieback in Fagus sylvatica",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-31T03:14:06Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85136084929",,"000861087300001","Sci.

We collected drone imagery and videos from different angles of a wide range of landscapes in Zambia, showing agricultural areas, forests, wetlands and water infrastructure. Then, we took the imagery back to the field to probe the perceptions of multiple stakeholders, including staff from both governmental and non-governmental organizations, hydropower operators, small-and large-scale farmers. In focus group discussions, we assessed the interpretability of oblique images, taken at an angle by a video drone, compared to nadir (vertical) imagery from Google Earth and from a high-end mapping drone. We show that oblique images produced better identification results across all groups of stakeholders, but especially from small-scale farmers, suggesting this type of imagery is helpful to empower people who lack previous experience in interpreting nadir images. Overall, the appreciation of the aesthetic value and the perceived professional benefits of drone imagery are high, but technical and legal barriers impede a wider adoption of the technology. While we highlight ethical concerns and technical limitations, we suggest that conservationists and environmental planners could benefit from a critical use of affordable video drones so as to produce intuitive landscape representations useful for more effective multi-stakeholder collaborations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000570829",,"0169-2046||1872-6062","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575176||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/570829","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104571","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575308","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Drone imagery to create a common understanding of landscapes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-09-15T11:36:27Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,"85138056378",,"000861576400001","Landsc. urban plan.",,"Landscape and Urban Planning","228","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Total biomass and production costs were determined. Indirect emissions were calculated from fuel used in producing and packing of synthetic fertilizers and herbicide, and sheep manure mineralization. The results showed that CO2 was the gas that most contributes to GHG emissions followed by the CH4 and NO2. The agrosystem with reduce tillage and synthetic inputs had the highest emissions (979 CO2 eq kg ha−1). Agrosystems using synthetic inputs (conventional and reduce tillage) showed higher indirect emissions (958 and 856 CO2 eq kg ha−1 respectively). Maize in monoculture produced more than the systems with rotation or intercropping. Reduced tillage with intercropping and organic inputs was the most expensive to produce but had the least gas emission per dollar invested and per kilogram of biomass produced while conventional tillage agrosystems with organic or synthetic inputs stored little carbon in the soil, produced less biomass per unit area and presented higher CO2 eq emissions per unit of biomass.",,,,"0167-8809||1873-2305",,"10.1016/j.agee.2022.108148","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/571203","en","Elsevier",,,"Reduced tillage||Intercropping||Organic inputs||Synthetic fertilizers||Cost balance gases||Temperate sub-humid zone","Direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions under conventional, organic, and conservation agriculture",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-09-18T03:10:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85137628700",,,"Agric. ecosyst. environ.",,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","340","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In selection silviculture, regeneration is initiated below canopy and usually remains shaded for a certain period. To better quantify growth patterns under these conditions on beech site types, beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) of the thicket and pole stage classes were subjected to an extensive stem disc analysis. The results were then used to explore the possibilities of species mixtures in uneven-aged forests. While height and diameter development of both tree species depended strongly on the availability of light, it was shown that height growth of beech was larger in dense stands. Sycamore maple benefited from a longer crown and should therefore be released from competing neighbors by active management interventions. But already at small diameters, height growth was reduced the older the sycamore trees were. Therefore, at the demographic equilibrium in beech selection forests (basal area of 21– 25 m2), growth of sycamore into the crown layer is strongly questioned, especially in small gaps (<270 m2) with less than 10% light availability. Under these conditions, its share in the regeneration is less than 25%, and the time to outgrow from the first two diameter-at-breast-height (DBH) classes (1–8 cm DBH) is on average 51 years. To maintain a demographic equilibrium, 90–120 trees per hectare should be present in DBH class 3 (8–12 cm DBH). However, to ensure a substantial proportion of sycamore maple in the mixture, it should be regenerated in gaps of at least 400 m2.

Our variance-partitioning analysis identifies vegetation type as an important predictor for SEB-components during Arctic summer (June-August), compared to other SEB-drivers including climate, latitude and permafrost characteristics. Differences among vegetation types can be of similar magnitude as between vegetation and glacier surfaces and are especially high for summer sensible and latent heat fluxes. The timing of SEB-flux summer-regimes (when daily mean values exceed 0 Wm−2) relative to snow-free and -onset dates varies substantially depending on vegetation type, implying vegetation controls on snow-cover and SEB-flux seasonality. Our results indicate complex shifts in surface energy fluxes with land-cover transitions and a lengthening summer season, and highlight the potential for improving future Earth system models via a refined representation of Arctic vegetation types.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000580579",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-022-34049-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580579","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Vegetation type is an important predictor of the arctic summer land surface energy budget",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-11-10T14:01:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,"FeedBaCks: Feedbacks between Biodiversity and Climate","193907","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","ERA-NET + EJP",,,"85140941186",,"000877943100002","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous studies have shown how the analysis of the content of geotagged images shared on social media can be used to shed a light on CES provision and consumption without having to resort to time-consuming surveys and interviews. However, to make this approach viable over large study areas, the image classification process must be automatized and new developments of deep learning field have the potential to do so. To evaluate this potential, we have gathered over 91,000 images acquired within British Columbia (Canada) provincial parks system and then trained and deployed convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify them. Images were classified based on: (i) their relevance in the context of CES research; (ii) the type of CES depicted (aesthetic or recreation); and (iii) the type of aesthetic experience or recreational activity depicted; with an estimated accuracy of 85 %. Then we combined the outcomes of the image classification process with images metadata to assess the value of the recreational ecosystem service provided by the most popular parks with an innovative crowdsourced benefit transfer approach, obtaining values that range from the 105.2 M CAN$ of Cypress park to the 0.3 M CAN$ of Lac du Bois park. Our findings show how crowdsourced social media images, coupled with the new developments of deep learning, offer to ecosystem managers across the world the opportunity of gathering cheap, fine scale, and comprehensive information about CES.

We show that by evolving the network backward in time one can not only reconstruct the growth rules but also get an insight into the conditions under which branch splitting occurs. Determining the growth rules from a single snapshot in time is particularly important for growth processes so slow that they cannot be directly observed, such as growth of river networks and deltas or cave passages. We apply this approach to analyze the growth of a real river network in Vermont, USA.

Aims  Our objective was to investigate patterns of microbial properties and their controls to understand whether they differ between soils derived from geochemically contrasting parent material in tropical montane forests.  Methods  We measured microbial biomass C (MBCSoil), potential extracellular enzyme activity (pEEA), and assessed microbial investments in C and nutrient acquisition at the beginning and end of a 120-day laboratory incubation experiment using soils developed from three geochemically contrasting parent material (i.e., mafic, mixed sediment, and felsic) and three soil depths (0–70 cm).  Results  We found that MBCSoil and pEEA were highest in soils developed from the mafic parent material. Microbial investment in C acquisition was highest in soils developed from mixed sedimentary rocks and lowest in soils developed from the felsic parent material. We propose that our findings are related to the strength of contrasting mineral-related C stabilization mechanisms and varying C quality. No predominant microbial investment in nitrogen (N) acquisition was observed, whereas investment in phosphorus (P) acquisition was highest in subsoils. We found lower microbial investment in C acquisition in subsoils indicating relatively high C availability, and that microbes in subsoils can substantially participate in C cycling and limit C storage if moisture and oxygen conditions are suitable. Geochemical soil properties and substrate quality were important controls on MBCSoil per unit soil organic C (MBCSOC), particularly after the exhaustion of labile and fast cycling C, that is, at the end of the incubation.  Conclusion  Although a laboratory incubation experiment cannot reflect real-world conditions, it allowed us to understand how soil properties affect microbial properties. We conclude that parent material is an important driver of microbial properties in tropical montane forests despite the advanced weathering degree of soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543971",,"1436-8730||0044-3263||1522-2624",,"10.1002/jpln.202100274","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543971","en","Wiley-VCH","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","carbon acquisition||extracellular enzymes||microbial biomass||nutrient acquisition","Microbial properties in tropical montane forest soils developed from contrasting parent material – An incubation experiment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-04-27T03:13:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85127944252",,"000783395700001","J.

For beech, it is yet unknown whether the drought evoked a decline towards tree mortality or whether trees can recover in the longer term. In this study, we monitored crown dieback, tree mortality and secondary drought damage symptoms in 963 initially live beech trees that exhibited either premature or normal leaf senescence in 2018 in three regions in northern Switzerland from 2018 to 2021. We related the observed damage to multiple climate- and stand-related parameters. Cumulative tree mortality continuously increased up to 7.2% and 1.3% in 2021 for trees with premature and normal leaf senescence in 2018, respectively. Mean crown dieback in surviving trees peaked at 29.2% in 2020 and 8.1% in 2019 for trees with premature and normal leaf senescence, respectively. Thereafter, trees showed first signs of recovery. Crown damage was more pronounced and recovery was slower for trees that showed premature leaf senescence in 2018, for trees growing on drier sites, and for larger trees. The presence of bleeding cankers peaked at 24.6% in 2019 and 10.7% in 2020 for trees with premature and normal leaf senescence, respectively. The presence of bark beetle holes peaked at 22.8% and 14.8% in 2021 for trees with premature and normal leaf senescence, respectively. Both secondary damage symptoms occurred more frequently in trees that had higher proportions of crown dieback and/or showed premature senescence in 2018. Our findings demonstrate context-specific differences in beech mortality and recovery reflecting the importance of regional and local climate and soil conditions. Adapting management to increase forest resilience is gaining importance, given the expected further beech decline on dry sites in northern Switzerland.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000577976",,"1435-8603||1438-8677",,"10.1111/plb.13467","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/577976","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bark beetles||bleeding cankers||climatic water balance||crown dieback||Fagus sylvatica||tree mortality","European beech dieback after premature leaf senescence during the 2018 drought in northern Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-10-27T03:57:04Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85136124331",,"000869614300001","Plant biol.","7","Plant Biology","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Specifically, the role of local edaphic factors - such as soil parent material and topography controlling soil fertility as well as water and nutrient fluxes - remains unclear and introduces substantial uncertainty in understanding net ecosystem productivity and carbon (C) stocks. Using a combination of vegetation growth monitoring and soil geochemical properties, we found that soil fertility parameters reflecting the local parent material are the main drivers of NPP and C allocation patterns in tropical montane forests, resulting in significant differences in below- to aboveground biomass components across geochemical (soil) regions. Topography did not constrain the variability in C allocation and NPP. Soil organic C stocks showed no relation to C input in tropical forests. Instead, plant C input seemingly exceeded the maximum potential of these soils to stabilize C. We conclude that, even after many millennia of weathering and the presence of deeply developed soils, above- and belowground C allocation in tropical forests, as well as soil C stocks, vary substantially due to the geochemical properties that soils inherit from parent material.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000577585",,"0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.18469","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/577585","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","African tropical forests||carbon allocation||carbon dynamics||net primary productivity||root||shoot ratio||soil fertility||soil geochemistry","Soil geochemistry - and not topography - as a major driver of carbon allocation, stocks, and dynamics in forests and soils of African tropical montane ecosystems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-10-25T05:06:37Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85141119822",,"000867810800001","New Phytol.","5","New Phytologist","236","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A considerable number of forest models have been developed in the last decades. However, few systematic and comprehensive model comparisons have been performed in Europe that combine an evaluation of modelled carbon and water fluxes and forest structure. We evaluate 13 widely used, state-of-the-art, stand-scale forest models against field measurements of forest structure and eddy-covariance data of carbon and water fluxes over multiple decades across an environmental gradient at nine typical European forest stands. We test the models' performance in three dimensions: accuracy of local predictions (agreement of modelled and observed annual data), realism of environmental responses (agreement of modelled and observed responses of daily gross primary productivity to temperature, radiation and vapour pressure deficit) and general applicability (proportion of European tree species covered). We find that multiple models are available that excel according to our three dimensions of model performance. For the accuracy of local predictions, variables related to forest structure have lower random and systematic errors than annual carbon and water flux variables. Moreover, the multi-model ensemble mean provided overall more realistic daily productivity responses to environmental drivers across all sites than any single individual model. The general applicability of the models is high, as almost all models are currently able to cover Europe's common tree species. We show that forest models complement each other in their response to environmental drivers and that there are several cases in which individual models outperform the model ensemble. Our framework provides a first step to capturing essential differences between forest models that go beyond the most commonly used accuracy of predictions. Overall, this study provides a point of reference for future model work aimed at predicting climate impacts and supporting climate mitigation and adaptation measures in forests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000573863",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.16384","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/573863","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","eddy-covariance||gap model||model ensemble||model evaluation||process-based modeling||terrestrial carbon dynamics","Accuracy, realism and general applicability of European forest models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-10-03T03:48:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85137483389",,"000855012200001","Glob.

We assembled a highly-complete local DNA reference library (PhyloAlps, 3923 plant taxa), and used this to obtain an exceptionally rich sedaDNA record of 366 plant taxa. Vegetation mainly responded to climate during the early Holocene, while human activity had an additional influence on vegetation from 6 ka onwards. Land-use shifted from episodic grazing during the Neolithic and Bronze Age to agropastoralism in the Middle Ages. Associated human deforestation allowed the coexistence of plant species typically found at different elevational belts, leading to levels of plant richness that characterise the current high diversity of this region.

We, therefore, conducted an experiment with Quercus pubescens (downy oaks) saplings grown under four drought levels from field capacity (well-watered; ~25% volumetric water content) to wilting point (extreme drought; ~6%), in combination with two fertilizer treatments (0 vs. 50 kg/ha/year blended) for one growing season to answer this question. We measured the pre- and post-winter NSC, and calculated the over-winter NSC consumption in storage tissues (i.e. shoots and roots) following drought and fertilization treatment, and recorded the spring leaf phenology, leaf biomass, and mortality next year. The results showed that, irrespective of drought intensity, carbon reserves were abundant in storage tissues, especially in roots. Extreme drought did not significantly alter NSC levels in tissues, but delayed the spring leaf expansion and reduced the leaf biomass. Previous season fertilization promoted shoot NSC use in extreme drought-stressed saplings over winter (showing reduced carbon reserves in shoots after winter), but it also showed positive effects on survival next year. We conclude that: (1) drought-stressed downy oak saplings seem to be able to maintain sufficient mobile carbohydrates for survival, (2) fertilization can alleviate the negative effects of extreme drought on survival and recovery growth of tree saplings.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000580863",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2022.1035191","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580863","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Carbon consumption||Carbon storage||Leaf phenology||Mobile carbohydrates||Quercus pubescents||Overwinter||Water deficit","The effects of previous summer drought and fertilization on winter non-structural carbon reserves and spring leaf development of downy oak saplings",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-11-15T15:00:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85142178531",,,"Front.

Established monitoring of macroinvertebrates is expensive and time-consuming, and relies on expert taxonomic knowledge. In contrast, biomonitoring based on molecular tools can support faster characterization of aquatic communities but needs validation for the target taxonomic groups and the study region. Here, we used data from a biomonitoring program covering a large biogeographic gradient to compare the routine kick-net method with eDNA metabarcoding. We used two primer pairs targeting COI, one targeting a broad metazoan spectrum (mICOIintF/jgHCO2198) and another more recently developed primer pair optimized for the detection of freshwater invertebrates (fwhF2/EPTDr2n). We used the data of the macroinvertebrate monitoring with a focus on the orders of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera across 92 rivers in Switzerland, covering four continental drainage basins and an elevational range from 198 to 1650 m a.s.l. Across all sample sites, the kick-net detected more distinct taxa than either of the metabarcoding approaches. At a site level, however, both primer pairs detected on average more species. Comparing both primer pairs, the fwhF2/EPTDr2n primer pair captured more species assigned to the indicator groups Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, and showed a significantly larger overlap with the kick-net method. However, the community composition still varied significantly among the different metabarcoding approaches. Fewer Trichoptera species were recovered by eDNA, whereas the fwhF2/EPTDr2n primer pair detected more Plecopterans than the other two approaches. This study highlights the importance of the optimization and validation of novel molecular approaches under consideration of the target organismal group and the study area.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583901",,"2637-4943",,"10.1002/edn3.342","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583901","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","aquatic||biomonitoring||macroinvertebrates||primer choice","Evaluation of primer pairs for eDNA-based assessment of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera across a biogeographically diverse region",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-11-30T04:10:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85135593261",,,,"6","Environmental DNA","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this context, agroecology is a game-changing approach that can provide the world’s growing population with nutritious, healthy afordable food, ensure fair incomes to farmers and halt and reverse the degradation of the natural environment. Here, we explore agroecological transition pathways in four case studies from low- and middle- income countries and identify catalysts for change. We fnd that enabling policy and market environments, participatory action research and local socio-technical support each plays a critical role in stimulating transitions towards agroecology.

To understand ECC trophic functioning and the effects of fishing in this region of the Mediterranean Sea, we applied the Ecopath and EcoTroph approaches. Our model encompassed 5 groups of primary producers and detritus, 14 invertebrate groups, two groups of Chondrichthyes, 16 teleost groups, one seabird group, and one group of cetaceans. The ECC ecosystem was structured into five trophic levels, regulated top–down by Sphyraenidae, Epinephelus marginatus, and Dentex dentex. The ecosystem displayed a high degree of benthic–pelagic coupling, confirmed by keystone groups/species located at intermediate trophic levels (planktivorous teleosts, benthic cephalopods, shrimps, zooplankton). The ECC demonstrated the lowest exploitation rate (F/Z) of all exploited Mediterranean ecosystems, with trawling representing 55% of catches, followed by the lobster net (27%) and fish net (18%) fisheries. Catches often included untargeted groups—often discarded dead—in particular sharks and rays, and several protected species. Moreover, Palinurus elephas, Scorpaena scrofa, and Dentex dentex had elevated F/Z values, highlighting their vulnerabilities to fishing. Although the fishing simulations suggested that the ECC could support a greater exploitation, they also revealed that these fisheries have a marked impact on upper trophic levels. Our study draws attention to the critical habitat the ECC provides for Chondrichthyes, evidenced by the significant biomass for these taxa and the low fishing pressure relative to other exploited Mediterranean systems. This first modelling of the ECC is an initial step towards modelling all Corsican marine ecosystems to serve as a guide for preserving these ecosystems through appropriate management measures.",,,,"0924-7963||1879-1573",,"10.1016/j.jmarsys.2022.103798","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/568703","en","Elsevier",,,"Ecopath||EcoTroph||Fishing impacts||Mediterranean Sea||Trawling||Trophic structure","Ecosystem modelling of the Eastern Corsican Coast (ECC): Case study of one of the least trawled shelves of the Mediterranean Sea",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-09-04T05:35:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85136599122",,"000855040800001","J.

Naturalized species richness on islands depends on several biogeographical and socioeconomic factors, but especially on remoteness. One potential explanation for this is that the phylogenetically imbalanced composition of native floras on remote islands leaves unoccupied niche space for alien species to colonize. Here, we tested whether the species richness of naturalized seed plants on 249 islands worldwide is related to the phylogenetic composition of their native floras. To this end, we calculated standardized effect size (ses) accounting for species richness for three phylogenetic assemblage metrics (Faith's phylogenetic diversity (PD), PDses; mean pairwise distance (MPD), MPDses; and mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD), MNTDses) based on a phylogeny of 42 135 native island plant species and related them to naturalized species richness. As covariates in generalized linear mixed models, we included native species richness and biogeographical, climatic and socioeconomic island characteristics known to affect naturalized species richness. Our analysis showed an increase in naturalized species richness with increasing phylogenetic clustering of the native assemblages (i.e. native species more closely related than expected by chance), most prominently with MPDses. This effect, however, was smaller than the influence of native species richness and biogeographical factors, e.g. remoteness. Further, the effect of native phylogenetic structure (MPDses) on naturalized species richness was stronger for smaller islands, but this pattern was not consistent across all phylogenetic assemblage metrics. This finding suggests that the phylogenetic composition of native island floras may affect naturalized species richness, particularly on small islands where species are more likely to co-occur locally. Overall, we conclude that the composition of native island assemblages affects their susceptibility to plant naturalizations in addition to other socioeconomic and biogeographical factors, and should be considered when assessing invasion risks on islands.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000569893",,"0906-7590||1600-0587",,"10.1111/ecog.06227","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/569893","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","biological invasions||biotic resistance||Darwin's naturalization hypothesis||naturalized species||phylogenetic structure||species composition","Phylogenetic composition of native island floras influences naturalized alien species richness",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-09-09T18:14:33Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85136864068",,"000847423400001",,"11","Ecography","2022","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recent research endeavors have focused on different aspects of NNTs such as legislation, benefits, and risks for forestry, emphasizing that large knowledge gaps remain. As an attempt to fulfill part of these gaps, within the PEN-CAFoRR COST Action (CA19128) network, we established an open-access questionnaire that allows both academic experts and practitioners to provide information regarding NNTs from 20 European countries. Then, we integrated the data originating from the questionnaire, related to the country-based assessment of both peer-reviewed and grey literature, with information from available datasets (EUFORGEN and EU-Forest), which gave the main structure to the study and led to a mixed approach review. Finally, our study provided important insights into the current state of knowledge regarding NNTs. In particular, we highlighted NNTs that have shown to be less commonly addressed in research, raising caution about those characterized by an invasive behavior and used for specific purposes (e.g., wood production, soil recultivation, afforestation, and reforestation). NNTs were especially explored in the context of resilient and adaptive forest management. Moreover, we emphasized the assisted and natural northward migration of NNTs as another underscored pressing issue, which needs to be addressed by joint efforts, especially in the context of the hybridization potential. This study represents an additional effort toward the knowledge enhancement of the NNTs situation in Europe, aiming for a continuously active common source deriving from interprofessional collaboration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583225",,"2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2022.908464","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583225","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Forestry||Invasive species||Distribution||Hybridization||Database||Grey literature||Assisted migration","Risks, benefits, and knowledge gaps of non-native tree species in Europe",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2022-11-27T06:32:11Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85142133377",,"000933573500001","Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study we quantified the impact of an extreme summer drought on the water-use efficiency and carbon sequestration of four mature Norway spruce trees. We used detailed observations of wood formation (xylogenesis) and intra-annual tree-ring properties (quantitative wood anatomy and stable carbon isotopes) combined with physiological water-stress monitoring.  During 41 d of tree water deficit, we observed an enrichment in 13C but a reduction in cell enlargement and wall-thickening processes, which impacted the anatomical characteristics. These adjustments diminished carbon sequestration by 67% despite an 11% increase in water-use efficiency during drought. However, with the resumption of a positive hydric state in the stem, we observed a fast recovery of cell formation rates based on the accumulated assimilates produced during drought.  Our findings enhance our understanding of carbon and water fluxes between the atmosphere and forest ecosystems, providing observational evidence on the tree intra-annual carbon sequestration and water-use efficiency dynamics to improve future generations of vegetation models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557039",,"0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.18224","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557039","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","carbon sequestration||extreme drought||intrinsic water-use efficiency||physiological drought||point dendrometer||quantitative wood anatomy||stable carbon isotopes||xylogenesis","Drought impacts on tree carbon sequestration and water use – evidence from intra-annual tree-ring characteristics",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-09T11:25:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85132149763",,"000813714800001","New Phytol.","1","New Phytologist","236","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we combined species habitat suitability through time with process-based models and genomic data to investigate the role of landscape features and functional connectivity in shaping the population genetic structure of Northern chamois.  Location European Alps.  Taxon Northern chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra).  Methods Using a model that simulates dispersal and tracks the functional connectivity of populations over dynamic landscapes, we modelled the response of the chamois to climate change from the last glaciation (20,000 years ago) to the present. We reconstructed species habitat suitability and landscape connectivity over time and simulated cumulative divergence of populations as a proxy for genetic differentiation. We then compared simulated divergence with the actual population structure of 449 chamois (with >20 k SNPs) sampled across the Alps.  Results We found that Alpine populations of chamois are structured into two main clades, located in the south-western and the eastern Alps. The contact zone between the two lineages is located near the Rhone valley in Switzerland. Simulations reproduced the geographic differentiation of populations observed in the genomic data, and limited dispersal ability and landscape connectivity co-determined the fit of the simulations to data.  Main conclusions The contemporary genetic structure of the chamois across the Alps is explained by limited functional connectivity in combination with large rivers or valleys acting as dispersal barriers. The results of our analysis combining simulations with population genomics highlight how biological characteristics, habitat preference and landscapes shape population genetic structure over time and in responses to climate change. We conclude that spatial simulations could be used to improve our understanding of how landscape dynamics, shaped by geological or climatic forces, impact intra- and interspecific diversity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543774",,"0305-0270||1365-2699",,"10.1111/jbi.14363","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543774","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","geogenomics||landscape genetics||palaeo-environmental modelling||population genetics||process-based modelling||range dynamics||species distribution modelling","Dispersal and habitat dynamics shape the genetic structure of the Northern chamois in the Alps",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-04-26T05:07:44Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85128259943",,"000783655500001","J. biogeogr.","10","Journal of Biogeography","49","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the consequences of this on the relationship between transpiration rate (E) and leaf xylem water potential (psi(leaf-x)) are yet to be quantified. Here, we used a noninvasive root pressure chamber to measure the E(psi(leaf-x)) relationship of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) treated with (saline) or without 100-mM NaCl (nonsaline conditions). The results were reproduced and interpreted with a soil-plant hydraulic model. Under nonsaline conditions, the E(psi(leaf-x)) relationship became progressively more nonlinear as the soil dried (theta <= 0.13 cm(3) cm(-3), psi(soil) = -0.08 MPa or less). Under saline conditions, plants exhibited an earlier nonlinearity in the E(psi(leaf-x)) relationship (theta <= 0.15 cm(3) cm(-3), psi(s)(oil) = -0.05 MPa or less). During soil drying, salinity induced a more negative psi(leaf-x) at predawn, reduced transpiration rate, and caused a reduction in root hydraulic conductance (from 1.48 x 10(-6) to 1.30 x 10(-6) cm(3) s(-1) hPa(-1)). The model suggested that the marked nonlinearity was caused by salt accumulation at the root surface and the consequential osmotic gradients. In dry soil, most water potential dissipation occurred in the bulk soil and rhizosphere rather than inside the plant. Under saline-dry conditions, the loss in osmotic potential at the root surface was the preeminent component of the total dissipation. The physical model of water flow and solute transport supports the hypothesis that a buildup of osmotic potential at the root-soil interface causes a large drop in psi(leaf-x) and limits transpiration rate under drought and salinity.",,,,"0032-0889||1532-2548",,"10.1093/plphys/kiac229","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551843","en","Oxford University Press",,,,"Coupled effects of soil drying and salinity on soil-plant hydraulics",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-06-11T04:58:13Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85138736681",,"000803707500001","Plant physiol.","2","Plant Physiology","190","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it remains largely unknown how changes in adaptive silvicultural interventions affect trade-offs and synergies among ESB in the long term. We used a simulation-based sensitivity analysis to evaluate popular adaptive forest management interventions in representative Swiss low- to mid-elevation beech- and spruce-dominated forest stands. We predicted stand development across the twenty-first century using a novel empirical and temperature-sensitive single-tree forest stand simulator in a fully crossed experimental design to analyse the effects of (1) planting mixtures of Douglas-fir, oak and silver fir, (2) thinning intensity, and (3) harvesting intensity on timber production, carbon storage and biodiversity under three climate scenarios. Simulation results were evaluated in terms of multiple ESB provision, trade-offs and synergies, and individual effects of the adaptive interventions. Timber production increased on average by 45% in scenarios that included tree planting. Tree planting led to pronounced synergies among all ESBs towards the end of the twenty-first century. Increasing the thinning and harvesting intensity affected ESB provision negatively. Our simulations indicated a temperature-driven increase in growth in beech- (+ 12.5%) and spruce-dominated stands (+ 3.7%), but could not account for drought effects on forest dynamics. Our study demonstrates the advantages of multi-scenario sensitivity analysis that enables quantifying effect sizes and directions of management impacts. We showed that admixing new tree species is promising to enhance future ESB provision and synergies among them.

Landscapes under management are dynamic and floral resources fluctuate in space and time. Thus, promoting different semi-natural habitat types within landscapes could be key to support diverse bee meta-communities throughout the season.  Here, we integrate analyses of α-diversity (species richness) and β-diversity and species-habitat networks to examine the relative contribution of all major semi-natural habitats to wild bee meta-communities in agricultural landscapes. We sampled extensively and conventionally managed meadows, flower strips, hedgerows and forest edges in spring, early and late summer in 25 landscapes in Switzerland.  Habitat types varied in their importance for wild bees throughout the season: While extensively managed meadows supported more rare species, habitat specialists and bee species overall than the other habitat types, flower strips were most important later in the season. Each of the five investigated habitat types harboured relatively unique sets of species with different habitats generally acting as distinct modules in the overall bee-habitat network.  Not only flower richness in a habitat per se, but also flower-habitat network properties (habitat strength and functional complementarity) were good predictors of wild bee richness. In addition to local floral richness, landscape composition and configuration interactively influenced β-diversity patterns across habitats.  Synthesis and applications. Our study highlights the value of pollinator-habitat network analysis to inform pollinator conservation management at the landscape scale, especially when combined with information on floral resources and flower-habitat networks. Maintaining different types of semi-natural habitats offers diverse and complementary resources throughout the season, which are crucial to sustain diverse wild bee meta-communities in agricultural landscapes. Particularly meadow extensification schemes can play a key role in safeguarding rare and specialist species in these landscapes. While locally a high flower richness promoted bee abundance and richness in general, our results indicate that increasing connectivity between habitat patches in landscapes dominated by arable crops appears to improve species exchange between local bee communities of different habitats, thereby possibly increasing their resilience to disturbances.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000564867",,"0021-8901||1365-2664",,"10.1111/1365-2664.14260","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/564867","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","conservation||landscape complexity||pollinators||semi-natural habitat||species-habitat networks||wild bees||α-diversity||β-diversity","Different types of semi-natural habitat are required to sustain diverse wild bee communities across agricultural landscapes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-19T02:47:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85135806048",,"000837892500001","J.

We found that shifts in community structure following an abrupt climate manipulation were not simply accelerated versions of shifts expected under gradual warming, as the former missed the transient rise of species benefiting from moderate warming.

To assess the impacts of climate change on vegetation from stand to global scales, models of forest dynamics that include tree demography are needed. Such models are now available for 50 years, but the currently existing diversity of model formulations and its evolution over time are poorly documented. This hampers systematic assessments of structural uncertainties in model-based studies.  2. We conducted a meta-analysis of 28 models, focusing on models that were used in the past five years for climate change studies. We defined 52 model attributes in five groups (basic assumptions, growth, regeneration, mortality and soil moisture) and characterized each model according to these attributes. Analyses of model complexity and diversity included hierarchical cluster analysis and redundancy analysis.  3. Model complexity evolved considerably over the past 50 years. Increases in complexity were largest for growth processes, while complexity of modelled establishment processes increased only moderately. Model diversity was lowest at the global scale, and highest at the landscape scale. We identified five distinct clusters of models, ranging from very simple models to models where specific attribute groups are rendered in a complex manner and models that feature high complexity across all attributes.  4. Most models in use today are not balanced in the level of complexity with which they represent different processes. This is the result of different model purposes, but also reflects legacies in model code, modelers' preferences, and the ‘prevailing spirit of the epoch’. The lack of firm theories, laws and ‘first principles’ in ecology provides high degrees of freedom in model development, but also results in high responsibilities for model developers and the need for rigorous model evaluation.  5. Synthesis. The currently available model diversity is beneficial: convergence in simulations of structurally different models indicates robust projections, while convergence of similar models may convey a false sense of certainty. The existing model diversity—with the exception of global models—can be exploited for improved projections based on multiple models. We strongly recommend balanced further developments of forest models that should particularly focus on establishment and mortality processes, in order to provide robust information for decisions in ecosystem management and policymaking.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000571171",,"0022-0477",,"10.1111/1365-2745.13989","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/571171","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Dynamic Global Vegetation Model||ecological modelling||forest gap model||forest landscape model||global change ecology||JABOWA||model design||model evolution","The evolution, complexity and diversity of models of long-term forest dynamics",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-09-17T09:22:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85137428390",,"000851519000001","J.

The hydrologic alterations due to developed soil structure also decrease sediment yields and associated particulate organic carbon (POC) transport to rivers while promoting export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) via hydrologic leaching. We identified global ""hotspots"" for soil structure impacts that support the putative role of vegetation-promoted soil structure in observed POC/DOC partitioning.

Centuries of forest management have decreased the extent of temperate old-growth forests in Europe and altered managed forests. Disentangling the effects of past human disturbances and climate on current species composition is crucial for understanding the long-term development of forests under global change. In this study, we investigated disturbance and recruitment dynamics in two forests in the Western Pyrenees (Spain) with contrasting management history: an old-growth forest and a long-untouched forest, both dominated by the two shade-tolerant species Fagus sylvatica (European beech) and Abies alba (Silver fir). We used dendroecological methods in seven plots to analyse forest structure, growth patterns and disturbance histories in these forests. We benchmarked these data with the dynamic vegetation model ForClim to examine the effects of natural and human-induced disturbances on forest development, structure and species composition. Disturbance regimes differed between the study forests, but none showed evidence of stand replacing disturbances, either natural or human induced. Low disturbance rates and continuous recruitment of beech and fir dominated the old-growth forest over the last 400 years. In contrast, the long-untouched forest was intensively disturbed in 1700–1780, probably by logging, with lower natural disturbance rates thereafter. Beech and fir recruitment preferentially occurred after more intense disturbances, despite the high shade tolerance of both beech and fir. Higher fir abundance in the long-untouched forest than in the old-growth forest appeared to be related to its human-induced disturbances. ForClim closely simulated forest potential natural vegetation with a dominance of beech over fir, but overestimated the presence of less shade-tolerant species. Previously observed local fir decline may result from natural forest successional processes after logging. Within ∼200 years after logging cessation, some long-untouched forest structural attributes converged towards old-growth forest, but legacy effects still affected species composition and structure. Natural disturbance regimes in beech-fir forests of the Western Pyrenees induce temporal fluctuations between beech and fir abundance, with a natural tendency for beech dominance in advanced developmental stages with low disturbance rates.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000572646",,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120541","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572646","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Dendroecology||Disturbance||Fagus-Abies||Forest biomass||Stand dynamics||Recruitment dynamics||Species coexistence||Temperate forest","Development and long-term dynamics of old-growth beech-fir forests in the Pyrenees: Evidence from dendroecology and dynamic vegetation modelling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-09-26T07:05:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85138378218",,"000870831800007","For.

The increase in natural disturbances leads to tree mortality and raises concerns about the forest's adaptive potential to sustain vital ecosystem services. In this context, the regeneration phase is crucial and comprises the largest potential to adapt to new environmental conditions with long lasting implications. Yet, forest regeneration is particularly susceptible to climatic changes due to the many directly climate-dependent processes, such as seed production and germination but also seedling and sapling development. Models of forest dynamics (MFDs) are essential to describe, understand and predict the effects of changing environmental and management factors on forest dynamics and subsequently on associated ecosystem services. We review a large variety of MFDs with regard to their representation and climate sensitivity of regeneration processes. Starting with a description of the underlying biological processes, we evaluate the various approaches taking into account specific model purposes, and provide recommendations for future developments. We distinguish between models based on ecological principles and models based on empirical relationships. We found an ample mix of regeneration modelling approaches tailored to different model purposes. We conclude that current approaches should be refined to adequately capture altered regeneration trends. Specifically, refinement is needed for MFDs that rely on ecological principals, as they suffer from knowledge gaps and underrepresented processes, thereby limiting their ability to accurately simulate forest regeneration under climate change. Global vegetation models are strongly constrained by their weak representation of vegetation structure and composition, and need to include more detail regarding structural complexity and functional diversity. Models focused on timber yield often rely on strong assumptions regarding the abundance and composition of the next tree generation, which may no longer hold true with changes in climate and forest management. With the increased utilization of natural regeneration as a source of forest renewal, more dynamic representations of tree regeneration are needed. Our review highlights the necessity to increase the data basis to close knowledge gaps and to enable the adequate incorporation and parameterization of the involved processes. This would allow to capture altered regeneration patterns and subsequent effects on forest structure, composition and, ultimately, forest functioning under climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557731",,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120390","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557731","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Dynamic forest modelling||Forest regeneration||Recruitment||Ingrowth","Tree regeneration in models of forest dynamics – Suitability to assess climate change impacts on European forests",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-13T03:06:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85133418566",,"000827224700007","For.

While many trees showed severe signs of crown dieback or died following the 2018 extreme drought, other co-occurring and neighboring trees showed no sign of dieback or only minor damage. The reasons why some trees were more severely impacted than others and which predisposing factors make some trees more vulnerable than others are still poorly understood. Here, we analyzed differences in long-term growth trends, neighborhood composition (competition and species diversity), early-warning signals, and growth responses to past severe droughts of co-occurring vital and severely declining beech trees at six sites in Switzerland. We aimed to connect tree vitality after 2018 with past long-term growth trajectories and investigated whether declining trees had already been more susceptible to drought than vital trees before dieback occurred.  Overall, trees that showed severe crown dieback had a stronger growth decline than vital trees in the last 50 years. Declining trees exhibited stagnating and then decreasing growth trajectories even before signs of crown dieback occurred. Interestingly, we did not find significant differences in growth response to past severe droughts between the vitality classes, with the exception that vital trees recovered faster from past more severe droughts. Further, we could neither detect any difference in the effect of competition and neighborhood species composition on growth response, nor predict crown dieback based on early-warning signals which try to predict regime shifts by sudden changes in the autoregressive coefficient with lag 1, standard deviation and skewness. Our results indicate that unlike vital trees, declining beech trees showed predisposing signs for crown dieback by having lower growth rates during the last 50 years.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000563572",,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109103","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563572","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Long-term growth decline precedes sudden crown dieback of European beech",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-13T12:59:26Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85135713230",,"000861247300004","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","324","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, we aim to understand to what extent the main controls on colluvial SOC stability differ from those observed in non-colluvial soils. Paired soil profiles (non-colluvial versus colluvial) were collected from five sites which differ in climate, soil geochemical background and cultivation history. Topsoil (0-10 cm) and subsoil (30-50 cm) were analysed for SOC fractions, mineral composition, potential soil respiration and radiocarbon content. Our analysis showed that for non-colluvial soils, climate, cultivation history and weathering degree have significant effects on potential soil respiration. In contrast, for colluvial soils, the most influential factor for potential soil respiration was the rate of accretion and this was independent of climatic and geochemical context. Furthermore, accretion rates indirectly affected potential soil respiration by interacting with the degree of weathering of deposited soil. This changed the mineral matrix of colluvial soil settings and thereby may enhance soil mineral-related SOC stabilisation mechanisms. Together, these results suggest that the dominant controls on SOC stability in colluvial soils differ from those in non-colluvial soils, and the soil accretion rate is the most important control on colluvial SOC stability in agricultural systems. Highlights The dominant controls on SOC stability in colluvial and non-colluvial soils were compared. Climate and mineral weathering predominantly control SOC stability in non-colluvial soils. In contrast, the accretion rate is the key factor controlling colluvial SOC stability. Accretion rate drives the role of mineral weathering in colluvial SOC stability.",,,,"1351-0754||1365-2389",,"10.1111/ejss.13311","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/578943","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,,"carbon cycling||carbon sequestration||cultivation||soil erosion||stabilisation mechanism","Factors controlling SOC stability in colluvial soils under contrasting climate and soil weathering conditions",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-11-02T04:04:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"000871453100001","Eur.

At the same time, cities can harbor diverse wild bee assemblages, partly due to the unique plant assemblages that provide resources. While bee dietary preferences have been investigated in various studies, bee dietary studies have been conducted mostly in nonurban ecosystems and data based on plant visitation observations or palynological techniques. This data set describes the larval food preferences of four wild bee species (i.e., $Chelostoma florisomne, Hylaeus communis, Osmia bicornis$ and $O. cornuta$)common in urban areas in five different European cities (i.e., Antwerp, Belgium; Paris, France; Poznan, Poland; Tartu, Estonia; and Zurich, Switzerland). In addition, the data set describes the larval food preferences of individuals from three wild bee genera (i.e., $Chelostoma $sp.,  $Hylaeus$ sp., and $Osmia $ sp.) that could not be identified to the species level. These data were obtained from a Europe-level study aimed at understanding the effects of urbanization on biodiversity across different cities and cityscapes and a Swiss project aimed at understanding the effects of urban ecosystems in wild bee feeding behavior. Wild bees were sampled using standardized trap nests at 80 sites (32 in Zurich and 12 in each of the remaining cities), selected following a double gradient of available habitat at local and landscape scales. Larval pollen was obtained from the bee nests and identified using DNA metabarcoding. The data provide the plant composition at the species or genus level preferred by each bee. These unique data can be used for a wide array of research questions, including urban ecology (e.g., diversity of food sources along urban gradients), bee ecology (characterization of bee feeding preferences), or comparative studies on the urban evolution of behavioral traits between urban and nonurban sites. In addition, the data can be used to inform urban planning and conservation strategies, particularly concerning flower resources (e.g., importance of exotic species and, thus, management activities).

Safeguarding the most threatened ecosystems requires accurate and integrative quantification of their vulnerability and their functioning, particularly the potential loss of species trait diversity which imperils their functioning. However, the magnitude of threats and associated biological responses both have high uncertainties. Additionally, a major difficulty is the recurrent lack of reference conditions for a fair and operational measurement of vulnerability. Here, we present a functional vulnerability framework that incorporates uncertainty and reference conditions into a generalizable tool. Through in silico simulations of disturbances, our framework allows us to quantify the vulnerability of communities to a wide range of threats. We demonstrate the relevance and operationality of our framework, and its global, scalable and quantitative comparability, through three case studies on marine fishes and mammals. We show that functional vulnerability has marked geographic and temporal patterns. We underline contrasting contributions of species richness and functional redundancy to the level of vulnerability among case studies, indicating that our integrative assessment can also identify the drivers of vulnerability in a world where uncertainty is omnipresent.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000569932",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-022-32331-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/569932","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Community ecology||Ecological modelling||Ecology","A functional vulnerability framework for biodiversity conservation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-09-10T03:14:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85137072549",,"000848744900014","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We used the University of British Columbia’s Point Grey campus in Vancouver, Canada, as a case study, using both historical aerial photographs from 1949 and 2015 LiDAR data. TCC was summed in 0.05 ha analysis polygons for both the LiDAR and aerial photo data, allowing for TCC comparison across the two different data types. Methods were validated using 2015 aerial photos, the means (Δ 0.24) and a TOST test indicated that the methods were statistically equivalent (±5.38% TCC). This research concludes the methods outlined is suitable for small scale TCC change detection over long time frames when inconsistent data types are available between the two time periods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000574112",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0273487","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/574112","en","PLOS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Lidar||Trees||Forests||Urbanization||Forestry||Urban environments||Statistical data||Urban areas","Combining aerial photos and LiDAR data to detect canopy cover change in urban forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-10-04T05:50:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85138445299",,,"PLoS ONE","9","PLoS ONE","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we investigated whether and how the water use of maize (Zea mays L.) varied under hydraulically contrasting soil textures. Our hypothesis is that a textural-specific drop in the hydraulic conductivity is associated with a distinct decrease in transpiration during soil drying. Methods Maize plants were grown in contrasting soil textures (sand, sandy loam, loam) and exposed to soil drying. We measured the relationships between transpiration rate, soil water content as well as soil and leaf water potential. We used a soil-plant hydraulic model to reproduce the experimental observations and infer the hydraulic conductance of the soil-plant system during soil drying. Results We observed the impact of soil texture on plant response to soil drying in various relationships. The soil water potentials at which transpiration decreased were more than one order of magnitude more negative in loam than in sand. The soil-plant conductance decreased not only abruptly but also at less negative soil water potentials in sand than in sandy loam or loam. Stomata closed at less negative leaf water potentials in sand than in loam. The model predictions matched well the experimental observations. Conclusion The results elucidated that the critical soil water content and potential at which plants close stomata depends on the soil texture. These findings support our plea to include soil properties for understanding and predicting stomatal regulation during soil drying.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000566564",,"0032-079X||1573-5036",,"10.1007/s11104-022-05656-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566564","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Belowground hydraulics||Transpiration||Leaf water potential||Soil drying||Water stress","Going underground: soil hydraulic properties impacting maize responsiveness to water deficit",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-26T03:57:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85136131654",,"000841066700001","Plant Soil",,"Plant and Soil","478","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, land-use changes and extreme events are increasingly impacting these processes. In this Review, we describe SHP across scales and examine their links with soil properties, ecosystem processes and climate. Soil structure influences SHP such as infiltration, soil water redistribution and root water uptake on small scales. On local scales, SHP are driven by root water uptake, vegetation and groundwater dynamics. Regionally, SHP are impacted by extreme events such as droughts, floods, heatwaves and land-use change; however, antecedent and current SHP partially determine the broader effects of extreme events. Emerging technologies such as wireless and automated sensing, soil moisture observation through novel synthetic aperture radars satellites, big data analysis and machine learning approaches offer unique opportunities to advance soil hydrology. These advances, in tandem with the inclusion of more key soil types and properties in models, will be pivotal in predicting the role of SHP during global change.",,,,"2662-138X",,"10.1038/s43017-022-00324-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563951","en","Nature",,,,"Soil hydrology in the Earth system",,"Review Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-08-16T04:02:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85135356129",,"000836416900002","Nat Rev Earth Environ","9","Nature Reviews Earth & Environment","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In grasslands, plants and insect herbivores are involved in many ecosystem processes such as herbivory and plant biomass production. Simultaneous changes in the trait composition of both plants and herbivores should affect herbivory rates, with consequences for plant growth and potentially biomass production. The mechanisms underlying these links are little understood for grasses and sucking insects, which build a major part of grassland communities. In a mesocosm experiment, we manipulated the composition of grasses and sucking herbivores (Hemiptera) to study the role of plant traits, herbivore traits and their interaction on herbivory and plant growth. Because sucking herbivory is generally difficult to quantify, we developed a novel experimental setting, in which we labelled plants with 15N isotope. This allowed to quantify 15N uptake and thus sucking rates of individuals. We found that herbivory and simultaneous plant growth reduction are most strongly linked to herbivore species identity. Unexpectedly, herbivory did not increase with herbivore size, but was highest for small species and for thin-bodied Heteroptera. Additionally, herbivory and plant growth reduction depended on the interacting herbivore and plant species, indicating trait matching, which could, however, not be explained with commonly used traits. This indicates that mechanisms linking ecological communities and ecosystem processes are highly context-specific. To understand how global change affects ecosystem functioning, studies need to cover all functionally relevant groups, including plant sap suckers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000558957",,"1439-1791||1618-0089",,"10.1016/j.baae.2022.06.004","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/558957","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Ecosystem functioning||Grasses||Hemiptera||Multitrophic interactions||Trait matching","Tracking sucking herbivory with nitrogen isotope labelling: Lessons from an individual trait-based approach",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-20T03:27:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85133790090",,"000822743700002","Basic Appl.

Understanding their mechanics and growth as well as their complex interplay with the soil properties at different spatial scales, from the sub-micron to the meter scales (cell wall, cell, tissue, root and root systems) requires multidisciplinary approaches and certainly offers a stimulating challenge for soft matter scientists. In this chapter we review the roles of the root and root systems in changing the physical, mechanical and hydric properties of the surrounding soil. We begin by describing the growth and mechanics of a primary root, whose complexity arises from its multicellularity and from the intriguing rheology of the cell wall surrounding the cell under turgor pressure. We continue by illustrating how the growth of a root is affected by the mechanical strength of the soil. Then we describe how an impeded root in a soil modifies the soil microstructure, either by a direct mechanical effect or by the secretion of a gel called mucilage. Finally, we extend to the root systems and their role in increasing the soil strength. Clearly it is crucial to understand the complex interplay between soil and root systems, as vegetation might be used as an ecologically friendly and sustainable alternative to more traditional hard engineering solutions for soil reinforcement.",,,"978-1-78801-724-4||978-1-83916-117-9||978-1-83916-116-2","2048-7681||2048-7681",,"10.1039/9781839161162-00165","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/593290","en","Royal Society of Chemistry",,,,"Root–Soil Interaction",,"Book Chapter","Metadata only","Soft Matter in Plants: From Biophysics to Biomimetics",,"2023-01-18T11:22:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Soft Matter Series","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We show that postglacial arrival time varies within and between plant growth forms. Further, arrival times were mainly predicted by adaptation to temperature, disturbance, and light. Major break points in ecological trait diversity were seen between 13.9 and 10.8 calibrated thousand years before the present (cal ka BP), as well as break point in functional diversity at 12.0 cal ka BP, shifting from a state of ecosystem buildup to a state where most habitat types and biotic ecosystem components were in place. Trait and functional diversity stabilized around 8 cal ka BP, after which both remained stable, although changes in climate took place and species inflow continued. Our ecosystem reconstruction indicates a millennial-scale time phase of formation to reach stable and resilient levels of diversity and functioning.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000575379",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.abo7434","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575379","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Postglacial species arrival and diversity buildup of northern ecosystems took millennia",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-10-12T03:10:27Z",,,,"yes",,,,"FeedBaCks: Feedbacks between Biodiversity and Climate","193907","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","ERA-NET + EJP",,,"85138872560",,"000967967500013","Sci Adv","39","Science Advances","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Increasing availability of monitoring data from sensor networks provides valuable information for developing future regional landslide early warning systems (LEWSs), however, most existing monitoring sites are located on flat terrain. The question arises, if the representativeness for regional landslide activity would improve if sensors were installed on a landslide-prone hillslope? To address this, two soil wetness monitoring stations were installed at close proximity on a steep slope and on a flat location in the Napf region (Northern Alpine Foreland of Switzerland), and measurements were conducted over a period of 3 years. As both sites inhibit similar lithological, vegetation and precipitation characteristics, soil hydrological differences can be attributed to the impact of topography and hydrogeology. At the sloped site, conditions were generally wetter and less variable in time, and evidence was found for temporary lateral water transport along the slope. These differences were systematic and could be reduced by considering relative soil moisture changes. The application of a statistical landslide forecast model showed that both sites were equally able to distinguish critical from non-critical conditions for landslide triggering, which demonstrates the value of existing monitoring sites in flat areas for the application in LEWSs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590906",,,,"10.5194/nhess-2022-211","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590906","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Impact of topography on in-situ soil wetness measurements for regional landslide early warning – a case study from the Swiss Alpine Foreland",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2023-01-09T08:36:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, consumer prejudice, farmer hesitance and strict regulations discourage utilization of these fertilizers, while animal manure is widely accepted. Yet, both fertilizers may contain antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes which spread among soil microorganisms by horizontal gene transfer. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to compare antibiotic resistance gene presence, abundance and diversity in human excreta-derived fertilizers and animal manure. We created a co-occurrence keyword network using the litsearchr R package to find suitable papers and reduce bias. We collected data such as the antibiotic resistance gene determination method, fertilizer base (human or animal), fertilizer type (i.e. manure, sewage sludge), and assessed antibiotic resistance genes. This resulted in 7918 datapoints from 43 papers on human excreta-derived fertilizers, 7558 datapoints from 24 papers on animal manure and 3321 datapoints of untreated soil from 14 papers. Antibiotic resistance genes were most often detected in soil amended with animal manure (91.1%), followed by animal manure directly (81.6%), human excreta-derived fertilizers directly (68.2%), soil amended with human excreta-derived fertilizers (45.2%) and lastly in untreated soil (35.1%). Moreover, antibiotic resistance gene diversity was highest in animal manure, compared to human excreta-derived fertilizers and untreated soil. Animal manure and human excreta-derived fertilizers soil amendments added, respectively, 70 and 28 unique antibiotic resistance genes that were not detected in untreated soil. Our results indicate that, in the context of the soil resistome, human excreta-derived fertilizers are a safe alternative to animal manure. However, studies covering a larger diversity of soil and environmental settings are needed to better understand antibiotic resistance gene dissemination and to identify safe application rates for using human excreta as fertilizer.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000585356",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/585356","en","ETH Zurich, Institute of Terrestrial Ecosystems","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","microbial ecology||antibiotic resistance||antibiotics||Sustainable agriculture||human excreta-derived fertilizers||animal excreta-derived fertilizers","A comparison of antibiotic resistance genes from animal and human waste-based fertilizers: A case for changing farming practices?",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2022-12-06T14:58:10Z",,,,"yes","18th International Symposium on Microbial Ecology (ISME 2022)","August 14–19, 2022","Lausanne, Switzerland","Understanding the impacts of antibiotics from human excreta derived fertilizers on the soil-microbial-plant nexus","193118","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","PRIMA",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, we explore the potential of crowdsourced social media data in tackling the mapping and valuing of forest recreation demand. To do so, we assess the relationships between crowdsourced social media data, acquired from over 350,000 Flickr geotagged pictures, and demand for forest recreation in British Columbia (BC) forests. We first identify temporal and spatial trends of forest recreation demand, as well as the countries of origin of BC forests visitors. Second, we estimate the average number of annual recreational visits with a linear regression model calibrated with empirically collected secondary data. Lastly, we estimate recreational values by deriving the average consumer surpluses for the visitors of BC forested provincial parks. We find that annually, on average, over 44 million recreational experiences are completed in BC forests, with peaks during the summer months and during the weekends. Moreover, a crowdsourced travel cost approach allowed us to value the recreational ecosystem service in five forested provincial parks ranging from ~2.9 to ~35.0 million CAN$/year. Our findings demonstrate that social media data can be used to characterize, quantify and map the demand for forest recreation (especially in peri-urban forests), representing a useful tool for the inclusion of recreational values in forest management.

We detected biogeographic and genetic signatures associated with both mechanisms in the assembly of the biota of the European Alps. Age distributions of endemic and widespread species within aquatic and terrestrial taxa (amphipods, fishes, amphibians, butterflies and flowering plants) revealed that endemic fish evolved only in lakes, are highly sympatric, and mainly of Holocene age, consistent with adaptive radiation. Endemic amphipods are ancient, suggesting preglacial radiation with limited range expansion and local Pleistocene survival, perhaps facilitated by a groundwater-dwelling lifestyle. Terrestrial endemics are mostly of Pleistocene age and are thus more consistent with the glacial species pump. The lack of evidence for Holocene adaptive radiation in the terrestrial biome is consistent with faster recolonization through range expansion of these taxa after glacial retreats. More stable and less seasonal ecological conditions in lakes during the Holocene may also have contributed to Holocene speciation in lakes. The high proportion of young, endemic species makes the Alpine biota vulnerable to climate change, but the mechanisms and consequences of species loss will likely differ between biomes because of their distinct evolutionary histories.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000564874",,"0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2022.1020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/564874","en","Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","time for speciation||llopatric speciation||adaptive radiation||Pleistocene refugia||glacial species pump||European Alps","Climate, immigration and speciation shape terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity in the European Alps",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-19T03:01:11Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85135729552",,"000838576600001","Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1980","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","289","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Unfortunately, empirical studies on soil GHG fluxes from African deforestation hotspots are still limited, creating uncertainties in global GHG budgets. Therefore, we assessed how soil GHG fluxes along with their auxiliary controls (water filled pore space (WFPS), temperature, and mineral nitrogen (N)) differed between the forest and sugarcane plantations. This assessment was based on monthly (forest) and intensive (sugarcane) GHG and auxiliary measurements between May 2019 and June 2020. Measurements were conducted in four reference forest plots and 12 sugarcane plots randomly assigned to three fertilization treatment groups (low, standard, and high), representing the fertilization gradient used by sugarcane farmers in Uganda. Despite the use of different fertilization rates as treatments for the sugarcane experiment, neither auxiliary controls nor soil GHG fluxes significantly differed among the treatments. Soil CO2 effluxes were higher under sugarcane (17.6 ± 0.0 Mg C ha-1 yr-1) compared to forest (14.5 ± 0.1 Mg C ha-1 yr-1; p < 0.001) because of the higher autotrophic respiration from the sugarcane's fine root biomass and the microbial decomposition of the sugarcane's larger soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Conversely, soil CH4 uptake under sugarcane (−1.1 ± 0.0 kg C ha-1 yr-1) was three times lower than under forest (−3.1 ± 0.0 kg C ha-1 yr-1; p < 0.001), owing to the likely alteration of methanotroph abundance upon conversion. Likewise, soil N2O emissions were smaller under sugarcane (1.3 ± 0.0 kg N ha-1 yr-1) compared to forest (1.8 ± 0.0 kg N ha-1 yr-1; p < 0.001) because excess N from fertilizer addition in the sugarcane was either lost through leaching or taken up by the sugarcane crop. Only seasonal variability in WFPS, among the auxiliary controls, affected CH4 uptake at both sites (p < 0.001) and soil CO2 effluxes under sugarcane (p = 0.018). Noteworthy, soil N2O fluxes from both sites were unaltered by the seasonality-mediated changes in auxiliary controls. We conclude that even with the increased SOC sequestration and the lower N2O emissions under sugarcane compared to forest, the forest-sugarcane conversion resulted in a yearly net C loss of 2.8 Mg CO2-eq ha-1 from soils to atmosphere, largely arising from the higher soil CO2 effluxes and to a smaller extent from a reduced CH4 uptake under sugarcane.",,,,"0167-8809||1873-2305",,"10.1016/j.agee.2022.107953","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542574","en","Elsevier",,,"C-balance||Fertilization||Soil greenhouse gas fluxes||Sugarcane||Tropical deforestation||Uganda","Soil greenhouse gas fluxes following conversion of tropical forests to fertilizer-based sugarcane systems in northwestern Uganda",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-04-18T03:30:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85127291979",,"000790051300002","Agric. ecosyst. environ.",,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","333","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Environmental DNA metabarcoding (eDNA) has been proposed as an alternative to Underwater Visual Census (UVC) to offer more rapid assessment of marine biodiversity to meet management demands for ecosystem health indices. Taxonomic information derived from sequenced eDNA can be combined with functional traits and phylogenetic positions to generate a variety of ecological indices describing ecosystem functioning. Here, we inventoried reef fish assemblages of two contrasting coastal areas of Curacao, (i) near the island's capital city and (ii) in a remote area under more limited anthropogenic pressure. We sampled eDNA by filtering large volumes of seawater (2 x 30 L) along 2 km boat transects, which we coupled with species ecological properties related to habitat use, trophic level, and body size to investigate the difference in fish taxonomic composition, functional and phylogenetic indices recovered from eDNA metabarcoding between these two distinct coastal areas. Despite no marked difference in species richness, we found a higher phylogenetic diversity in proximity to the city, but a higher functional diversity on the more isolated reef. Composition differences between coastal areas were associated with different frequencies of reef fish families. Because of a partial reference database, eDNA only partly matched those detected with UVC, but eDNA surveys nevertheless provided rapid and robust species occurrence responses to contrasting environments. eDNA metabarcoding coupled with functional and phylogenetic diversity assessment can serve the management of coastal habitats under increasing threat from global changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000567424",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.9212","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/567424","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Caribbean region||coral reefs||Curaçao||environmental DNA||fish composition||functional diversity||phylogenetic diversity","Ecological indices from environmental DNA to contrast coastal reefs under different anthropogenic pressures",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-30T03:11:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85138687186",,"000843056200001","Ecol Evol","8","Ecology and Evolution","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, how large habitat fragments must be, and what level of protection is required to sustain species, remains poorly known. We compiled a global dataset on almost 2000 bird species in 741 forest fragments varying in size and protection status, and show that protection is associated with higher bird occurrence, especially for threatened species. Protection becomes increasingly effective with increasing size of forest fragments. For forest fragments >50 ha our results show that strict protection (International Union for Conservation of Nature [IUCN] categories I-IV) is strongly associated with higher bird occurrence, whereas fragments had to be at least 175 ha for moderate protection (IUCN categories V and VI) to have a positive effect. This meta-analysis quantifies the importance of fragment size, protection status, and their interaction for the conservation of bird species communities, and stresses that protection should not be limited to large pristine areas.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000540637",,"1540-9295||1540-9309",,"10.1002/fee.2485","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/540637","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Conservation of birds in fragmented landscapes requires protected areas",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2022-04-03T03:05:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85126859515",,"000772023200001","Front. ecol. environ.","6","Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Woody vegetation is a key component of UGSs, providing many socio-ecological benefits such as habitat provision and human well-being. Knowing plant diversity and vegetation configuration that underpin urban ecosystem processes and functions is critical to maximize nature contributions to city dwellers. Here, we present a well-replicated multi-city study showing a detailed description of taxonomic and structural diversity of woody vegetation in 225 UGSs distributed across seven European cities along a NE-SW gradient. Our aim was to understand how UGSs attributes, including size and fragmentation, influence woody vegetation features. A total of 418 woody species belonging to 76 families were identified. UGS size displayed weak positive correlations with woody species richness, but a strong negative correlation with woody species density. Alien woody species were abundant in all cities (from 40% of all species recorded in Antwerp to 64% in Lisbon and Zurich). Among the native tree species we found a predominance of Pinus spp. in southern cities and Acer spp. in cooler climates. On average, tree canopies extent was 56% of UGSs. This paper provides insights on the plant diversity and woody vegetation composition in UGSs of different size, climate and urban planning history. Our results encourage and contribute to future urban ecology studies involving different taxa and ecosystem services as well as support effective urban planning and management practices.","application/pdf",,,"1618-8667",,"10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127650","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/558949","en","Elsevier",,,"Urban vegetation||Species richness||Above-ground biomass||Canopy cover||Species-area relationship","Negative relationship between woody species density and size of urban green spaces in seven European cities",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-07-20T03:12:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85134561539",,"000823431700004",,,"Urban Forestry & Urban Greening","74","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although cycling of essential nutrients affects recovery trajectories of secondary forests, the effect of nutrient limitation on forest regrowth is poorly constrained. Here we use three lines of evidence from secondary forest succession sequences in central Africa to identify potential nutrient limitation in regrowing forests. First, we show that atmospheric phosphorus supply exceeds demand along forest succession, whereas forests rely on soil stocks to meet their base cation demands. Second, soil nutrient metrics indicate that available phosphorus increases along the succession, whereas available cations decrease. Finally, fine root, foliar and litter stoichiometry show that tissue calcium concentrations decline relative to those of nitrogen and phosphorus during succession. Taken together, these observations suggest that calcium becomes an increasingly scarce resource in central African forests during secondary succession. Furthermore, ecosystem calcium storage shifts from soil to woody biomass over succession, making it a vulnerable nutrient in the wake of land-use change scenarios that involve woody biomass export. Our results thus call for a broadened focus on elements other than nitrogen and phosphorus regarding tropical forest biogeochemical cycles and identify calcium as a scarce and potentially limiting nutrient in an increasingly disturbed and dynamic tropical forest landscape.",,,,"2397-334X",,"10.1038/s41559-022-01810-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557186","en","Nature",,,,"Increasing calcium scarcity along Afrotropical forest succession",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-07-11T02:52:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85133481891",,"000820561900005","Nat Ecol Evol","8","Nature Ecology & Evolution","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study examines the potential of integrating Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data to map FCC in the heterogeneous Mediterranean oak forests of western Iran in different data densities (one-year datasets vs. three-year datasets). This study used very high-resolution satellite images from Google Earth, gridded points, and field inventory plots to generate a reference dataset. Based on it, four FCC classes were defined, namely non-forest, sparse forest (FCC = 1–30%), medium-density forest (FCC = 31–60%), and dense forest (FCC > 60%). In this study, three machine learning (ML) models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), were used in the Google Earth Engine and their performance was compared for classification. Results showed that the SVM produced the highest accuracy on FCC mapping. The three-year time series increased the ability of all ML models to classify FCC classes, in particular the sparse forest class, which was not distinguished well by the one-year dataset. Class-level accuracy assessment results showed a remarkable increase in F-1 scores for sparse forest classification by integrating S-1 and S-2 (10.4% to 18.2% increased for the CART and SVM ML models, respectively). In conclusion, the synergetic use of S-1 and S-2 spectral temporal metrics improved the classification accuracy compared to that obtained using only S-2. The study relied on open data and freely available tools and can be integrated into national monitoring systems of FCC in Mediterranean oak forests of Iran and neighboring countries with similar forest attributes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000563161",,"2220-9964",,"10.3390/ijgi11080423","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563161","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","forest canopy cover||Google Earth Engine||machine learning||random forest||support vector machine||classification and regression tree||Sentinel time series||Quercus brantii||Iran","The Influence of Data Density and Integration on Forest Canopy Cover Mapping Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series in Mediterranean Oak Forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-11T09:19:32Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85137378702",,"000845781700001","ISPRS int. j. geo-inf.","S 8","ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Next, we assess how current financial barriers might be overcome. We find that there are market incentives for corporate entities to finance restoration for carbon drawdown, sustainable branding, and to promote sustainability in supply chains. Conversely, asset managers face strong barriers as projects are deemed high risk and with low prospects for sufficient return on investments. Through enhanced markets for restoration benefits, complementary public policies, and financial instruments, private finance for restoration can be scaled for a wider variety of restoration projects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000592696",,,,"https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1851634/v1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/592696","en","Research Square","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Unlocking the potential of private finance for forest and landscape restoration",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2023-01-16T13:01:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Research Square",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we investigate how habitat connectivity and habitat heterogeneity affect phenotypic differentiation by formulating a stochastic eco-evolutionary model where individuals are structured over a spatial graph. We combine analytical insights into the eco-evolutionary dynamics with numerical simulations to understand how the graph topology and the spatial distribution of habitat types affect differentiation. We show that not only low connectivity but also heterogeneity in connectivity promotes neutral differentiation, due to increased competition in highly connected vertices. Habitat assortativity, a measure of habitat spatial auto-correlation in graphs, additionally drives differentiation under habitat-dependent selection. While assortative graphs systematically amplify adaptive differentiation, they can foster or depress neutral differentiation depending on the migration regime. By formalising the eco-evolutionary and spatial dynamics of biological populations on graphs, our study establishes fundamental links between landscape features and phenotypic differentiation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557746",,"2399-3642",,"10.1038/s42003-022-03595-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557746","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biodiversity||Evolutionary ecology||Network topology||Population dynamics","Eco-evolutionary model on spatial graphs reveals how habitat structure affects phenotypic differentiation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-13T03:07:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85133415382",,"000825338900001","Commun Biol","1","Communications Biology","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Increasing monitoring of marine ecosystems is crucial to understand the breadth of the changes in biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and propose more effective conservation strategies. Such strategies should not only focus on maximizing the number of species (i.e., taxonomic diversity) but also the diversity of phylogenetic histories and ecological functions within communities. To support future conservation decisions, multicomponent biodiversity monitoring can be combined with high-throughput species assemblage detection methods such as environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. Here, we used eDNA to assess fish biodiversity along the coast of southern Brittany (France, Iroise Sea). We filtered surface marine water from 17 sampling stations and applied an eDNA metabarcoding approach targeting Actinopterygii and Elasmobranchii taxa. We documented three complementary biodiversity components—taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity—and three diversity facets—richness, divergence and regularity. We identified a north/south contrast with higher diversity for the three facets of the biodiversity components in the northern part of the study area. The northern communities showed higher species richness, stronger phylogenetic overdispersion and lower functional clustering compared to the ones in the southern part, due to the higher diversity of habitats (reefs, rocky shores) and restricted access for fishing. Moreover, we also detected a higher level of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional uniqueness in many offshore stations compared to more coastal ones, with the presence of species typically living at greater depths (> 300 m), which suggests an influence of hydrodynamic structures and currents on eDNA dispersion and hence sample composition. eDNA metabarcoding can, therefore, be used as an efficient sampling method to reveal fine-scale community compositions and in combination with functional and phylogenetic information to document multicomponent biodiversity gradients in coastal marine systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576730",,"2637-4943",,"10.1002/edn3.305","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576730","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Actinopterygii||beta-diversity||Chondrichthyes||functional diversity||Iroise Sea||metabarcoding||phylogenetic diversity||taxonomic diversity","Disentangling the components of coastal fish biodiversity in southern Brittany by applying an environmental DNA approach",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-10-19T03:05:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85129333225",,,,"4","Environmental DNA","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Stomatal optimization models posit that stomata maximize the carbon gain relative to a penalty caused by water loss, such as xylem cavitation. However, a mechanism that allows the stomata to behave optimally is unknown. Here, we introduce a model of stomatal regulation that results in similar stomatal behaviour without presupposing an optimality principle. By contrast, the proposed model explains stomatal closure based on a well-known component of stomatal regulation: abscisic acid (ABA). The ABA level depends on its production rate, which is assumed to increase with declining leaf water potential, and on its degradation rate, which is assumed to increase with assimilation rate. Our model predicts that stomata open until the ratio of leaf water potential to assimilation rate, proportional to ABA level, is at a minimum. As a prerequisite, the model simulates soil-plant hydraulics and leaf photosynthesis under varying environmental conditions. The model predicts that in wet soils and at low vapour pressure deficit (VPD), when there is no water limitation, stomatal closure is controlled by the relationship between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. In dry soils or at high VPD, when the soil hydraulic conductivity limits the water supply, stomatal closure is triggered by the sharp decline in leaf water potential as transpiration rate increases. Being adaptive to changing soil and atmospheric conditions, the proposed model can explain how plants are enabled to avoid critical water potentials during drought for varying soil properties and atmospheric conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000517715",,"1936-0592||1936-0584",,"10.1002/eco.2386","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517715","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","abscisic acid (ABA)||drought||root water uptake||soil–plant hydraulics||stomatal regulation","Stomatal regulation prevents plants from critical water potentials during drought: Result of a model linking soil–plant hydraulics to abscisic acid dynamics",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-11-30T09:03:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85121431912",,"000731183100001",,"5","Ecohydrology","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Quantifying how sensitive streamflow timing is to climate change and where it is most sensitive remain key questions. Physically based hydrological models are often used for this purpose; however, they have embedded assumptions that translate into uncertain hydrological projections that need to be quantified and constrained to provide reliable inferences. The purpose of this study is to evaluate differences in projected end-of-century changes to streamflow timing between a new empirical model based on diel (daily) streamflow cycles and regional land surface simulations across the mountainous western USA. We develop an observational technique for detecting streamflow responses to snowmelt using diel cycles of incoming solar radiation and streamflow to detect when snowmelt occurs. We measure the date of the 20th percentile of snowmelt days (DOS20) across 31 western USA watersheds affected by snow, as a proxy for the beginning of snowmelt-initiated streamflow. Historic DOS20 varies from mid-January to late May among our sites, with warmer basins having earlier snowmelt-mediated streamflow. Mean annual DOS20 strongly correlates with the dates of 25% and 50% annual streamflow volume (DOQ25 and DOQ50, both R2=0.85), suggesting that a 1 d earlier DOS20 corresponds with a 1 d earlier DOQ25 and 0.7 d earlier DOQ50. Empirical projections of future DOS20 based on a stepwise multiple linear regression across sites and years under the RCP8.5 scenario for the late 21st century show that DOS20 will occur on average 11±4 d earlier per 1 °C of warming. However, DOS20 in colder watersheds (mean November–February air temperature, TNDJF < -8 °C) is on average 70 % more sensitive to climate change than in warmer watersheds (TNDJF > 0 °C). Moreover, empirical projections of DOQ25 and DOQ50 based on DOS20 are about four and two times more sensitive to climate change, respectively, than those simulated by a state-of-the-art land surface model (NoahMP-WRF) under the same scenario. Given the importance of changes in streamflow timing for water resources, and the significant discrepancies found in projected streamflow sensitivity, snowmelt detection methods such as DOS20 based on diel streamflow cycles may help to constrain model parameters, improve hydrological predictions, and inform process understanding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557187",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-26-3393-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557187","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Diel streamflow cycles suggest more sensitive snowmelt-driven streamflow to climate change than land surface modeling does",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-11T02:52:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85133651003",,"000820626500001","Hydrol.

Changes of grazing pressure and climate have been identified as drivers of woody encroachment in subalpine pastures, but disentangling their relative importance remains challenging. It is particularly unclear if grazing alone can mitigate potential climate change impacts on encroachment.  2. We used the dynamic vegetation model LandClim to simulate how multiple biotic and abiotic factors influence the rate of woody encroachment (i.e. how changes in temperature and precipitation influence woody and herbaceous vegetation, and interactions with grazing). We simulated a 61-ha subalpine pasture in Switzerland near tree line. Currently, 21% of the pasture is covered by woody plants.  3. If current grazing levels are maintained, almost all climate change scenarios showed an increase in woody cover. Under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, there was a mean encroachment rate of 0.24% and 0.15% per year respectively.  4. Large variation among climate model chains with RCP 8.5 was found, due to variations in precipitation. Generally, decreasing precipitation caused woody encroachment to slow down, even under very low grazing pressures.  5. Using a sensitivity analysis with all possible combinations of grazing pressure, temperature and precipitation changes, we found that woody encroachment rates were most sensitive to changes in grazing pressure. Precipitation change was the second most important factor, while temperature changes were least important.   6. Synthesis and applications. Modelling shows that increasing grazing pressure in subalpine pastures can strongly reduce woody encroachment and mitigate climate change impacts on woody encroachment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000550327",,"0021-8901||1365-2664",,"10.1111/1365-2664.14199","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/550327","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","alpine||cattle||climate change||dynamic vegetation model||landscape||livestock||Woody encroachment","Management-based mitigation of the impacts of climate-driven woody encroachment in high elevation pasture woodlands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-06-02T03:43:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85132643964",,"000799425900001","J.

However, for plants, species range maps remain scarce and often inaccurate.  We present a novel approach to map species ranges at a global scale, integrating polygon mapping and species distribution modelling (SDM). We develop a polygon mapping algorithm by considering distances and nestedness of occurrences. We further apply an SDM approach considering multiple modelling algorithms, complexity levels, and pseudo-absence selections to map the species at a high spatial resolution and intersect it with the generated polygons.  We use this approach to construct range maps for all 1957 species of Fagales and Pinales with data compilated from multiple sources. We construct high-resolution global species richness maps of these important plant clades, and document diversity hotspots for both clades in southern and south-western China, Central America, and Borneo. We validate the approach with two representative genera, Quercus and Pinus, using previously published coarser range maps, and find good agreement.  By efficiently producing high-resolution range maps, our mapping approach offers a new tool in the field of macroecology for studying global species distribution patterns and supporting ongoing conservation efforts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000547222",,"0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.18158","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/547222","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","biodiversity||Fagales||mapping||Pinales||polygon (hull)||range map||species distribution modelling (SDM)||species richness","An integrated high-resolution mapping shows congruent biodiversity patterns of Fagales and Pinales",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-05-15T02:46:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85132293287",,"000790780600001","New Phytol.","2","New Phytologist","235","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) from organisms can be captured in ecosystem samples and sequenced using metabarcoding, but processing large volumes of eDNA data and annotating sequences to recognized taxa remains computationally expensive. Speed and accuracy are two major bottlenecks in this critical step. Here, we evaluated the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process short eDNA sequences and associate them with taxonomic labels. Using a unique eDNA data set collected in highly diverse Tropical South America, we compared the speed and accuracy of CNNs with that of a well-known bioinformatic pipeline (OBITools) in processing a small region (60 bp) of the 12S ribosomal DNA targeting freshwater fishes. We found that the taxonomic labels from the CNNs were comparable to those from OBITools, with high correlation levels for the composition of the regional fish fauna. The CNNs enabled the processing of raw fastq files at a rate of approximately 1 million sequences per minute, which was about 150 times faster than with OBITools. Given the good performance of CNNs in the highly diverse ecosystem considered here, the development of more elaborate CNNs promises fast deployment for future biodiversity inventories using eDNA.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557119",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-022-13412-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557119","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biodiversity||Classification and taxonomy","Applying convolutional neural networks to speed up environmental DNA annotation in a highly diverse ecosystem",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-07-10T03:17:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85132149580",,"000812565400032","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Driven in part by worsening macroeconomic conditions, these structural changes and the associated rationalization of agricultural supply chains have affected social relations in rural areas. In turn, farmers' social contacts influence farming decisions. Social and structural changes are thus interconnected, and they affect the resilience of rural areas through their influence on environmental, social, and economic capital. OBJECTIVE: We examine the connection between farm structures and farmers' social contacts in the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Entlebuch (UBE), a mountain region in central Switzerland with a strong presence of family farms, and explore the implications of social and structural change for rural resilience. METHODS: We conduct a survey of N =102 farming households and combine it with farm-level agricultural census data and interviews with key stakeholders (N =13) to analyze farmers' current social contacts and their changes since the year 2000. We use regression and cluster analyses to examine the relationship between (changes in) social contacts and farm-level characteristics. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Farmers in the UBE have a high, but decreasing frequency of contacts with family, friends, and colleagues and lower, but increasing frequency of commercial and administrative contacts. Work-loads have increased by 6% in five years, driven by farm-level expansion of agricultural area (+5%)—including expanding ecological compensation areas—and intensification in managed areas (+3%), leading to parallel processes of intensification and extensification. Since most of these family farms do not hire workers, growing workloads directly impinge on farmers' free time, affecting informal contacts most. Farm managers in larger and more intensive farms have more frequent and more diverse, but also more rapidly declining, social contacts. Our results point to a net loss in social capital as social contacts become less frequent and shift from local and informal to regional and national professional contacts. SIGNIFICANCE: A 17% decline in farm numbers in 15 years reflects the vulnerability of farms in this region. Growing financial strain, workloads, time pressure and the associated erosion of informal contacts contribute to this vulnerability. Policymakers from local to national should recognize the contribution of farmers' diverse social networks towards rural resilience and seek options to maintain and enhance such networks. Beyond direct interventions that foster social capital, policymakers should more rigorously consider the short- and long-term interconnections and tradeoffs between different forms of capital.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000548539",,"0308-521X",,"10.1016/j.agsy.2022.103435","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/548539","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Farming||Agriculture||Social capital||Structural change||Switzerland||UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Entlebuch","Structural change in agriculture and farmers' social contacts: Insights from a Swiss mountain region",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-05-23T11:21:02Z",,,,"yes",,,,"SNF R4D","152167","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 60: Gesuch",,,"85130579947",,"000805833200001",,,"Agricultural Systems","200","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Species vulnerability to multiple threats, which affect provision of ecosystem services, is poorly understood. We conducted a region-wide, spatially explicit assessment of the vulnerability of 63 socioeconomically important tree species to overexploitation, fire, overgrazing, habitat conversion, and climate change. Trees were selected for assessment from national priority lists, and selections were validated by an expert network representing 20 countries. We used Maxent suitability modeling to predict species distribution ranges, freely accessible spatial data sets to map threat exposures, and functional traits to estimate threat sensitivities. Species-specific vulnerability maps were created as the product of exposure maps and sensitivity estimates. Based on vulnerability to current threats and climate change, we identified priority areas for conservation and restoration. Overall, 74% of the most important areas for conservation of these trees fell outside protected areas, and all species were severely threatened across an average of 47% of their native ranges. The most imminent threats were overexploitation and habitat conversion; populations were severely threatened by these factors in an average of 24% and 16% of their ranges, respectively. Our model predicted limited overall climate change impacts, although some study species were likely to lose over 15% of their habitat by 2050 due to climate change. We pinpointed specific natural areas in Borneo rain forests as hotspots for in situ conservation of forest genetic resources, more than 82% of which fell outside designated protected areas. We also identified degraded areas in Western Ghats, Indochina dry forests, and Sumatran rain forests as hotspots for restoration, where planting or assisted natural regeneration will help conserve these species, and croplands in southern India and Thailand as potentially important agroforestry options. Our results highlight the need for regionally coordinated action for effective conservation and restoration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000535009",,"0888-8892||1523-1739",,"10.1111/cobi.13873","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/535009","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","climate change analysis||conservation hotspots||conservation priorities||restoration hotspots||restoration priorities||spatially explicit threat assessment||species distribution modeling||tree species||vulnerability mapping||especies de árboles","Tropical and subtropical Asia's valued tree species under threat",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-03-03T04:04:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85123244804",,"000754563100001","Conserv.

We show that spray applications of the insecticide sulfoxaflor (product Closer) and the fungicide azoxystrobin (product Amistar), both alone and combined, had no significant negative impacts on adult female survival or the production, mortality, sex ratio and body size of offspring when sulfoxaflor was applied five days before crop flowering. Our results indicate that for O. bicornis (1) the risk of adverse impacts of sulfoxaflor (Closer) on fitness is small when applied at least five days before crop flowering and (2) that azoxystrobin (Amistar) has a low potential of exacerbating sulfoxaflor effects under field-realistic conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000547304",,"0160-4120||1873-6750",,"10.1016/j.envint.2022.107252","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/547304","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Azoxystrobin||Osmia bicornis||Pesticides||Pollinators||Sulfoxaflor||Mitigation measures","No evidence for impaired solitary bee fitness following pre-flowering sulfoxaflor application alone or in combination with a common fungicide in a semi-field experiment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-05-16T07:37:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85129458997",,"000793757900004","Environ.

However, such dynamics remain poorly documented, and their drivers unclear. Here, we investigate changes in fish assemblages of two key European fishing areas, the Bay of Biscay (BoB) and the Celtic Sea (CS), during the last two decades. We quantify the relative contribution of change in energy (i.e. temperature and trophic resources), habitat (depth, substrate, oxygen) and fishing pressure to explaining observed spatial and temporal variations in fish diversity. We used long-term scientific surveys to evaluate the spatio-temporal changes in species richness (SR), abundance and composition of demersal fish (Actinopterygii) assemblages at different spatial scales combined with a range of regression models and variance partitioning. Diversity patterns showed greater variability in space than in time: SR weakly changed over time, while compositional dissimilarity showed local patterns of taxonomic homogenization in the CS and differentiation in the southern BoB, where local assemblages were becoming more similar and dissimilar over time, respectively. Energy funnelled through small pelagic species as a potential trophic link affecting the dynamics of demersal assemblages was the most important driver, while habitat and fishing pressure had limited importance. Our study revealed contrasted dynamics of demersal fish assemblages at a regional scale that were best explained by the dynamics of small pelagic species. Direct effects of environmental forcing and fishing pressure were limited in both regions which have a long history of fishing and still remain relatively buffered from global warming effects. This research paved the way to combine methods inspired by biogeography with scientific monitoring surveys to detect spatio-temporal dynamics of fish assemblages and their drivers in marine ecosystems under multiple pressures.",,,,"0079-6611",,"10.1016/j.pocean.2022.102788","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543437","en","Elsevier",,,"Actinopterygii||beta diversity||Energy||Habitat||Long-term ecological surveys||Taxonomic homogenization","Contrasted spatio-temporal changes in the demersal fish assemblages and the dominance of the environment vs fishing pressure, in the Bay of Biscay and Celtic Sea",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-04-23T03:54:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85128227227",,"000929868000001","Prog.

Nevertheless, semantic model production usually requires quite a lot of human interaction, which may result in quite long and annoying procedures for human operators. The production of 3D semantic models of buildings often takes advantage of already available 3D reconstructions of the considered objects. Given the ever increasing resolution of 3D reconstructions, obtained thanks to the recently developed laser scanners and photogrammetric software, the availability of tools for supporting the automatic or semi-automatic generation of semantic models represents a key step for easing and speeding up the process of semantic model production. In particular, the correct semantic interpretation of the different parts of a 3D point cloud, can be seen as the basic step for the production of a BIM model. The most frequently used methods for point cloud semantic segmentation can be separated in two categories: those directly segmenting the point clouds and those based on the ancillary semantic segmentation of images representing the object of interest, then transferring back the segmentation results to the point cloud. This work focuses on the latter method, considering more specifically the application of heritage building semantic segmentation. To be more specific, this paper investigates the semantic segmentation performance on a set of four heritage buildings, obtained first applying deep-learning based image semantic segmentation and then propagating back the semantic information to the point cloud by means of a voting strategy. The obtained results are quite encouraging, motivating future investigations on improvements of this strategy, in particular when including more buildings in the considered dataset.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557131",,"1682-1750||2194-9034||1682-1777",,"10.5194/isprs-archives-XLIII-B2-2022-861-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557131","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","3D point cloud||Semantic segmentation||Label transfer||Heritage buildings","2D to 3D Label Propagation for the Semantic Segmentation of Heritage Building Point Clouds",,"Conference Paper","Open access",,,"2022-07-10T03:28:09Z",,,,"yes","XXIV ISPRS Congress “Imaging today, foreseeing tomorrow”, Commission II","June 6-11, 2022","Nice, France",,,,,,,,"85132029436",,"000855635300116","Int.

These sensors were primarily designed for indoor use, making them highly unpredictable in terms of their performance and accuracy when used outdoors. The Azure Kinect belongs to this category of low-cost 3D scanners and has been successfully employed in outdoor applications. In addition, this sensor possesses features such as portability and live visualization during data acquisition that makes it extremely interesting in the field of forestry. In the context of forest inventory, these advantages would allow to facilitate the task of tree parameters acquisition in an efficient manner. In this paper, a protocol was established for the acquisition of 3D data in forests using the Azure Kinect. A comparison of the resulting point cloud was performed against photogrammetry. Results demonstrated that the Azure Kinect point cloud was of suitable quality for extracting tree parameters such as diameter at breast height (DBH, with a standard deviation of 2.2cm). Furthermore, the quality of the visual and geometric information of the point cloud was evaluated in terms of its feasibility to identify microhabitats. Microhabitats represent valuable information on forest biodiversity and are included in Swiss forest inventory measurements. In total, five different microhabitats were identified in the Azure Kinect Point cloud. The measurements were therefore comparable to sensors such as terrestrial laser scanning and photogrammetry. Therefore, we argue that the Azure Kinect point cloud can efficiently identify certain types of microhabitats and this study presents a first approach of its application in forest inventories.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557133",,"1682-1750||2194-9034||1682-1777",,"10.5194/isprs-archives-XLIII-B2-2022-989-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557133","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Point cloud||Azure kinect||Close-range photogrammetry||Microhabitat detection||DBH||Bark texture","Evaluation of Azure Kinect Derived Point Clouds to Determine the Presence of Microhabitats on Single Trees Based on the Swiss Standard Parameters",,"Conference Paper","Open access",,,"2022-07-10T03:28:09Z",,,,"yes","XXIV ISPRS Congress “Imaging today, foreseeing tomorrow”, Commission II","June 6-11, 2022","Nice, France",,,,,,,,"85132026332",,"000855635300133","Int.

We used stable isotopes of water to compare the seasonal origins of water found in three common tree species across 24 Swiss forest sites sampled in two different years. Water from winter precipitation was observed in trees at most sites, even at the peak of summer, although the relative representation of seasonal sources differed by species. However, the representation of winter precipitation in trees decreased with site mean annual precipitation in both years; additionally, it was generally lower in the cooler and wetter year. Together, these relationships show that precipitation amount influenced the seasonal origin of water taken up by trees across both time and space.

Fish sequence diversity was decreased primarily byestuarine pollution factors (chemical oxygen demand and zinc) in the YLJK.

In this context, the 3D semantic segmentation of heritage point clouds presents an interesting and promising approach for modelling automation, in light of the heterogeneous nature of historical building styles and features. However, this heterogeneity also presents an obstacle in terms of generating the training data for use in deep learning, hitherto performed largely manually. The current generally low availability of labelled data also presents a motivation to aid the process of training data generation. In this paper, we propose the use of approaches based on geometric rules to automate to a certain degree this task. One object class will be discussed in this paper, namely the pillars class. Results show that the approach managed to extract pillars with satisfactory quality (98.5% of correctly detected pillars with the proposed algorithm). Tests were also performed to use the outputs in a deep learning segmentation setting, with a favourable outcome in terms of reducing the overall labelling time (−66.5%). Certain particularities were nevertheless observed, which also influence the result of the deep learning segmentation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557140",,"2194-9042||2194-9050",,"10.5194/isprs-annals-V-2-2022-317-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557140","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Training data||Automation||Deep learning||Point cloud||Heritage||Semantic segmentation","Automatic Training Data Generation in Deep Learning-Aided Semantic Segmentation of Heritage Buildings",,"Conference Paper","Open access",,,"2022-07-10T03:28:38Z",,,,"yes","XXIV ISPRS Congress ""Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow"", Commission II","June 6-11, 2022","Nice, France",,,,,,,,"85132303616",,"000855196400041","ISPRS Ann.

These approaches cannot map local heterogeneities in CA, which typically exist in intact soil. Here, we explore the potential and limitations of in situ measurements of three-dimensional CAs with simplified benchmark tests and in intact sand. The method is based on a protocol for the freely available OpenFOAM software and applied to segmented X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) data. This study scrutinizes its suitability under typical vadose zone conditions, as it was originally developed for rock studies in petroleum engineering. The assets of the method are that it allows for accurate measurement of locally varying, equilibrium contact angles and that they can be linked to pore scale features that cause them. This is demonstrated with rehydrated mucilage structures in sand and the associated change in local CAs, where they touch sand grains. In general, the image acquisition time of polychromatic X-ray CT (minutes) precludes the assessments of dynamic CAs that may equilibrate within seconds. Another limitation is that acute CAs are overestimated due to the voxel discretization of interfaces and contact lines in combination with image smoothing. The divergence arises around 60 degrees and is most severe in the limit of vanishing water repellency. In summary, the method enables the mapping of local heterogeneities of equilibrium CAs, though the absolute values should be critically assessed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543969",,"1539-1663",,"10.1002/vzj2.20197","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543969","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"In situ measurement of 3D contact angle in sand based on X-ray computed tomography",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-04-27T03:13:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85129055652",,"000782562400001","Vadose Zone J.","3","Vadose Zone Journal","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, errors in the amplification and sequencing of eDNA samples can blur this intraspecific signal and strongly over-estimate genetic diversity. Existing bioinformatics pipelines therefore need to be tested to evaluate whether reliable levels of intraspecific genetic variability can be derived from eDNA samples. Here, we compare the ability of twelve metabarcoding pipelines to detect intraspecific genetic variability combining five programs. All pipelines have common pre-processing steps, a processing data step using programs among obiclean; DADA2; SWARM; and LULU. An additional chimera removal step is also investigated based on two programs (VSEARCH or DADA2). The case study was the natural intraspecific variation within Mullus surmuletus in experimental settings. We developed specific primers for this species, located on the mitochondrial D-loop fragment (barcode MS-DL06). Thirty-nine individuals were collected from the Mediterranean Sea, placed into four aquariums, and their DNA was sequenced on this marker to build an intraspecific reference database. After filtering the aquarium water, DNA was extracted, amplified, and sequenced using the primer pair developed. We then quantified the number of true haplotypes returned by each pipeline and its capacity to eliminate most of the erroneous sequences. We show that the program DADA2 with a two-parent chimeric sequence removal step is the best tool to estimate intraspecific diversity from eDNA. Furthermore, our approach was also able to detect true M. surmuletus haplotypes in two eDNA samples collected in the Mediterranean Sea. We conclude that the combination of an appropriate intrapopulation barcode and a denoising pipeline like DADA2 with a chimeric sequence removal step is promising to make population-level inference using environmental DNA possible.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000550930",,"2637-4943",,"10.1002/edn3.269","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/550930","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","bioinformatics||environmental DNA||fish||genetic diversity||marine ecology","Evaluating bioinformatics pipelines for population-level inference using environmental DNA",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-06-05T03:00:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85124548375",,,,"3","Environmental DNA","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

One such system, the Swiss plate geophone (SPG), has been calibrated in several gravel-bed streams using direct sampling techniques. The linear calibration coefficients linking the signal recorded by the SPG system to the transported bedload can vary between different monitoring stations by about a factor of six, for reasons that remain unclear. Recent controlled flume experiments allowed us to identify the grain-size distribution of the transported bedload as a further site-specific factor influencing the signal response of the SPG system, along with the flow velocity and the bed roughness. Additionally, impact tests performed at various field sites suggested that seismic waves generated by impacting particles can propagate over several plates of an SPG array, and thus potentially bias the bedload estimates. To gain an understanding of this phenomenon, we adapted a test flume by installing a partition wall to shield individual sensor plates from impacting particles. We show that the SPG system is sensitive to seismic waves that propagate from particle impacts on neighboring plates or on the concrete bed close to the sensors despite isolating elements. Based on this knowledge, we designed a filter method that uses time-frequency information to identify and eliminate these “apparent” impacts. Finally, we apply the filter to four field calibration datasets and show that it significantly reduces site-to-site differences between calibration coefficients and enables the derivation of a single calibration curve for total bedload at all four sites.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000550002",,"2333-5084",,"10.1029/2021EA001962","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/550002","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","bedload transport||Swiss plate geophone||flume experiments||noise filtering||general calibration relationship","Improving the Calibration of the Swiss Plate Geophone Bedload Monitoring System by Filtering Out Seismic Signals From Extraneous Particle Impacts",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-06-01T03:06:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85130600770",,"000803050000001",,"5","Earth and Space Science","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These activities account for a significant portion of the total log procurement costs, therefore, attempts were made in previous studies to optimize some aspects of log logistics. However, operational details, such as sorting decisions, truck compatibility requirements, and social objectives, are often disregarded in the optimization literature. Incorporating these details into the model makes the results more realistic and applicable. To address these gaps, a bi-objective mixed-integer programming model is developed in this paper in order to optimize log logistics. The first objective is to minimize total logistics costs, and the second objective is to provide a balanced workload for trucking contractors. The bi-objective model is solved using the goal programming approach. The model is applied to log logistics of a large Canadian forest company, where trucking contractors use heterogeneous fleet of trucks to carry various log sorts from cut-blocks to sort yards for sorting. The planning horizon is four weeks with daily decisions. The goal programming model generates balanced workloads for the contractors with less than 0.4% increase in total costs compared to the single objective model where only the total cost is minimized.||La logistique des rondins inclut le tri, le traitement et le transport des rondins à partir du lieu de leur récolte jusqu’aux lieux où il y a une demande. Ces activités représentent une partie importante des coûts totaux de l’approvisionnement en rondins et, par conséquent, des tentatives ont été faites dans des études antérieures pour optimiser certains aspects de la logistique des rondins. Toutefois, les détails opérationnels, par exemple les décisions de tri, les exigences de compatibilité des camions et les objectifs sociaux, sont souvent ignorés dans la documentation sur l’optimisation. L’intégration de ces détails dans le modèle rend les résultats plus réalistes et plus applicables. Pour combler ces lacunes, un modèle de programmation d’entier relatif mixte bi-critères d’optimisation est développé dans la présente communication dans le but d’optimiser la logistique des rondins. Le premier objectif est de minimiser les coûts totaux de la logistique et le second objectif est de fournir une charge de travail équilibrée aux entrepreneurs en camionnage. Le modèle bi-critères d’optimisation est résolu en utilisant une approche de programmation des objectifs. Le modèle est appliqué à la logistique des rondins d’une importante compagnie forestière canadienne où les entrepreneurs en camionnage utilisent une flotte hétérogène de camions pour transporter diverses sortes de rondins à partir des blocs de coupe jusqu’aux parcs de triage pour y être triés. L’horizon de planification est de 4 semaines avec des décisions quotidiennes. Le modèle de programmation des objectifs génère des charges de travail équilibrées pour les entrepreneurs avec une augmentation des coûts totaux de moins de 0.4 % comparativement au modèle à objectif unique où seulement le coût total est minimisé.

Individual tree canopies were identified with light detection and ranging data and aggregated to 0.05 ha grid sections. Using canopy cover and forest arrangement, the urban forest was classified into closed, open, small, sparse, or non- forest classifications.

It is still poorly understood how fast interlinked ecosystem processes respond to altered environmental conditions, if these responses occur gradually or suddenly when thresholds are exceeded, and if the patterns of the responses will reach a stable state. We conducted an irrigation experiment in the Pfynwald, Switzerland from 2003–2018. A naturally dry Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest was irrigated with amounts that doubled natural precipitation, thus releasing the forest stand from water limitation. The aim of this study was to provide a quantitative understanding on how different traits and functions of individual trees and the whole ecosystem responded to increased water availability, and how the patterns and magnitudes of these responses developed over time. We found that the response magnitude, the temporal trajectory of responses, and the length of initial lag period prior to significant response largely varied across traits. We detected rapid and stronger responses from above-ground tree traits (e.g., tree-ring width, needle length, and crown transparency) compared to below-ground tree traits (e.g., fine root biomass). The altered above-ground traits during the initial years of irrigation increased the water demand and trees adjusted by increasing root biomass during the later years of irrigation, resulting in an increased survival rate of Scots pine trees in irrigated plots. The irrigation also stimulated ecosystem-level foliar decomposition rate, fungal fruit body biomass, and regeneration abundances of broadleaved tree species. However, irrigation did not promote the regeneration of Scots pine trees which are reported to be vulnerable to extreme droughts. Our results provide extensive evidence that tree- and ecosystem-level responses were pervasive across a number of traits on long-term temporal scales. However, after reaching a peak, the magnitude of these responses either decreased or reached a new stable state, providing important insights into how resource alterations could change the system functioning and its boundary conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000524138",,"0012-9615||1557-7015||1741-7015",,"10.1002/ecm.1507","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524138","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Ecosystem properties||Ecosystem resilience||functional traits||long-term irrigation||Scots pine","Lessons learned from a long‐term irrigation experiment in a dry Scots pine forest: Impacts on traits and functioning",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-01-10T08:26:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85124527330",,"000753807000001","Ecol. monogr.","2","Ecological Monographs","92","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using data from forests across the tropics, we quantify wood nutrient stocks at individual tree and ecosystem levels. At the ecosystem level, we show that tropical wood can store substantial amounts of rock-derived nutrients. Furthermore, on a tree level, tree species vary widely in woody nutrient concentrations. These observations raise important questions as to the biogeochemical or ecological drivers that lead to this variability, as well as the role that woody tissue plays in the buffering and cycling of nutrients. We offer some potential explanations and direction for future research to explore this under-appreciated but sizable store of inorganic nutrients in tropical biomass.",,,,"0006-3606||1744-7429",,"10.1111/btp.13069","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/536802","en","Wiley",,,"biogeochemistry||calcium||magnesium||nutrient budget||nutrients||phosphorus||potassium||wood","Tropical wood stores substantial amounts of nutrients, but we have limited understanding why",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-03-14T09:14:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85125373558",,"000762353400001",,"3","Biotropica","54","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These stressors are predicted to increase over the coming decades and will be exacerbated by co-stressors including harmful algal blooms, dam construction, hardening coastlines, phasing out coastal power plants, land clearing, and human food insecurity. The cumulative impacts on all sirenian habitats will be locally variable but changes in habitat extent and continuity are likely to be widespread. Important features of some key manatee habitats such as warm water refuges, freshwater sources, and navigable migration routes are expected to be reduced or lost. Foraging and movement behaviors of all species will change in response to alterations in community composition of feeding habitats, and the temporary loss of such habitats resulting from the increased intensity of extreme events, including the expansion of polar vortices, marine heatwaves, tropical cyclones, floods, droughts, and harmful algal blooms. These extreme events are expected to increase sirenian mortality and reduce fecundity, local population size , and genetic diversity.

New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone is a global biodiversity hotspot for cetaceans and benefits from a system of marine protected areas (MPAs). However, spatial patterns of cetacean biodiversity and their overlap with MPAs have never been assessed.  We quantify this overlap by using a comprehensive cetacean at-sea sightings database, high-resolution environmental data layers, and information on ecological and evolutionary characteristics of each species to model spatial patterns of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of cetaceans. We examine areas of congruence among hotspots of richness and uniqueness components of biodiversity and measure the contribution of species to biodiversity.  We find that cetacean taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity are spatially mismatched with MPAs, but this is less true for functional diversity. Hotspots of congruence among richness indices are located on the continental shelf break, whereas hotspots of uniqueness indices are located closer to shore on the continental shelf. Seven species have high contributions to biodiversity, with blue whale being the only species being evolutionarily distinct, functionally unique, specialised and globally endangered.  Our results underline the potential of multicomponent biodiversity indices, their spatial congruence, and the contribution of species to biodiversity to be used as guides for a strategic placement and expansion of MPAs to protect biodiversity.",,,,"0006-3207||1873-2917",,"10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109484","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/595041","en","Elsevier",,,"Biodiversity||Marine protected areas||Cetaceans||Functional diversity||Phylogenetic diversity||Conservation planning","Spatial mismatch in diversity facets reveals contrasting protection for New Zealand's cetacean biodiversity",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2023-01-26T12:11:50Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biol Conserv",,"Biological Conservation","267","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These climatic grids do not reflect conditions below vegetation canopies and near the ground surface, where critical ecosystem functions occur and most terrestrial species reside. Here, we provide global maps of soil temperature and bioclimatic variables at a 1-km² resolution for 0–5 and 5–15 cm soil depth. These maps were created by calculating the difference (i.e., offset) between in-situ soil temperature measurements, based on time series from over 1200 1-km² pixels (summarized from 8500 unique temperature sensors) across all the world’s major terrestrial biomes, and coarse-grained air temperature estimates from ERA5-Land (an atmospheric reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). We show that mean annual soil temperature differs markedly from the corresponding gridded air temperature, by up to 10°C (mean = 3.0 ± 2.1°C), with substantial variation across biomes and seasons. Over the year, soils in cold and/or dry biomes are substantially warmer (+3.6 ± 2.3°C) than gridded air temperature, whereas soils in warm and humid environments are on average slightly cooler (-0.7 ± 2.3°C). The observed substantial and biome-specific offsets emphasize that the projected impacts of climate and climate change on near-surface biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are inaccurately assessed when air rather than soil temperature is used, especially in cold environments. The global soil-related bioclimatic variables provided here are an important step forward for any application in ecology and related disciplines. Nevertheless, we highlight the need to fill remaining geographic gaps by collecting more in-situ measurements of microclimate conditions to further enhance the spatiotemporal resolution of global soil temperature products for ecological applications.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523670",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.16060","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523670","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Bioclimatic variables||global maps||microclimate||near-surface temperatures||soil temperature||soil-dwelling organisms||temperature offset||weather stations","Global maps of soil temperature",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-01-06T14:13:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Robust models for assessing the effectiveness of technologies and managements to reduce N2O emissions from grazed pastures (Models4Pastures)||ICOS-CH: Integrated Carbon Observation System in Switzerland||ICOS-CH Phase 2||Reconciling innovative farming practices and networks to enable sustainable development of smart Swiss farming systems||Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies","154245||148992||173691||172433||774124","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||EC","FACCE-JPI||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Forschungsinfrastrukturen||NFP 73: Gesuch||H2020",,,"85123931737",,"000753944300001","Glob.

Here, we use environmental DNA metabarcoding to reconstruct well-known patterns of fish biodiversity on coral reefs and uncover hidden patterns on these highly diverse and threatened ecosystems. We analysed 226 environmental DNA (eDNA) seawater samples from 100 stations in five tropical regions (Caribbean, Central and Southwest Pacific, Coral Triangle and Western Indian Ocean) and compared those to 2047 underwater visual censuses from the Reef Life Survey in 1224 stations. Environmental DNA reveals a higher (16%) fish biodiversity, with 2650 taxa, and 25% more families than underwater visual surveys. By identifying more pelagic, reef-associated and crypto-benthic species, eDNA offers a fresh view on assembly rules across spatial scales. Nevertheless, the reef life survey identified more species than eDNA in 47 shared families, which can be due to incomplete sequence assignment, possibly combined with incomplete detection in the environment, for some species. Combining eDNA metabarcoding and extensive visual census offers novel insights on the spatial organization of the richest marine ecosystems.",,,,"0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2022.0162","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/544937","en","Royal Society",,,,"Cross-ocean patterns and processes in fish biodiversity on coral reefs through the lens of eDNA metabarcoding",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-05-04T03:12:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85128795340",,"000791285600004","Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci",,"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","289","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, current IRF estimation methods typically require restrictive assumptions that are rarely met in practice, including that the underlying system is homogeneous, linear, and stationary, and that any noise is well behaved. Here, I present data-driven, model-independent, nonparametric IRF estimation methods that relax these assumptions, and thus expand the applicability of IRFs in real-world systems. These methods can accurately and efficiently deconvolve IRFs from signals that are substantially contaminated by autoregressive moving average (ARMA) noise or nonstationary ARIMA noise. They can also simultaneously deconvolve and demix the impulse responses of individual components of heterogeneous systems, based on their combined output (without needing to know the outputs of the individual components). This deconvolution-demixing approach can be extended to characterize nonstationary coupling between inputs and outputs, even if the system's impulse response changes so rapidly that different impulse responses overlap one another. These techniques can also be extended to estimate IRFs for nonlinear systems in which different input intensities yield impulse responses with different shapes and amplitudes, which are then overprinted on one another in the output. I further show how one can efficiently quantify multiscale impulse responses using piecewise linear IRFs defined at unevenly spaced lags. All of these methods are implemented in an R script that can efficiently estimate IRFs over hundreds of lags, from noisy time series of thousands or even millions of time steps.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000548713",,,,"10.3390/s22093291","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/548713","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","impulse response function||deconvolution||system identification||ARMA noise||nonlinear deconvolution||robust estimation||time series analysis","Impulse Response Functions for Nonlinear, Nonstationary, and Heterogeneous Systems, Estimated by Deconvolution and Demixing of Noisy Time Series",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-05-24T03:45:33Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85130133413",,"000794641600001",,"9","Sensors","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Mountain ecosystems are of paramount importance for studying phenological and growth responses of trees to the gradual variation of temperature. However, the relationship between growing season length and tree growth has been little studied at the level of individual trees. Here, we investigated the relationships between leaf phenology, growing degree-days and radial growth of sessile oaks growing in nine populations along an elevational gradient of 1500 m in the French Pyrenees. In each population, leaf unfolding in spring and leaf coloration in autumn were monitored between 2005 and 2015 on 25-30 trees having contrasting spring phenology (i.e. early vs. late flushing trees). These trees were cored in 2013 to analyse annual tree-ring widths. While trees displayed consistent phenological ranks for both leaf unfolding and leaf coloration within their population over the years, the growing period length decreased with increasing elevation, from about 210 days at the lowest elevation (131 m a.s.l.) to 140 days at the highest elevation (1630 m a.s.l.). For a given year, individual leaf coloration dates correlated positively with leaf unfolding dates at lower elevations, but negatively at higher elevations. Radial growth was positively correlated with growing degree-days at higher elevations, but negatively correlated at lower elevations, likely because higher temperatures are often associated with severe droughts in the lowlands of this region. No clear relationship was found between growing period length and radial growth of oaks within their population. This indicates that climatic conditions during the growing period have a more important impact on the secondary growth of sessile oaks than the growing period length. Our findings suggest that the lengthening of the growing period of trees in response to global warming does not necessarily lead to higher radial growth and productivity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000535921",,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.108885","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/535921","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Tree ring||Phenological rank||Growing period||Leaf unfolding||Leaf coloration||Elevational gradient","Temperature rather than individual growing period length determines radial growth of sessile oak in the Pyrenees",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-03-07T15:24:06Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85125695118",,"000821897300002","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","317","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Simultaneously, we are seeing a diversification of public expectations on the broader sustainable use of forest resources beyond timber production. As a result, the science and art of silviculture needs to adapt to these changing realities. In this piece, we argue that silviculturists are gradually shifting from the application of empirically derived silvicultural scenarios to new sets of approaches, methods and practices, a process that calls for broadening our conception of silviculture as a scientific discipline. We propose a holistic view of silviculture revolving around three key themes: observe, anticipate and adapt. In observe, we present how recent advances in remote sensing now enable silviculturists to observe forest structural, compositional and functional attributes in near-real-time, which in turn facilitates the deployment of efficient, targeted silvicultural measures in practice that are adapted to rapidly changing constraints. In anticipate, we highlight the importance of developing state-of-the-art models designed to take into account the effects of changing environmental conditions on forest growth and dynamics. In adapt, we discuss the need to provide spatially explicit guidance for the implementation of adaptive silvicultural actions that are efficient, cost-effective and socially acceptable. We conclude by presenting key steps towards the development of new tools and practical knowledge that will ensure meeting societal demands in rapidly changing environmental conditions. We classify these actions into three main categories: re-examining existing silvicultural trials to identify key stand attributes associated with the resistance and resilience of forests to multiple stressors, developing technological workflows and infrastructures to allow for continuous forest inventory updating frameworks, and implementing bold, innovative silvicultural trials in consultation with the relevant communities where a range of adaptive silvicultural strategies are tested. In this holistic perspective, silviculture can be defined as the science of observing forest condition and anticipating its development to apply tending and regeneration treatments adapted to a multiplicity of desired outcomes in rapidly changing realities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515804",,,,"10.1093/forestry/cpab047","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515804","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The changing culture of silviculture",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-11-18T10:05:46Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85127113531",,"000776706600001",,"2","Forestry: An International Journal of Forest Research","95","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In these forests, natural regeneration of shade-tolerant species is at an advantage over shade-intolerant species. This is particularly pronounced in continuous-cover stands dominated by European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), which develops its crown laterally as a reaction to release events. The conditions necessary to sustain a mixture with less shade-tolerant species, e.g. sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), have been little studied. Therefore, we explored growth patterns and stand structures in mixed deciduous forests with light availability quantified using vegetation height models. Harvesting and growth patterns were derived from inventory data of beech-dominated selection forests in Thuringia, Germany and long-term forest monitoring plot data from four stands in Switzerland. Based on these data, models of stem number distributions confirmed that stand basal area in deciduous forests dominated by beech should not exceed 21–25 m2 ha−1 to maintain a sustainable structure. In these forests, a total of ~90–120 stems per ha are needed in the ingrowth DBH class (DBH 8–11.9 cm) to ensure demographic sustainability. At canopy light transmittance <10 per cent, total stem number required in the thicket stage (DBH < 8 cm) is 800–1700 ha−1. Under such shady conditions, only a small proportion of sycamore was observed (<25 per cent) in the thicket stage, as the species is likely to require canopy gaps >400 m2 (gap diameter > 22.5 m) to recruit successfully. Selection silviculture with shade-intolerant species therefore requires much lower stocking volume and larger canopy openings created by group selection cutting than what is routinely applied in practical forest management using single-tree selection principles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505912",,"0015-752X||1464-3626",,"10.1093/forestry/cpab041","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505912","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Sustainable regeneration in uneven-aged mixed deciduous forests managed by selection silviculture: the role of demographic structure",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-09-17T13:04:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85127189382",,"000776706600004","Forestry","2","Forestry","95","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Drought deteriorates the health, structure, and functioning of forests, which can lead to reduced diversity, decreased productivity, and increased tree mortality. Therefore, it is an urgent need to assess the impact of drought on tree species. Due to differences in tree physiology, saplings and mature trees are likely to respond specifically to drought conditions. In contrast to mature trees, little is known about the response of saplings to drought. Here, we combine in-situ field measurements for saplings of deciduous tree species with remote sensing for forest canopy to assess drought damage, recovery, and sapling mortality patterns during a centennial drought (2018, 2019) and beyond (2020). We measured 2051 saplings out of 214 plots in Central Germany. Forest canopy health was assessed using 10 × 10 m resolution satellite observations for the same locations. We (1) demonstrate that forest canopy exhibits long-lasting drought-induced effects, (2) show that saplings have a remarkable capacity to recover from drought and survive a subsequent drought, (3) demonstrate that reduced sapling recovery leads to their mortality, (4) reveal that drought damage on saplings increases from pioneer to non-pioneer species, and mortality is ranking from Sorbus aucuparia > Sambucus nigra > Fraxinus excelsior, Acer campestre, Frangula alnus > Ulmus glabra > Carpinus betulus > Betula pendula, Fagus sylvatica > Acer pseudoplatanus > Quercus petraea > Corylus avellana, Crataegus spp., > Prunus avium, Quercus robur; and (5) link drought response to site conditions, indicating that species diversity and winter precipitation as relevant indicators of tree health. If periods of drought become more frequent, as expected, this could negatively impact mid-term forest recovery, alter long-term tree species assemblages and reduce biodiversity and functional resilience of forest ecosystems. We suggest that models of forest response to drought should differentiate between the forest canopy and understory and also consider species-specific responses as we found a broad spectrum of responses within the same plant functional type of deciduous tree species in terms of drought damage and recovery.",,,,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120075","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/533359","en","Elsevier",,,"2018 and 2019 droughts||Temperate forests||Climate change||Climate change||Forest health||Tree recovery||Sapling mortality","Drought impacts in forest canopy and deciduous tree saplings in Central European forests",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-02-19T05:52:26Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85124411652",,"000820847900003","For.

While various deforestation-free strategies have been proposed to enhance OP sustainability, field-based evidence still need to be consolidated, in particular with respect to savanna regions where OP expansion has recently occurred and that present large area with potential for OP cultivation. Here we show that the common management practice creating within the plantation the so-called management zones explained nearly five times more variability of soil biogeochemical properties than the savanna land-use change per se. We also found that clayey-soil savanna conversion into OP increased total ecosystem C stocks by 40 ± 13 Mg C ha(−1) during a full OP cultivation cycle, which was due to the higher OP-derived C accumulated in the biomass and in the soil as compared to the loss of savanna-derived C. In addition, application of organic residues in specific management zones enhanced the accumulation of soil organic carbon by up to 1.9 Mg ha(−1) year(−1) over the full cycle. Within plantation, zones subjected to organic amendments sustained similar soil microbial activity as in neighboring savannas. Our findings represent an empirical proof-of-concept that the conversion of non-forested land in parallel with organic matter-oriented management strategies can enhance OP agroecosystems C sink capacity while promoting microbe-mediated soil functioning. Nonetheless, savannas are unique and threatened ecosystems that support a vast biodiversity. Therefore, we suggest to give priority attention to conservation of natural savannas and direct more research toward the impacts of the conversion and subsequent management of degraded savannas.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000530414",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.16069","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/530414","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","biomass||C sequestration||degraded savannas||ecosystem C stocks||savanna||soil fertility||soil organic carbon||δ13C","Deforestation-free land-use change and organic matter-centered management improve the C footprint of oil palm expansion",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-02-02T04:04:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Oil Palm Adaptive Landscapes (OPAL)","152019","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","r4d - Ecosystems: Gesuch",,,"85123163843",,"000744958900001","Glob.

Estimates of C age can provide useful information about the timescales on which C will respond to such changes. It is generally accepted that the interaction of climate and soil mineralogy have a strong influence on C age. However, our current understanding is primarily based on findings from temperate regions and from small-scale studies. Large knowledge gaps persist in (sub-)tropical regions where soil processes are often understudied.  Here, we use a systematic continental-scale approach to better understand the processes controlling C age on a larger scale in these understudied soils. In total, 510 samples were analyzed for radiocarbon (Δ14C), consisting of topsoils (0–20 cm) and subsoils (20–50 cm) collected from 30 sites across 14 countries. The sampled soils are part of a comprehensive soil survey (AfSIS) for sub-Saharan Africa, for which soil mineralogy (based on X-ray powder diffraction) and soil chemistry were determined.  Soils with the youngest C ages are generally highly weathered, and are characterized by humid climates, high gross primary productivity (GPP), and a dominance of 1:1 clay minerals. In contrast, older C ages are either found in arid regions characterized by low C inputs and low mineral stabilization, or in seasonal climates, where GPP is high but a portion of the C is stabilized by 2:1 clay minerals and poorly crystalline minerals. Cultivation and erosion appear to play a secondary role at this large scale, but widen the range of C ages.  Our data suggest that soils from seasonal climate zones have the most favorable climatic and pedogenic conditions to stabilize and store C. Yet, they are also the most vulnerable climate zones according to future projections for sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding how the stabilizing minerals will react to climate change is key to understanding short and long-term changes in C storage and stabilization.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542890",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-13380","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542890","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Soils with seasonal climates have highest potential to stabilize carbon by minerals in sub-Saharan Africa",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2022-04-20T09:06:34Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23-27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,"110525827",,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To address this matter, we assessed the influence of soil geochemistry on bulk SOM composition along a soil chronosequence in California, USA, spanning 3 million years. This was done by combining data on soil mineralogy and texture from previous studies with additional measurements on total carbon (C), stable isotope values (δ13C and δ15N), and spectral information derived from diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). To assess qualitative shifts in bulk SOM, we analysed the peak areas of simple plant-derived (S-POM), complex plant-derived (C-POM), and predominantly microbial-derived organic matter (OM; MOM) and their changes in abundance across soils with several millennia to millions of years of weathering and soil development. We observed that SOM became increasingly stabilized and microbial-derived (lower Cg:gN ratio, increasing δ13C and δ15N) as soil weathering progressed. Peak areas of S-POM (i.e. aliphatic root exudates) did not change over time, while peak areas of C-POM (lignin) and MOM (components of microbial cell walls (amides, quinones, and ketones)) increased over time and depth and were closely related to clay content and pedogenic iron oxides. Hence, our study suggests that with progressing soil development, SOM composition co-varied with changes in the mineral matrix. Our study indicates that structurally more complex OM compounds (C-POM, MOM) play an increasingly important role in soil carbon stabilization mechanisms as the mineral soil matrix becomes increasingly weathered.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542332",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-19-1675-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542332","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Soil geochemistry as a driver of soil organic matter composition: Insights from a soil chronosequence",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-04-14T02:54:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85127401195",,"000774580200001",,"6","Biogeosciences","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Global biodiversity studies indicate that mountain biodiversity is only partially controlled by global climate drivers and is primarily the result of topographic relief, which amplifies habitat complexity by generating temperature and precipitation gradients. However, climate and relief alone do not fully explain observed patterns of species richness in mountainous regions.  Here, we investigate the plant diversity of the Hengduan Mountains of southwest China, the main biodiversity hotspot outside the tropics, to demonstrate that the generation of this hotspot goes beyond habitat complexity. We mapped species richness patterns for seed plants across the entire Hengduan region and compared them to geomorphic characteristics of the landscape calculated using standard methods of digital topographic (DEM) analysis, including elevation and local relief (5 km radius). As we hypothesized, there is a strong, positive correlation between local relief and species richness generally. We also find large spatial anomalies among different families that may be fingerprints of older geologic processes. We hypothesize that other drivers, such as glacier extent, tectonic faults, and river capture, may explain regions of exceptionally high (resp. low) species richness.  To understand which geological events drove seed plant diversification in the Hengduan Mountains, we developed a generalized linear correlation model to determine the component of species richness explained by climate variables. We removed the component of species richness corresponding to contemporary climate and mapped the residuals to determine where climate underpredicts species richness. We correlated this spatial relationship to known geologic events, based on published thermochronological studies, fault displacement history, and glaciations. In particular, this allows the differentiation between diversification in response to late Quaternary climate change and older, tectono-geomorphic events. We examine patterns across different plant families (from lowland to alpine species) and observe similar adaptive patterns in response to landscape transience.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000592752",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-7204","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/592752","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Influence of landscape transience on plant biodiversity patterns in the Hengduan Mountains, China",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2023-01-16T14:56:25Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23-27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,"110610706",,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02330 - Dep.

This complex dynamical behavior highly influences macroscopic properties such as the effective permeability and it also creates characteristic fluctuations in the velocity fields of the two phases, as well as in their relative permeability curves. In order to better understand how the microscopic behavior of the flow affects macroscopic properties of two phases, we simulate the velocity fields of two immiscible fluids flowing through a two-dimensional porous medium. By analyzing the fluctuations in the velocity fields of the two phases, we find that the system is ergodic for large volume fractions of the less viscous phase and high capillary numbers Ca. We also see that the distribution of drop sizes m follows a power-law scaling, (Formula presented.). The exponent ξ depends on the capillary number. Below a characteristic capillary number, namely Ca* ≈ 0.046, the drops are large and cohesive with a constant scaling exponent ξ ≈ 1.23 ± 0.03. Above the characteristic capillary number Ca*, the flow is dominated by many small droplets and few finger-like spanning clusters. In this regime the exponent ξ increases approaching 2.05 ± 0.03 in the limit of infinite capillary number. Our analysis also shows that the temporal mean velocity of the entire mixture can be described by a generalization of Darcy’s law of the form (Formula presented.) where the exponent β is sensitive to the surface tension between the two phases. In the limit of infinite capillary numbers the mobility term increases exponentially with the saturation of the less viscous phase. This result agrees with previous observations for effective permeabilities found in dissolved-gas-driven reservoirs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542588",,"2296-424X",,"10.3389/fphy.2022.860190","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542588","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","porous media||two phase flow||Onsager symmetry||computational fluid dynamics||generalized Darcy’s law","Bubble Dynamics in Stationary Two-phase Flow Through Disordered Porous Media",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-04-19T03:01:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85127943097",,"000788270000001",,,"Frontiers in Physics","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This uncertainty may obstruct devoting land, time and resources in promoting this restoration approach. Process-based models allow to simulate forest regrowth under different scenarios and may thus support decision making to manage areas in ways that maximize forest restoration based on natural forest regrowth. In the present study, we used the process-based model LandClim to assess the following questions:1) How does land use intensity affect forest growth, aboveground biomass (AGB) and tree species diversity in agricultural landscapes in the long term? 2) How do different land use configurations affect the structure and expansion of second-growth forests? We based our study on six 4 × 4 km agricultural landscapes, dominated by pastures and sugarcane, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest region. We parameterized and validated LandClim for the study region by comparing model outputs with published estimates and information from field data collected across the six landscapes. We then simulated natural forest regrowth under different land use intensities in the six landscapes and analyzed how land use intensity and landscape configuration affect AGB, tree species diversity and the spatial dynamics of second-growth forests. Our results showed negative effects of increased land use intensity on landscape biomass accumulation due to limited forest cover expansion. Landscapes dominated by sugarcane had lower forest regrowth potential than pasture-dominated landscapes due to lower likelihood of abandonment, and limited rates of seed availability and seedling growth. Land use intensity and landscape configuration were also important factors for tree diversity changes. However, temporal patterns differed, and while AGB reached a plateau after 100–150 years, tree diversity peaked between 30 and 70 years. Thus, the effects of land use intensity and landscape configuration on forest AGB and tree diversity take decades to be fully expressed, highlighting the importance of a long-term commitment in restoration projects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529369",,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120012","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529369","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Dynamic model||Natural regeneration||Forest dynamics||Second-growth forests||Tropical forests||Forest and landscape restoration||Forest restoration||Forest regeneration||Forest management||Aboveground biomass||Tree diversity","Natural forest regrowth under different land use intensities and landscape configurations in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-01-28T04:10:50Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Advanced Tree MOrtality MOdeling (ATMO^2)","163250","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85123185004",,"000784301100008","For.

Urban areas are rapidly expanding worldwide, representing a major threat for biodiversity. Nonetheless, cities are increasingly recognised as ecosystems on their own, harbouring often a considerably high biodiversity, being a major force of eco-evolutionary change, and in turn, providing a wide array of ecosystem functions and contributions to people. Despite an already long history of research, there are still important questions that remain elusive in urban ecology particularly concerning the effects of socio-ecological drivers on urban biodiversity patterns and ecological processes, for example diet preferences, species distributions and interspecific competition. Furthermore, although invertebrate species represent the majority of taxa inhabiting cities, they have been much less investigated than plants and birds, and thus, the diversities patterns for many groups in urban ecosystems are poorly understood. This thesis aimed at exploring the influence of different socio-ecological drivers on different aspects of urban biodiversity (e.g. diversity patterns, species distribution, trait variation, and trophic and competitive interactions) across spatial scales and ecological levels of organisation. To do so, different methodological tools, including macroecological analyses, next-generation sequencing techniques and individual trait-based approaches, have been used to better elucidate the effects of urban socio-ecological drivers on ecological processes and urban biodiversity patterns. Each of the three chapters of this thesis is set at a different spatial scale and ecological level of organisation. Chapter I is part of the European project BioVEINS, and includes 80 study sites in five European cities (i.e. Antwerp, Belgium; Paris, France; Poznan, Poland; Tartu, Estonia; Zurich, Switzerland) distributed following gradients of urban intensity and available habitat, where solitary wild bees and their larval pollen were sampled. Chapter II is part of the project ZuriDiverCity and represents a compilation of four urban ecology studies conducted in the city of Zurich, with 252 study sites representing the most common types of urban greens areas (e.g. parks, brownfields, green roofs, gardens) distributed along multiple urban intensity gradients and data of 1446 animal species from 12 animal groups. Finally, Chapter III is part of the project City4Bees and includes data on managed and wild bees in 23 domestic gardens varying in local habitat features and in the position within the urban intensity gradient in the city of Zurich. Chapter I studies the larval diet preferences of four widespread solitary bee species (i.e. Chelostoma florisomne, Osmia bicornis, Osmia cornuta and Hylaeus communis) using pollen metabarcoding, and, in addition, investigates how larval feeding specialisation affects the distribution of the four wild bee species within urban intensity gradients. It shows that there are different feeding specialisation strategies that can be successful in urban ecosystems allowing bees to exploit a variable part of the urban floral resources. These feeding specialisation strategies are not limited to broad generalism, but also included intermediate levels of generalism, with a certain degree of diet conservatism at the plant family or genus level (in O. bicornis and O. cornuta), and strict specialisation to a single plant genus with few species but widely common in urban habitats (in C. florisomne). However, at the same time, larval feeding specialisation influences the occupation of habitat patches and distribution within urban intensity gradients, and broader diets result in less sensitivity to urban intensity. Broad generalist H. communis was the least sensitive bee to urban intensity. Interestingly, the analyses of its larval diet reveals plant host shifts from a more herbaceous-based diet to a more tree-based diet triggered by losses in the amount of available herbaceous habitat, showing the important role of street trees in providing alternative resources for some wild bee species. Therefore, identifying larval floral preferences could be helpful for identifying key plant taxa and traits for bee survival and for improving strategies to develop bee-friendly cities. Chapter II investigates the ecological properties of urban biodiversity in the city of Zurich using machine learning predictive models and occurrence and abundance data from 1446 species belonging to 12 different animal groups. The occurrence and abundance distribution patterns of the taxonomic groups resemebled those from non-urban ecosystems. Specifically, urban diversity is composed by a very reduced group of hyperdominant and hyperwidespread species in the city while the vast majority of species are scarce and locally- occurring. Furthermore, the application of predictive models revealed that only species with intermediate abundances and occurrences were spatially structured along urban gradients, with decreasing numbers with increasing urban intensity. Strikingly, rare species were less sensitive to urban gradients and their numbers kept constant even in the most utbanised areas of the city. Overall, urban green areas with lower management regimes tended to contain higher species richness of most of the studied groups. The use of predictive models in urban ecosystems, specifically when producing continuous citywide biodiversity maps, is a promising tool to address both ecological questions and inform urban planning and management. Chapter III examines the interplay of resource availability and beekeeping intensity at local and landscape scales in shaping the diversity of urban wild bees in urban gardens in the city of Zurich. By collecting six functional traits and incorporating individual trait variability, the feeding niche partitioning between the wild bee community and the honeybee population was calculated at each site. Lower resource availability at the local scale negatively affected wild bee species richness, whereas lower resource availability at the landscape scale increased honeybee densities at the study sites. In turn, feeding niche partitioning decreased in sites with lower resource availability at the landscape scale (and thus, with larger honeybee densities) and decreased as well with lower resource availability at the local scale, due to a reduction in the number of wild bee species, in particular those that where more functionally similar to honeybees. Conversely, beekeeping intensity at local and landscape scales did not have a direct effect neither on feeding niche partitioning nor on wild bee species richness. Hence, monitoring and management of resource availability is critical to support wild bee diversity and manage urban beekeeping. This thesis provides novel insights on the effects of socio-ecological drivers on selected biodiversity patterns and ecological processes at different scales and ecological level of organisation, through the application of new methodological tools. The application of new analytical tools, such macroecological models or next-generation sequencing technique can pose a great opportunity to revist classical urban ecology questions but with novel lenses. Furthermore, the different results compiled provide a basis to ecologically inform management and planning of urban habitats, specifically to minimize the effects of anthropogenic activities and secure the natural capital of urban ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000549216",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/549216","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Urban ecology||Biodiversity||Predictive modeling||Biotic interaction||Competition||Biodiversity conservation||Urban planning||Landscape ecology||urban macroecology","LOOKING AT CITIES THROUGH NOVEL LENSES",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2022-05-27T07:08:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28199",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The main objective is to propose a hydraulic framework to investigate the interplay between soil and root hydraulic properties on water uptake. We collected highly resolved data on transpiration, leaf and soil water potential across 11 crops and 10 contrasting soil textures. In drying soils, the drop in water potential at the soil-root interface resulted in a rapid decrease in soil hydraulic conductance, especially at higher transpiration rates. The analysis reveals that water uptake was limited by soil within a wide range of soil water potential (-6 to -1000 kPa), depending on both soil textures and root hydraulic phenotypes. We propose that a root phenotype with low root hydraulic conductance, long roots and/or long and dense root hairs postpones soil limitation in drying soils. The consequence of these root phenotypes on crop water use is discussed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000530917",,"0140-7791||1365-3040",,"10.1111/pce.14259","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/530917","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","drought||leaf water potential||root hairs||root hydraulic conductance||root length||root water uptake||soil hydraulic conductivity||soil texture","Root hydraulic phenotypes impacting water uptake in drying soils",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2022-02-05T14:06:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85123769428",,"000747676400001","Plant cell environ.","3","Plant, Cell & Environment","45","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we present an approach of combining Sentinel-2 data, high-resolution aerial images, and machine learning (ML) algorithms to model FCC in the Hyrcanian mixed temperate forest, Northern Iran. Sentinel-2 multispectral bands and vegetation indices were used as variables for modeling and mapping FCC based on UAV ground truth to a wider spatial extent. Random forest (RF), support-vector machine (SVM), elastic net (ENET), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were the ML algorithms used to learn and generalize on the remotely sensed variables. Evaluation of variable importance indicated that vegetation indices including NDVI, NDVI-A, NDRE, and NDI45 were the dominant predictors in most of the models. Model accuracy estimation results showed that among the tested models, RF (R2 = 0.67, RMSE = 18.87%, MAE = 15.35%) and ENET (R2 = 0.63, RMSE = 20.04%, MAE = 16.44%) showed the best and the worst performance, respectively.

However, it remains unclear whether mutualistic interactions in particular can drive trait patterns at the global scale, where climatic constraints and biogeographic processes gain importance. Here we evaluate global relationships between traits of frugivorous birds and palms (Arecaceae), and how these relationships are affected, directly or indirectly, by assemblage richness, climate and biogeographic history. We leverage a new and expanded gape size dataset for nearly all avian frugivores, and find a positive relationship between gape size and fruit size, that is, trait matching, which is influenced indirectly by palm richness and climate. We also uncover a latitudinal gradient in trait matching strength, which increases towards the tropics and varies among zoogeographic realms. Taken together, our results suggest trophic interactions have consistent influences on trait structure, but that abiotic, biogeographic and richness effects also play important, though sometimes indirect, roles in shaping the functional biogeography of mutualisms.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000534838",,"1461-023X||1461-0248",,"10.1111/ele.13890","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/534838","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Global plant-frugivore trait matching is shaped by climate and biogeographic history",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-03-02T04:34:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85125147662",,"000760331500012","Ecol. lett.","3","Ecology Letters","25","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Idiosyncratic biotic and geographic conditions appear to have driven diversification and morphological evolution in three endemic Indo-Australasian radiations.

The project results will lay the foundation for developing appropriate adaption to the current forest management concepts in Avers. The aim of this thesis is to analyze forest (i) stand and (ii) growth dynamics in Avers. (iii) Climatic and (iv) non-climatic, site-specific factors influencing tree growth are also analyzed. The results are discussed in relation to the region’s past land-use history.  Methods: Features and increment cores of 892 trees along seven altitudinal gradients were collected, their ring widths measured and crossdated. Several tree-ring chronologies were established using regional curve standardization (RCS) and spline detrending methods. 30-year splines with a 50% frequency cutoff were used for moving-correlation analysis between the annual summer temperature and radial growth since 1930. Linear mixed effects (LME) models were calculated to assess non-climatic and site-specific effects on tree growth.  Results: (i) Apart from the stand of Croeterwald, the age distribution shows widespread establishment of larch (Larix decidua) and stone-pine (Pinus cembra) during the 20th century. (ii) Old-growth (monumental) trees of different stands, elevation and species show similar growth trends during the past 500 years. Since the 1980s, low-elevation stone-pine show a decreasing growth trend, while both high- and low-elevation larch show a pronounced growth increase. (iii) A singularly important factor influencing tree growth are summer temperatures. The sensitivity of trees towards the latter has been undergoing an upward-shift on the altitudinal gradient since the 1980s. (iv) LME models highlighted the pioneer character of larch, as well as the importance of low crown coverage for the establishment of regeneration.  Conclusion: Complete or near abandonment of forest pasture in Capetta- and Hohenhauswald has led to a widespread establishment of trees during the 20th century. Ongoing climate change is leading to an upward shift in temperature sensitivity of both larch and stone-pine along the altitudinal gradient. This particularly impedes the growth of low-elevation stone-pine. Three measures should be applied to increase tree and stand resilience: (1) Tree density should be reduced around monumental trees to avoid increased competition for light, water and nutrients. (2) Thinning interventions in Hohenhauswald will allow recently established trees to serve as stabilizing elements. (3) Between the monumental trees in Croeter- and Hohenhauswald, new regeneration should be initiated and favored. Keeping open but sustainable structures allows grass species to develop, which is important for pasturing and biodiversity. Further, it maintains the forests’ touristic and cultural historic value and safeguards their uniqueness for future generations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000580894",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580894","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"500 years of forest growth dynamics in the high mountain valley of Avers, Switzerland",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,"2022-11-15T16:22:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this paper, we propose a simple method to apply such methods in close range photogrammetry by benefitting from deep learning-based semantic segmentation. Specifically, AI was used to detect unwanted objects in a scene involving the 3D reconstruction of a historical building façade. For these purposes, classes e.g., sky, trees, and electricity poles were considered as noise. Masks were then created from the results which would then constraint the dense image matching process to only the wanted classes. In this regard, the resulting dense point cloud essentially projected the 2D semantic labels into the 3D space, thus excluding noise and unwanted object classes from the 3D scene. Our results were compared to manual image masking and managed to achieve comparable results while requiring only a fraction of the processing time when using a pre-trained DL network to do the task.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000538289",,"1682-1750||2194-9034||1682-1777",,"10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVI-2-W1-2022-389-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/538289","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Photogrammetry||AI||Semantic segmentation||Image masks||Automation||Point cloud cleaning||3D reconstruction","Automatic point cloud noise masking in close range photogrammetry for buildings using ai-based semantic labelling",,"Conference Paper","Open access",,,"2022-03-22T05:02:15Z",,,,"yes","9th International Workshop 3D-ARCH ""3D Virtual Reconstruction and Visualization of Complex Architectures""","March 2-4, 2022","Mantova, Italy",,,,,,,,"85126395393",,,"Int.

The current generation of surveying tools allows the quick collection of large and detailed amount of data: such data ensure accurate spatial representations of the buildings, but their employment in the creation of informative semantic 3D models is still a challenging task, and it currently still requires manual time-consuming intervention by expert operators. Hence, increasing the level of automation, for instance developing an automatic semantic segmentation procedure enabling machine scene understanding and comprehension, can represent a dramatic improvement in the overall processing procedure. In accordance with this observation, this paper aims at presenting a new workflow for the automatic semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds based on a multi-view approach. Two steps compose this workflow: first, neural network-based semantic segmentation is performed on building images. Then, image labelling is back-projected, through the use of masked images, on the 3D space by exploiting photogrammetry and dense image matching principles. The obtained results are quite promising, with a good performance in the image segmentation, and a remarkable potential in the 3D reconstruction procedure.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000538290",,"1682-1750||2194-9034||1682-1777",,"10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVI-2-W1-2022-429-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/538290","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","3D point cloud||Deep learning||Semantic segmentation||Cultural heritage","An Image-Based Deep Learning Workflow for 3D Heritage Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation",,"Conference Paper","Open access",,,"2022-03-22T05:02:15Z",,,,"yes","9th International Workshop 3D-ARCH ""3D Virtual Reconstruction and Visualization of Complex Architectures""","March 2-4, 2022","Mantova, Italy",,,,,,,,"85126393204",,,"Int.

It contains measurements recorded from 202 crop studies, covering 3,394 field observations, 2,552 yield measurements (i.e., berry mass, number of fruits, and fruit density [kg/ha], among others), and 47,752 insect records from 48 commercial crops distributed around the globe. CropPol comprises 32 of the 87 leading global crops and commodities that are pollinator dependent. Malus domestica is the most represented crop (32 studies), followed by Brassica napus (22 studies), Vaccinium corymbosum (13 studies), and Citrullus lanatus (12 studies). The most abundant pollinator guilds recorded are honey bees (34.22% counts), bumblebees (19.19%), flies other than Syrphidae and Bombyliidae (13.18%), other wild bees (13.13%), beetles (10.97%), Syrphidae (4.87%), and Bombyliidae (0.05%). Locations comprise 34 countries distributed among Europe (76 studies), North America (60), Latin America and the Caribbean (29), Asia (20), Oceania (10), and Africa (7). Sampling spans three decades and is concentrated on 2001-2005 (21 studies), 2006-2010 (40), 2011-2015 (88), and 2016-2020 (50). This is the most comprehensive open global data set on measurements of crop flower visitors, crop pollinators and pollination to date, and we encourage researchers to add more datasets to this database in the future. This data set is released for non-commercial use only.

It will shift ecosystem boundaries, potentially affecting vulnerable ecosystems, such as tropical Africa's high mountain ecosystems, i.e., afroalpine ecosystems, and their highly susceptible uniquely adapted species. However, ecosystems along these mountains are not expected to respond similarly to the change. The ericaceous woody vegetation, located between the low-elevation broadleaf forests and high-elevation afroalpine vegetation, are anticipated to be affected differently. We hypothesize that projected climate change will result in an upward expansion and increasing dominance of ericaceous vegetation, which will negatively impact the endemic rich afroalpine ecosystems of the extensive Sanetti plateau. Hence, we modeled the impact of future climate change on the distribution of ericaceous vegetation and discussed its effect on bordering ecosystems in the Bale Mountains. We applied four familiar correlative modeling approaches: bioclim, domain, generalized linear methods, and support vector machines. We used WorldClim's bioclimatic variables as environmental predictors and two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report climate change scenarios, namely RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for future climate projection. The results indicate increased ericaceous vegetation cover on the midaltitude of northwestern and northern parts of the massif, and the Sanetti plateau. We observed upward range expansion and increase of close ericaceous vegetation in midaltitudes, while receding from the lower range across the massif. Moreover, the current ericaceous vegetation range correlates to the temperature and precipitation trends, reaffirming the critical role of temperature and precipitation in determining species distributions along elevational gradients. The results indicate the high likelihood of considerable changes in this biodiversity hotspot in Eastern Africa.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000531722",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-022-05846-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/531722","en","Macmillan Publishers","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ericaceous vegetation of the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia will prevail in the face of climate change",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-02-10T04:24:59Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85123973789",,"000752017100006","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Soil infiltration capacity determines the partitioning of precipitation into infiltration and overland flow and is therefore an important soil hydrological characteristic. Water infiltration through soil is facilitated by macropores created by roots and soil macrofauna. In clay-rich soils, such as those of the tropical forests of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, most infiltration occurs via these preferential flow pathways.  2. We evaluated the effects of dung beetle tunnelling on infiltration and macropore creation (depth and width of the flow pathways) in tropical forest soils in Sabah. Using mesocosms, we applied three treatments (i) soil-only, (ii) dung-only, (iii) dung + dung beetles, and measured saturated hydraulic conductivity (i.e., the steady-state infiltration rate) after 0, 5 and 10 days, and assessed depth and width of infiltration pathways by applying a blue dye tracer.  3. The steady-state infiltration rate increased in the presence of dung beetles, though differences among treatments were only statistically significant after 10 days. After 5 days of dung beetle presence, infiltrated water had reached a greater depth than the control mesocosms without beetles. However, there were no differences in the width of infiltration pathways among treatments.  4. These results reveal the important, but under studied roles of dung beetles on soil hydrological functioning, that may have consequences for nutrient cycling and plant productivity. Further, our findings indicate that the novel application of an established hydrological method—blue dye tracer—can provide interesting and reliable results for macrofauna–soil interaction studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000509882",,"0307-6946||1365-2311",,"10.1111/een.13094","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/509882","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Ecosystem engineers||infiltration capacity||macropore flow||Malaysian Borneo||tropical forest soils","Dung beetles as hydrological engineers: effects of tunnelling on soil infiltration",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-10-15T02:56:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85116413024",,"000704298000001","Ecol. entomol.","1","Ecological entomology","47","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While radial stem growth has been widely used to explain mortality in juvenile trees, the leaf area ratio (LAR), known to be a key component of shade tolerance, has been neglected so far. We assessed the effects of LAR, radial stem growth and tree height on survival time and the age-specific mortality rate of juvenile Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech), Acer pseudoplatanus L. (sycamore maple) and Acer platanoides L. (Norway maple) in a primeval beech forest (Ukraine). Aboveground and belowground biomass and radial stem growth were analysed for 289 living and 179 dead seedlings and saplings. Compared with the other species, F. sylvatica featured higher LAR, slower growth and a lower mortality rate. The average survival time of F. sylvatica juveniles (72 years) allows it to reach the canopy more often than its competitors in forests with low canopy turnover rate. In contrast, a combination of lower LAR, higher growth rate and higher age-specific mortality rate of the two Acer species resulted in their shorter survival times and thus render their presence in the canopy a rare event. Overall, this study suggests that shade tolerance, commonly defined as a relationship between sapling mortality and growth, can alternatively be formulated as a relationship between survival time and the interplay of growth and LAR.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516192",,"1612-4677||1612-4669",,"10.1007/s10342-021-01427-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516192","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Acer||Dominance||Fagus||LAR||Mortality rate||Regeneration||Shade tolerance||Survival time","Survival time and mortality rate of regeneration in the deep shade of a primeval beech forest",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2021-11-20T03:49:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85118683329",,"000714861500002","Eur J Forest Res","1","European Journal of Forest Research","141","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we follow up on the hypothesis that long-term orientation increases environmental policy performance. To this end, we use three time preference indices (including a newly constructed index with a wide spatial coverage based on Google search data). Our results show that countries with higher long-term orientation have higher environmental policy performance. This relationship is in most cases because of the positive association of long-term orientation and environmental policy performance with economic development and other factors. Only the analysis with increased spatial coverage (especially to African and Asian countries) using Google long-term orientation shows some results indicating positive relationships when considering economic development and other factors. Still, also in this analysis, the positive relationships are largely because of economic development and other factors. Expanding the spatial coverage when measuring time preference might add insights into the time preference-environmental policy performance relationship. Moreover, the results show that researchers need to control for important factors, especially economic development, when analyzing time preference and environmental policy performance or related questions, such as environmental behavior and culture, as these factors can completely, or at least largely, drive the results.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000517420",,"1462-9011||1873-6416","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517420||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518964","10.1016/j.envsci.2021.11.017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526720","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Environmental policy||Time preference||Economic preferences||Digital trace data||Climate change||Biodiversity||Public policy","Global relationships between time preference and environmental policy performance",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-11-29T07:40:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85119916526",,"000820089800001","Environ.

Urban ecosystems can sustain populations of wild bees, partly because of their rich native and exotic floral resources. A better understanding of the urban bee diet, particularly at the larval stage, is necessary to understand biotic interactions and feeding behaviour in urban ecosystems, and to promote bees by improving the management of urban floral resources.  2. We investigated the larval diet and distribution patterns of four solitary wild bee species with different diet specialization (i.e. Chelostoma florisomne, Osmia bicornis, Osmia cornuta and Hylaeus communis) along urban intensity gradients in five European cities (Antwerp, Paris, Poznan, Tartu and Zurich) using two complementary analyses. Specifically, using trap-nests and pollen metabarcoding techniques, we characterized the species' larval diet, assessed diet consistency across cities and modelled the distribution of wild bees using species distribution models (SDMs).  3. Our results demonstrate that urban wild bees display different successful strategies to exploit existing urban floral resources: not only broad generalism (i.e. H. communis) but also intermediate generalism, with some degree of diet conservatism at the plant family or genus level (i.e. O. cornuta and O. bicornis), or even strict specialization on widely available urban pollen hosts (i.e. C. florisomne). Furthermore, we detected important diet variation in H. communis, with a switch from an herbaceous pollen diet to a tree pollen diet with increasing urban intensity.  4. Species distribution modelling indicated that wild bee distribution ranges inside urban ecosystems ultimately depend on their degree of specialization, and that broader diets result in less sensitivity to urban intensity.  5. Policy implications. Satisfying larval dietary requirements is critical to preserving and enhancing wild bee distributions within urban gradients. For high to intermediate levels of feeding specialization, we found considerable consistency in the preferred plant families or genera across the studied cities, which could be generalized to other cities where these bees occur. Identifying larval floral preferences (e.g. using pollen metabarcoding) could be helpful for identifying key plant taxa and traits for bee survival and for improving strategies to develop bee-friendly cities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519198",,"0021-8901||1365-2664",,"10.1111/1365-2664.14063","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519198","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","cavity-nesting bees||feeding behaviour||remote sensing||species distribution models||trap-nests||urban biodiversity||urbanization","How wild bees find a way in European cities: Pollen metabarcoding unravels multiple feeding strategies and their effects on distribution patterns in four wild bee species",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-12-07T09:31:41Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85117919451",,"000711836600001","J.

Today, worldwide conservation strategies have largely focused on protecting old-growth forests. Yet logged forests are more widespread than old-growth forests and harbour huge amounts of biodiversity and carbon stores, providing many ecosystem services and functions. In Borneo, logged forests support the livelihood of half a million indigenous people. Empowering these communities to manage logged forests can result in ecological, social and economic benefits. This study took place in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, and focused on logged forests. We investigated how community members value ecosystem services (ES) in terms of importance for their lives, and explored factors influencing their valuation. We combined a qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with a statistical analysis of respondents’ preferences for ES. We present three key findings: 1. Clean water, clean air, regulation of temperature, flood and erosion are the ES ranked as the most important by all community members regardless of their spatial and socio-demographic backgrounds, 2. Prioritization for other ES varied according to members’ age, gender, ethnicity, dependence on forest resources and distance to forest, 3. Community members’ priorities for ES align with the ecological literature that these services are retained by logged forest. Our results emphasize the need to promote people-centred approaches to design sustainable conservation policies of logged forests in Sabah.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000517654",,"1462-9011||1873-6416",,"10.1016/j.envsci.2021.11.003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517654","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Malaysia||Degraded Forests||Conservation||Ecosystem Function||Local Valuation","The value of logged tropical forests: A study of ecosystem services in Sabah, Borneo",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-11-30T03:51:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85119691697",,"000723419400008","Environ.

Although the coordination between stomatal regulation, leaf and xylem hydraulics has been extensively investigated, the impact of below-ground hydraulics on stomatal regulation remains unknown. Methods  We used a novel root pressure chamber to measure, during soil drying, the relation between transpiration rate (E) and leaf xylem water pressure (ψleaf-x) in tomato shoots grafted onto two contrasting rootstocks, a long and a short one. In parallel, we also measured the E(ψleaf-x) relation without pressurization. A soil–plant hydraulic model was used to reproduce the measurements. We hypothesize that (1) stomata close when the E(ψleaf-x) relation becomes non-linear and (2) non-linearity occurs at higher soil water contents and lower transpiration rates in short-rooted plants. Key Results  The E(ψleaf-x) relation was linear in wet conditions and became non-linear as the soil dried. Changing below-ground traits (i.e. root system) significantly affected the E(ψleaf-x) relation during soil drying. Plants with shorter root systems required larger gradients in soil water pressure to sustain the same transpiration rate and exhibited an earlier non-linearity and stomatal closure. Conclusions  We conclude that, during soil drying, stomatal regulation is controlled by below-ground hydraulics in a predictable way. The model suggests that the loss of hydraulic conductivity occurred in soil. These results prove that stomatal regulation is intimately tied to root and soil hydraulic conductances.",,,,"1095-8290||0305-7364",,"10.1093/aob/mcab141","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526241","en","Oxford University Press",,,"Solanum lycopersicum||water stress||hydraulic signal||modelling||root system||hydraulic limitations","Stomatal closure during water deficit is controlled by below-ground hydraulics",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-01-17T12:53:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85127729042",,"000822064600006","Ann Bot","2","Annals of Botany","129","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, these processes occur on multiple scales, challenging modelling of rhizosphere and plant behaviour. Current advances in modelling and experimental methods open the path to unravel the importance and interconnectedness of those processes across scales. Methods  We present a series of case studies of state-of-the art simulations addressing this multi-scale, multi-process problem from a modelling point of view, as well as from the point of view of integrating newly available rhizosphere data and images. Results  Each case study includes a model that links scales and experimental data to explain and predict spatial and temporal distribution of rhizosphere components. We exemplify the state-of-the-art modelling tools in this field: image-based modelling, pore-scale modelling, continuum scale modelling, and functional-structural plant modelling. We show how to link the pore scale to the continuum scale by homogenisation or by deriving effective physical parameters like viscosity from nano-scale chemical properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate ways of modelling the links between rhizodeposition and plant nutrient uptake or soil microbial activity. Conclusion  Modelling allows to integrate new experimental data across different rhizosphere processes and scales and to explore more variables than is possible with experiments. Described models are tools to test hypotheses and consequently improve our mechanistic understanding of how rhizosphere processes impact plant-scale behaviour. Linking multiple scales and processes including the dynamics of root growth is the logical next step for future research.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000530283",,"0032-079X||1573-5036",,"10.1007/s11104-022-05306-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/530283","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Rhizosphere||Modelling||Up- and downscaling||Emergent behaviour","Linking rhizosphere processes across scales: Opinion",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-02-01T07:57:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85123912867",,"000750868800001","Plant Soil",,"Plant and Soil","478","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Long-term temporal trends towards earlier leaf unfolding are observed across Northern Hemisphere forests. Phenological dates also vary between years, whereby end-of-season (EOS) dates correlate positively with start-of-season (SOS) dates and negatively with growing season total net CO2 assimilation (Anet). These associations have been interpreted as the effect of a constrained leaf longevity or of premature carbon (C) sink saturation - with far-reaching consequences for long-term phenology projections under climate change and rising CO2. Here, we use multi-decadal ground and remote-sensing observations to show that the relationships between Anet and EOS are opposite at the interannual and the decadal time scales. A decadal trend towards later EOS persists in parallel with a trend towards increasing Anet - in spite of the negative Anet-EOS relationship at the interannual scale. This indicates that acclimation of phenology has enabled plants to transcend a constrained leaf longevity or premature C sink saturation over the course of several decades, leading to a more effective use of available light and a sustained extension of the vegetation CO2 uptake season over time.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529849",,,,"10.1101/2022.01.17.476561","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529849","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Acclimation of phenology relieves leaf longevity constraints in deciduous forests",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2022-01-30T21:12:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,"next-generation Modelling of the biosphere - Including New Data streams and optimality approaches||Forest growth and carbon balance in a warming world: Predicting the growing season lengths of temperate forests","181115||193646","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Eccellenza||Ambizione",,"106690760",,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Under this hypothesis, baseflows are typically dominated by groundwater and mostly reflect groundwater chemistry, whereas high flows are typically dominated by shallow soil water and mostly reflect soil water chemistry. Aspects of this hypothesis draw on applications like end member mixing analyses and hydrograph separation, yet direct data support for the hypothesis remains scarce. This work tests the shallow and deep hypothesis using co-located measurements of soil water, groundwater, and streamwater chemistry at two intensively monitored sites, the W-9 catchment at Sleepers River (Vermont, United States) and the Hafren catchment at Plynlimon (Wales). At both sites, depth profiles of subsurface water chemistry and stream CQ relationships for the 10 solutes analyzed are broadly consistent with the hypothesis. Solutes that are more abundant at depth (e.g., calcium) exhibit dilution patterns (concentration decreases with increasing discharge). Conversely, solutes enriched in shallow soils (e.g., nitrate) generally exhibit flushing patterns (concentration increases with increasing discharge). The hypothesis may hold broadly true for catchments that share such biogeochemical stratifications in the subsurface. Soil water and groundwater chemistries were estimated from high- and low-flow stream chemistries with average relative errors ranging from 24% to 82%. This indicates that streams mirror subsurface waters: stream chemistry can be used to infer scarcely measured subsurface water chemistry, especially where there are distinct shallow and deep end members. © 2021.

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the adsorption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soils as well as desorption of organic carbon (OC) caused by phosphate addition. We conducted desorption and sorption experiments with DOC, phosphate (Na2HPO4), and chloride (KCl) in topsoil and subsoil samples from a Ferralsol, an Andosol, and a Podzol. Furthermore, we quantified the size of DOC by size-exclusion chromatography. We found that phosphate addition caused a strong increase in the DOC concentration in all soils. The DOC concentration was elevated by up to a factor of 4.5 compared to a control (water only) within five minutes after phosphate addition and kept increasing further with time, particularly in the Ferralsol. After 10 days, the DOC concentrations in the P addition treatment were between 5.5 and 18.0 times higher than in the control treatment. In contrast, chloride addition did not lead to increased DOC concentrations compared to the control (water only). Phosphate addition led mostly to desorption of organic matter of medium molecular size (10–100 and 100–1000 kDa) in the Ferralsol and the Andosol and of large molecular size (>1000 kDa) in the Podzol. In contrast, potassium chloride addition shifted the size distribution of DOC in the soil solution towards small compounds (<10 kDa), likely because KCl addition affected the aggregation of DOC compounds, in contrast to Na2HPO4 addition. Furthermore, phosphate addition also decreased subsequent sorption of DOC in the Ferralsol and the Andosol by a factor of up to 2.9 and 2.1, respectively. Our results have far-reaching implications because they show that phosphate addition can lead to desorption, and thus to destabilization of SOM, particularly in Ferralsols, and can also prevent further sorption of organic matter in soils. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation of why phosphate addition can decrease soil organic carbon sequestration and stabilization. This mechanism should be considered in the analysis of land-use and tillage effects on SOM sequestration in the future. Furthermore, our study indicates that also medium and large molecular size organic matter is stabilized through adsorption in soils. © 2021 Elsevier",,,,"0016-7061||1872-6259",,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115377","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517335","en","Elsevier",,,"Soil organic matter stabilization||Sorption||Ligand-exchange surface complexation||Phosphorus addition||Soil organic matter loss||Phosphorus fertilization","Sorption and desorption of organic matter in soils as affected by phosphate",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-11-27T04:13:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85113274383",,"000703712100002","Geoderma",,"Geoderma","405","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is clear that recycling human wastes has a strong potential to accomplish multiple societal goals at once. For example, it can provide effective fertilizers for enhancing crop production, soil amendments for improving carbon sequestration and water-holding capacity, and a means for improving public sanitation and health. As such, human excreta derived fertilizers (HEDFs) are applied to agricultural fields in many areas globally. However, the potential health risks of such practices are debated, especially as little is known regarding how human antibiotics contained in these fertilizers will impact the soil-microbial-plant nexus. In this greenhouse trial, we compared the impact of antibiotics contained in four different HEDFs on the soil bacterial and fungal community structure, ecosystem functioning, the development of antibiotic resistance genes, and the uptake of antibiotics into edible plant parts. Specifically, we assessed two urine-based HEDFs (raw stored urine and nitrified stored urine) and two that include carbon-rich feces (compost produced using sewage sludge and municipal green wastes and vermicompost produced from human excreta as the main feedstock). These HEDFs were then applied to two soils with contrasting geochemical properties that we hypothesized would impact sorption-desorption dynamics. Additionally, two different crop types were grown to compare uptake of antibiotics into aboveground edible plant parts (spinach) and belowground edible plant parts (carrots).

However, little is known whether - and which -  bacterial phylotypes are associated with SOM properties. The complexity of SOM quality and its stabilization differing across major soil orders and climatic regimes might be key to improve our understanding of how SOM affects microbial community structures.  In this study, we use a correlative approach to identify microbial phylotypes that are strongly associated with – soil specific - SOM properties. We sampled 35 topsoils (0 – 10 cm) characterized by varying SOM quality and quantity as well as soil properties along a 4000 km north-south transect in Chilean grasslands. First, we characterized SOM properties using a wide array of approaches, including quantification of extractable and (mineral)stabilized C pools, stable isotope ratios, spectroscopy and Rock-Eval pyrolysis. In a second step, we used soil DNA metabarcoding to assess the bacterial (16SrRNA genes) community diversity and identify dominant phylotypes. Our correlative analysis shows significant and consistent shifts in community structure along  gradients of SOM quality and quantity, and identifies phylotypes preferentially associated with specific SOM properties. This provides new insights into the link between soil C dynamics and bacterial community composition. Further, these findings will help to evaluate ecological concepts about substrate specific traits in soil microbial ecology.

This work aimed to investigate how soil textures and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) impact the relationship between transpiration rate, canopy conductance, and leaf water potential of maize (Zea mays L.) during soil drying. We hypothesize that the decrease in soil-plant hydraulic conductance (K-sp) triggers stomatal closure and the latter is soil specific. Methods Plants were grown in two contrasting soil textures (sand and loam) and exposed to two consecutive VPD levels (1.8 and 2.8 kPa). We measured transpiration rate, canopy conductance, soil and leaf water potentials during soil drying. Results Transpiration rate decreased at higher soil matric potential in sand than in loam at both VPD levels. In sand, high VPD generated a steeper drop in canopy conductance with decreasing leaf water potential. The decrease in canopy conductance was well correlated with the drop in K-sp, which was significantly affected by soil texture. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that variations in canopy conductance were not simply a function of leaf water potential but largely affected by soil hydraulics. These results reinforce a model of stomatal closure driven by a loss in soil hydraulic conductivity. Further studies will determine if soil-specific stomatal regulation exists among species.",,,,"0032-079X||1573-5036",,"10.1007/s11104-022-05818-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/586864","en","Springer",,,"Canopy conductance||Drought||Leaf water potential||Maize||Soil-plant hydraulic conductance||Stomatal regulation||VPD","Transpiration response to soil drying and vapor pressure deficit is soil texture specific",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-12-14T04:08:30Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"000889416100001","Plant Soil",,"Plant and Soil",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To address this gap, we reconstructed 48 plant-herbivore interaction networks along six elevation gradients in the Central European Alps in Switzerland, using DNA metabarcoding on orthoptera faeces. We developed hypotheses on the ecological mechanisms expected to structure interaction networks, based on plant phylogeny, plant abundance, leaf toughness, leaf nitrogen content and plant metabolomics. We show that plant phylogenetic relationships and species abundance have the greatest explanatory power regarding the structure of the ecological networks. Moreover, we found that leaf nitrogen content is a key determinant of interactions in warmer environments, while phenolic compounds and tannins are more important in colder environments, suggesting that determinants of species interactions can shift along environmental gradients. With this work, we propose an approach to study the mechanisms that structure the way species interact with each other between bioregions and ecosystems.","application/pdf",,,"0962-1083||1365-294X",,"10.1111/mec.16545","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/555007","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,,"DNA metabarcoding||metabolomics||orthopteran herbivore||phylogenetic position||plant||resource abundance||temperature||trait matching","DNA-based networks reveal the ecological determinants of plant-herbivore interactions along environmental gradients",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-06-28T03:10:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Lif3web: The present and future spatial structure of tri-trophic networks","162604","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85132571587",,"000813366700001","Mol Ecol",,"Molecular Ecology",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The evolutionary speed hypothesis predicts that environmental kinetic energy shapes variation in speciation rates through temperature- or life history-dependent rates of evolution. To test whether variation in evolutionary speed can explain the relationship between energy and biodiversity in birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles, we simulated diversification over 65 myr of geological and climatic change with a spatially explicit eco-evolutionary simulation model. We modeled four distinct evolutionary scenarios in which speciation-completion rates were dependent on temperature (M1), life history (M2), temperature and life history (M3), or were independent of temperature and life-history (M0). To assess the agreement between simulated and empirical data, we performed model selection by fitting supervised machine learning models to multidimensional biodiversity patterns. We show that a model with temperature-dependent rates of speciation (M1) consistently had the strongest support. In contrast to statistical inferences, which showed no general relationships between temperature and speciation rates in tetrapods, we demonstrate how process-based modeling can disentangle the causes behind empirical biodiversity patterns. Our study highlights how environmental energy has played a fundamental role in the evolution of biodiversity over deep time.

To date, research has mainly focused on hydraulic and physical functions of mucilage in the rhizosphere. Studies on the relevance of mucilage as a microbial habitat are scarce. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are similarly gelatinous high-molecular-weight substances produced by microorganisms. EPS support the establishment of microbial assemblages in soils, mainly through providing a moist environment, a protective barrier, and serving as carbon and nutrient sources. We propose that mucilage shares physical and chemical properties with EPS, functioning similarly as a biofilm matrix covering a large extent of the rhizosphere. Our analyses found no evidence of consistent differences in viscosity and surface tension between EPS and mucilage, these being important physical properties. With regard to chemical composition, polysaccharide, protein, neutral monosaccharide, and uronic acid composition also showed no consistent differences between these biogels. Our analyses and literature review suggest that all major functions known for EPS and required for biofilm formation are also provided by mucilage, offering a protected habitat optimized for nutrient mobilization. Mucilage enables high rhizomicrobial abundance and activity by functioning as carbon and nutrient source.

As such, limited guidance exists on the most reliable methods to explain and predict spatial variation in abundance. We analysed the performance of 68 abundance-based species distribution models fitted to 800 000 standardised abundance records for more than 800 terrestrial bird and reef fish species. We found a large amount of variation in the performance of abundance-based models. While many models performed poorly, a subset of models consistently reconstructed range-wide abundance patterns. The best predictions were obtained using random forests for frequently encountered and abundant species and for predictions within the same environmental domain as model calibration. Extending predictions of species abundance outside of the environmental conditions used in model training generated poor predictions. Thus, interpolation of abundances between observations can help improve understanding of spatial abundance patterns, but our results indicate extrapolated predictions of abundance under changing climate have a much greater uncertainty.

The designed scenarios reflect (i) expected future land-use demands for living space, built-up areas, green space and agricultural areas, and (ii) statutory and strategic planning intentions extracted from four spatial plans and weighted based on expert opinion. All scenarios, alongside natural and socioeconomic driving forces, were simulated for both the local and the regional scales using the CLUMondo land-change model.

Predicting bedload transport in higher gradient streams still represents a considerable challenge because of its large spatio-temporal variability. To cope with these uncertainties, intensive efforts were made to develop surrogate bedload monitoring technologies. The present thesis focuses on one such system, the Swiss plate geophone (SPG), which has been deployed and calibrated in numerous steep water courses, mainly in the Alps. In a first stage, we conducted field calibration measurements at three Swiss field sites recently equipped with a SPG system which are located at the Albula, the Navisence, and the Avançon de Nant streams. There, direct bedload samples were collected with a net sampler to calibrate the signal recorded by the geophones. Earlier studies have shown that the calibration relationships obtained from such campaigns can vary substantially between different monitoring stations, likely due to site-specific factors such as the flow velocity and the bed roughness. In a second stage, we attempted to improve our understanding of these disparities by performing full-scale controlled flume experiments at an outdoor flume facility. The mentioned field sites were replicated one after another in a 24 m-long flume on the basis of their morphological and hydraulic characteristics, and a part of the bedload samples collected in the field served as test material. Even though these flume experiments could not accurately reproduce field-based calibration relationships, they enabled us to relate variations in the SPG signal response to changes in the grain-size distribution of bedload mixtures. Furthermore, we showed that a geophone plate detects vibrations from impacts occurring either on a neighboring plate or on the surrounding concrete sill, which introduces a significant site-specific bias to field calibration relationships. Recent studies have reported combinations of amplitude and frequency information to infer particle sizes and improve the detectability of bedload particles using various surrogate monitoring techniques. Motivated by these findings, we developed in a last stage two amplitude-frequency-based methods aiming to identify these extraneous impacts and reduce their effect on site-specific calibration relationships. Using a field calibration dataset extended with measurements from the Erlenbach site, we showed that including frequency information in the calibration of the SPG signal results in more homogeneous signal responses across all sites and significantly improves the accuracy of fractional sediment flux and grain-size estimates. Thus, it was possible to develop a single general calibration relationship capable of providing fairly accurate bedload transport estimates at all the four investigated field sites. Optimizing the calibration procedure for each field site separately, resulted in a further increase of the accuracy of the predicted bedload transport rates.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000541325",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/541325","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Bedload Transport Measurements in Mountain Streams with the Swiss Plate Geophone System: Towards a General Calibration Procedure for Fractional Transport",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2022-04-06T21:38:46Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28232",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Therefore, reliable predictions of low-flow metrics are crucial. In this study, we assess which catchment characteristics (climate, topography, geology and landcover) can explain the spatial variability of low-flow metrics at two different scales: the regional scale and the small headwater catchment scale. For the regional-scale analysis, we calculated the mean 7-day annual minimum flow (qmin), the mean of the flow that is exceeded 95% of the year (q95), and the master recession constant (C) for 280 independent gauging stations across the Swiss Plateau and the Swiss Alps for the 2000–2018 period. We assessed the relation between 44 catchment characteristics and the three low-flow metrics based on correlation analysis and a random forest model. Low-flow magnitudes across the Swiss Plateau were positively correlated with the fraction of the area covered by sandstone bedrock or alluvium, and with the area that has a slope between 10° and 30°. Across the Swiss Alps, low-flow magnitudes were positively correlated with the fraction of area with slopes between 30° and 60°, and the area with glacial deposits and debris cover. There was good agreement between observations and predictions by the random forest regression model with the top 11 catchment characteristics for both regions: for 80% of the Swiss Plateau catchments and 60% of the Swiss Alpine catchments, we could predict the three low-flow metrics within an error of 30%. The residuals of the regression model, however, varied across short distances, suggesting that local catchment characteristics affect the variability of low-flow metrics. For the local-scale headwater catchments, we conducted 1-day snapshot field campaigns in 16 catchments during low-flow periods in 2015 and 2016. The measurements in these sub-catchments also showed that areas with sandstone bedrock and a good storage-to-river connectivity had above average low-flow magnitudes. Including knowledge on local catchment characteristics may help to improve regional low-flow predictions, however, not all local catchment characteristics were useful descriptors at larger scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526146",,"0885-6087||1099-1085",,"10.1002/hyp.14462","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526146","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A multi‐scale study of the dominant catchment characteristics impacting low‐flow metrics",,"Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-01-17T09:54:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"105187272","85123683176",,"000747506900018","Hydrol.

However, the influence of spatially heterogeneous distributions on the soil particles surfaces is scarcely known. Therefore, this study investigates the influence of spatially heterogeneous wettability distributions on infiltration into porous media. For this purpose, we utilize a two-phase flow model based on Lattice-Boltzmann to numerically simulate the infiltration in porous media with a simplified geometry and for various selected heterogeneous wettability coatings. Additionally, we simulated the rewetting of the dry rhizosphere of a sandy soil where dry hydrophobic mucilage depositions on the particle surface are represented via a locally increased contact angle. In particular, we can show that hydraulic dynamics and water repellency are determined by the specific location of wettability patterns within the pore space. When present at certain locations, tiny hydrophobic depositions can cause water repellency in an otherwise well-wettable soil. In this case, averaged, effective contact angle parameterizations such as the Cassie equation are unsuitable. At critical conditions, when the rhizosphere limits root water uptake, consideration of the specific microscale locations of exudate depositions may improve models of root water uptake.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000540699",,"2073-4441",,"10.3390/w14071110","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/540699","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","porous media||rhizosphere||heterogeneous wettability||effective contact angle||lattice boltzmann modeling","How Heterogeneous Pore Scale Distributions of Wettability Affect Infiltration into Porous Media",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-04-04T06:17:02Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85128286406",,"000781543600001",,"7","Water","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Methods A wild-type and its root hairless mutant maize (Zea mays) were grown in the field in loam and sand substrates during two growing seasons with a large precipitation deficit. A comprehensive dataset of soil and plant properties and monitored variables were collected and interpreted using simulations with a mechanistic root water uptake model.  Results Total crop water use was similar in both soils and for both genotypes whereas shoot biomass was larger for the wild type than for the hairless mutant and did not differ between soils. Total final root length was larger in sand than in loam but did not differ between genotypes. Simulations showed that root systems of both genotypes and in both soils extracted all plant available soil water, which was similar for sand and loam, at a potential rate.

Mutants with defective root hairs are expected to have lower nutrient uptake, unless they compensate with more root growth. Since root hairs can also contribute to the plant's water uptake their importance could change over the course of a growing season. It was our objective to investigate the role of root hairs under field conditions. Methods The root hair mutant rth3 of Zea mays and the corresponding wild-type were grown for two years under field conditions on sand and loam. Results Shoot growth and P and K uptake of the plants were promoted by the presence of hairs at all growth stages. Differences between genotypes were greater on loam than on sand until tassel emergence, presumably as additional exploitation by hairs is more relevant in loam. Compensation for the absence of root hairs by increased root growth was not observed in absolute terms. The root to shoot ratio was higher for rth3 than for wild-type. Root traits showed high plasticity in response to texture, the most salient being a greater mean root diameter in sand, irrespective of genotype. The mechanism causing the increase in mean root diameter is still unknown. Root length density was higher in sand, which can be explained by a greater need for exploration than exploitation in this substrate. Conclusion The role of hairs for nutrient uptake could be confirmed under field conditions. The large impact of texture on root growth and consequences for carbon balance require further investigations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000544536",,"0032-079X||1573-5036",,"10.1007/s11104-022-05434-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/544536","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Mechanical impedance||Nutrient availability||Rhizosphere||Root diameter||Root length density||Root to shoot ratio||Water availability||Zea mays","Root hairs matter at field scale for maize shoot growth and nutrient uptake, but root trait plasticity is primarily triggered by texture and drought",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-05-01T02:53:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85128758022",,"000785579500001","Plant Soil",,"Plant and Soil","478","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In temperate European forests, the adoption of ‘close-to-nature silviculture’ and the cessation of forest management in forest reserves have allowed Fagus sylvatica to increase its share and have sparked new interest in the mechanisms of its dominance. An outstanding object to study its dominance is the largest remnant primary Fagus sylvatica forest, Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh in the Ukrainian Carpathians. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the competitive advantages of Fagus sylvatica over Acer platanoides, A. pseudoplatanus and Ulmus glabra. To do so, traits of shade tolerance and associated competitive advantages were studied: i) the influence of species identity, tree age and biomass partitioning to leaves and shoots on leaf area ratio, absolute growth rate of tree biomass and storage pools in stem and root; ii) mortality rates and survival times of Fagus sylvatica and Acer spp.; and iii) the abundance of understory trees under canopy trees of Fagus sylvatica, Acer spp. and U. glabra as a proxy of replacement probability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000579874",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/579874","en","ETH Zurich",,,"Fagus||dominance","Fagus sylvatica dominance in European forests",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2022-11-07T19:12:22Z","2023-11-09",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27831",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Various studies predict higher tree mortality and susceptibility to natural disturbances such as windthrow, bark beetle infestation, and forest fires as a result of future climate and legacies of land-use history. Therefore the fundamental research question of this thesis arises: Can disturbed mountain forests with lying deadwood still protect against rockfall or will protective deficits occur? The novel development in experimental methodology and the subsequent adaption of the results within modern numerical methods to answer this guiding question is presented in this thesis resulting in three publications. They cover different spatial scales and address different relevant questions related to rockfall processes in mountain forests. The first paper breaks ground for the experimental procedure of a 1:1 rockfall tests through an experimental rockfall trilogy in the forest. It comprises the release of approximately medicine ball sized, sensor-equipped, cubic 45 kg rocks to a forested rockfall transit area. The forest service changed the predominant forest structure between experiments, resulting in different forest stages and experimental setups: (i) the original forest, (ii) the stage after a timber cut with lying deadwood left as obstacles and (iii) the cleared stage after the removal of the deadwood. The second paper deals with similar rockfall experiments but with larger rock masses ranging up to 3.2 t, varying rock shapes on a longer and naturally, windthrow-affected forested slope. With the rock masses, the experimental complexity also increased. A multi-camera setup was elaborated and each time installed anew to achieve video-footage coverage along the entire slope. Together with the in situ rock data and high-resolution lidar point clouds of the site, a reconstruction of 63 rock trajectories was possible. The intricate experimental sequence involves removing and re-installing the logs of the deadwood in order to allow comparable living forest states, allowing for the highest possible cross-comparability of forest states across different weight classes. The effect of the lying deadwood could be quantified in unprecedented detail. Both studies show that deadwood effectively protects against rockfall but to varying extent. The deadwood retention ratio of the first experiment was above 95 %. For larger rock masses, this ratio decreased. However, the protective effect of forests is not solely dependent on deadwood: In contrast to the results of open land experiments, we demonstrated that platy-shaped rocks are less dangerous in the forest than their mass-equivalent, cubic rocks. They are more affected by tree impacts and tend to stop earlier. The results of these experiments with and without lying deadwood have been successfully reproduced in computer simulations. Therefore three-dimensional cones (cylinders) were introduced into the program RAMMS::ROCKFALL. The third paper presents an automatic deadwood generator which has been programmed to facilitate the upscaling and transferability from the two experimental sites to other rockfall and windthrow endangered areas. This approach allows programmatically placing deadwood logs into the landscape regional-wide and is serving as an input for rockfall simulation models. The thesis hence comprises high-end real-scale rockfall experiments in different forests with deadi wood, acting as a potent real-world link for new numerical modelling approaches. This combination of both, experiments and modelling, allows the upscaling of the relevant results up to a regional scale. The results are of the highest relevance and application for forest management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000588624",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588624","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","Rockfall||Deadwood||Protective effect of forests||Rockfall experiments||Rock shape","Experimental quantification of deadwood influence on rockfall dynamics and its incorporation into regional-scale rockfall models",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2022-12-21T12:36:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28668",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We develop a polygon mapping algorithm by considering distances and nestedness of occurrences. We further apply an SDM approach considering multiple modelling algorithms, complexity levels, and pseudo-absence selections to map the species at a high spatial resolution and intersect it with the generated polygons. We use this approach to construct range maps for all 1957 species of Fagales and Pinales with data compilated from multiple sources. We construct high-resolution global species richness maps of these important plant clades, and document diversity hotspots for both clades in southern and south-western China, Central America, and Borneo. We validate the approach with two representative genera, Quercus and Pinus, using previously published coarser range maps, and find good agreement. By efficiently producing high-resolution range maps, our mapping approach offers a new tool in the field of macroecology for studying global species distribution patterns and supporting ongoing conservation efforts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000562715",,"0013-8703||1570-7458",,"10.1111/nph.18158","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/562715","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","biodiversity||Fagales||mapping||Pinales||polygon (hull)||range map||species distribution modelling (SDM)||species richness","An integrated high-resolution mapping shows congruent biodiversity patterns of Fagales and Pinales",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-08-09T16:41:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85132293287",,"000792075000001","Entomol. exp. appl.","6","Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata","170","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As the rapid changes in earth ecosystems occur, ecologists are faced with the task of quantifying the magnitude of biodiversity loss resulting from human-induced global change. Consequences of global change on species richness and community composition at different spatial and temporal scales have been widely documented, however less is known about the effects of global change on species interactions. In early stages of ecological research, species interactions were often overlooked as an important facet of biodiversity that should be studied and quantified. This has changed over the last several decades and species interactions have gained increasing recognition as the backbone of biodiversity; since many ecological processes that maintain and generate biodiversity closely depend on the formation of species interactions. Despite this increasing interest, there are still gaps in our knowledge on how drivers of global change, particularly forest conversion, affect species interactions. Gaps in knowledge are particularly evident in tropical ecosystems where species richness is often high. To determine the influence of land use change on species interactions I studied hummingbirds and the plants they visit for nectar. When visiting flowering plants, hummingbirds move pollen across the landscape enabling plant reproduction. In exchange, plants reward hummingbirds with high-sucrose nectar, needed to fulfill their energetic demands. This mutually beneficial relationship results in the pollination of thousands of plant species across the Americas. The study region of this dissertation was located in a biodiversity hotspot in the northwestern Andes of Ecuador along a wide elevation gradient that ranges 800 to 3500 m above sea level, which consists of forests and converted areas for cattle grazing. This dissertation consists of three chapters. Chapter 2 investigates the effects of land use change hereafter, forest conversion, on hummingbirds’ interspecific competition mediated by resource availability and morphological similarity among hummingbirds. To test the effects of forest conversion on resource competition I performed selectivity experiments. Selectivity was quantified as the time hummingbirds spent at high resource feeders when feeders with both low and high resource values were offered in the presence of competitors. This experiment was replicated in three points along the elevation gradient (low, mid, high). Forest conversion resulted in increased selectivity, but the influence of morphological dissimilarity and resource availability on selectivity varied between these elevations. In lowlands, hummingbird assemblages are structured by local processes, like niche-partitioning, resulting in a bigger role of resources in explaining selectivity. In contrast, in assemblages at higher elevations, which are shaped by environmental filtering, differences in morphology predict selectivity. Chapter 3 investigates the effect of forest conversion on the functional roles fulfilled by interacting plants and hummingbirds. Species functional roles were quantified based on their interaction niches i.e. the range of biotic resources used by a species. At the network level, the diversity of functional roles was quantified as the sum of all species interaction niches and the functional redundancy as the overlaps in species interaction niches. This chapter shows evidence that forest conversion, disproportionally reduced the diversity and redundancy of functional roles of plants compared to their hummingbird pollinators. Plant communities became less redundant when the available interaction niche created by hummingbirds increased. Although forest conversion had no effect on the diversity of functional roles of hummingbirds, the composition of their functional roles changed between habitats, implying that hummingbirds use different parts of plants functional space. In Chapter 4, the rules that govern species interactions are examined in the context of forest conversion. Species interactions are governed by linkage rules related to their morphological match or mismatch (niche-based linkage rules) and by neutral-based rules that assume niche equivalency among species. By using a hierarchical Bayesian model that associates linkage rules to interaction probabilities, while accounting for imperfect detection of hummingbirds, the effect of forest conversion on niche and neutral based rules was tested. This chapter shows evidence that indicates that forest conversion negatively affected the strength of trait matching on interaction probabilities. This negative effect is rooted on changes in the distribution of floral traits that forced hummingbirds to interact with less well matched flowers. This dissertation moves beyond a species-only approach and provides new evidence on the effects of drivers of global change to species interactions. The findings obtained during this research are discussed from an ecological perspective; but also, and whenever possible, a conservation angle is adopted. This was done to provide concrete management alternatives to land-owners and practitioners responsible for the conservation species and integrity of species interactions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000574824",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/574824","en","ETH Zurich",,,"Biodiversity||Conservation||Ecology||Ecuador||Elevation gradient||Functional traits||Hummingbirds||plant-pollinator interactions","The Effects of Land-Use Change on Species Interactions in the Tropical Andes",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::590 - Zoological sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2022-10-08T12:52:46Z","2025-10-10",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28538",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They were used as dielectric insulator in capacitors and transformers but also as plasticizer in paints and joint sealants, and as flame retardant in building materials. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) were rather unintentionally formed as by-products of uncompleted combustion processes. Unfortunately, PCBs and PCDD/Fs are easily dispersed, resistant to environmental degradation, bioaccumulative, and toxic, which may endanger ecosystems and human health, and therefore resulted in their listing as persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Despite global restrictive measures since 2004, PCBs and PCDD/Fs are ubiquitous in the environment. These lipophilic contaminants bioaccumulate along the feed-to-food chain, reaching high concentrations in animal fat-rich tissues and excreta (i.e., meat, milk, and eggs). Therefore, humans are mainly exposed to them via the consumption of food of animal origin. Only bovine products (meat and dairy) already account for more than 70% of the total exposure in Western diets, with a higher contribution coming from PCBs than PCDD/Fs. Even with preventive measures by sanitary authorities and the livestock sector, the European population continues to exceed the tolerable weekly intake (TWI). Especially cattle from extensive grass-based feeding systems have shown to be occasionally non-compliant with legally defined maximum regulatory levels. Such livestock contamination incidents can compromise consumer's confidence towards meat safety, which affects livestock system sustainability and induces social distress for farmers. The focus of this thesis was the expansion of our knowledge regarding the toxicokinetics of PCBs and PDD/Fs from oral exposure (feed with background environmental contamination and contaminated soil) to the body compartments and excreta of cattle. This thesis specifically focused on beef production by surveying fattening bulls (part 1 of the thesis), as well as suckling cows and calves (part 2). The aim is to decipher the effects of bovine physiology, besides physicochemical properties of the compound, on both the overall transfer (empirical transfer factors, e.g., feed to meat bioconcentration factor, or feed to milk transfer rate) and the detailed absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) mechanisms. In the first part of this thesis, the influence of carcass lipid proportion and growth rate of fattening bulls on various empirical factors quantifying PCB transfer were explored. Eleven bulls were fattened for 293 days with three different energy-containing diets at PCB background levels, to achieve distinct growth rates until slaughter at 530 or 600 kg body weight. It was shown that PCB physicochemical properties, such as a higher chlorination degree and a non-ortho substitution increased the transfer rate [i.e., increase in bioconcentration factor (BCF), biotransfer factor (BTF), and assimilation efficiency (AE)]. The animal physiology, mainly the carcass lipid proportion, was negatively correlated with BCF and BTF. To handle this complex interplay between physicochemical and physiological characteristics, equations were proposed to decrease the uncertainties linked to average transfer factors in case the carcass lipid proportion can be estimated. The second part of this thesis assessed the influence of PCB and PCDD/F physicochemical properties and animal physiology on transgenerational accumulation, distribution among body tissues, and decontamination by mimicking a suckling cow husbandry during gestation and lactation. Nine exposed cows ate a grass silage/contaminated soil mixture for 109 days prepartum until 288 days in milk (DIM). Four of them decontaminated after DIM164 by receiving the same uncontaminated grass silage, as did four control cows along the entire study. The calves were fed the milk of their respective mothers and received additionally non-contaminated hay and concentrate. Within the cow, absorption of PCBs was reduced with increasing chlorination and lipophilicity, and when provided through soil. The chlorination effect was not obvious in calves, resulting in a transgenerational bioaccumulation within the exposed group until DIM164, with calf blood and adipose tissue PCB and PCDD/F concentrations 2-fold higher as those in their mother cows. Physicochemical POP properties and reproductive parity of the cow were also influencing transfer rates to milk, as well as decontamination half-lives in milk. To characterize the remaining POP fractions not transferred to the milk, an additional input-output balance was established, showing that the metabolism rate was negatively correlated with chlorination degree. Calves tended to accumulate the largest absorbed fraction in their body but were still more efficient in reducing their POP body concentrations compared to their mother cows, presumably based on a higher increase in body fat mass. In both cow and calf, liver specific enrichment of PCBs and PCDD/Fs occurred, whereas indicator PCBs also tended to accumulate more in kidney and muscles, than in adipose tissues. Such results challenged whether adipose tissue concentrations are representative for most edible beef-tissues. This thesis chapter again shows the essence of knowing the physicochemical pollutant properties, as well as the physiological characteristics of bovine, whether young growing calves or reproductive females, to be able to perform a robust and reliable transfer assessment.  This thesis provides detailed insights about the transfer of PCBs and PCDD/Fs from diffusive environmental sources into beef cattle, be it while fattening or suckling. The results clearly showed dependencies of transfer, accumulation, and decontamination on POP physicochemical properties and animal physiology. Such complex interactions have to be considered when performing risk assessment. This profound knowledge will help to set-up new guidelines and to implement preventive measures to reduce beef cattle POP contamination and subsequently ensure food safety and public health.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000550206",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/550206","en","ETH Zurich",,,"Absorption rate||Adipose tissue||Cattle||Chemical food safety||Decontamination||Milk||Muscle||Persistent organic pollutant (POP)||Transgenerational transfer","Fate of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in Beef-Producing Husbandries and the Impact of Animal Physiology",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::540 - Chemistry||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::590 - Zoological sciences","2022-06-01T13:56:23Z","2024-06-02",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28349",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the future, the intensity of disturbances will likely further increase, which may have more serious consequences for tropical forests than those we have already observed. Thus, quantifying aboveground biomass loss of forest stands due to stem mortality (hereafter biomass loss rate) is important for the estimation of the role of tropical forests in the global carbon cycle. So far, the long-term impacts of altered stem mortality on rates of biomass loss have not been adequately described.  This study aims to analyse the consequences of long-term elevated stem mortality rates on forest dynamics and biomass loss rate. We applied an individual-based forest model and investigated the impacts of permanently increased stem mortality rates on the growth dynamics of humid, terra firme forests in French Guiana. Here, we focused on biomass, leaf area index (LAI), forest height, productivity, forest age, quadratic mean stem diameter, and biomass loss rate. Based on the simulation data, we developed a multiple linear regression model to estimate biomass loss rates of forests in different successional states from the various forest attributes.  The findings of our simulation study indicated that increased stem mortality altered the succession patterns of forests in favour of fast-growing species, which increased the old-growth forests' gross primary production, though net primary production remained stable. The stem mortality rate had a strong influence on the functional species composition and tree size distribution, which led to lower values in LAI, biomass, and forest height at the ecosystem level. We observed a strong influence of a change in stem mortality on biomass loss rate. Assuming a doubling of stem mortality rate, the biomass loss rate increased from 3.2 % yr−1 to 4.5 % yr−1 at equilibrium. We also obtained a multidimensional relationship that allowed for the estimation of biomass loss rates from forest height and LAI. Via an example, we applied this relationship to remote sensing data on LAI and forest height to map biomass loss rates for French Guiana. We estimated a countrywide mean biomass loss rate of 3.0 % yr−1.  The approach described here provides a novel methodology for quantifying biomass loss rates, taking the successional state of tropical forests into account. Quantifying biomass loss rates may help to reduce uncertainties in the analysis of the global carbon cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542315",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-19-1891-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542315","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Importance of the forest state in estimating biomass losses from tropical forests: combining dynamic forest models and remote sensing",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-04-14T02:44:32Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85128269773",,"000777999700001",,"7","Biogeosciences","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we explore how pelagic fish species diversity relates to functional diversity by sampling two locations, which, on the basis of biogeography, environmental conditions and human pressures, were expected to host pronounced differences in species composition and abundances and therefore functionality. Strings of five drifting mid-water Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems were used to survey pelagic vertebrate diversity and abundance in two isolated oceanic island systems, the Malpelo Fauna and Flora Sanctuary – a large, 25-year-old marine protected area – and an unprotected area in Cape Verde. Functional diversity, which offers insight into a community’s resilience against disturbance, was analysed using six key functional traits of marine fishes. Abundance was recorded as MaxN, the maximum number of individuals of a given species in a single frame during the 2-h deployment time. Cape Verde showed high overall abundance (Total MaxN 873) and low biomass (3559 kg), with a predominance of smaller fishes. Malpelo showed high biomass (7839 kg) but lower abundance (Total MaxN 465), with a predominance of large species. Species and functional diversity were marginally different between locations. Multivariate analysis of species relative abundances showed significant divergence between locations, although community functional traits overlapped strongly, suggesting that both communities share a similar structure and vulnerability. The existence of a common functional ‘backbone’ in diverging species communities across the oceans, under different productivity regimes, and under different protection levels, suggests that although pelagic communities may differ considerably in terms of species composition, this does not translate into a differing functional structure and resilience potential. Whether this vulnerability is a common feature of pelagic communities and how this contrasts with benthic systems warrants further research.",,,,"0025-3162||1432-1793",,"10.1007/s00227-021-03998-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522243","en","Springer",,,"Biodiversity||Functional diversity||Pelagic fish||Islands||Mid-water BRUV","Similar trait structure and vulnerability in pelagic fish faunas on two remote island systems",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-12-24T05:40:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85121451893",,"000731281400001","Mar. biol.","1","Marine Biology","169","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While there is widespread consensus on the general usefulness of conceptual fractions with specific functional implications, there is still a lack of information on the patterns with which they contribute to bulk soil organic carbon (SOC) stock at larger scales and across climatic and soil physicochemical gradients. In this study, we aimed to assess first the quantitative importance of three key SOM fractions across a diverse range of 12 soil groups with global significance. Secondly, we wanted to gain insights on the environmental drivers that shape the contribution of these fractions to SOC stocks.  Here we sampled a set of 35 grassland topsoils (0 – 10 cm) along a 3000 km north-south transect in Chile ranging from subpolar to Mediterranean climate, and covering 12 WRB major soil groups. Following a modified version of the protocol in Zimmermann et. al (2007), we partitioned the soils into three functional SOM fractions defined by particle size and density (free silt and clay, free particulate organic matter, stable microaggregates), enabling us to quantify SOC stocks and the relative contribution to SOC in these three fractions. In order to identify links between fractions and potential drivers of C stabilization, we further characterized extensively relevant physico-chemical properties of the soils, compiled climatic data of the sites and characterized OM maturity (DRIFT spectroscopy and Rock-Eval pyrolysis) as well as pedogenic, secondary Fe-, Al- and Mn-oxide concentrations through sequential extraction.  We found that the contributions of mineral-associated SOM fractions to bulk SOC varied strongly across the soil gradient, while the contribution of free particulate organic matter was comparatively stable and low. SOM associated with free silt and clay sized particles are the most important C reservoir in soils with less than 4 % SOC, whereas in soils with higher SOC content, the majority of the SOC is contained in stable microaggregates. The SOC stock in various fractions was sensitive to changes in temperature, pedogenic oxides, and OM input vs. decomposition. Comparison of OM maturity showed that free particulate OM and free silt and clay associated OM can be clearly distinguished, while OM in microaggregates is likely a mixture of both. However, drivers of OM composition in microaggregates could not be identified.  This study demonstrates that in SOC-rich soils, microaggregates represent a major fraction of bulk SOC, and that SOC stocks in key SOM fractions can be linked to distinct climatic and soil physicochemical factors.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542684",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-9088","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542684","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Drivers of the distribution of soil organic matter fractions along a geo-climatic gradient",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2022-04-19T09:48:24Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23-27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In Northern Scandinavia, permafrost peat plateaus have been found to decline rapidly during the last decades, releasing old organic carbon to decomposition and runoff. Thawing peat plateaus can partly turn into thermokarst ponds, with consequences for the biogeochemical fate of the released carbon. We investigated carbon degradation of thawing permafrost peat by incubating permafrost peat and thermokarst sediments from three peat plateaus in Northern Norway. The samples were incubated field moist at 10oC for almost one year. Initial decomposition was dominated by CO2 production which strongly responded to oxygen availability, while methane (CH4) production was small. Methane production increased drastically after more than ten months, indicating that thawed permafrost peat has a considerable potential to produce CH4 after a time lag. The cumulative CH4 production of thawed permafrost peat after one year of incubation exceeded that of overlaying active layer peat by up to 641 times, illustrating the potential of thawing subarctic permafrost to act as an additional CH4 source. Comparing laboratory thawed permafrost peat to thermokarst peat revealed remarkable differences in CH4 production, with much higher CH4 production potentials in thermokarst sediments during the first months of incubation and in some samples exceeding CH4 production measured in permafrost peat after one year. This suggests that the potential to produce CH4 increases dramatically with thermokarst formation. Interestingly, thawed permafrost peat produced more DOC over the period of one year than gaseous C (CO2 and CH4), which suggests that hydrological conditions are key to the understanding of the fate of C released from thawing peat plateaus.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542700",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-5257","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542700","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The long-term biogeochemical fate of C in Subarctic thawing peat plateaus",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2022-04-19T11:03:09Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23-27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Frost-sensitive, N-rich aboveground biomass may be a particular problem during wintertime, as it may fuel off season N2O emissions during freezing-thawing cycles, which have been shown to dominate the annual N2O budget of many temperate and boreal sites. Here we report growing season and winter N2O emissions in a plot experiment in SE Norway, testing a barley production system with seven different catch and cover crops (perennial and Italian ryegrass, oilseed radish, summer and winter vetch, phacelia and an herb mixture) against a control without cover crops. Cover crops where either undersown in spring or established after harvesting barley. While ryegrass undersown to barley marginally reduced N2O emissions during the growing season, freeze-thaw cycles in winter resulted in significantly larger N2O emissions in treatments with N-rich cover crops (oilseed reddish, vetch) and Italian ryegrass. N2O budgets will be presented relative to aboveground yield and quality of cover crops and compared to potential souil organic carbon gains.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543383",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-3066","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543383","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"High off-season nitrous oxide emissions negate potential soil C-gain from cover crops in boreal cereal cropping",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2022-04-22T14:36:48Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23-27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A warmer climate has already severely altered the cryosphere. Cryospheric changes such as snowpack reduction are known to be strongly coupled with the entire hydrologic cycle. However, relatively little is known about the nexus between snow cover changes, source water contributions to groundwater and surface water bodies and associated biogeochemical cycling in aquatic systems.   To better understand the rapid changes occurring in cold region environments, we obtained field- and satellite-derived data from two sub-arctic catchments (one glaciated, one unglaciated) in the north-western corner of the Hardangervidda mountain plateau (South Central  Norway). During 2020 and 2021, we analyzed various water sources including streams, lakes, groundwater, snow and ice for environmental tracers (major ions, stable water isotopes, radon-222) and greenhouse gases (GHG; CO2, CH4 and N2O). Combining the environmental tracer data with a Bayesian end-member mixing modelling approach (Popp et al., 2019) allowed us to partition water source contributions to streams and lakes. Moreover, we used the noble gas radon to assess hyporheic exchange flow and short water residence times (Popp et al., 2021). To estimate snow cover anomalies in 2020 and 2021 compared to a five-year mean, we retrieved fractional snow cover durations (fSCDs) from 2016 to 2021 by merging Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 imagery over Finse and applying a spectral unmixing algorithm (Aalstad et al., 2020).   According to the satellite-derived data, 2020 was exceptionally snow-rich, while 2021 was a snow-poor year. Initial results suggest that the snow-poor year (2021) resulted in comparatively longer groundwater and stream water residence times. As expected, in 2021, surface waters and groundwaters showed lower fractions of snow and ice meltwater. This signal is, however, less pronounced in the unglaciated catchment. With this approach, we aim to hone our understanding of the response of water source partitioning and associated biogeochemical cycling, particularly greenhouse gas concentrations, to climate change-induced alterations in the snowpack.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543384",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-10348","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543384","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The impact of snow cover changes on source water contributions and associated biogeochemical cycling in high latitude catchments",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2022-04-22T14:39:05Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23-27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This rapid warming leads, among other effects, to the massive loss of ice masses, development of thermokarst features when permafrost thaws, intensification of the hydrological cycle, and increasing loads of nutrients and organic carbon to surface waters. Freshwaters are highly sensitive to these changes, which affect microbial community composition and diversity. Therefore, these ecosystems are good sentinels to study processes in primary ecological succession related to ecosystem processes such as productivity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With this study, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the linkages between biogeochemistry and hydrology in High Arctic freshwaters. To this end, we sampled various water sources (e.g., lakes and streams) in two High Arctic catchments (Bayelva and Lovénbreen, in Svalbard in July 2021) for the analysis of GHGs (CH4, CO2, N2O), noble gases (radon-222, argon-40), major ions, stable water isotopes (δD and δ18O) and nutrients (organic C, organic -P and organic -N). We used Ar-corrected gas saturation of each GHG as a proxy of net metabolic changes, while tracers such as stable water isotopes help to disentangle water source contributions. Our first results show that lakes and streams were oversaturated in CO2 as well as N2O but slightly undersaturated in O2, suggesting higher respiration activity than primary production. Our data also indicate a  strong oversaturation in CH4 in lakes, but not in streams. Moreover, we used microbial mineralization of organic matter as a proxy for GHG production. We found similar concentrations of total organic C and N in both lakes and streams and significantly higher concentrations of total P in streams than in lakes. This work furthers our knowledge of the current state of High Arctic freshwaters and helps to predict future effects of climate change impacts on GHG evasion.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543382",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-2051","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543382","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"High Arctic freshwaters as emitters of greenhouse gases",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2022-04-22T14:34:12Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23-27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Infection by V. album has become more and more apparent with climate change during the last decades. In some drought-prone regions, mistletoe infection has been found to aggravate drought stress, leading to increasing tree mortality. It is well known that mistletoe relies on water and nutrients from its host. It is still unclear, however, whether there is carbon exchange between mistletoe and its host, as mistletoe connects only to the host xylem and not to the phloem. This Ph.D. thesis concentrates on two common subspecies of European mistletoe (i.e. V. album ssp. austriacum and V. album ssp. album) and their host trees, exploring the relationship between mistletoe and its host from a comprehensive perspective. Two controlled labeling experiments (Chapters I, II) and a field assessment (Chapter III) were conducted to investigate the carbon, water and nutrient relationship between V. album and its hosts under various growing conditions.  In Chapter I, a dual-labeling (i.e. 13C and 18O) experiment was conducted on pine mistletoe (V. album ssp. austriacum) and its host Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing in dry and irrigated plots of a long-term irrigation experiment in Pfynwald, Valais. Compared with the dry control, irrigation resulted in a lower natural abundance of 18O and a lower concentration of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in V. album ssp. austriacum but not in Scots pine, indicating that mistletoe and its host may differ in their strategies to deal with water stress. Further, Scots pine branches and detached mistletoes (i.e. preventing resource exchange between mistletoe and host branch) were labeled with 13C-enriched CO2 and 18O-enriched water vapor over 4 hours in closed chambers. Both mistletoe and its host had a weaker 13C-signal but an unchanged 18O signal in irrigated plots compared with values in dry control plots. Irrespective of the irrigation treatment, the 13C and 18O labeling of the assimilates was 50% weaker in mistletoe than in its host, indicating a lower incorporation capacity in the former than in the latter.  Chapter II is based on two experiments, a wrapping experiment and a removal experiment, conducted under the ‘umbrella’ of a whole-tree 13C-pulse labeling experiment with mature Scots pine infected by V. album ssp. austriacum growing in the dry and irrigated plots in Pfynwald. In the wrapping experiment, mistletoe clusters were selected and wrapped with gas-tight plastic and aluminum foil before the whole-tree 13C-pulse labeling was started, to prevent uptake of 13CO2 from the labeling. Hence, any 13C labeling signals potentially measured in these wrapped mistletoe clusters would provide direct evidence for carbon transfer from host to mistletoe. To investigate carbon exchange in relation to changes in carbon and water availability of the host, a tissue removal experiment was conducted on girdled pine branches infected by mistletoe, i.e. preventing carbon translocation via the phloem. Before the whole-tree 13C-pulse labeling, these branches were treated with either: (1) removal of all pine needles, (2) removal of all mistletoe tissues, or (3) intact control without needle or mistletoe tissue removal. Results of the wrapping experiment indicate that there is no carbon transfer from the host to the mistletoe, as no labeled 13C signal was found in the wrapped mistletoe tissue. Also, no carbon transfer was observed from the mistletoe to the carbon-limited host (i.e. pine branch with needles removed). However, the increase in local water availability with pine needle removal resulted in more pronounced 13C signals and higher NSC concentrations in mistletoes in dry plots, suggesting that the assimilation capacity of mistletoes is constrained by the availability of water to the host. Therefore, it can be concluded that V. album ssp. austriacum assimilates carbon independently assimilates carbon independently but that its capacity to assimilate carbon depends on the availability of water to the host tree. Chapter III focuses on the carbon, water and nutrient relationships between V. album ssp. album and its various host tree species growing under different environmental conditions. It is based on a field sampling assessment of nine mistletoe–host pairs in central Switzerland. Consistent with the results in the first two chapters, the concentrations of NSC and its compounds in mistletoe and the host tissues showed no significant correlations among the different mistletoe–host pairs, suggesting a carbon independency of V. album ssp. album and its hosts. In contrast, leaf δ13C, leaf water content, and leaf concentrations of almost all nutrient elements were consistently positively correlated among all nine mistletoe–host pairs, indicating an adaptation strategy of mistletoe to co-exist with its host under varying water and nutrient availability.   Overall, the aim of this thesis is to investigate the carbon, water and nutrient relationships between V. album and its host trees. It provides novel direct evidence that no carbon transfer occurs between V. album and its host. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the water and nutrient status of V. album is directly impacted by the availability of water and nutrients to its host. Hence, this thesis deepens the mechanistic understanding of mistletoe–host coexistence in various and changing environmental conditions, including ongoing global environmental change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591641",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591641","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Mistletoe||plant physiology||isotope ecology||non-structural carbohydrate (NSC)||water relations||nutrient relations","Carbon, water and nutrient relationship between European mistletoe (Viscum album L.) and its host trees",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences","2023-01-11T12:47:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28632",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We developed a set of climate-related variables at as yet unprecedented spatiotemporal detail as a basis for environmental and ecological analyses. We downscaled time series of near-surface relative humidity (hurs) and cloud area fraction (clt) under the consideration of orography and wind as well as near-surface wind speed (sfcWind) using the delta-change method. Combining these grids with mechanistically downscaled information on temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation, we then calculated vapor pressure deficit (vpd), surface downwelling shortwave radiation (rsds), potential evapotranspiration (pet), the climate moisture index (cmi), and site water balance (swb) at a monthly temporal and 30 arcsec spatial resolution globally from 1980 until 2018 (time-series variables). At the same spatial resolution, we further estimated climatological normals of frost change frequency (fcf), snow cover days (scd), potential net primary productivity (npp), growing degree days (gdd), and growing season characteristics for the periods 1981-2010, 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100, considering three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP126, SSP370, SSP585) and five Earth system models (projected variables). Time-series variables showed high accuracy when validated against observations from meteorological stations and when compared to alternative products. Projected variables were also highly correlated with observations, although some variables showed notable biases, e.g., snow cover days. Together, the CHELSA-BIOCLIM+ dataset presented here (https://doi.org/10.16904/envidat.332, Brun et al., 2022) allows improvement to our understanding of patterns and processes that are governed by climate, including the impact of recent and future climate changes on the world's ecosystems and the associated services on societies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000589289",,"1866-3516||1866-3508",,"10.5194/essd-14-5573-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589289","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Global climate-related predictors at kilometer resolution for the past and future",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-12-28T05:43:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,"FeedBaCks: Feedbacks between Biodiversity and Climate","193907","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","ERA-NET + EJP",,,,,"000895876900001","Earth syst. sci. data","12","Earth System Science Data","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

First, environmental constraints limiting tree growth and shaping tree species distribution worldwide are discussed. Second, examples are presented for environmental conditions under which tree-ring isotopes record environmental signals particularly well, but also cases where physiological processes can mask climate signals. Third, the link between leaf-level carbon assimilation and the investment of assimilates in the stem during the annual ring formation are discussed in light of the resulting deviations of the isotopic values between leaves and tree rings. Finally, difficulties and pitfalls in the interpretation of stable isotope signals in tree rings are reviewed. These problems often result from a poor understanding of when and how the tree canopy, stems and roots are physiologically interconnected. Current literature suggests that photosynthesis and radial growth are only loosely coupled, if at all, challenging the interpretation of environmental signals recorded in tree-ring isotopes. Harsh environmental conditions (e.g. low temperatures, drought) often result in a decoupling of carbon assimilation and growth. The chapter closes by providing possible solutions on how to improve the detection of environmental information from stable isotope signals by integrating scales and different methodological approaches.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000592863","978-3-030-92697-7||978-3-030-92698-4","0829-318X||1758-4469",,"10.1007/978-3-030-92698-4_14","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/592863","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Limits and Strengths of Tree-Ring Stable Isotopes",,"Book Chapter","Open access","Stable Isotopes in Tree Rings: Inferring Physiological, Climatic and Environmental Responses",,"2023-01-17T08:21:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tree Physiology","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The processes operating at the different organizational scales affect each other, generating complex couplings across scales. Yet, despite this astonishing organizational complexity, ecological and economic systems both display invariant patterns. A fundamental challenge in the study of ecological and economic systems is to identify the general organizational principles from which these patterns originate. Recently, studies have shown that evolutionary processes can occur on similar time scales as ecological processes, generating eco-evolutionary feedbacks which may play an important role on the dynamics of ecological systems. In parallel, studies on economic systems suggest that economic change is determined by analogous eco-evolutionary processes. Yet, our understanding of eco-evolutionary processes and feedback mechanisms in empirical systems is limited, because of the oversimplicity of current eco-evolutionary models and a lack of confrontation with empirical data. By developing novel modelling approaches to improve the modelling of empirical systems, this thesis advances our general understanding of the eco-evolutionary processes and feedbacks shaping the dynamics of ecological and economic systems. Specifically, Chapter 2 presents and analyses an eco-evolutionary model on spatial graphs to understand how eco-evolutionary processes, together with complex habitat structures, influence the phenotypic distribution of biological populations. Chapter 3 presents an inverse modelling framework to estimate the most likely parameter values of dynamical models from empirical data, granting the opportunity to discriminate between competing eco-evolutionary hypotheses. Chapter 4 tests whether processes operating on economic activities, consisting of positive and negative interactions between them, their spatial dispersal and their transformations, can explain their dynamics at the country level. To reach this goal, the inverse modelling framework, together with data covering 59 years of economic time series over 74 countries, are used. Finally, Chapter 5 presents two numerical methods to efficiently simulate eco-evolutionary models of biological populations that are structured in high dimensional spatial and phenotypic spaces. This thesis altogether advances our general understanding of the eco-evolutionary processes and feedbacks shaping the dynamics of biological populations and economic activities. A comprehensive mapping of elemental eco-evolutionary feedbacks influencing spatially structured biological populations is established. As regards economic activities, processes involving positive interactions between themselves and spatial dispersal are evidenced to systematically affect their dynamics at the country scale. In parallel to those fundamental results, novel forward and inverse modelling methods are developed, allowing to better capture the dynamics of empirical systems. In the face of the ongoing climate and biodiversity crisis, there is an urgent need to accelerate our general understanding of the mechanisms shaping our world. Bridging biology, mathematical modelling, machine learning and economics, the approaches developed in this thesis can massively help us to reach this goal.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000598848",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/598848","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","deep learning||eco-evolutionary dynamics||economic system||inverse modelling||partial differential equations","Forward and inverse modelling of eco-evolutionary dynamics",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::510 - Mathematics||DDC - DDC::0 - Computer science, information & general works::004 - Data processing, computer science","2023-02-15T15:06:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28804",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The sustainable use of forest resources and ecosystem services is therefore the main objective of responsible forest management. This requires a holistic view of the processes driving forest dynamics and ecosystem service provision. Management decisions are typically taken locally, i.e. at the level of forest stands. Yet, large-scale forces such as climate and land-use change as well as forest policies increasingly influence forest functioning and the provision of forest ecosystem services. Integrative modelling approaches of forest dynamics are needed to support decision-making at small (e.g., stands) and large spatial scales (e.g., landscapes, countries). However, detailed initialisation data for forest models at large regions such as countries and ecoregions are often lacking.  National Forest Inventory (NFI) data representatively depict forest composition and structure at large spatial scales, but individual NFI sample plots are small and do not directly represent forest stands. To render such large-scale sampling data from small sample plots useful for the initialisation of dynamic forest models at multiple spatial scales, I developed and validated a novel statistical methodology. Furthermore, I extended and used the empirical stand simulator SwissStandSim to evaluate stand development and future ecosystem services and biodiversity (ESB) under adaptive forest management and climate scenarios at a regional, i.e. Switzerland north of the Alps, and local scale, i.e. three forest enterprises in Switzerland.  In Chapter I, I developed a methodology to predict stand descriptions from small and truncated but large-scale sampling data of the Swiss NFI. I used multi truncated uni- and bimodal Weibull functions with an extended parameter prediction method (PPM) to predict stand diameter distributions and linked them to the species composition predicted by a multinomial logistic regression model. In Switzerland, diameter distributions of stands are typically positively skewed and around one-tenth of them is better described by a bimodal Weibull function than by a unimodal one. Bimodal diameter distributions are especially valuable to account for regeneration (e.g., of shade-tolerant species) in the stands. This methodology can be applied to any large-scale dataset (e.g., NFI) and allows to generate representative stand descriptions, which can be used to initialise dynamic forest models at multiple scales.  In Chapter II, I validated the methodology of Chapter I and compared it to alternative approaches for approximating stand-level data from large-scale sampling data. The method proposed in Chapter I (except for multinomial logistic regression, which was outperformed by a Random Forest approach) is generally superior in terms of prediction performance compared to the other approaches. This means stand descriptions were more accurate for even-aged as well as structurally diverse stands and for stand predictions based on samples with less than 17–19 trees (the majority of samples in NFIs). This Chapter highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches, provides guidance for model selection and model building. It also confirms that the methodology proposed in Chapter I can be used to accurately initialise forest models at local and regional scales in a standardised way.  In Chapter III, I first extended the empirical stand simulator SwissStandSim to make it useful for simulating sustainable management on long time scales. Then, I used a simulation-based sensitivity analysis to systematically evaluate the effects of adaptive forest management interventions on ESB provision in common beech- and spruce-dominated stands in Switzerland north of the Alps across the 21st century. I demonstrated that the planting of climatically suited tree species is promising to enhance future ESB provision and synergies among them, while intensified harvesting may lead to a loss of ESB in the study region. The results suggest a temperature-driven increase of productivity, but did not consider the effects of drought. Overall, Chapter III showed the advantages of multi-scenario sensitivity analysis that enables quantifying effect sizes and effect directions of individual (adaptive) management interventions and climate impacts, which is of central importance for deriving targeted management plans in the view of multiple options for forest adaptation to climate change.  In Chapter IV, we simulated stand development under management and climate change for a 50-year time horizon using SwissStandSim in three forest enterprises. To this end, we extended SwissStandSim with expert-based prescriptions for the management strategies plentering (continuous cover forestry) and crop tree management, which are preferred by local forest practitioners. We evaluated ESB provision by means of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The currently applied (sustainable) management (BAU) resulted in the highest overall utility under different climate change and ESB preference scenarios. We found synergistic effects between biodiversity, protection, recreation, and carbon sequestration, while these services were generally negatively related to timber production. In this Chapter, we presented a new multi-criteria decision support system (DSS) prototype and discussed its importance for strategic and long-term planning at the forest enterprise level.  My thesis provides considerable steps forward to a more realistic and holistic simulation of forest development under management and climate scenarios at diverse spatial scales. It thus can be used to guide management at regional and local levels in Switzerland. This thesis identified scale-dependent effects of management interventions on ESB provision that should be further investigated and may ultimately contribute to advance future forest management planning. The application of the initialisation method presented in this thesis in multi-scale modelling approaches provides a solid empirical foundation to increase trust in model predictions and improve scale-dependent decision support for forestry, which is urgently needed in the face of climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000600982",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/600982","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Forest models||Forest model initialisation||Adaptive forest management||Forest ecology||Climate change||Small forest samples||National forest inventories||Tree diameter distribution||Weibull probability density function||Tree species composition||Statistical models||Ecosystem services||Trade-offs and synergies||Sensitivity analysis||Decision support system","A matter of scale: sampling data for forest stand simulations, adaptive forest management and ecosystem service assessments",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture","2023-02-28T19:57:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28794",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Metagenomics data are increasingly easy to obtain, but studies of soil metagenomics face three key challenges: (1) accounting for soil physicochemical properties; (2) incorporating untreated controls; and (3) sharing data. Accounting for soil physicochemical properties is crucial for better understanding the changes in soil microbial community composition, mechanisms, and abundance. Untreated controls provide a good baseline to measure changes in soil microbial communities and separate treatment effects from random effects. Sharing data increases reproducibility and enables meta-analyses, which are important for investigating overall effects. To overcome these challenges, we suggest establishing standard guidelines for the design of experiments for studying soil metagenomics. Addressing these challenges will promote a better understanding of soil microbial community composition and function, which we can exploit to enhance soil quality, health, and fertility.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000585085",,"2076-2607",,"10.3390/microorganisms10101900","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/585085","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","soil physicochemical properties||microbial ecology||metagenomics||untreated controls||data-sharing guidelines","Current Challenges and Pitfalls in Soil Metagenomics",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2022-12-06T08:36:06Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85140981361",,,,"S 10","Microorganisms","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The use of terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) dominates contemporary literature for under-storey vegetation mapping as this technique provides precise and easy-to-use solutions for users. However, TLS requires substantial investments in terms of device acquisition and user training. The search for and development of low-cost alternatives is therefore an interesting field of inquiry. Here, we use low-cost 360° cameras combined with spherical photogrammetric principles for under-storey vegetation mapping. While we fully assume that this low-cost approach will not generate results on par with either TLS or classical close-range photogrammetry, its main aim is to investigate whether this alternative is sufficient to meet the requirements of forest mapping. In this regard, geometric analyses were conducted using both TLS and close-range photogrammetry as comparison points. The diameter at breast height (DBH), a parameter commonly used in forestry, was then computed from the 360° point cloud using three different methods to determine if a similar order of precision to the two reference datasets can be obtained. The results show that 360° cameras were able to generate point clouds with a similar geometric quality as the references despite their low density, albeit with a significantly higher amount of noise. The effect of the noise is also evident in the DBH computation, where it yielded an average error of 3.5 cm compared to both the TLS and close-range photogrammetry.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000586088",,"1682-1750||2194-9034||1682-1777",,"10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-2-w1-2022-185-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/586088","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Low-cost||Forest||Under-storey||Photogrammetry||Spherical||360° images","Low-cost mapping of forest under-storey vegetation using spherical photogrammetry",,"Conference Paper","Open access",,,"2022-12-09T15:13:48Z",,,,"yes","7th International Workshop LowCost 3D - Sensors, Algorithms, Applications","December 15-16, 2022","Würzburg, Germany",,,,,,,,"85144330254",,"000943591000026","Int.

As a consequence of tremendous advances in 3D scanning technologies, broad areas of forest can be mapped in 3D dramatically faster than 20 years ago. Consequently, capturing 3D forest point clouds with the use of 3D sensing technologies – such as lidar – is becoming predominant in the field of forestry. However, the processing of 3D point clouds to bring semantics to the 3D forestry data – e.g. by linking them with ecological values – has not seen similar advancements. Therefore, in this paper we consider a novel approach based on the use of VR (Virtual reality) as a potential solution for deriving biodiversity from 3D point clouds acquired in the field. That is, we developed a VR labelling application to visualise forest point clouds and to perform the segmentation of several biodiversity components on tree stems e.g., mosses, lichens and bark pockets. Furthermore, the VR segmented point cloud was analysed with standard accuracy and precision metrics. Namely, the proposed VR application managed to achieve an IoU (Intersection over Union) rate value of 98.74% for the segmentation of bark pockets and resp. 93.71% for the moss and lichen classes. These encouraging results reinforce the potential for the proposed VR labelling method for other purposes in the future, for example for AI (Artificial Intelligence) training dataset creation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000586087",,"1682-1750||2194-9034||1682-1777",,"10.5194/isprs-archives-xlviii-2-w1-2022-95-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/586087","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Virtual reality||Point cloud segmentation||Training dataset creation||Tree stem labelling||Microhabitats","Feasibility study of using virtual reality for interactive and immersive semantic segmentation of single tree stems",,"Conference Paper","Open access",,,"2022-12-09T15:11:10Z",,,,"yes","7th International Workshop LowCost 3D - Sensors, Algorithms, Applications","December 15-16, 2022","Würzburg, Germany",,,,,,,,"85144292218",,"000943591000014","Int.

However, under changing environmental conditions, it remains unclear whether soils act as sources or sinks of carbon. Especially soils in alpine ecosystems are subject to undergo changes in their soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. To disentangle the possible effects of climate change on SOC stocks in alpine environments, the factors which contribute to SOC stabilization have to be known and understood. Recent studies indicated the importance of soil physicochemical parameters governed by weathering of parent material.  To attain a better understanding of how parent material may influence SOC stabilization in alpine ecosystems, five alpine sites in Europe with varying parent material (i.e., Dolomite, Flysch, Gneiss, Greenschist, and Marl) were investigated. Similar climatic conditions, aspect, and slope allowed to analyze the impact of different parent materials on SOC stocks. The geochemical composition of the parent material and the soil, exchangeable cations and effective cation exchange capacity, pH, pedogenic oxides, soil texture, organic carbon and nitrogen contents, and SOC fractions were determined for all soil horizons (i.e., Oh, Ah, Bv, and Cv). The following SOC fractions were physically separated: unprotected, coarse particulate organic carbon (>250 µm), SOC occluded in microaggregates (53 – 250 µm), and SOC in the silt and clay fraction (<53 µm), which is assumed to be predominantly protected via minerals. Linear and non-linear models were computed in order to distill the relative importance of the geochemical parameters on SOC concentrations in the bulk soil (SOCbulk) and the silt and clay fraction (SOCs+c).  Preliminary findings point at the importance of soil depth, texture, and organically complexed oxides as these parameters were found to be among the best predictors for SOCbulk. The concentrations of poorly crystalline aluminum, magnesium, and exchangeable manganese gained importance when predicting SOCs+c. These results align with previous research which has shown the influence of pedogenic oxides on SOC stabilization, Furthermore, the significance of soil depth supports the increasing call of soil scientists to take the entire soil profile into account when analyzing SOC dynamics since large amounts of carbon are stored at depth below the commonly analyzed first 30 cm.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000595566",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-13386","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/595566","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Weathering of soil parent material controls quantity and quality of soil organic carbon in alpine ecosystems",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2023-01-29T18:53:30Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23-27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We applied modern thermal analysis methods to investigate soil mineral effects on the thermal stability, chemical composition, and age distribution of soil organic matter. We selected subsoil mineral fractions that contained a single dominant stabilizing pathway (e.g. 2:1 clays, iron oxides, short-range order minerals, crystalline minerals) to isolate effects of individual minerals. We paired thermal fractionation with pyrolysis-GC/MS to describe the relationships of SOM age and chemical composition. Early results show that while certain minerals display heterogeneous thermal stabilities, single mineralogies contain generally narrow age ranges.

However, empirical studies focusing on soil GHG flux dynamics from deforestation hotspots in the tropics are still limited creating major uncertainties for constraining global GHG budgets. In this study, we investigated how deforestation for fertilizer intensive sugarcane cultivation in Uganda affects soil-borne GHGs. Therefore, soil GHG fluxes were measured in a primary forest and in a completely randomized experiment premised in the neighboring sugarcane fields with different fertilizer regimes, representing both smallholder and industrial-scale sugarcane farm management. Despite the use of different fertilization rates (low, standard, and high) as treatments for the sugarcane CRD experiment, neither auxiliary controls nor soil GHG fluxes significantly differed among the CRD treatments. Soil respiration was higher in the sugarcane than in the forest, which we attribute to the increased autotrophic respiration from the sugarcane’s fine root biomass and the likely exposure of the sugarcane’s larger soil organic carbon stocks to microbial decomposition through ploughing operations. The forest soils were a stronger net sink of CH4 than the sugarcane soils despite forest soils having both higher bulk densities and larger water-filled pore space (WFPS), and we suspect that this was due to alteration of the methanotroph abundance upon the conversion. Soil N2O emissions were smaller in the sugarcane than in the forest, which was surprising, but most likely resulted from the excess N being lost either through leaching or uptake by the sugarcane crop. Only seasonal variability in WFPS, among the auxiliary controls, affected CH4 uptake at both sites and soil CO2 effluxes in the sugarcane. Noteworthy, soil N2O fluxes from both sites were unaltered by the seasonality-mediated changes in auxiliary controls. All the findings put together suggest that forest conversion for sugarcane cultivation alters soil GHG fluxes by increasing soil CO2 emissions and reducing both soil CH4 sink strength and soil N2O emissions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000595572",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-761","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/595572","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Soil greenhouse gas fluxes following tropical deforestation for fertilizer-intensive sugarcane cultivation in northwestern Uganda",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2023-01-29T22:15:13Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23-27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Theory predicts that a large fraction of phytochemical diversity—the richness of individual chemical compounds produced by plants—governs the complexity of interactions between plants and their herbivores. While the effect of specific classes of chemical compounds on plant resistance against herbivores has been largely documented, the effect of community-level variation in phytochemical diversity on plant–herbivore interactions has so far received minimal consideration. 2. We hypothesized that plant communities bearing on average higher levels of phytochemical diversity should sustain lower herbivory rates, overall. Yet, the magnitude of this effect could vary across different environmental conditions, potentially because of climate-mediated effects on phytochemical production and changes in herbivore community richness and composition. 3. To address these hypotheses, we used previous knowledge of species-level phytochemical make-up for more than 400 plant species of the Swiss Alps. Using common garden experiments, we estimated season-wide herbivore damage on low (average 3,500 unique molecules) and high (average 4,500 unique molecules) phytochemical diversity plant communities that were planted in the colline, mountain and alpine vegetation sites along two elevation transects in the Alps. 4. We found that high phytochemical diversity plant communities showed reduced levels of herbivore damage in the colline (low elevation) sites, but this pattern reversed in the alpine (high elevation) sites. Our results suggest that the outcome of phytochemical diversity on plant–herbivore interactions depends on the characteristics of the local herbivore communities, together with trade-offs between chemical defences and other plant traits (i.e. physical defences and plant palatability). 5. Synthesis. Phytochemical diversity is a key component of functional diversity, influencing community composition and dynamics. We show that the effect of phytochemical diversity on herbivory is environmental-dependent, generating ecological switches when moving from low to high elevation. Through upward movement of plants under climate change, phytochemical community structure will be likely modified, ultimately disrupting local community assembly processes.",,,,"0022-0477",,"10.1111/1365-2745.13649","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495123","en","Wiley",,,"alpine environment||biodiversity-ecosystem functioning||chemical defences||common garden experiment||plant–climate interactions||plant–herbivore interactions||secondary metabolites||untargeted HPLC-MS","The effect of community-wide phytochemical diversity on herbivory reverses from low to high elevation",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-07-15T10:47:37Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Lif3web: The present and future spatial structure of tri-trophic networks","162604","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85103368065",,"000634533000001","J.

A major aim of ecology is to upscale attributes of individuals to understand processes at population, community and ecosystem scales. Such attributes are typically described using functional traits, that is, standardised characteristics that impact fitness via effects on survival, growth and/or reproduction. However, commonly used functional traits (e.g. wood density, SLA) are becoming increasingly criticized for not being truly mechanistic and for being questionable predictors of ecological processes.  2. This Special Feature reviews and studies how the metabolome (i.e. the thousands of unique metabolites that underpin physiology) can enhance trait-based ecology and our understanding of plant and ecosystem functioning.  3. In this Editorial, we explore how the metabolome relates to plant functional traits, with reference to life-history trade-offs governing fitness between generations and plasticity shaping fitness within generations. We also identify solutions to challenges of acquiring, interpreting and contextualising metabolome data, and propose a roadmap for integrating the metabolome into ecology.  4. We next summarise the seven studies composing the Special Feature, which use the metabolome to examine mechanisms behind plant community assembly, plant-organismal interactions and effects of plants and soil micro-organisms on ecosystem processes.  5. Synthesis. We demonstrate the potential of the metabolome to improve mechanistic and predictive power in ecology by providing a high-resolution coupling between physiology and fitness. However, applying metabolomics to ecological questions is currently limited by a lack of conceptual, technical and data frameworks, which needs to be overcome to realise the full potential of the metabolome for ecology.",,,,"0022-0477",,"10.1111/1365-2745.13826","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/527698","en","Wiley",,,"ecophysiology||fitness||functional traits||life history||metabolite||metabolomics||plasticity||trade-offs","Functional Traits 2.0: The power of the metabolome for ecology",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-01-24T04:44:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Ecological consequences of novel plant-soil interactions under changing climate||Novel`interactions and species’ responses to climate change","176044||678841","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","H2020||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85122789613",,"000741645500002","J.

AOA are key players in the nitrogen cycle and defining their niche specialization can help predicting effects of environmental change on these communities. However, hierarchical effects of environmental filters on AOA and the delineation of niche preferences of nitrososphaerial lineages remain poorly understood. We used phylogenetic information at fine scale and machine learning approaches to identify climatic, edaphic and geomorphological drivers of Nitrososphaeria and other archaea along a 3000 km European gradient. Only limited insights into the ecology of the low-abundant archaeal classes could be inferred, but our analyses underlined the multifactorial nature of niche differentiation within Nitrososphaeria. Mean annual temperature, C:N ratio and pH were the best predictors of their diversity, evenness and distribution. Thresholds in the predictions could be defined for C:N ratio and cation exchange capacity. Furthermore, multiple, independent and recent specializations to soil pH were detected in the Nitrososphaeria phylogeny. The coexistence of widespread ecophysiological differences between closely related soil Nitrososphaeria highlights that their ecology is best studied at fine phylogenetic scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000517418",,"1462-2912||1462-2920",,"10.1111/1462-2920.15830","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517418","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Diversity of archaea and niche preferences among putative ammonia‐oxidizing Nitrososphaeria dominating across European arable soils",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-11-29T07:30:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85119279722",,"000720134900001","Environ. microbiol.","1","Environmental Microbiology","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
