Here we use satellite derived soil moisture observations from the Climate Change Initiative of the European Space Agency to quantify the relation between soil moisture drought and temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration and vegetation during the peak of the growing season. Furthermore, we follow the temporal evolution of the buildup and recovery surrounding the drought peak. We find that in many regions longer-term precipitation deficits are the driving factors of large negative soil moisture anomalies. At the peak of the dry period large anomalies are found for precipitation, evapotranspiration, and temperature, while vegetation indices often show a delayed response. This delay is likely related to the limited information contained in the remotely sensed soil moisture signal on the deeper root zone, thus underestimating the available soil moisture for plants. Anomalies over grasslands are generally larger than over forests, likely linked to the ability of trees to better access water at deeper depths, and to save water during dry conditions. These results illustrate the relevance of remote-sensing based soil moisture as a new independent observation for studying land-vegetation-atmosphere dynamics at the global scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000167365",,"0034-4257",,"10.1016/j.rse.2017.06.014","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/167365","en","Elsevier BV",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Drought event composites||Satellite derived soil moisture||ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI)||Land cover","A drought event composite analysis using satellite remote-sensing based soil moisture","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-30T08:23:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85020523679","000418464200015","Remote Sens.

To do this, we critically examined and compared the social and scientific values that shaped the production of three national climate scenarios in the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK. A comparative analysis of documentary materials and expert interviews linked to the climate scenarios was performed. Our findings reveal a new typology of use-inspired research in climate science for decision-making: (i) innovators, where the advancement of science is the main objective; (ii) consolidators, where knowledge exchanges and networks are prioritised; and (iii) collaborators, where the needs of users are put first and foremost. These different values over what constitutes ‘good’ science for decision-making are mirrored in the way users were involved in the production process: (i) elicitation, where scientists have privileged decision-making power; (ii) representation, where multiple organisations mediate on behalf of individual users; and (iii) participation, where a multitude of users interact with scientists in an equal partnership. These differences help explain why climate knowledge gains its credibility and legitimacy differently even when the information itself might not be judged as salient and usable. If the push to deliberately co-produce climate knowledge is not sensitive to the national civic epistemology at play in each country, scientist–user interactions may fail to deliver more ‘usable’ climate information.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000130748",,"1436-3798||1436-378X",,"10.1007/s10113-017-1155-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/130748","en","Springer",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate scenarios||Adaptation||Decision-making||Co-production||Civic epistemology","The social and scientific values that shape national climate scenarios: a comparison of the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T21:01:11Z",,,,"pub:193779",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936556e348df33266","003869201",,"85018257377","000415136200012","Reg Environ Change","8","Regional Environmental Change","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The ratio between potential evapotranspiration (PET) and P is explicitly considered to be the primary control of ET/P within the Budyko framework, whereas all other controls are often integrated into a single parameter, ω. Although the joint effect of these additional controlling factors of ET/P can be significant, a detailed understanding of them is yet to be achieved. This study therefore introduces a new global data set for the long-term mean partitioning of P into ET and runoff in 2,733 catchments, which is based on in situ observations and assembled from a systematic examination of peer-reviewed studies. A total of 26 controls of ET/P that are proposed in the literature are assessed using the new data set. Results reveal that: (i) factors controlling ET/P vary between regions with different climate types; (ii) controls other than PET/P explain at least 35% of the ET/P variance in all regions, and up to ∼90% in arid climates; (iii) among these, climate factors and catchment slope dominate over other landscape characteristics; and (iv) despite the high attention that vegetation-related indices receive as controls of ET/P, they are found to play a minor and often nonsignificant role. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive picture on factors controlling the partitioning of P, with valuable insights for model development, watershed management, and the assessment of water resources around the globe.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000225005",,"0043-1397||1944-7973",,"10.1002/2017WR021215","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/225005","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Large-Scale Controls of the Surface Water Balance Over Land: Insights From a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-03T03:39:21Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85038935185","000418736700055","Water Resour.

We use ensemble simulations for the period AD 1600–2000 carried out by the coupled Atmosphere-Ocean-Chemistry-Climate Model (AOCCM) SOCOL-MPIOM. Firstly, the SOCOL-MPIOM is evaluated using observational and reanalyses datasets. The model is able to realistically simulate the ISMR as well as relevant patterns of sea surface temperature and atmospheric circulation. Further, the influence of Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability on ISMR is realistically simulated. Secondly, we investigate the impact of internal climate variability and external climate forcings on ISMR on decadal to multi-decadal timescales over the past 400 years. The results show that AMO, PDO, and Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) play a considerable role in controlling the wet and dry decades of ISMR. Resembling observational findings most of the dry decades of ISMR occur during a negative phase of AMO and a simultaneous positive phase of PDO. The observational and simulated datasets reveal that on decadal to multi-decadal timescales the ISMR has consistent negative correlation with PDO whereas its correlation with AMO and TSI is not stationary over time.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191962",,"0930-7575||1432-0894","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/223792||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191962","10.1007/s00382-017-3529-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/233518","en","Springer",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Indian Summer Monsoon||El Niño southern oscillation||Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation||Pacific decadal oscillation||External forcings of climate||Solar activity","Decadal to multi-decadal scale variability of Indian summer monsoon rainfall in the coupled ocean-atmosphere-chemistry climate model SOCOL-MPIOM","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T04:05:37Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85010931924","000414153800035","Clim Dyn","9-10","Climate Dynamics","49","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we present sea level rise (SLR) projections for the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) storylines and different year-2100 radiative forcing targets (FTs). Future SLR is estimated with a comprehensive SLR emulator that accounts for Antarctic rapid discharge from hydrofracturing and ice cliff instability. Across all baseline scenario realizations (no dedicated climate mitigation), we find 2100 median SLR relative to 1986–2005 of 89 cm (likely range: 57–130 cm) for SSP1, 105 cm (73–150 cm) for SSP2, 105 cm (75–147 cm) for SSP3, 93 cm (63–133 cm) for SSP4, and 132 cm (95–189 cm) for SSP5. The 2100 sea level responses for combined SSP-FT scenarios are dominated by the mitigation targets and yield median estimates of 52 cm (34–75 cm) for FT 2.6 Wm−2, 62 cm (40–96 cm) for FT 3.4 Wm−2, 75 cm (47–113 cm) for FT 4.5 Wm−2, and 91 cm (61–132 cm) for FT 6.0 Wm−2. Average 2081–2100 annual SLR rates are 5 mm yr−1 and 19 mm yr−1 for FT 2.6 Wm−2 and the baseline scenarios, respectively. Our model setup allows linking scenario-specific emission and socioeconomic indicators to projected SLR. We find that 2100 median SSP SLR projections could be limited to around 50 cm if 2050 cumulative CO2 emissions since pre-industrial stay below 850 GtC, with a global coal phase-out nearly completed by that time. For SSP mitigation scenarios, a 2050 carbon price of 100 US$2005 tCO2 −1 would correspond to a median 2100 SLR of around 65 cm. Our results confirm that rapid and early emission reductions are essential for limiting 2100 SLR.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000221340",,"1748-9326||1748-9318","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/221340||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/226897","10.1088/1748-9326/aa92b6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/230713","en","Institute of Physics",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","sea level rise||Shared socioeconomic pathways||climate change||climate impacts||climate mitigation||climate scenarios||antarctic dynamics","Linking sea level rise and socioeconomic indicators under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-12-15T02:51:11Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85036628150",,"Environ.

It is then transported to the extratropics by the Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC), forming a protective ""ozone layer"" around the globe. Human emissions of halogen-containing ozone-depleting substances (hODSs) led to a decline in stratospheric ozone until they were banned by the Montreal Protocol (MP), and since 1998 ozone in the upper stratosphere shows a likely recovery. Total column ozone (TCO) measurements of ozone between the Earth's surface and the top of the atmosphere, indicate that the ozone layer has stopped declining across the globe, but no clear increase has been observed at latitudes outside the polar regions (60–90). Here we report evidence from multiple satellite measurements that ozone in the lower stratosphere between 60° S and 60° N has declined continuously since 1985. We find that, even though upper stratospheric ozone is recovering in response to the MP, the lower stratospheric changes more than compensate for this, resulting in the conclusion that, globally (60°&tinsp;S–60° N), stratospheric column ozone (StCO) continues to deplete. We find that globally, TCO appears to not have decreased because tropospheric column ozone (TrCO) increases, likely the result of human activity and harmful to respiratory health, are compensating for the stratospheric decreases. The reason for the continued reduction of lower stratospheric ozone is not clear, models do not reproduce these trends, and so the causes now urgently need to be established. Reductions in lower stratospheric ozone trends may partly lead to a small reduction in the warming of the climate, but a reduced ozone layer may also permit an increase in harmful ultra-violet (UV) radiation at the surface and would impact human and ecosystem health.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000221530",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-2017-862","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/221530","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Continuous decline in lower stratospheric ozone offsets ozone layer recovery","Working Paper","Open access",,,"2017-12-15T11:24:46Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atmos. chem. phys. discuss.",,"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A k-means clustering algorithm is used to characterize the two-dimensional variability of the eddy-driven jet stream, defined by the lower tropospheric zonal wind in the ERA-Interim reanalysis. The first three clusters capture the central jet and northern jet, along with a new mixed-jet configuration; a fourth cluster is needed to recover the southern jet. The mixed cluster represents a split or strongly tilted jet, neither of which is well described in the zonal-mean framework, and has a persistence of about one week, similar to the other clusters. Connections between the preferred jet locations and weather regimes are corroborated – southern to GA, central to ZO, and northern to AR. In addition, the new mixed cluster is found to be linked to European/Scandinavian blocking, whose relation to the eddy-driven jet was previously unclear.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000217030",,"0035-9009||1477-870X",,"10.1002/qj.3155","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/217030","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","eddy-driven jet||weather regimes||North Atlantic atmospheric variability||blocking||NAO","The link between eddy-driven jet variability and weather regimes in the North Atlantic-European sector","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-12-05T05:38:21Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,"The mutual interaction of individual weather systems and weather regimes","148177","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,,"85034636045","000416062100026","Q.

The approach of “event attribution” compares the occurrence-probability of an event in the present, factual climate with its probability in a hypothetical, counterfactual climate without human-induced climate change. Several methods can be used for event attribution, based on climate model simulations and observations, and usually researchers only assess a subset of methods and data sources. Here, we explore the role of methodological choices for the attribution of the 2015 meteorological summer drought in Europe. We present contradicting conclusions on the relevance of human influence as a function of the chosen data source and event attribution methodology. Assessments using the maximum number of models and counterfactual climates with pre-industrial greenhouse gas concentrations point to an enhanced drought risk in Europe. However, other evaluations show contradictory evidence. These results highlight the need for a multi-model and multi-method framework in event attribution research, especially for events with a low signal-to-noise ratio and high model dependency such as regional droughts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000212504",,"2328-4277",,"10.1002/2017EF000612","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/212504","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Event attribution||2015 European drought||climate change","Methods and Model Dependency of Extreme Event Attribution: The 2015 European Drought","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-11-23T06:31:46Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85031717072","000415124900008",,"10","Earth's Future","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Primary ice formation above 235 K is initiated by nucleation on seed aerosol particles called ice-nucleating particles (INPs). Instruments that measure the ice-nucleating potential of aerosol particles in the atmosphere need to be able to accurately quantify ambient INP concentrations. In the last decade several instruments have been developed to investigate the ice-nucleating properties of aerosol particles and to measure ambient INP concentrations. Therefore, there is a need for intercomparisons to ensure instrument differences are not interpreted as scientific findings.  In this study, we intercompare the results from parallel measurements using four online ice nucleation chambers. Seven different aerosol types are tested including untreated and acid-treated mineral dusts (microcline, which is a K-feldspar, and kaolinite), as well as birch pollen washing waters. Experiments exploring heterogeneous ice nucleation above and below water saturation are performed to cover the whole range of atmospherically relevant thermodynamic conditions that can be investigated with the intercompared chambers. The Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS) and the Portable Immersion Mode Cooling chAmber coupled to the Portable Ice Nucleation Chamber (PIMCA-PINC) performed measurements in the immersion freezing mode. Additionally, two continuous-flow diffusion chambers (CFDCs) PINC and the Spectrometer for Ice Nuclei (SPIN) are used to perform measurements below and just above water saturation, nominally presenting deposition nucleation and condensation freezing.  The results of LACIS and PIMCA-PINC agree well over the whole range of measured frozen fractions (FFs) and temperature. In general PINC and SPIN compare well and the observed differences are explained by the ice crystal growth and different residence times in the chamber. To study the mechanisms responsible for the ice nucleation in the four instruments, the FF (from LACIS and PIMCA-PINC) and the activated fraction, AF (from PINC and SPIN), are compared. Measured FFs are on the order of a factor of 3 higher than AFs, but are not consistent for all aerosol types and temperatures investigated. It is shown that measurements from CFDCs cannot be assumed to produce the same results as those instruments exclusively measuring immersion freezing. Instead, the need to apply a scaling factor to CFDCs operating above water saturation has to be considered to allow comparison with immersion freezing devices. Our results provide further awareness of factors such as the importance of dispersion methods and the quality of particle size selection for intercomparing online INP counters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000197673",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-11683-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/197673","en","European Geophysical Society",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Leipzig Ice Nucleation chamber Comparison (LINC): Intercomparison of four online ice nucleation counters","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-19T02:06:04Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85030542875","000412245600001","Atmos. chem. phys.","18","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this paper, we examine the transport of carbonaceous aerosols, including black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC), into the monsoon anticyclone using of ECHAM6-HAM, a global aerosol climate model. Further, we investigate impacts of enhanced (doubled) carbonaceous aerosol emissions on the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), underneath monsoon circulation and precipitation from sensitivity simulations.  The model simulation shows that boundary layer aerosols are transported into the monsoon anticyclone by the strong monsoon convection from the Bay of Bengal, southern slopes of the Himalayas and the South China Sea. Doubling of emissions of both BC and OC aerosols over Southeast Asia (10° S–50° N, 65–155° E) shows that lofted aerosols produce significant warming (0.6–1 K) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) near 400–200 hPa and instability in the middle/upper troposphere. These aerosols enhance radiative heating rates (0.02–0.03 K day−1) near the tropopause. The enhanced carbonaceous aerosols alter aerosol radiative forcing (RF) at the surface by −4.74 ± 1.42 W m−2, at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) by +0.37 ± 0.26 W m−2 and in the atmosphere by +5.11 ± 0.83 W m−2 over the TP and Indo-Gangetic Plain region (15–35° N, 80–110° E). Atmospheric warming increases vertical velocities and thereby cloud ice in the upper troposphere. Aerosol induced anomalous warming over the TP facilitates the relative strengthening of the monsoon Hadley circulation and increases moisture inflow by strengthening the cross-equatorial monsoon jet. This increases precipitation amounts over India (1–4 mm day−1) and eastern China (0.2–2 mm day−1). These results are significant at the 99 % confidence level.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000197677",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-11637-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/197677","en","European Geophysical Society",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Potential impact of carbonaceous aerosol on the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) and precipitation during Asian summer monsoon in a global model simulation","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-19T02:06:04Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85030656704","000411884400004","Atmos. chem. phys.","18","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Satellite-based observations of the terrestrial biosphere provide an important reference for detecting and describing the spatiotemporal development of such events. However, in-depth investigations of ecological processes during extreme events require additional in situ observations. The question is whether the density of existing ecological in situ networks is sufficient for analysing the impact of extreme events, and what are expected event detection rates of ecological in situ networks of a given size. To assess these issues, we build a baseline of extreme reductions in the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), identified by a new event detection method tailored to identify extremes of regional relevance. We then investigate the event detection success rates of hypothetical networks of varying sizes. Our results show that large extremes can be reliably detected with relatively small networks, but also reveal a linear decay of detection probabilities towards smaller extreme events in log–log space. For instance, networks with  ≈  100 randomly placed sites in Europe yield a  ≥  90 % chance of detecting the eight largest (typically very large) extreme events; but only a  ≥  50 % chance of capturing the 39 largest events. These findings are consistent with probability-theoretic considerations, but the slopes of the decay rates deviate due to temporal autocorrelation and the exact implementation of the extreme event detection algorithm. Using the examples of AmeriFlux and NEON, we then investigate to what degree ecological in situ networks can capture extreme events of a given size. Consistent with our theoretical considerations, we find that today's systematically designed networks (i.e. NEON) reliably detect the largest extremes, but that the extreme event detection rates are not higher than would be achieved by randomly designed networks. Spatio-temporal expansions of ecological in situ monitoring networks should carefully consider the size distribution characteristics of extreme events if the aim is also to monitor the impacts of such events in the terrestrial biosphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000192472",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-14-4255-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/192472","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Detecting impacts of extreme events with ecological in situ monitoring networks","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T05:08:16Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85029951406","000411587000001",,"18","Biogeosciences","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The IPCC was charged with assessing climate impacts at these temperature levels, but fully coupled equilibrium climate simulations do not currently exist to inform such assessments. In this study, we produce a set of scenarios using a simple model designed to achieve long-term 1.5 and 2 °C temperatures in a stable climate. These scenarios are then used to produce century-scale ensemble simulations using the Community Earth System Model, providing impact-relevant long-term climate data for stabilization pathways at 1.5 and 2 °C levels and an overshoot 1.5 °C case, which are realized (for the 21st century) in the coupled model and are freely available to the community. Here we describe the design of the simulations and a brief overview of their impact-relevant climate response. Exceedance of historical record temperature occurs with 60 % greater frequency in the 2 °C climate than in a 1.5 °C climate aggregated globally, and with twice the frequency in equatorial and arid regions. Extreme precipitation intensity is statistically significantly higher in a 2.0 °C climate than a 1.5 °C climate in some specific regions (but not all). The model exhibits large differences in the Arctic, which is ice-free with a frequency of 1 in 3 years in the 2.0 °C scenario, and 1 in 40 years in the 1.5 °C scenario.

The WSG and WISG have recently been found to over- and underestimate radiation values, respectively (Fehlmann et al., 2012; Gröbner et al., 2014), although research is still ongoing. In view of a possible revision of the reference scales of both standard groups, this study discusses the methods involved and the implications on existing archives of radiation time series, such as the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). Based on PMOD/WRC calibration archives and BSRN data archives, the downward longwave radiation (DLR) time series over the 2006–2015 period were analysed at four stations (polar and mid-latitude locations). DLR was found to increase by up to 3.5 and 5.4 W m−2 for all-sky and clear-sky conditions, respectively, after applying a WISG reference scale correction and a minor correction for the dependence of pyrgeometer sensitivity on atmospheric integrated water vapour content. Similar increases in DLR may be expected at other BSRN stations. Based on our analysis, a number of recommendations are made for future studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000226801",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-10-3057-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/226801","en","Copernicus Publications",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Revising shortwave and longwave radiation archives in view of possible revisions of the WSG and WISG reference scales: methods and implications","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-09T12:15:42Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000408229400003","Atmos. meas. tech.","8","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A full characterization of C cycling requires detailed information on spatiotemporal patterns of surface–atmosphere fluxes. However, relevant C cycle observations are highly variable in their coverage and reporting standards. Especially problematic is the lack of integration of the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange of the ocean, inland freshwaters and the land surface with the atmosphere. Here we adopt a data-driven approach to synthesize a wide range of observation-based spatially explicit surface–atmosphere CO2 fluxes from 2001 to 2010, to identify the state of today's observational opportunities and data limitations. The considered fluxes include net exchange of open oceans, continental shelves, estuaries, rivers, and lakes, as well as CO2 fluxes related to net ecosystem productivity, fire emissions, loss of tropical aboveground C, harvested wood and crops, as well as fossil fuel and cement emissions. Spatially explicit CO2 fluxes are obtained through geostatistical and/or remote-sensing-based upscaling, thereby minimizing biophysical or biogeochemical assumptions encoded in process-based models. We estimate a bottom-up net C exchange (NCE) between the surface (land, ocean, and coastal areas) and the atmosphere. Though we provide also global estimates, the primary goal of this study is to identify key uncertainties and observational shortcomings that need to be prioritized in the expansion of in situ observatories. Uncertainties for NCE and its components are derived using resampling. In many regions, our NCE estimates agree well with independent estimates from other sources such as process-based models and atmospheric inversions. This holds for Europe (mean ± 1 SD: 0.8 ± 0.1 PgC yr−1, positive numbers are sources to the atmosphere), Russia (0.1 ± 0.4 PgC yr−1), East Asia (1.6 ± 0.3 PgC yr−1), South Asia (0.3 ± 0.1 PgC yr−1), Australia (0.2 ± 0.3 PgC yr−1), and most of the Ocean regions. Our NCE estimates give a likely too large CO2 sink in tropical areas such as the Amazon, Congo, and Indonesia. Overall, and because of the overestimated CO2 uptake in tropical lands, our global bottom-up NCE amounts to a net sink of −5.4 ± 2.0 PgC yr−1. By contrast, the accurately measured mean atmospheric growth rate of CO2 over 2001–2010 indicates that the true value of NCE is a net CO2 source of 4.3 ± 0.1 PgC yr−1. This mismatch of nearly 10 PgC yr−1 highlights observational gaps and limitations of data-driven models in tropical lands, but also in North America. Our uncertainty assessment provides the basis for setting priority regions where to increase carbon observations in the future. High on the priority list are tropical land regions, which suffer from a lack of in situ observations. Second, extensive pCO2 data are missing in the Southern Ocean. Third, we lack observations that could enable seasonal estimates of shelf, estuary, and inland water–atmosphere C exchange. Our consistent derivation of data uncertainties could serve as prior knowledge in multicriteria optimization such as the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS) and atmospheric inversions, without over- or under-stating bottom-up data credibility. In the future, NCE estimates of carbon sinks could be aggregated at national scale to compare with the official national inventories of CO2 fluxes in the land use, land use change, and forestry sector, upon which future emission reductions are proposed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000192415",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-14-3685-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/192415","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Reviews and syntheses: An empirical spatiotemporal description of the global surface-atmosphere carbon fluxes: Opportunities and data limitations","Review Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::560 - Paleontology, paleozoology","2017-10-06T05:02:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85027245233","000407380600001",,"15","Biogeosciences","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To identify important gaps in our knowledge of ice nucleation processes and their impacts, two international workshops on ice nucleation were held in Vienna, Austria in 2015 and 2016. Experts from these workshops identified the following research needs: (1) uncovering the molecular identity of active sites for ice nucleation; (2) the importance of modeling for the understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation; (3) identifying and quantifying contributions of biological ice nuclei from natural and managed environments; (4) examining the role of aging in ice nuclei; (5) conducting targeted sampling campaigns in clouds; and (6) designing lab and field experiments to increase our understanding of the role of ice-nucleating particles in the atmosphere. Interdisciplinary teams of scientists should work together to establish and maintain a common, unified language for ice nucleation research. A number of commercial applications benefit from ice nucleation research, including the production of artificial snow, the freezing and preservation of water-containing food products, and the potential modulation of weather. Additional work is needed to increase our understanding of ice nucleation processes and potential impacts on precipitation, water availability, climate change, crop health, and feedback cycles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191806",,"2073-4433",,"10.3390/atmos8080138","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191806","en","MDPI",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","INM||IN||ice nucleation||nucleation sites||crystal||aging||water||precipitation||INP||cloud glaciation","Perspectives on the Future of Ice Nucleation Research: Research Needs and Unanswered Questions Identified from Two International Workshops","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:42:52Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85027460190","000408757800023",,"8","Atmosphere","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We show that when accounting for seasonal cycles of both temperature and precipitation, it is impossible to find good analogs for projections at many places across the world. For substantial land fractions, primarily in the tropics and subtropics, there are no analogs anywhere with current seasonal cycles of temperature and precipitation matching their projected future conditions. This implies that these places experience the emergence of novel climates. For 1.5 °C global warming about 15% and for 2 °C warming about 21% of the global land is projected to experience novel climates, whereas for a 4 °C warming the corresponding novel climates may emerge on more than a third of the global land fraction. Similar fractions of today's climates, mainly found in the tropics, subtropics and polar north, are anticipated to disappear in the future. Note that the exact quantification of the land fraction is sensitive to the threshold selection. Novel and disappearing climates may have serious consequences for impacts that are sensitive to the full seasonal cycle of temperature and precipitation. For individual seasons, however, spatial analogs may still be a powerful tool for climate change communication.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190378",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aa75d7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190378","en","IOP Publishing",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","climate change communication||spatial climate analogs||novel and disappearing climates","Future local climate unlike currently observed anywhere","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:02:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85029186318","000406139000004","Environ.

In a process-based comparison of two aerosol and chemistry schemes within the regional atmospheric modeling framework COSMO-ART (Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling, Aersosol and Reactive Trace gases extension), we identify key sensitivities of aerosol parameterizations. We consider the aerosol module MADE (Modal Aerosol Dynamics model for Europe) in combination with full gas-phase chemistry and the aerosol module M7 in combination with a constant-oxidant-field-based sulfur cycle. For a Saharan dust outbreak reaching Europe, modeled aerosol populations are more sensitive to structural differences between the schemes, in particular the consideration of aqueous-phase sulfate production, the selection of aerosol species and modes, and modal composition, than to parametric choices like modal standard deviation and the parameterization of aerosol dynamics. The same observation applies to aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Differences in the concentrations of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are masked by uncertainties between two ice-nucleation parameterizations and their coupling to the aerosol scheme. Differences in cloud droplet and ice crystal number concentrations are buffered by cloud microphysics as we show in a susceptibility analysis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191366",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-8651-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191366","en","Copernicus GmbH",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"A comparison of two chemistry and aerosol schemes on the regional scale and the resulting impact on radiative properties and liquid- and ice-phase aerosol-cloud interactions","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:09:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85024902745","000405649900002","Atmos. chem. phys.","14","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Crop yields vary with climate and it is important to understand how climate and crop yields are linked to ensure future food security. Temperature and precipitation are among the key driving factors of crop yield variability. Previous studies have investigated mostly linear relationships between temperature and precipitation and crop yield variability. Other research has highlighted the adverse impacts of climate extremes, such as drought and heat waves, on crop yields. Impacts are, however, often non-linearly related to multivariate climate conditions. Here we derive bivariate return periods of climate conditions as indicators for climate variability along different temperature–precipitation gradients. We show that in Europe, linear models based on bivariate return periods of specific climate conditions explain on average significantly more crop yield variability (42 %) than models relying directly on temperature and precipitation as predictors (36 %). Our results demonstrate that most often crop yields increase along a gradient from hot and dry to cold and wet conditions, with lower yields associated with hot and dry periods. The majority of crops are most sensitive to climate conditions in summer and to maximum temperatures. The use of bivariate return periods allows the integration of non-linear impacts into climate–crop yield analysis. This offers new avenues to study the link between climate and crop yield variability and suggests that they are possibly more strongly related than what is inferred from conventional linear models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190400",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-14-3309-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190400","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Bivariate return periods of temperature and precipitation explain a large fraction of European crop yields","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:02:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85023180890","000405376200001",,"13","Biogeosciences","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The focus of these studies is on kinetic limitations of hygroscopic growth and the plasticizing effect of water. In contrast, much less is known about diffusion limitations of organic molecules and oxidants in viscous matrices. These may affect atmospheric chemistry and gas–particle partitioning of complex mixtures with constituents of different volatility. In this study, we quantify the diffusivity of a volatile organic in a viscous matrix. Evaporation of single particles generated from an aqueous solution of sucrose and small amounts of volatile tetraethylene glycol (PEG-4) is investigated in an electrodynamic balance at controlled relative humidity (RH) and temperature. The evaporative loss of PEG-4 as determined by Mie resonance spectroscopy is used in conjunction with a radially resolved diffusion model to retrieve translational diffusion coefficients of PEG-4. Comparison of the experimentally derived diffusivities with viscosity estimates for the ternary system reveals a breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relationship, which has often been invoked to infer diffusivity from viscosity. The evaporation of PEG-4 shows pronounced RH and temperature dependencies and is severely depressed for RH ≲ 30 %, corresponding to diffusivities < 10−14 cm2 s−1 at temperatures < 15 °C. The temperature dependence is strong, suggesting a diffusion activation energy of about 300 kJ mol−1. We conclude that atmospheric volatile organic compounds can be subject to severe diffusion limitations in viscous organic aerosol particles. This may enable an important long-range transport mechanism for organic material, including pollutant molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190334",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-8453-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190334","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Diffusivity measurements of volatile organics in levitated viscous aerosol particles","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T01:59:30Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,"Physical states of mixed organic-inorganic aerosols","146760","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,,"85023754676","000405372800005","Atmos. chem. phys.","13","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Every year, intense nighttime thunderstorms cause numerous boating accidents on the lake, resulting in thousands of deaths among fishermen. Operational storm warning systems are therefore crucial. Here we complement ongoing early warning efforts based on numerical weather prediction, by presenting a new satellite data-driven storm prediction system, the prototype Lake Victoria Intense storm Early Warning System (VIEWS). VIEWS derives predictability from the correlation between afternoon land storm activity and nighttime storm intensity on Lake Victoria, and relies on logistic regression techniques to forecast extreme thunderstorms from satellite observations. Evaluation of the statistical model reveals that predictive power is high and independent of the type of input dataset. We then optimise the configuration and show that false alarms also contain valuable information. Our results suggest that regression-based models that are motivated through process understanding have the potential to reduce the vulnerability of local fishing communities around Lake Victoria.

The algorithm was developed to address the inverse modelling problems associated with fitting large sets of model input parameters encountered in state-of-the-art kinetic models for heterogeneous and multiphase atmospheric chemistry. The MCGA approach utilizes a sequence of optimization methods to find and characterize the solution of an optimization problem. It addresses an issue inherent to complex models whose extensive input parameter sets may not be uniquely determined from limited input data. Such ambiguity in the derived parameter values can be reliably detected using this new set of tools, allowing users to design experiments that should be particularly useful for constraining model parameters. We show that the MCGA has been used successfully to constrain parameters such as chemical reaction rate coefficients, diffusion coefficients, and Henry's law solubility coefficients in kinetic models of gas uptake and chemical transformation of aerosol particles as well as multiphase chemistry at the atmosphere–biosphere interface. While this study focuses on the processes outlined above, the MCGA approach should be portable to any numerical process model with similar computational expense and extent of the fitting parameter space.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191761",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-8021-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191761","en","Copernicus Publications",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Technical note: Monte Carlo genetic algorithm (MCGA) for model analysis of multiphase chemical kinetics to determine transport and reaction rate coefficients using multiple experimental data sets","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:38:15Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85022229125","000404771300009","Atmos. chem. phys.","12","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The method exploits information relating to the climatological mean state of a number of projection-relevant variables as well as metrics representing long-term statistics of weather extremes. The weights, once computed can be used to simply compute weighted means and significance information from an ensemble containing multiple initial condition members from potentially co-dependent models of varying skill. Two parameters in the algorithm determine the degree to which model climatological skill and model uniqueness are rewarded; these parameters are explored and final values are defended for the assessment. The influence of model weighting on projected temperature and precipitation changes is found to be moderate, partly due to a compensating effect between model skill and uniqueness. However, more aggressive skill weighting and weighting by targeted metrics is found to have a more significant effect on inferred ensemble confidence in future patterns of change for a given projection.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191237",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-10-2379-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191237","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Skill and independence weighting for multi-model assessments","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:59:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85021660194","000404485200001","Geosci. model dev.","6","Geoscientific Model Development","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Our results demonstrate how the dependence structure between variables affects the occurrence frequency of multivariate extremes. Assessments based on univariate statistics can thus strongly underestimate risks associated with given extremes, if impacts depend on multiple (dependent) variables.

In addition, the central terms underlying the bulk mass-flux parametrization of CMT are evaluated offline. Further, the uncertainties related to the representation of CMT are explored by running the stochastically perturbed parametrizations (SPP) approach of the IFS. The analyzed cases exhibit shallow convective clouds developing within considerable low-level wind shear. Analysis of the momentum fluxes in the LES data reveals significant momentum transport by the convection in both cases, which is directed downgradient despite substantial organization of the cloud field. A detailed inspection of the convection parametrization reveals a very good representation of the entrainment and detrainment rates and an appropriate representation of the convective mass and momentum fluxes. To determine the correct values of mass-flux and in-cloud momentum at the cloud base in the parametrization yet remains challenging. The spread in convection-related quantities generated by the SPP is reasonable and addresses many of the identified uncertainties.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190715",,"1942-2466",,"10.1002/2017MS000915","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190715","en","American Geophysical Union",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Uncertainties related to the representation of momentum transport in shallow convection","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:22:43Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85019957620","000406239300029",,"2","Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They include a strengthening and poleward contraction of the westerly atmospheric circulation over the Southern extratropics, i.e. a strengthening Southern Annular Mode (SAM), in austral spring and summer. Associated effects on extratropical temperature and precipitation and more recently subtropical precipitation have been documented and are understood in a zonal mean framework. We present zonally asymmetric effects of ozone depletion that reach into the tropics and affect atmospheric circulation and precipitation, including the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), the most important rainband of the Southern Hemisphere. Using observation-based analyses and model simulations we show that over the 1961–1996 period, ozone depletion led to increased precipitation at the northern flank of the SPCZ and to decreased precipitation to the south. The effects originate from a flow pattern over the southwestern Pacific that extends equatorward and alters the propagation of synoptic waves and thus the position of the SPCZ. Model simulations suggest that anticipated stratospheric ozone recovery over the next decades will reverse these effects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191729",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aa7416","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191729","en","Institute of Physics",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","southern annular mode||chemistry-climate modeling||ozone depletion||South Pacific convergence zone","Tropical circulation and precipitation response to ozone depletion and recovery","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:34:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85021269933","000403502300002","Environ.

This coupled behaviour causes various land–atmosphere feedbacks, and an insufficient understanding of these feedbacks contributes to uncertain global climate model projections. For example, a crucial role of the land surface in exacerbating summer heat waves in midlatitude regions has been identified empirically for high-impact heat waves, but individual climate models differ widely in their respective representation of land–atmosphere coupling. Here, we compile an ensemble of 54 combinations of observations-based temperature (T) and evapotranspiration (ET) benchmarking datasets and investigate coincidences of T anomalies with ET anomalies as a proxy for land–atmosphere interactions during periods of anomalously warm temperatures. First, we demonstrate that a large fraction of state-of-the-art climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) archive produces systematically too frequent coincidences of high T anomalies with negative ET anomalies in midlatitude regions during the warm season and in several tropical regions year-round. These coincidences (high T, low ET) are closely related to the representation of temperature variability and extremes across the multi-model ensemble. Second, we derive a land-coupling constraint based on the spread of the T–ET datasets and consequently retain only a subset of CMIP5 models that produce a land-coupling behaviour that is compatible with these benchmark estimates. The constrained multi-model simulations exhibit more realistic temperature extremes of reduced magnitude in present climate in regions where models show substantial spread in T–ET coupling, i.e. biases in the model ensemble are consistently reduced. Also the multi-model simulations for the coming decades display decreased absolute temperature extremes in the constrained ensemble. On the other hand, the differences between projected and present-day climate extremes are affected to a lesser extent by the applied constraint, i.e. projected changes are reduced locally by around 0.5 to 1 °C – but this remains a local effect in regions that are highly sensitive to land–atmosphere coupling. In summary, our approach offers a physically consistent, diagnostic-based avenue to evaluate multi-model ensembles and subsequently reduce model biases in simulated and projected extreme temperatures.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190728",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-8-387-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190728","en","Copernicus Publications",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Refining multi-model projections of temperature extremes by evaluation against land-atmosphere coupling diagnostics","Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2017-10-06T02:25:35Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85019974403","000402418100001",,"2","Earth System Dynamics","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Wave breaking may be enhanced by warm conveyor belts (WCBs) associated with extratropical cyclones developing over the Atlantic Ocean. More precisely, WCBs supply the upper troposphere with air masses of low potential vorticity that, in turn, amplify ridges and thus favor Rossby wave breaking. This study identifies the mechanism that connects Atlantic cyclones and intense mature Mediterranean cyclones through ridge amplification by WCBs, and validates its climatological relevance. Using European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA‐Interim reanalyses and a feature‐based approach, we analyze the 200 most intense Mediterranean cyclones for the years 1989–2008 and show that their majority (181 cases) is indeed associated with this mechanism upstream. Results show that multiple Atlantic cyclones are associated with each case of intense Mediterranean cyclone downstream. Moreover, the associated Atlantic cyclones are particularly deeply intensifying compared with climatology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000130780",,,,"10.1002/asl.745","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/130780","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Cyclogenesis||Ridge amplification||Trajectories||Warm conveyor belt","A dynamical link between deep Atlantic extratropical cyclones and intense Mediterranean cyclones","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T21:01:11Z",,,,"pub:193811",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936556ebf0c473768","004008028",,"85017616629","000400783000003",,"5","Atmospheric Science Letters","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the processes that are responsible for this pattern are not fully understood. We here employ an extended surrogate or pseudo-warming approach to disentangle the contribution of different mechanisms to this response pattern. The basic idea of the surrogate technique is to use a regional climate model and apply a large-scale warming to the lateral boundary conditions of a present-day reference simulation, while maintaining the relative humidity (and thus implicitly increasing the specific moisture content). In comparison to previous studies, our approach includes two important extensions: first, different vertical warming profiles are applied in order to separate the effects of a mean warming from lapse-rate effects. Second, a twin-design is used, in which the climate change signals are not only added to present-day conditions, but also subtracted from a scenario experiment. We demonstrate that these extensions provide an elegant way to separate the full climate change signal into contributions from large-scale thermodynamic (TD), lapse-rate (LR), and circulation and other remaining effects (CO). The latter in particular include changes in land-ocean contrast and spatial variations of the SST warming patterns. We find that the TD effect yields a large-scale warming across Europe with no distinct latitudinal gradient. The LR effect, which is quantified for the first time in our study, leads to a stronger warming and some drying in southern Europe. It explains about 50 % of the warming amplification over the Iberian Peninsula, thus demonstrating the important role of lapse-rate changes. The effect is linked to an extending Hadley circulation. The CO effect as inherited from the driving GCM is shown to further amplify the north-south temperature change gradient. In terms of mean summer precipitation the TD effect leads to a significant overall increase in precipitation all across Europe, which is compensated and regionally reversed by the LR and CO effects in particular in southern Europe.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000118908",,"0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-016-3276-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/118908","en","Springer",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Surrogate climate change||Regional climate modelling||Thermodynamic effects||Lapse-rate effects||Circulation effects","Separating climate change signals into thermodynamic, lapse-rate and circulation effects: theory and application to the European summer climate","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T10:07:23Z",,,,"pub:180894",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654965224469211","000036174",,"84979707979","000399431900035","Clim Dyn","8","Climate Dynamics","48","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Those elevated GHG concentrations warm the planet and – partially offset by net cooling effects by aerosols – are largely responsible for the observed warming over the past 150 years. An accurate representation of GHG concentrations is hence important to understand and model recent climate change. So far, community efforts to create composite datasets of GHG concentrations with seasonal and latitudinal information have focused on marine boundary layer conditions and recent trends since the 1980s. Here, we provide consolidated datasets of historical atmospheric concentrations (mole fractions) of 43 GHGs to be used in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project – Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiments. The presented datasets are based on AGAGE and NOAA networks, firn and ice core data, and archived air data, and a large set of published studies. In contrast to previous intercomparisons, the new datasets are latitudinally resolved and include seasonality. We focus on the period 1850–2014 for historical CMIP6 runs, but data are also provided for the last 2000 years. We provide consolidated datasets in various spatiotemporal resolutions for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as 40 other GHGs, namely 17 ozone-depleting substances, 11 hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 9 perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2). In addition, we provide three equivalence species that aggregate concentrations of GHGs other than CO2, CH4 and N2O, weighted by their radiative forcing efficiencies. For the year 1850, which is used for pre-industrial control runs, we estimate annual global-mean surface concentrations of CO2 at 284.3 ppm, CH4 at 808.2 ppb and N2O at 273.0 ppb. The data are available at https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/input4mips/ and http://www.climatecollege.unimelb.edu.au/cmip6. While the minimum CMIP6 recommendation is to use the global- and annual-mean time series, modelling groups can also choose our monthly and latitudinally resolved concentrations, which imply a stronger radiative forcing in the Northern Hemisphere winter (due to the latitudinal gradient and seasonality).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191830",,"1991-9603||1991-959X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191830||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/204836","10.5194/gmd-10-2057-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/205639","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Historical greenhouse gas concentrations for climate modelling (CMIP6)","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:42:52Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85020214855","000402419000002","Geosci. model dev.",,"Geoscientific Model Development","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Few observational studies have focused on dust–MSc interactions, and thus this effect remains poorly quantified. We use observations from multiple sensors in the NASA A-Train satellite constellation from 2004 to 2012 to obtain estimates of the aerosol–cloud radiative effect, including its uncertainty, of dust aerosol influencing Atlantic MSc off the coast of northern Africa between 45° W and 15° E and between 0 and 35° N. To calculate the aerosol–cloud radiative effect, we use two methods following Quaas et al. (2008) (Method 1) and Chen et al. (2014) (Method 2). These two methods yield similar results of −1.5 ± 1.4 and −1.5 ± 1.6 W m−2, respectively, for the annual mean aerosol–cloud radiative effect. Thus, Saharan dust modifies MSc in a way that acts to cool the planet. There is a strong seasonal variation, with the aerosol–cloud radiative effect switching from significantly negative during the boreal summer to weakly positive during boreal winter. Method 1 (Method 2) yields −3.8 ± 2.5 (−4.3 ± 4.1) during summer and 1 ± 2.9 (0.6 ± 1) W m−2 during winter. In Method 1, the aerosol–cloud radiative effect can be decomposed into two terms, one representing the first aerosol indirect effect and the second representing the combination of the second aerosol indirect effect and the semidirect effect (i.e., changes in liquid water path and cloud fraction in response to changes in absorbing aerosols and local heating). The first aerosol indirect effect is relatively small, varying from −0.7 ± 0.6 in summer to 0.1 ± 0.5 W m−2 in winter. The second term, however, dominates the overall radiative effect, varying from −3.2 ± 2.5 in summer to 0.9 ± 2.9 W m−2 during winter. Studies show that the semidirect effect can result in a negative (i.e., absorbing aerosol lies above low clouds like MSc) or positive (i.e., absorbing aerosol lies within low clouds) aerosol–cloud radiative effect. The semipermanent MSc are low and confined within the boundary layer. CALIPSO shows that 61.8 ± 12.6 % of Saharan dust resides above North Atlantic MSc during summer for our study area. This is consistent with a relatively weak first aerosol indirect effect and also suggests the second aerosol indirect effect plus semidirect effect (the second term in Method 1) is dominated by the semidirect effect. In contrast, the percentage of Saharan dust above North Atlantic MSc in winter is 11.9 ± 10.9 %, which is much lower than in summer. CALIPSO also shows that 88.3 ± 8.5 % of dust resides below 2.2 km the winter average of MSc top height. During summer, however, there are two peaks, with 35.6 ± 13 % below 1.9 km (summer average of MSc top height) and 44.4 ± 9.2 % between 2 and 4 km. Because the aerosol–cloud radiative effect is positive during winter, and is also dominated by the second term, this again supports the importance of the semidirect effect. We conclude that Saharan dust–MSc interactions off the coast of northern Africa are likely dominated by the semidirect effect.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190844",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-6305-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190844","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Impact of Saharan dust on North Atlantic marine stratocumulus clouds: importance of the semidirect effect","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:32:46Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85019724220","000401923600001","Atmos. chem. phys.","10","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Therefore, it is important to understand their life cycles and identify processes that are responsible for their favoured occurrence, persistence or transition. Recent studies have shown that convectively active phases of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) in the tropics impact and control part of the distribution and sequences of the daily weather regimes defined over the North Atlantic-European region. Thereby, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific-North American teleconnection pattern (PNA), and the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex modulate the background states through which the MJO and its global response patterns propagate during Northern Hemisphere winter. Within this thesis, we here present how the frequency of defined Atlantic-European weather regime occurrences is modulated following an MJO activity. The lagged relationship between active MJO episodes and weather regime occurrences is explored for 37 extended winters from 1979 to present. We examined for unmodulated and modulated background states the potential predictability, focusing separately on the influence of ENSO, PNA and the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex. The results indicate that the lagged relationship between the MJO phases and the weather regimes strongly differs during different states of ENSO, PNA and the stratospheric circulation. Hence, the European response to MJO activity substantially changes with a varying background state. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering both the MJO activity in its phase and the concurrent low frequency forcings to determine the statistically expected regime frequency due to a MJO event.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000238793",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/238793","en","ETH Zurich",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Madden-Julian oscillation, weather regimes, NAO, ENSO, teleconnection","The Connection between the Madden-Julian Oscillation and European Weather Regimes and its Modulation by low frequency Forcings","Master Thesis","Open access",,,"2018-02-05T14:39:29Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Simultaneously, a remarkable and widespread growing season greening was observed over most of the NH in the record from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). While the response of vegetation to climate change (i.e. the long term trend) is assumed to be predictable, it is still unclear whether it is also possible to predict the interannual variability in vegetation activity.  Here, we evaluate whether the unprecedented magnitude and extent of the greening observed in 2015 corresponds to an expected response to the 2015 climate anomaly, or to a change in the sensitivity of NH vegetation to climate. We decompose NDVI into the long-term and interannual variability components, and find that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) explain about half of NDVI interannual variability. This response is in addition to the long-term temperature and human-induced greening trend. We use a simple statistical approach to predict the NDVI anomaly in 2015, using the PDO and AMO states as predictors for interannual variability, and temperature and precipitation trends for the long-term component.  We show that the 2015 anomaly can be predicted as an expected vegetation response to temperature and water-availability associated with the very strong state of the PDO in 2015. The link found between climate variability patterns and vegetation activity should contribute to increase the predictability of carbon-cycle processes at interannual time-scales, which may be relevant, for instance, for optimizing land-management strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191677",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aa67b5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191677","en","IOP Publishing",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","NDVI||climate variability||MODIS||PDO||AMO","Was the extreme Northern Hemisphere greening in 2015 predictable?","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:31:07Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85018505080","000399285900001","Environ.

We examine short- (13 yr) and long-term (56 yr) heatwave frequency trends in a 21‐member ensemble of a global climate model (Community Earth System Model; CESM), where each member is driven by identical anthropogenic forcings. To estimate changes dominantly due to internal climate variability, trends were calculated in the corresponding pre-industrial control run. We find that short-term trends in heatwave frequency are not robust indicators of long-term change. Additionally, we find that a lack of a long-term trend is possible, although improbable, under historical anthropogenic forcing over many regions. All long-term trends become unprecedented against internal variability when commencing in 2015 or later, and corresponding short-term trends by 2030, while the length of trend required to represent regional long-term changes is dependent on a given realization. Lastly, within ten years of a short-term decline, 95% of regional heatwave frequency trends have reverted to increases. This suggests that observed short-term changes of decreasing heatwave frequency could recover to increasing trends within the next decade. The results of this study are specific to CESM and the 'business as usual' scenario, and may differ under other representations of internal variability, or be less striking when a scenario with lower anthropogenic forcing is employed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000130380",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aa63fe","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/130380","en","Institute of Physics",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Heatwaves||Internal variability||Trends||Observations||Model projections||Global||Regional","The influence of internal climate variability on heatwave frequency trends","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:50:08Z",,,,"pub:193386",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365567501ab76203","005253059",,"85018520642","000397804000005","Environ.

Here we examine and compare two well-established methods to determine evapotranspiration at the site level: lysimeter-based measurements (EL) and eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements (EEC). The analyses are based on parallel measurements carried out with these two methods at the research catchment Rietholzbach in northeastern Switzerland, and cover the time period of June 2009 to December 2015. The measurements are compared on various timescales, and with respect to a 40-year lysimeter-based evapotranspiration time series. Overall, the lysimeter and EC measurements agree well, especially on the annual timescale. On that timescale, the long-term lysimeter measurements also correspond well with catchment water-balance estimates of evapotranspiration. This highlights the representativeness of the site-level lysimeter and EC measurements for the entire catchment despite their comparatively small source areas and the heterogeneous land use and topography within the catchment. Furthermore, we identify that lack of reliable EC measurements using open-path gas analyzers during and following precipitation events (due to limitations of the measurement technique under these conditions) significantly contributes to an underestimation of EEC and to the overall energy balance gap at the site.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000129864",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-21-1809-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/129864","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"A site-level comparison of lysimeter and eddy covariance flux measurements of evapotranspiration","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:33:38Z",,,,"pub:192854",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936555d1284d62779",,,"85016516748","000402919900002","Hydrol.

Here we present a systematic analysis of the impact such an extreme event can have on the Earth’s atmosphere. Using state-of-the-art cosmic ray cascade and chemistry-climate models, we successfully reproduce the observed variability of cosmogenic isotope 10Be, around 775 AD, in four ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, thereby validating the models in the assessment of this event. We add to prior conclusions that any nitrate deposition signal from SEP events remains too weak to be detected in ice cores by showing that, even for such an extreme solar storm and sub-annual data resolution, the nitrate deposition signal is indistinguishable from the seasonal cycle. We show that such a severe event is able to perturb the polar stratosphere for at least one year, leading to regional changes in the surface temperature during northern hemisphere winters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000130016",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/srep45257","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/130016","en","Nature Publishing Group",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Atmospheric chemistry||Atmospheric dynamics||Natural hazards||Palaeoclimate","Atmospheric impacts of the strongest known solar particle storm of 775 AD","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:37:20Z",,,,"pub:193017",,"yes",,,,"Future and Past Solar Influence on the Terrestrial","130642","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Sinergia",,"imp59365560238ec32307","006751867",,"85016322149","000397535200001","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we present a straightforward weighting scheme that accounts both for the large differences in model performance and for model interdependencies, and we test reliability in a perfect model setup. We provide weighted multimodel projections of Arctic sea ice and temperature as a case study to demonstrate that, for some questions at least, it is meaningless to treat all models equally. The constrained ensemble shows reduced spread and a more rapid sea ice decline than the unweighted ensemble. We argue that the growing number of models with different characteristics and considerable interdependence finally justifies abandoning strict model democracy, and we provide guidance on when and how this can be achieved robustly.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000129180",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1002/2016GL072012","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/129180","en","American Geophysical Union",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"A climate model projection weighting scheme accounting for performance and interdependence","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:12:19Z",,,,"pub:192140",,"yes",,,,"Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach","641816","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,"imp593655509795121627","010841505",,"85013444319","000396411100036","Geophys.

In its classical description, the growth of the ice phase requires the emergence of a critical embryo from random fluctuations of water molecules between the water bulk and ice-like clusters, which is associated with overcoming an energy barrier. For heterogeneous ice nucleation on ice-nucleating surfaces both stochastic and deterministic descriptions are in use. Deterministic (singular) descriptions are often favored because the temperature dependence of ice nucleation on a substrate usually dominates the stochastic time dependence, and the ease of representation facilitates the incorporation in climate models. Conversely, classical nucleation theory (CNT) describes heterogeneous ice nucleation as a stochastic process with a reduced energy barrier for the formation of a critical embryo in the presence of an ice-nucleating surface. The energy reduction is conveniently parameterized in terms of a contact angle α between the ice phase immersed in liquid water and the heterogeneous surface. This study investigates various ice-nucleating agents in immersion mode by subjecting them to repeated freezing cycles to elucidate and discriminate the time and temperature dependences of heterogeneous ice nucleation. Freezing rates determined from such refreeze experiments are presented for Hoggar Mountain dust, birch pollen washing water, Arizona test dust (ATD), and also nonadecanol coatings. For the analysis of the experimental data with CNT, we assumed the same active site to be always responsible for freezing. Three different CNT-based parameterizations were used to describe rate coefficients for heterogeneous ice nucleation as a function of temperature, all leading to very similar results: for Hoggar Mountain dust, ATD, and larger nonadecanol-coated water droplets, the experimentally determined increase in freezing rate with decreasing temperature is too shallow to be described properly by CNT using the contact angle α as the only fit parameter. Conversely, birch pollen washing water and small nonadecanol-coated water droplets show temperature dependencies of freezing rates steeper than predicted by all three CNT parameterizations. Good agreement of observations and calculations can be obtained when a pre-factor β is introduced to the rate coefficient as a second fit parameter. Thus, the following microphysical picture emerges: heterogeneous freezing occurs at ice-nucleating sites that need a minimum (critical) surface area to host embryos of critical size to grow into a crystal. Fits based on CNT suggest that the critical active site area is in the range of 10–50nm2, with the exact value depending on sample, temperature, and CNT-based parameterization. Two fitting parameters are needed to characterize individual active sites. The contact angle α lowers the energy barrier that has to be overcome to form the critical embryo at the site compared to the homogeneous case where the critical embryo develops in the volume of water. The pre-factor β is needed to adjust the calculated slope of freezing rate increase with temperature decrease. When this slope is steep, this can be interpreted as a high frequency of nucleation attempts, so that nucleation occurs immediately when the temperature is low enough for the active site to accommodate a critical embryo. This is the case for active sites of birch pollen washing water and for small droplets coated with nonadecanol. If the pre-factor is low, the frequency of nucleation attempts is low and the increase in freezing rate with decreasing temperature is shallow. This is the case for Hoggar Mountain dust, the large droplets coated with nonadecanol, and ATD. Various hypotheses why the value of the pre-factor depends on the nature of the active sites are discussed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000130207",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-3525-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/130207","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Refreeze experiments with water droplets containing different types of ice nuclei interpreted by classical nucleation theory","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:43:42Z",,,,"pub:193210",,"yes",,,,"Ice Freezing on Clay Minerals (IFClaM)","138039","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,"imp59365563e18fb42672",,,"85015370419","000397827900003","Atmos. chem. phys.","5","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The research usefulness of such projects is dependent on applying simple and standardized methods. Here, we conducted a citizen science project that involved more than 3500 Swedish high school students to examine the temperature difference between surface water and the overlying air (Tw-Ta) as a proxy for sensible heat flux (QH). If QH is directed upward, corresponding to positive Tw-Ta, it can enhance CO2 and CH4 emissions from inland waters, thereby contributing to increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. The students found mostly negative Tw-Ta across small ponds, lakes, streams/rivers and the sea shore (i.e. downward QH), with Tw-Ta becoming increasingly negative with increasing Ta. Further examination of Tw-Ta using high-frequency temperature data from inland waters across the globe confirmed that Tw-Ta is linearly related to Ta. Using the longest available high-frequency temperature time series from Lake Erken, Sweden, we found a rapid increase in the occasions of negative Tw-Ta with increasing annual mean Ta since 1989. From these results, we can expect that ongoing and projected global warming will result in increasingly negative Tw-Ta, thereby reducing CO2 and CH4 transfer velocities from inland waters into the atmosphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000129744",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/srep43890","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/129744","en","Nature Publishing Group",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate-change impacts||Carbon cycle","Citizen science shows systematic changes in the temperature difference between air and inland waters with global warming","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:30:18Z",,,,"pub:192729",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936555ac898590229","006751867",,"85014683244","000395736900001","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Regional climate signals at specific global warming levels, and especially the differences between 1.5°C and 2°C, are not well constrained, however. In particular, methodological challenges related to the assessment of such differences have received limited attention. This article reviews alternative approaches for identifying regional climate signals associated with global temperature limits, and evaluates the extent to which they constitute a sound basis for impacts analysis. Four methods are outlined, including comparing data from different greenhouse gas scenarios, sub-selecting climate models based on global temperature response, pattern scaling, and extracting anomalies at the time of each global temperature increment. These methods have rarely been applied to compare 2°C with 1.5°C, but some demonstrate potential avenues for useful research. Nevertheless, there are methodological challenges associated with the use of existing climate model experiments, which are generally designed to model responses to different levels of greenhouse gas forcing, rather than to model climate responses to a specific level of forcing that targets a given level of global temperature change. Novel approaches may be required to address policy questions, in particular: to differentiate between half degree warming increments while accounting for different sources of uncertainty; to examine mechanisms of regional climate change including the potential for nonlinear responses; and to explore the relevance of time-lagged processes in the climate system and declining emissions, and the resulting sensitivity to alternative mitigation pathways.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000128813",,"1757-7780||1757-7799","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128813||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/226894","10.1002/wcc.457","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/233655","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Characterizing half-a-degree difference: a review of methods for identifying regional climate responses to global warming targets","Review Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T19:59:40Z",,,,"pub:191741",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365548adaf544004","007428737",,"85012975511","000397287800009","Wiley interdiscip. rev. , Clim. chang.","2","Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews.

Recently, aerosol effects on stratiform MPCs have also been considered in global climate models. The estimated effective aerosol radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud and aerosol-radiation interactions (ERFaci + ari) at the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) in stratiform warm and MPCs, which is an update of the estimate given in the fifth assessment report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change, is −1.2 W m−2 with a 5–95 % range between −0.8 and −2.0 W m−2. Since AR5, only one new estimate of ERFaci+ari including aerosol effects on both stratiform and convective clouds of −1.4 W m−2 has been published.

The models included in the comparison are the 3-D chemistry transport model 3dCTM, the ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model, FinROSE, the Hamburg Model of the Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere (HAMMONIA), the Karlsruhe Simulation Model of the Middle Atmosphere (KASIMA), the modelling tools for SOlar Climate Ozone Links studies (SOCOL and CAO-SOCOL), and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM4). The comparison focuses on the energetic particle precipitation (EPP) indirect effect, that is, the polar winter descent of NOx largely produced by EPP in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. A particular emphasis is given to the impact of the sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) in January 2009 and the subsequent elevated stratopause (ES) event associated with enhanced descent of mesospheric air. The chemistry climate model simulations have been nudged toward reanalysis data in the troposphere and stratosphere while being unconstrained above. An odd nitrogen upper boundary condition obtained from MIPAS observations has further been applied to medium-top models. Most models provide a good representation of the mesospheric tracer descent in general, and the EPP indirect effect in particular, during the unperturbed (pre-SSW) period of the NH winter 2008/2009. The observed NOx descent into the lower mesosphere and stratosphere is generally reproduced within 20 %. Larger discrepancies of a few model simulations could be traced back either to the impact of the models' gravity wave drag scheme on the polar wintertime meridional circulation or to a combination of prescribed NOx mixing ratio at the uppermost model layer and low vertical resolution. In March–April, after the ES event, however, modelled mesospheric and stratospheric NOx distributions deviate significantly from the observations. The too-fast and early downward propagation of the NOx tongue, encountered in most simulations, coincides with a temperature high bias in the lower mesosphere (0.2–0.05 hPa), likely caused by an overestimation of descent velocities. In contrast, upper-mesospheric temperatures (at 0.05–0.001 hPa) are generally underestimated by the high-top models after the onset of the ES event, being indicative for too-slow descent and hence too-low NOx fluxes. As a consequence, the magnitude of the simulated NOx tongue is generally underestimated by these models. Descending NOx amounts simulated with medium-top models are on average closer to the observations but show a large spread of up to several hundred percent. This is primarily attributed to the different vertical model domains in which the NOx upper boundary condition is applied. In general, the intercomparison demonstrates the ability of state-of-the-art atmospheric models to reproduce the EPP indirect effect in dynamically and geomagnetically quiescent NH winter conditions. The encountered differences between observed and simulated NOx, CO, and temperature distributions during the perturbed phase of the 2009 NH winter, however, emphasize the need for model improvements in the dynamical representation of elevated stratopause events in order to allow for a better description of the EPP indirect effect under these particular conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191839",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-3573-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191839","en","Copernicus GmbH",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"HEPPA-II model-measurement intercomparison project: EPP indirect effects during the dynamically perturbed NH winter 2008-2009","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:42:52Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,"Future and Past Solar Influence on the Terrestrial Climate II","147659","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF: Sonstige",,,,,"85015386479","000397827900005","Atmos. chem. phys.","5","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Many current experiments in, for example, the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP), are not specifically designed for informing this report. Here, we document the design of the half a degree additional warming, projections, prognosis and impacts (HAPPI) experiment. HAPPI provides a framework for the generation of climate data describing how the climate, and in particular extreme weather, might differ from the present day in worlds that are 1.5 and 2.0 °C warmer than pre-industrial conditions. Output from participating climate models includes variables frequently used by a range of impact models. The key challenge is to separate the impact of an additional approximately half degree of warming from uncertainty in climate model responses and internal climate variability that dominate CMIP-style experiments under low-emission scenarios.  Large ensembles of simulations (>  50 members) of atmosphere-only models for three time slices are proposed, each a decade in length: the first being the most recent observed 10-year period (2006–2015), the second two being estimates of a similar decade but under 1.5 and 2 °C conditions a century in the future. We use the representative concentration pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6) to provide the model boundary conditions for the 1.5 °C scenario, and a weighted combination of RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 for the 2 °C scenario.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000128890",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-10-571-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128890","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Half a degree additional warming, prognosis and projected impacts (HAPPI): Background and experimental design","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:03:34Z",,,,"pub:191819",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936554a7669737043","010180250",,"85011982641","000395390500001","Geosci. model dev.","2","Geoscientific Model Development","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The HoloGondel platform overcomes this limitation by using a cable car to obtain vertical profiles of the microphysical and meteorological cloud parameters. The main component of the HoloGondel platform is the HOLographic Imager for Microscopic Objects (HOLIMO 3G), which uses digital in-line holography to image cloud particles. Based on two-dimensional images the microphysical cloud parameters for the size range from small cloud particles to large precipitation particles are obtained for the liquid and ice phase. The low traveling velocity of a cable car on the order of 10ms−1 allows measurements with high spatial resolution; however, at the same time it leads to an unstable air speed towards the HoloGondel platform. Holographic cloud imagers, which have a sample volume that is independent of the air speed, are therefore well suited for measurements on a cable car. Example measurements of the vertical profiles observed in a liquid cloud and a mixed-phase cloud at the Eggishorn in the Swiss Alps in the winters 2015 and 2016 are presented. The HoloGondel platform reliably observes cloud droplets larger than 6.5µm, partitions between cloud droplets and ice crystals for a size larger than 25µm and obtains a statistically significantly size distribution for every 5m in vertical ascent.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000128907",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-10-459-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128907","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"HoloGondel: In situ cloud observations on a cable car in the Swiss Alps using a holographic imager","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:03:34Z",,,,"pub:191836",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936554ad120c48845",,,"85011878121","000395102800003","Atmos. meas. tech.","2","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we report a widespread decrease in cloud cover since the 1970 s over the Mediterranean region, in particular during the 1970 s–1980 s, especially in the central and eastern areas and during springtime. Confidence in these findings is high due to the good agreement between the interannual variations of cloud cover provided by surface observations and several satellite-derived and reanalysis products, although some discrepancies exist in their trends. Climate model simulations of the historical experiment from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) also exhibit a decrease in cloud cover over the Mediterranean since the 1970 s, in agreement with surface observations, although the rate of decrease is slightly lower. The observed northward expansion of the Hadley cell is discussed as a possible cause of detected trends.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000128586",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/srep41475","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128586","en","Nature Publishing Group",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Climate and Earth system modelling","Fewer clouds in the Mediterranean: Consistency of observations and climate simulations","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T19:50:50Z",,,,"pub:191497",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593655442385688624","006751867",,"85011344628","000393097100002","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Lidar and ceilometer backscatter observations offer a robust technique with growing spatial coverage, but the obtained backscatter profiles need to be carefully translated into boundary layer parameters. Here we present the development of the PathfinderTURB algorithm for the analysis of ceilometer backscatter data and the real-time detection of the vertical structure of the planetary boundary layer. Two typical aerosol layer heights are retrieved by PathfinderTURB: the Convective Boundary Layer (CBL) and the Continuous Aerosol Layer (CAL). PathfinderTURB combines the strengths of gradient- and variance-based methods and addresses the layer attribution problem by adopting a geodesic approach. The algorithm has been applied to one year of data measured by two CHM15k ceilometers operated at the Aerological Observatory of Payerne (491 m, a.s.l.) on the Swiss plateau, and at the Kleine Scheidegg (2061 m, a.s.l.) in the Swiss Alps. The retrieval of the CBL has been validated at Payerne using two reference methods: (1) manual detections of the CBL height performed by independent human experts using the ceilometer backscatter data of the year 2014; (2) values of CBL heights calculated using the Richardson's method from co-located radio sounding data. We found average biases as small as 27 m (53 m) with respect to reference method 1 (2). Based on the excellent agreement with the two reference methods, PathfinderTURB has been applied to the ceilometer data at the mountainous site of the Kleine Scheidegg for the period September 2014 till November 2015. At this site, the CHM15k is operated in a novel, tilted configuration at 71° zenith angle to probe the air next to the Sphinx Observatory (3580 m, a.s.l.) on the Jungfraujoch (JFJ). The analysis of the retrieved layers led to the following results: the CAL reaches the JFJ during 41 % of the time in summer and during 21 % of the time in winter for a total of 97 days during the two seasons. The season-averaged daily cycles show that the CBL height reaches the JFJ only during short periods (4 % of the time) on 20 individual days in summer and never during winter. Especially during summer the CBL and the CAL modify the air sampled in-situ at JFJ, resulting in an unequivocal dependence of the measured absorption coefficient on the height of both layers. This highlights the relevance of retrieving the height of CAL and CBL in mountainous regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000178514",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-2016-962","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/178514","en","Copernicus","218589||216770","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"PathfinderTURB: an automatic boundary layer algorithm.

In the mid-latitudes, over 80% of precipitation extremes are associated with extratropical cyclones and their occurrence or absence controls the frequency and severity of floods and droughts. Phase-change processes like condensation and rain evaporation affect the dynamics of extratropical cyclones and their impact by contributing latent heat to the cyclone intensification, and by significantly reducing the surface precipitation amount, respectively. A widely applied method to passively trace the atmospheric water cycle with a focus on phase-change processes is to consider stable water isotopes, because these naturally available tracers record the condensation and evaporation history of atmospheric water vapour and precipitation.  The aim of this thesis is to identify the driving mechanisms of isotopic variability on the sub-event time scale and draw conclusions for the dynamics of the investigated events. This is done by performing parallel high-frequency measurements of stable water isotopes in near-surface vapour and precipitation for selected rain events and compare these data to simulations with a below-cloud interaction model fed with meteorological observations.  In the first part of this thesis, the techniques to measure the isotopic composition of surface vapour and rain are outlined. In-situ vapour isotope measurements of δ2H, δ18O and hence d-excess are performed with two cavity ring-down laser spectrometers (Picarro L1115-i and L2130-i). Precipitation is sampled in short intervals (∼ 10 min) during several rain events and analysed for its isotopic composition. Supporting meteorological observations are taken from radiosondes, a disdrometer, a micro rain radar and two X-band radars. An overview of the data is presented, which was collected during two measurement campaigns in Switzerland.  The second part introduces the below-cloud interaction model, which simulates the changing isotopic composition of a single falling hydrometeor. The model is used to enhance the conceptual understanding of below-cloud processes and test the sensitivity of the isotopic signal of rain to temperature, relative humidity, formation height, the formation mechanism, and to the isotopic composition of the source vapour. Variables that determine the initial isotopic composition of rain mostly affect large hydrometeors and intense rain. In contrast, small hydrometeors and weak rain are mostly affected by variables that determine the strength of below-cloud processes. These processes are limited by the height of the melting layer and weak if the melting layer is low.  The driving mechanisms of isotopic variability of selected frontal rain events are analysed in the third part of this thesis. The evolution of the isotopic difference between rain and near-surface vapour of three cold frontal passages is compared to the mass weighted mean diameter Dm of the rain samples to identify the influence of below-cloud processes. Thereby, the importance of sampling rain with a high frequency is underlined. Phases are identified, when rain is mainly controlled by evaporation or equilibration or by changes in the source conditions. Below-cloud processes are more dominant for weak rain intensities, a high melting layer and low near-surface relative humidity. They are thus expected to have a weaker influence in cold and moist seasons and climates, where convective rain dominates. Rain in comparison with near-suface vapour is on average depleted by 5.4 permil in δ2H, which indicates incomplete equilibration, and lower by 4.6 permil in d-excess, which underlines the presence of rain evaporation. A new reference frame (∆δ∆d-space) for the interpretation of rain samples is introduced, which displays the isotopic difference between rain and near-surface vapour for δ2H and d-excess. The degree of equilibrium between rain and near-surface vapour and the influence of evaporation can be directly identified from the location of a sample in the ∆δ∆d-space. Certain periods are dominated by the influence of evaporation, and during others, the influence of below-cloud processes is weak. A characteristic slope in the ∆δ∆d-space of −0.30 ± 0.01 is found for all samples of all investigated rain events.  A comparison between observations and below-cloud interaction model simulations yields that short-term, sample to sample isotopic variations are caused by changes in the drop size, and that the longer-term evolution is controlled by a change of the source vapour, which is manifested by a changing vertical isotopic profile in the model. Conclusions about the relative humidity profile can be drawn from the difference between measured and simulated d-excess. Differences of δ2H are used to constrain changes in the vapour isotopic profile due to the layering of different air masses. It is demonstrated with these analyses that stable water isotopes provide information about the dynamics of weather events that is not available from traditional meteorological variables, or that would involve disproportionately more extensive measurements.  In summary, this thesis presents an unprecedented combination of parallel high-frequency measurements of stable water isotopes in vapour and rain in mid-latitude weather events. The measurements can be used to improve our understanding of below-cloud processes and of the controls of short-term variations of isotopes in precipitation. The combination with model simulations is a valuable tool to constrain atmospheric conditions and to validate atmospheric models during rain events.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000266387",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/266387","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","PRECIPITATIONS (METEOROLOGY)||Stable water isotopes||precipitation evaporation||below-cloud processes||MODELLRECHNUNG UND SIMULATION IN DEN UMWELTWISSENSCHAFTEN||Atmospheric dynamics||Water Cycle||Weather systems||COLD FRONTS (METEOROLOGY)","The effect of below-cloud processes on short-term variations of stable water isotopes in surface precipitation","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2018-05-29T10:08:27Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24777",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A new method is developed based on integrating diabatic PV changes along backward trajectories. This method allows us to decompose the Lagrangian PV change over a certain time interval into contributions from different microphysical processes, including the below-cloud processes snow sublimation, snow melting and rain evaporation. The method is first applied to an extratropical cyclone in an idealized baroclinic channel setup. The mesoscale PV structure along the bent-back front results from a complex combination of microphysical processes. The microphysical contributions to the different positive and negative anomalies are analyzed in detail. It is found that for each anomaly, typically one specific microphysical process takes the leading role in its diabatic generation. A large but rather weak low and mid-level positive anomaly is produced by depositional growth of ice and snow. Two smaller but stronger positive anomalies at lower levels are generated mainly by in-cloud condensational heating at the warm front, and below-cloud rain evaporation and snow melting 200 km further north. In addition, near-surface negative anomalies are produced by snow melting and snow sublimation, respectively. The same method is applied to a particularly strong maritime extratropical cyclone, occurring over the Bering Sea on 12-14 December 2015. The warm-frontal structure is characterized by one strong positive PV anomaly stretching from the surface almost up to the tropopause. For this anomaly, condensation and below-cloud rain evaporation contribute most in the lower part, whereas deposition of ice and snow are more important in the upper part. Snow melting contributes very strongly in a localized region at the surface front. Snow sublimation leads to a weak negative anomaly on the cold side of the front. The cold frontal structure was found to be characterized by two strong low-level positive PV anomalies. The one on the warm side is produced due to condensation and below-cloud rain evaporation, the one on the cold side, located outside the clouds, has contributions from almost all microphysical processes. The time evolution of the anomalies showed that positive anomalies vary most over time, whereas negative anomalies stay relatively constant. The transition of the cyclone to a situation where it is embedded in a colder environment is marked by an increasing relative importance of the ice-phase processes compared to the liquid phase processes. The general findings of this study are: (a) a complex combination of microphysical processes dictates the strength and structure of diabatic PV anomalies along the fronts; (b) below-cloud processes are relevant for both the positive and negative anomalies throughout most of the troposphere;  and (c) the Lagrangian approach proved meaningful for this detailed process-based analysis of dynamically relevant mesoscale flow structures. With regard to the below-cloud process, we note their strong contributions up to 1.0 PVU to the positive low-level anomalies, their relevance for anomalies in both the warm sector (mainly rain evaporation) and the cold sector (mainly rain evaporation and snow sublimation), and the importance of snow melting in localized regions close to the surface front. Furthermore, it is shown that in the mid troposphere both the integrated diabatic PV tendencies (Lagrangian anomalies) and consideration of cross-isentropic transport in a background with a vertical PV gradient are important to understand the resulting PV anomalies. Idealized modelling has the potential to further distinguish the inherently linked effects of Lagrangian PV modification and cross-isentropic transport of low-PV air. Finally, it is shown how our novel method could lead to a better understanding of the pathways of stratosphere-troposphere exchange and the involved physical processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000204404",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/204404","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Potential vorticity anomalies related to clouds and precipitation in extratropical cyclones","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2017-11-03T15:29:29Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24061",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although this amplification is well understood for individual cyclones, there is still need for a systematic and quantitative investigation of how LH affects cyclone intensification in different, particularly warmer and moister climates predicted for the future. In this thesis, we thus introduce a simple diagnostic method to quantify the contribution of LH to cyclone intensification within the potential vorticity (PV) framework. The two leading terms in the PV tendency equation, diabatic PV modification and vertical advection, are used to derive a diagnostic equation to explicitly calculate the fraction of a cyclone's positive lower-tropospheric PV anomaly caused by LH. The strength of this anomaly is strongly coupled to cyclone intensity and the associated impacts in terms of surface weather. To evaluate the performance of the diagnostic, sensitivity simulations of 12 Northern Hemisphere cyclones with artificially modified LH are carried out with a numerical weather prediction model. Based on these simulations, we demonstrate that the PV diagnostic captures the mean sensitivity of the cyclones' PV structure to LH as well as parts of the large case-to-case variability, which is a particular benefit for climatological applications. The simple and purely diagnostic characteristics of the PV diagnostic allow for a versatile application to cyclones in weather and climate model output as well as in reanalysis data, independent of their spatial and temporal resolution.It is still unclear how enhanced LH in a warmer and moister climate will affect cyclones, mainly because its intensifying effect is expected to partly counteract the effects of further changes in the meridional temperature gradient and static stability. We thus use our PV diagnostic to study the role of LH for cyclones in different idealized climate change experiments. In a first step, we perform high-resolution surrogate climate change simulations of a set of moderate and intense Northern Hemisphere cyclones, in which temperatures are spatially homogeneously increased by 4 K, keeping relative humidity constant and thus increasing specific humidity. With our PV diagnostic we can demonstrate that enhanced LH associated with the higher moisture content is the main driver for an increase in intensity and impacts of all cyclones: it amplifies their positive lower-tropospheric PV anomaly by intensifying diabatic PV generation. This amplification leads to a stronger intensification of the cyclones by enhancing cyclonic circulation in the lower troposphere, which, in most cases, results in higher cyclone intensities, stronger wind gusts at the surface, and, in combination with the higher moisture content, more precipitation. This correlation is most robust from an average perspective, but also the strong case-to-case variability of the changes can partly be explained by consistent changes in LH and thus diabatic PV generation. The experiments further indicate that extreme diabatically-driven cyclones of a present-day climate have the potential to be substantially more devastating if occurring in a warmer climate.In a second step, we investigate the role of LH for cyclones in different climates, in which changes in the thermodynamic background state are not anymore limited to an increase in temperature and thus moisture. To this end, an idealized general circulation model (GCM) in an aquaplanet setup is used to simulate a set of very cold to very warm climates, in which cyclones are identified and tracked based on their local sea level pressure minimum. With our PV diagnostic we can demonstrate that diabatic PV generation due to LH intensifies with increasing global mean surface air temperature, yielding a maximum lower-tropospheric PV anomaly in very warm climates. This increase in diabatic PV generation is stronger for intense than for moderate cyclones, and extends into the middle and upper troposphere in very warm climates. The intensity of moderate cyclones, measured in terms of lower-tropospheric relative vorticity, peaks in a climate slightly warmer than present-day and decreases toward very warm climates, which demonstrates that the increase in LH toward warmer climates is too weak to overcompensate counteracting changes in the meridional temperature gradient and static stability. In contrast, the intensity of intense cyclones peaks in a climate substantially warmer than present-day, in which also the lower-tropospheric PV anomaly reaches its maximum. The intensification of LH in intense cyclones is thus strong enough to overcompensate counteracting changes in the meridional temperature gradient and static stability, and hence drives their increase in intensity toward warmer climates.This thesis not only provides a versatile diagnostic tool to quantify the effects of LH on cyclones but also suggests enhanced LH to increase the intensity of intense cyclones in a future climate. Improving predictions of future storm track changes thus requires a better representation of LH processes in GCMs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000250887",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/250887","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Atmospheric dynamics||Climate change||Extratropical cyclones||Latent heating||Potential vorticity||Diabatic processes||Meteorology||Wind storms||Winter storms||Potential vorticity diagnostics||Diagnostic tools||Idealized climate change simulations||Surrogate climate change simulations||Idealized GCM simulations||Numerical weather prediction models||Atmospheric physics","Potential Vorticity Diagnostics to Quantify Effects of Latent Heating in Extratropical Cyclones: Methodology and Application to Idealized Climate Change Simulations","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2018-03-19T10:39:05Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,"Quantifying effects of latent heating on midlatitude cyclones under different climate conditions","149140","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)","24511",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For instance, a two-week winter cold spell in Europe strongly enhances heating demand. Due to the large-scale deployment of renewables in the past decade in Europe, the importance of weather for the energy sector has increased even more. Variations in large-scale weather patterns impacting wind, precipitation and cloud cover critically affect energy supply and weather forecasts are hence important price drivers in energy markets. Of particular interest for many market participants is the time range from a few weeks to two months ahead, since large volumes are traded on these timescales, for which the weather evolution is however highly uncertain. Improved predictability on these timescales would therefore be particularly valuable for the energy sector. Motivated by the weather sensitivity of the energy industry, this thesis applies a ""weather event perspective"" to investigate predictors for anomalous weather conditions in Europe with a particularly high impact on the energy sector for up to two months ahead. In the first part of the thesis energy-relevant weather events are defned and the large-scale flow conditions in which they occur are discussed, using a novel weather regime defnition of 7 Atlantic-European weather regimes and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).Weather events are multi-day periods with anomalously high or low temperatures, winds, or precipitation in one of five subregions of Europe. The role of the NAO is quite distinct for different weather events. Some event types preferably occur during weather regimes with a positive NAO, e.g., high wind and high temperature events in the northern subregions and low wind events in the southern subregions. Weather regimes with negative NAO favour fewer event types, i.e., only low temperature events in Central Europe and the Nordics. However, there are also a number of events that occur in weather regimes not related to the NAO, such as low wind events in northern and high wind events in southern Europe. The second part of the thesis investigates the implications of stratosphere-troposphere coupling for the weather events. Several event categories show statistically significant anomalous stratosphere-troposphere coupling (i.e., a stronger than normal stratospheric polar vortex and a positive NAO or a weaker than normal polar vortex and a negative NAO) up to about 40 days before the events. Strongest stratosphere-troposphere coupling is present before those wind events, which preferably occur during a strongly positive NAO. Stratosphere-troposphere coupling is also present for some temperature and precipitation events, but the signals are weaker than for the wind events. We also show that the stratospheric circulation modulates the 3 Atlantic-European weather regimes which strongly project onto the NAO, which corroborates the finding that mainly NAO related events occur during stratosphere-troposphere coupling. The third part of the thesis investigates the implications of the lower stratospheric circulation for month-ahead wind power and its prediction, using the novel dataset Renewables. ninja. We demonstrate that there exists a strong relationship between the lower stratospheric circulation and month-ahead wind electricity generation in different parts of Europe. This relationship exists due to episodes of stratosphere-troposphere coupling, which lead to prolonged periods of either the positive or the negative phase of the NAO. Since these persistent NAO periods are associated with strong surface wind anomalies, they have an important impact on wind electricity generation, in particular for Northern Europe. The state of the lower stratospheric circulation also determines the exact latitudinal position of these prolonged NAO patterns, with contrasting implications for wind electricity generation in specific countries. Using simple statistical forecasts we show that the observed relationship between the lower stratosphere and wind electricity generation can be used for skilful forecasts of month-ahead wind electricity generation. Particularly high forecast skill is found when the circulation in the lower stratosphere differs strongly from its climatological mean. Anomalous states of the lower stratospheric circulation therefore provide windows of sub-seasonal range predictability for wind power output in many European countries. In the last part of the thesis the state of low-frequency forcings other than the stratospheric circulation are analysed with respect to weather events. They include the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), the Global Wind Oscillation (GWO), sea surface temperatures, Arctic sea ice and Eurasian snow cover. The signals are weaker than the ones found for the stratospheric circulation, but they exist and are mostly consistent with the findings of previous studies. Weather events occurring preferentially during NAO+ tend to be preceded by MJO phases 2 to 4, GWO phases 5 to 8, above normal Arctic sea ice, the warm phase of the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and below normal Eurasian snow cover. In contrast, weather events occurring preferentially during NAO- are preceded by MJO phases 6 to 8, GWO phases 1 to 3, below normal Arctic sea ice, the cold phase of the PDO and above normal October Eurasian snow cover. We find one signal which is in clear contradiction to previous literature. Weather events preferentially occurring in NAO+ (NAO-) tend to occur during El Niño (La Niña), while the bulk of the literature so far suggested that El Niño favours NAO- dominated winters and vice versa.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000255644",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/255644","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Sources of sub-seasonal predictability for energy-industry-relevant weather events","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment","2018-04-05T16:49:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24488",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Computational constraints restrict the horizontal resolution in current global atmosphere models to order 10-100 km. Processes that act on smaller scales cannot be explicitly resolved and have to be parameterized in terms of the resolved large-scale fields. Most turbulent processes in the atmospheric boundary layer, which spans the lowest 1-2 km of the atmosphere, fall into this category and are the focus of this work. The accuracy of parameterization schemes is crucial, as the parameterized processes feed back onto the large-scale motion. For instance, the inaccuracies and differences among climate models in the representation of convection and the low clouds that often top boundary layers translate into uncertainties in cloud radiative effects and their response to climate changes. The cloud radiative feedback contributes to the global energy budget and represents a significant feedback in a changing climate. As a result, the parameterization of low clouds has emerged as a key source of uncertainty in the prediction of climate sensitivity.  The work presented in this PhD thesis investigates two different approaches for the parameterization of subgrid scale processes in the boundary layer. Part I investigates the potential and limitations of obtaining parameterizations by truncating the hierarchy of statistical moments in turbulent flows at the certain order. Here, a truncation at second order is considered, which takes into account mean and (co-)variance values of at the second order. In such a second-order closure moments of third order and higher are neglected, such that nonlinear interactions among turbulent eddies are suppressed but nonlinear eddy-mean flow interactions are retained.  Part II investigates `assumed-PDF' schemes using mixtures of Gaussian probability distributions. This method assumes that the subgrid scale fields are distributed according to a certain family of probability distributions of which the parameters are determined from the large-scale fields. The two methods are related, since for Gaussian random variables like for second-order closures all third- and higher-order cumulants vanish; hence, a flow that obeys Gaussian statistics can be captured by a second-order closure.   In Part I, the dynamics represented by second-order turbulence closures are studied, with focus on two main questions: How well can such a closure, using the complete set of first- and second-order moments, approximate the dynamics in atmospheric boundary layers? Does the inclusion of spatially non-local correlations ameliorate some of the deficiencies of traditional second-order closures, despite the omission of all third- and higher-order moments?  In conventional second-order schemes, only a subset of the second-order moments, such as the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), is treated prognostically. All other moments, as for instance the variance or the turbulent flux of heat and moisture, are treated diagnostically. Treating all second-order moments as prognostic variables allows one to systematically single out errors introduced by omitting certain second-order terms (e.g., non-local correlation terms) from errors introduced by omitting third- and higher-order moments. The dynamics that are captured by the full set of first- and second-order cumulant equations, including local and non-local correlations, can be studied in terms of the quasi-linearized equations of motion. Both sets of equations represent the same dynamics. To study the quasi-linear (QL) dynamics, a large-eddy simulation (LES) code is modified to describe the quasi-linear transport of scalars and momentum. The patterns and statistics of flow fields resulting from these QL LES and the original, non-linear LES are compared against each other. In a dry convective boundary layer, the first-order statistics, such as the mean temperature profile and the growth of the boundary layer, are well represented by the QL LES. However, the QL simulation fails to capture the negative vertical heat flux at the top of the boundary layer and underestimates the vertical transport of turbulent kinetic energy. This underlines the non-linear nature of these processes. Quasi-linear simulations of moist boundary layer convection exhibit excessive growth of higher-order moments, which can be traced back to a violation of local conservation for scalar variables like entropy and total water. Similar difficulties are known for third-order closures, while they seem to have received less attention as a limitation of second-order closures.   Part II focuses on the subgrid scale statistics of thermodynamic variables in atmospheric boundary layers and clouds, which are essential for the representation of the cloud cover. A correct estimation of the cloud fraction and the liquid water path is crucial for an accurate computation of cloud radiative feedbacks and precipitation.  Building on previous work, this study tries to answer the following question: What degree of complexity is necessary for a probability distribution to represent cloud cover statistics? Can the subgrid scale distribution in the environment of convective updrafts be approximated by a normal distribution, as is required by many parameterization schemes?  The present study investigates Gaussian mixture models as assumed probability distribution functions (PDFs) of subgrid scale variability of liquid potential temperature and total water. Data from a suite of LES are used as training and reference data for fitting and testing the PDF models. The results support previous findings that a single Gaussian PDF provides a good approximation in stratiform cloud layers, while up to three Gaussian components are necessary for a good estimate in shallow and deep cumulus convection. The same analysis is applied after decomposing the LES data into convective updrafts and their environment. Conditional statistics indicate that the thermodynamic variables in the environment do not follow a normal distribution due to the presence of passive clouds that remain near the top of convective clouds. In the shallow convection case considered in this study, this can lead to an error of up to 30\% in total cloud fraction and liquid water.   With regard to scale-aware cloud closure schemes, the PDF models are tested for LES sampling domains of varying horizontal and vertical extent. The models are robust with regard to the horizontal extent of the sampling domain, as long as the sampling domain covers a representative part of the cloud cover. In contrast, the results show a strong sensitivity to the vertical coarse-graining of the sampling domain, which points to the importance of vertical resolution for parameterization schemes in large-scale models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000292267",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/292267","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Atmospheric boundary layer||Turbulence||Clouds||Atmospheric dynamics||Atmosphere||Closure","Boundary-Layer Turbulence and Clouds in the Atmosphere: Prospects for Closures","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2018-09-27T21:04:10Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24742",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While changes in mean and extreme precipitation have been studied intensively, precipitation variability has received less attention, despite its theoretical and practical importance. Here, we show that precipitation variability in most climate models increases over a majority of global land area in response to warming (66% of land has a robust increase in variability of seasonal-mean precipitation). Comparing recent decades to RCP8.5 projections for the end of the 21st century, we find that in the global, multi-model mean, precipitation variability increases 3–4% K−1 globally, 4–5% K−1 over land and 2–4% K−1 over ocean, and is remarkably robust on a range of timescales from daily to decadal. Precipitation variability increases by at least as much as mean precipitation and less than moisture and extreme precipitation for most models, regions, and timescales. We interpret this as being related to an increase in moisture which is partially mitigated by weakening circulation. We show that changes in observed daily variability in station data are consistent with increased variability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000226638",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-017-17966-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/226638","en","Nature Publishing Group",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Precipitation variability increases in a warmer climate","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-09T02:29:58Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000418562100006","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Countries put forward pledges called nationally determined contributions (NDC) whose impact is assessed in global stocktaking exercises. Subsequently, actions can then be strengthened in light of the Paris climate objective: limiting global mean temperature increase to well below 2 °C and pursuing efforts to limit it further to 1.5 °C. However, pledged actions are currently described ambiguously and this complicates the global stocktaking exercise. Here, we systematically explore possible interpretations of NDC assumptions, and show that this results in estimated emissions for 2030 ranging from 47 to 63 GtCO2e yr−1. We show that this uncertainty has critical implications for the feasibility and cost to limit warming well below 2 °C and further to 1.5 °C. Countries are currently working towards clarifying the modalities of future NDCs. We identify salient avenues to reduce the overall uncertainty by about 10 percentage points through simple, technical clarifications regarding energy accounting rules. Remaining uncertainties depend to a large extent on politically valid choices about how NDCs are expressed, and therefore raise the importance of a thorough and robust process that keeps track of where emissions are heading over time.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000192192",,"2041-1723","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/192192||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/226885","10.1038/ncomms15748","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/233660","en","Nature Publishing Group",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Understanding the origin of Paris Agreement emission uncertainties","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T04:42:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85020467632",,"Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This paper documents the status of the GEBA version 2017 dataset, presents the new web interface and user access, and reviews the scientific impact that GEBA data had in various applications. GEBA has continuously been expanded and updated and contains in its 2017 version around 500 000 monthly mean entries of various surface energy balance components measured at 2500 locations. The database contains observations from 15 surface energy flux components, with the most widely measured quantity available in GEBA being the shortwave radiation incident at the Earth's surface (global radiation). Many of the historic records extend over several decades. GEBA contains monthly data from a variety of sources, namely from the World Radiation Data Centre (WRDC) in St. Petersburg, from national weather services, from different research networks (BSRN, ARM, SURFRAD), from peer-reviewed publications, project and data reports, and from personal communications. Quality checks are applied to test for gross errors in the dataset. GEBA has played a key role in various research applications, such as in the quantification of the global energy balance, in the discussion of the anomalous atmospheric shortwave absorption, and in the detection of multi-decadal variations in global radiation, known as ""global dimming"" and ""brightening"". GEBA is further extensively used for the evaluation of climate models and satellite-derived surface flux products. On a more applied level, GEBA provides the basis for engineering applications in the context of solar power generation, water management, agricultural production and tourism.

Confidence in climate projections relies on the adequacy of climate models for those projections. The question of how to argue for the adequacy of models for climate projections has not gotten sufficient attention in the climate modeling community. The most common way to evaluate a climate model is to assess in a quantitative way degrees of ‘model fit’; that is, how well model results fit observation-based data (empirical accuracy) and agree with other models or model versions (robustness). However, such assessments are largely silent about what those degrees of fit imply for a model's adequacy for projecting future climate. We provide a conceptual framework for discussing the evaluation of the adequacy of models for climate projections. Drawing on literature from philosophy of science and climate science, we discuss the potential and limits of inferences from model fit. We suggest that support of a model by background knowledge is an additional consideration that can be appealed to in arguments for a model's adequacy for long-term projections, and that this should explicitly be spelled out. Empirical accuracy, robustness and support by background knowledge neither individually nor collectively constitute sufficient conditions in a strict sense for a model's adequacy for long-term projections. However, they provide reasons that can be strengthened by additional information and thus contribute to a complex non-deductive argument for the adequacy of a climate model or a family of models for long-term climate projections.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000125398",,"1757-7780||1757-7799","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/125398||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/213284","10.1002/wcc.454","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/215008","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Building confidence in climate model projections: an analysis of inferences from fit","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T18:04:26Z",,,,"pub:187999",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936550f8315068160",,,"85018214663","000399906300004",,"3","WIREs Climate Change","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

On the other hand, humans started to affect Earth’s climate. The consumption of fossil fuels leads to higher global temperatures and more climate extremes. Extreme events, such as heat waves or droughts, can have adverse effects on societies and ecosystems. An improved understanding of their drivers helps to mitigate their impacts. However, extreme events are rare and changes in their frequency are hard to detect as natural variability is superimposed on possible trends. The land surface is an integral part of the climate system and is coupled to the atmosphere via the exchange of water and energy. Thereby, soil moisture conditions can influence the partitioning of the available surface net radiation into the latent and sensible heat flux. When the soil is sufficiently wet, the latent heat flux is controlled and limited by radiation, whereas under drought conditions it is limited by moisture availability. Hence, dry soils tend to decrease the latent heat flux, thereby increasing the sensible heat flux, exacerbating hot extremes during heat waves.  In this thesis, I investigate the influence of past climate change and of the land surface on climate extremes. The importance of climate change for extreme events can be quantified with probabilistic event attribution. This method compares the probability of an extreme event in the current climate to its probability in a counterfactual climate absent anthropogenic influence. The effect of the land conditions on the atmosphere is assessed with numerical sensitivity experiments prescribing soil moisture in global climate models. This decouples the land from the atmosphere and therefore allows to infer the effect of soil moisture on climate.  In the first part of this thesis I investigate the influence of climate change on climate extremes. Using the 2015 meteorological summer drought in Europe as test case, I assess the importance of methodological choices for probabilistic event attribution. The summer of 2015 was characterized by record low rainfall and river levels. Using a wide range of observations and model simulations I show that the conclusion whether this event is related to anthropogenic climate change heavily depends on methodological decisions. Our results highlight that uncertainties of event attribution studies are larger than commonly assumed, implying a high risk of erroneous attribution statements. In the second part of the thesis I investigate the influence of the land surface on climate extremes. I contrast four different methods to prescribe soil moisture, and compare the ramifications of prescribing the mean versus the median soil moisture climatological seasonal cycle. I show that soil moisture prescription methods that alter the soil ice content lead to large, undesirable, ground heat flux anomalies in the employed land model. Therefore, I developed a novel approach to prescribe soil moisture that prevents the ground heat flux anomalies, while still muting the land–atmosphere coupling. Furthermore, I find that the median soil moisture climatology is lower than the mean for most regions and that prescribing the mean climatology leads to larger temperature anomalies. However, prescribing soil moisture does not conserve water, and I show how the atmospheric temperature response is directly related to the amount of artificially added and removed water, which implies that not the entire temperature signal can be attributed to land–atmosphere coupling.  In the third part of the thesis I investigate the joint influence of climate change and the land surface on climate extremes. In 2010 western Russia experienced a severe heat wave, which led to record-high temperatures. It was hypothesized that climate change and land–atmosphere interactions were important for the build-up of the observed temperature extremes. To test this hypothesis, I combine the approaches introduced in the first two parts of this thesis and I conducted dedicated climate model simulations that allow to disentangle to effect of recent climate change from that of dry soils. I find that climate change alone has increased the probability of the event threefold since the 1960s. Prescribing the soil moisture conditions observed during the event indicates that dry soils made the event six times more likely. Finally, the joint effect of the soil moisture anomaly and climate change leads to a 13-fold increase in the event probability. In two co-authored articles presented in the appendix, I briefly showcase two further methods to investigate the influence of climate change and the land surface on extremes. The first uses trend detection and attribution to identify the drivers behind the trend in the growing season length, a climate index indicating conditions favorable for plant growth. We show that in extratropical regions where some of the world’s major crops are grown, the observed increase in the growing season length can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change. The second analysis illustrates how land–temperature coupling metrics can be used to assess the importance of soil moisture for heat waves. Using two different coupling metrics we illustrate how dry soils exacerbated the extreme temperatures during the 2015 heat wave in the Western United States. Overall, the presented findings enhance the understanding of the role of climate change and land–atmosphere interactions for climate extremes. They highlight the importance of climate change for extreme events, but also demonstrate large uncertainties in some of the assessments. The results further underline the relevance of land–atmosphere interactions for aggravating temperature extremes during heat waves. The presented scientific advances emphasize the usefulness of combining different methodological frameworks, and serve as an example of fruitful collaboration across research communities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000179749",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/179749","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Attributing climate extremes to anthropogenic climate change and land–atmosphere coupling","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture","2017-08-22T12:18:29Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24308",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We investigated this issue using long-term sunshine duration records from China, which experienced a rapid increase in urbanization during the past decades. Over the period 1960–2013, 172 pairs of urban and nearby rural stations were analyzed. Urban and rural sunshine duration trends show similar spatial patterns during a dimming phase (1960–1989) and a subsequent period during which trends were leveling off (1990–2013). This indicates that rather than local effects, the trends in sunshine duration are on more of a national or regional scale in China. Nevertheless, in the dimming phase, the declining rate of sunshine duration in rural areas is around two-thirds of that in urban areas. The ratio of rural to urban dimming generally increases from a minimum of 0.39 to a maximum of 0.87 with increasing indices of urbanization calculated based on the year 2013. It reaches a maximum when the urbanization level exceeds 50 %, the urban population exceeds 20 million, or the population density becomes higher than 250 person km−2. After the transition into the leveling-off period, sunshine duration trends are no longer significantly affected by urbanization. Meanwhile, the number of laws and regulations related to air pollution and investment in pollution treatment have been increasing in China.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191685",,"0992-7689||0939-4176||1432-0576",,"10.5194/angeo-35-839-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191685","en","European Geosciences Union",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Meteorology and atmospheric dynamics (climatology; radiative processes)","Urbanization effect on trends in sunshine duration in China","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:31:07Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: absorption of solar radiation||Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: temporal variation of solar radiation in the climate system","135395||159938","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projekte MINT",,,,,"85025122156","000405776600001","Ann.

The main reason for this is that the microphysical processes responsible for the formation, de- velopment and precipitation initiation in MPCs are not well understood. Orographic clouds provide an ideal natural laboratory to observe the microphysical properties of MPCs. However, aircraft cannot sample in complex alpine terrain and ground-based measurements at mountain- top research stations are limited to single-point observations, which can be influenced by surface processes. Thus, new measurements strategies are required to make representative measurements of orographic clouds and to improve our understanding of relevant processes in MPCs. This work introduces a novel in-situ measurement platform, named HoloGondel, which is designed for the use on a cable car to measure vertical profiles of the microphysical and meteo- rological properties of orographic clouds. Its main component is a new HOLographic Imager for Microscopic Objects 3G (HOLIMO 3G). HOLIMO 3G uses digital in-line holography to image an entire ensemble of cloud particles larger than 6 μm at once. The information about the three dimensional position and the 2D image of each particle is reconstructed computationally. Based on the shape of their 2D images, cloud particles larger than 25 μm are classified as liquid droplets or ice crystals. In-line holography has the advantage of a particle size and air speed independent sample volume, which is of particular importance for the use on a cable car. HoloGondel is additionally equipped with a temperature, a relative humidity, a pressure and a GPS sensor. Due to a modular design and an independent battery supply for operation up to 20 hours, Holo- Gondel can be easily adapted for different scientific questions and has a large variety of possible applications. In winter 2015 and 2016, HoloGondel was successfully deployed on a cable car at the Eggishorn, Switzerland, which was the first time that vertical profiles of microphysical cloud properties were obtained on a cable car. During these campaigns, HoloGondel measured the microphysical and meteorological cloud properties with a vertical resolution of several meters and confirmed lab- oratory results for resolving cloud particles and discriminating between liquid droplets and ice crystals. In April 2016, HoloGondel was mounted on the supply cable car of the Sonnblick Observatory (SBO) in the Hohen Tauern, Austria. Based on the vertical profiles of the ob- served microphysical cloud properties different cloud processes, e.g. seeder-feeder and Wegener- Bergeron-Findeisen (WBF) process, are discussed. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of liquid droplets on a sub-meter and millimeter scale is analyzed on a qualitative level. The observed ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) with HoloGondel on cable cars is an order of magnitude smaller than the ICNC regularly observed at mountain-top research stations. To assess the possible impact of surface processes on ICNC measured at mountain-top research stations, a field campaign was conducted at the SBO. HoloGondel was mounted on an elevator attached to the meteorological tower of the SBO to obtain vertical profiles of the ICNC up to 10 m above the surface. A decrease of the ICNC within the observed height interval by a factor of 2 to 10 suggests a strong influence of surface processes on the measured ICNC at mountain-top research stations. In addition, two near-surface processes are proposed to modify the ICNC even when the surface is not covered with snow.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000250847",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/250847","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","holography, clouds","Observing the Microstructure of Orographic Clouds with HoloGondel","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2018-03-19T08:24:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24520",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we use observation-based estimates of the interannual variations in evapotranspiration (ET), net biome productivity (NBP), as well as the present-day sensitivity of NBP to climate variations, to constrain globally the terrestrial carbon cycle feedbacks as simulated by models that participated in the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP5). The constraints result in a ca. 40% lower response of NBP to climate change and a ca. 30% reduction in the strength of the CO2 fertilization effect relative to the unconstrained multi-model mean. While the unconstrained CMIP5 models suggest an increase in the cumulative terrestrial carbon storage (477 PgC) in response to an idealized scenario of 1%/year atmospheric CO2 increase, the constraints imply a ca. 19% smaller change. Overall, the applied emerging constraint approach offers a possibility to reduce uncertainties in the projections of the terrestrial carbon cycle, which is a key determinant of the future trajectory of atmospheric CO2 concentration and resulting climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000128585",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/12/1/014009","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128585","en","Institute of Physics",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","CMIP5 models||CO2 fertilization||Emergent constraints||Evapotranspiration||Terrestrial carbon cycle feedbacks","Hydrological and biogeochemical constraints on terrestrial carbon cycle feedbacks","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T19:50:50Z",,,,"pub:191496",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593655441e7d873098","005253059",,"85011347254","000410387700001","Environ.

Every year, natural variability in climatic conditions worldwide leads to droughts and floods which have significant impacts for ecosystems and societies. All water reservoirs act as natural buffers and balance these fluctuations by providing water supply during dry conditions and by storing water surplus after rain and snow events. However, these changes in terrestrial water storage do not only reflect a response to climate variability, they also feed back to the energy and carbon cycles, introducing a complex picture of inter-annual variability and delayed response mechanisms within the climate system. Since 2002, the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites have provided the very first global observations of terrestrial water storage changes, allowing for entirely new analyses on the role of this variable for the Earth system and the degree to which human activities impact freshwater resources. However, while a large number of regional studies have provided a rich overview on individual aspects of water storage changes, there are still few global assessments of the sensitivity of terrestrial water storage to changes in atmospheric conditions. In addition, our understanding of how extremes in water storage feed back to the global energy and carbon cycles is still very uncertain. This is partly because some of these effects occur on inter-annual to decadal time scales and are therefore difficult to identify from the relatively short GRACE record. The overarching goal of this thesis, which is organized in three individual studies, is to resolve these important research gaps. The first study presented in this thesis provides a global survey of the spatial and temporal modes of variability found in GRACE observations of terrestrial water storage changes. An extensive review of the literature shows that these different modes of variability tend to coincide with different hydrological processes and can be partly related to changes in temperature and precipitation. In addition, most of the high-frequency GRACE signal can be explained by precipitation if an adequate averaging filter is applied to the daily precipitation time series. Based on these relationships, the second study makes use of historical precipitation and temperature data to reconstruct terrestrial water storage changes prior to the GRACE mission. The main outcome of this study is an open-access dataset providing estimates of monthly terrestrial water storage changes for the period 1985 to 2015 and at a spatial resolution of 3° (about 330 km). This dataset is shown to be on average superior to hydrological model estimates, which represent the state of the art for estimating past water storage changes. Two potential applications are then illustrated, showing that this dataset can be used to isolate secular trends from climate-driven inter-annual variability and to investigate inter-annual changes in sea level. Finally, the third study is dedicated to the impact of water storage changes on the global carbon cycle. For the first time, a significant negative coupling between changes in terrestrial water storage and year-to-year variations in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate is shown at the global scale. The identified relationship suggests that drier years coincide with a reduction in the assimilation of CO2 by the terrestrial biosphere. In contrast, current dynamic global vegetation models are shown to underestimate the strength of this relationship. These results challenge the prevailing paradigm that tropical temperature is the dominant driver of global fluctuations in the net land carbon flux. They highlight terrestrial water storage as a global driver of changes in carbon cycle-climate feedbacks. Altogether, this thesis demonstrates how fluctuations in terrestrial water storage both influence and respond to climate variability, stressing the importance of an accurate representation of this variable in Earth system models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000273375",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/273375","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Water cycle||carbon cycle||Terrestrial water storage||Climate variability||Earth Observation||Water Resources||GLOBAL CHANGE + GLOBAL WARMING (CLIMATOLOGY)||Drought||BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLE (BIOGEOCHEMISTRY)||Statistical analysis||Earth System Model||RAINFALL-RUNOFF RELATION (HYDROLOGY)","Terrestrial water storage: large-scale variability and impacts on the global carbon cycle","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2018-07-02T11:19:33Z","2019-07-02",,,,,"yes",,,,"Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate","617518","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7","24696",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Specifically, we compare a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) RCP 8.5 climate change scenario, covering the simulation period from 2005 to 2300, to a historical simulation, covering the simulation period from 1850 to 2005. In RCP 8.5, the OHT declines by 30–50 % in comparison to the historical simulation in the North Atlantic by the end of the 23rd century. The decline in the OHT is accompanied by a change in the seasonal cycle of the total OHT and its components. We decompose the OHT into overturning and gyre component. For the OHT seasonal cycle, we find a northward shift of 5° and latitude-dependent shifts between 1 and 6 months that are mainly associated with changes in the meridional velocity field. We find that the changes in the OHT seasonal cycle predominantly result from changes in the wind-driven surface circulation, which projects onto the overturning component of the OHT in the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic. This leads in turn to latitude-dependent shifts between 1 and 6 months in the overturning component. In comparison to the historical simulation, in the subpolar North Atlantic, in RCP 8.5 we find a reduction of the North Atlantic Deep Water formation and changes in the gyre heat transport result in a strongly weakened seasonal cycle with a weakened amplitude by the end of the 23rd century.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000189454",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-8-129-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/189454","en","Copernicus Publ.",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Changes in the seasonal cycle of the Atlantic meridional heat transport in a RCP 8.5 climate projection in MPI-ESM","Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2017-10-04T08:20:03Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Earth System Dynamics","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Interpre-tation of these diagnostics requires detailed knowledge of theradiative, chemical, dynamical, and physical processes incor-porated in the models.

Within this model system, using OASIS3-MCT as a coupler, CCLM can be coupled to two land surface models (the Community Land Model (CLM) and VEG3D), the NEMO-MED12 regional ocean model for the Mediterranean Sea, two ocean models for the North and Baltic seas (NEMO-NORDIC and TRIMNP+CICE) and the MPI-ESM Earth system model.  We first present the different model components and the unified OASIS3-MCT interface which handles all couplings in a consistent way, minimising the model source code modifications and defining the physical and numerical aspects of the couplings. We also address specific coupling issues like the handling of different domains, multiple usage of the MCT library and exchange of 3-D fields.  We analyse and compare the computational performance of the different couplings based on real-case simulations over Europe. The usage of the LUCIA tool implemented in OASIS3-MCT enables the quantification of the contributions of the coupled components to the overall coupling cost. These individual contributions are (1) cost of the model(s) coupled, (2) direct cost of coupling including horizontal interpolation and communication between the components, (3) load imbalance, (4) cost of different usage of processors by CCLM in coupled and stand-alone mode and (5) residual cost including i.a. CCLM additional computations.  Finally a procedure for finding an optimum processor configuration for each of the couplings was developed considering the time to solution, computing cost and parallel efficiency of the simulation. The optimum configurations are presented for sequential, concurrent and mixed (sequential+concurrent) coupling layouts. The procedure applied can be regarded as independent of the specific coupling layout and coupling details.  We found that the direct cost of coupling, i.e. communications and horizontal interpolation, in OASIS3-MCT remains below 7% of the CCLM stand-alone cost for all couplings investigated. This is in particular true for the exchange of 450 2-D fields between CCLM and MPI-ESM. We identified remaining limitations in the coupling strategies and discuss possible future improvements of the computational efficiency.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000130781",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-10-1549-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/130781","en","Copernicus Publications",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The COSMO-CLM 4.8 regional climate model coupled to regional ocean, land surface and global earth system models using OASIS3-MCT: Description and performance","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T21:01:11Z",,,,"pub:193812",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936556ec479274331","010180250",,"85017614264","000399753700002","Geosci. model dev.","4","Geoscientific Model Development","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The estimated annual global total for the reference simulation is 634TgCyr−1 (simulation period 2000–2012). Isoprene is the main contributor to the average emission total, accounting for 66% (417TgCyr−1), followed by several monoterpenes (12%), methanol (7%), acetone (3.6%), and ethene (3.6%). Regionally, most of the high annual emissions are found to be associated with tropical regions and tropical vegetation types.  In order to evaluate the implementation of the biogenic model in ECHAM-HAMMOZ, global and regional biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions of the reference simulation were compared to previous published experiment results with MEGAN. Several sensitivity simulations were performed to study the impact of different model input and parameters related to the vegetation cover and the ECHAM6 climate. BVOC emissions obtained here are within the range of previous published estimates. The large range of emission estimates can be attributed to the use of different input data and empirical coefficients within different setups of MEGAN. The biogenic model shows a high sensitivity to the changes in plant functional type (PFT) distributions and associated emission factors for most of the compounds. The global emission impact for isoprene is about −9%, but reaches +75% for α-pinene when switching from global emission factor maps to PFT-specific emission factor distributions. The highest sensitivity of isoprene emissions is calculated when considering soil moisture impact, with a global decrease of 12.5% when the soil moisture activity factor is included in the model parameterization. Nudging ECHAM6 climate towards ERA-Interim reanalysis has an impact on the biogenic emissions, slightly lowering the global total emissions and their interannual variability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000129118",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-10-903-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/129118","en","Copernicus Publications",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Implementation of the MEGAN (v2.1) biogenic emission model in the ECHAM6-HAMMOZ chemistry climate model","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T20:09:34Z",,,,"pub:192077",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936554f4079475861","010180250",,"85014013407","000395112500001","Geosci. model dev.","2","Geoscientific Model Development","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Our results suggest that these very high O3 episodes were originated by three main contributions: (i) the surface fumigation from high O3 reservoir layers located at 1500–3000 m a.g.l. (according to modelling and non-tethered balloon measurements), and originated during the previous day(s) injections of polluted air masses at high altitude; (ii) local/regional photochemical production and transport (at lower heights) from the BMA and the surrounding coastal settlements, into the inland valleys; and (iii) external (to the study area) contributions of both O3 and precursors. These processes gave rise to maximal O3 levels in the inland plains and valleys northwards from the BMA when compared to the higher mountain sites. Thus, a maximum O3 concentration was observed within the lower tropospheric layer, characterised by an upward increase of O3 and black carbon (BC) up to around 100–200 m a.g.l. (reaching up to 300 µg m−3 of O3 as a 10 s average), followed by a decrease of both pollutants at higher altitudes, where BC and O3 concentrations alternate in layers with parallel variations, probably as a consequence of the atmospheric transport from the BMA and the return flows (to the sea) of strata injected at certain heights the previous day(s). At the highest altitudes reached in this study with the tethered balloons (900–1000 m a.g.l.) during the campaign, BC and O3 were often anti-correlated or unrelated, possibly due to a prevailing regional or even hemispheric contribution of O3 at those altitudes. In the central hours of the days a homogeneous O3 distribution was evidenced for the lowest 1 km of the atmosphere, although probably important variations could be expected at higher levels, where the high O3 return strata are injected according to the modelling results and non-tethered balloon data.  Relatively low concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFPs) were found during the study, and nucleation episodes were only detected in the boundary layer.  Two types of O3 episodes were identified: type A with major exceedances of the O3 information threshold (180 µg m−3 on an hourly basis) caused by a clear daily concatenation of local/regional production with accumulation (at upper levels), fumigation and direct transport from the BMA (closed circulation); and type B with regional O3 production without major recirculation (or fumigation) of the polluted BMA/regional air masses (open circulation), and relatively lower O3 levels, but still exceeding the 8 h averaged health target.  To implement potential O3 control and abatement strategies two major key tasks are proposed: (i) meteorological forecasting, from June to August, to predict recirculation episodes so that NOx and VOC abatement measures can be applied before these episodes start; (ii) sensitivity analysis with high-resolution modelling to evaluate the effectiveness of these potential abatement measures of precursors for O3 reduction.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000219792",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-2817-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/219792","en","European Geophysical Society",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Phenomenology of high-ozone episodes in NE Spain","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-12-11T13:43:01Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","4","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

CNT parameterization schemes describe immersion freezing as a stochastic process, including the properties of insoluble aerosol particles in the droplets. There are different ways to parameterize the properties of aerosol particles (i.e., contact angle schemes), which are compiled and tested in this paper. The goal of this study is to find a parameterization scheme for GCMs to describe immersion freezing with the ability to shift and adjust the slope of the freezing curve compared to homogeneous freezing to match experimental data.  We showed in a previous publication that the resulting freezing curves from CNT are very sensitive to unconstrained kinetic and thermodynamic parameters in the case of homogeneous freezing. Here we investigate how sensitive the outcome of a parameter estimation for contact angle schemes from experimental data is to unconstrained kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. We demonstrate that the parameters describing the contact angle schemes can mask the uncertainty in thermodynamic and kinetic parameters.  Different CNT formulations are fitted to an extensive immersion freezing dataset consisting of size-selected measurements as a function of temperature and time for different mineral dust types, namely kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, microcline (K-feldspar), and Arizona test dust. We investigated how accurate different CNT formulations (with estimated fit parameters for different contact angle schemes) reproduce the measured freezing data, especially the time and particle size dependence of the freezing process. The results are compared to a simplified deterministic freezing scheme. In this context, we evaluated which CNT-based parameterization scheme able to represent particle properties is the best choice to describe immersion freezing in a GCM.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000128558",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-1713-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128558","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Classical nucleation theory of immersion freezing: Sensitivity of contact angle schemes to thermodynamic and kinetic parameters","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T19:50:50Z",,,,"pub:191468",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593655437f24f65442","004294181",,"85011634405","000395097100004","Atmos. chem. phys.","3","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

So far it has not been tested whether these results are comparable to geoengineering simulations in which cirrus clouds are seeded with INPs. We compare simulations where the ice crystal sedimentation velocity is increased at temperatures colder than −35°C with simulations of cirrus seeding with INPs using the ECHAM-HAM general circulation model. The radiative flux response of the two methods shows a similar behaviour in terms of annual and seasonal averages. Both methods decrease surface temperature but increase precipitation in response to a decreased atmospheric stability. Moreover, simulations of seeding with INPs lead to a decrease in liquid clouds, which counteracts part of the cooling due to changes in cirrus clouds. The liquid cloud response is largely avoided in a simulation where seeding occurs during night only. Simulations with increased ice crystal sedimentation velocity, however, lead to counteracting mixed-phase cloud responses. The increased sedimentation velocity simulations can counteract up to 60% of the radiative effect of CO2 doubling with a maximum net top-of-the-atmosphere forcing of −2. 2Wm−2. They induce a 30% larger surface temperature response, due to their lower altitude of maximum diabatic forcing compared with simulations of seeding with INPs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000130794",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-4871-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/130794","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Is increasing ice crystal sedimentation velocity in geoengineering simulations a good proxy for cirrus cloud seeding?","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T21:01:11Z",,,,"pub:193825",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936556f13d1414891","004294181",,"85017574222","000403956400003","Atmos. chem. phys.","7","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This review presumes that ice preserved in pores is responsible for pre-activation and analyses pre-activation under this presumption. Idealized trajectories of air parcels are used to discuss the pore characteristics needed for ice to persist in pores and to induce macroscopic ice growth out of the pores. The pore width needed to keep pores filled with water decreases with decreasing relative humidity as described by the inverse Kelvin equation. Thus, narrow pores remain filled with ice well below ice saturation. However, the smaller the pore width, the larger the melting and freezing point depressions within the pores. Therefore, pre-activation due to pore ice is constrained by the melting of ice in narrow pores and the sublimation of ice from wide pores imposing restrictions on the temperature and relative humidity range of pre-activation for cylindrical pores. Ice is better protected in ink-bottle-shaped pores with a narrow opening leading to a large cavity. However, whether pre-activation is efficient also depends on the capability of ice to grow macroscopically, i.e. out of the pore. A strong effect of pre-activation is expected for swelling pores, because at low relative humidity (RH) their openings narrow and protect the ice within them against sublimation. At high relative humidities, they open up and the ice can grow to macroscopic size and form an ice crystal. Similarly, ice protected in pockets is perfectly sheltered against sublimation but needs the dissolution of the surrounding matrix to be effective. Pores partially filled with condensable material may also show pre-activation. In this case, complete filling occurs at lower RH than for empty pores and freezing shifts to lower temperatures.  Pre-activation experiments confirm that materials susceptible to pre-activation are indeed porous. Pre-activation was observed for clay minerals like illite, kaolinite, and montmorillonite with inherent porosity. The largest effect was observed for the swelling clay mineral montmorillonite. Some materials may acquire porosity, depending on the formation and processing conditions. Particles of CaCO3, meteoritic material, and volcanic ash showed pre-activation for some samples or in some studies but not in other ones. Quartz and silver iodide were not susceptible to pre-activation.  Atmospheric relevance of pre-activation by ice preserved in pores may not be generally given but depend on the atmospheric scenario. Lower-level cloud seeding by pre-activated particles released from high-level clouds crucially depends on the ability of pores to retain ice at the relative humidities and temperatures of the air masses they pass through. Porous particles that are recycled in wave clouds may show pre-activation with subsequent ice growth as soon as ice saturation is exceeded after having passed a first cloud event. Volcanic ash particles and meteoritic material likely influence ice cloud formation by pre-activation. Therefore, the possibility of pre-activation should be considered when ice crystal number densities in clouds exceed the number of ice-nucleating particles measured at the cloud forming temperature.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000128570",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-1595-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128570","en","European Geophysical Society",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Pre-activation of aerosol particles by ice preserved in pores","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T19:50:50Z",,,,"pub:191481",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365543c3e0144944","004294181",,"85011579137","000395096200001","Atmos. chem. phys.","3","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A combination of a scanning mobility particle sizer and an Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer was used to determine SOA mass concentration and chemical composition. We used a Monte Carlo approach to parameterize smog chamber SOA yields as a function of the condensed phase absorptive mass, which includes the sum of OA and the corresponding bound liquid water content. High RH increased SOA yields by up to 6 times (1.5–6.4) compared to low RH. The yields at low NOx∕VOC ratios were in general higher compared to yields at high NOx∕VOC ratios. This NOx dependence follows the same trend as seen in previous studies for α-pinene SOA.  A novel approach of data evaluation using volatility distributions derived from experimental data served as the basis for thermodynamic phase partitioning calculations of model mixtures in this study. These calculations predict liquid–liquid phase separation into organic-rich and electrolyte phases. At low NOx conditions, equilibrium partitioning between the gas and liquid phases can explain most of the increase in SOA yields observed at high RH, when in addition to the α-pinene photo-oxidation products described in the literature, fragmentation products are added to the model mixtures. This increase is driven by both the increase in the absorptive mass and the solution non-ideality described by the compounds' activity coefficients. In contrast, at high NOx, equilibrium partitioning alone could not explain the strong increase in the yields with RH. This suggests that other processes, e.g. reactive uptake of semi-volatile species into the liquid phase, may occur and be enhanced at higher RH, especially for compounds formed under high NOx conditions, e.g. carbonyls.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191299",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-5035-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191299","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Assessing the influence of NOx concentrations and relative humidity on secondary organic aerosol yields from alpha-pinene photo-oxidation through smog chamber experiments and modelling calculations","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:06:05Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85018479988","000403958200001","Atmos. chem. phys.","8","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

CFDCs have been deployed for decades to measure the formation of INPs under controlled humidity and temperature conditions in laboratory studies and by ambient aerosol populations. These measurements have, in turn, been used to construct parameterizations for use in models by relating the formation of ice crystals to state variables such as temperature and humidity as well as aerosol particle properties such as composition and number. We show here that assumptions of ideal instrument behavior are not supported by measurements made with a commercially available CFDC, the SPectrometer for Ice Nucleation (SPIN), and the instrument on which it is based, the Zurich Ice Nucleation Chamber (ZINC). Non-ideal instrument behavior, which is likely inherent to varying degrees in all CFDCs, is caused by exposure of particles to different humidities and/or temperatures than predicated from instrument theory of operation. This can result in a systematic, and variable, underestimation of reported INP concentrations. We find here variable correction factors from 1.5 to 9.5, consistent with previous literature values. We use a machine learning approach to show that non-ideality is most likely due to small-scale flow features where the aerosols are combined with sheath flows. Machine learning is also used to minimize the uncertainty in measured INP concentrations. We suggest that detailed measurement, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, be performed to characterize this uncertainty.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190733",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-10855-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190733","en","Copernicus Publications",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Uncertainty in counting ice nucleating particles with continuous flow diffusion chambers","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:25:35Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,"Elucidating Ice Nucleation Mechanisms Relevant to the Atmosphere: Is deposition nucleation really immersion freezing in pores?","156581","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,"85029505904","000410640000001","Atmos. chem. phys.","17","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The past1000 transient simulations serve to investigate the response to (mainly) natural forcing under background conditions not too different from today, and to discriminate between forced and internally generated variability on interannual to centennial timescales. This paper describes the motivation and the experimental set-ups for the PMIP4-CMIP6 past1000 simulations, and discusses the forcing agents orbital, solar, volcanic, and land use/land cover changes, and variations in greenhouse gas concentrations. The past1000 simulations covering the pre-industrial millennium from 850 Common Era (CE) to 1849 CE have to be complemented by historical simulations (1850 to 2014 CE) following the CMIP6 protocol. The external forcings for the past1000 experiments have been adapted to provide a seamless transition across these time periods. Protocols for the past1000 simulations have been divided into three tiers. A default forcing data set has been defined for the Tier 1 (the CMIP6 past1000) experiment. However, the PMIP community has maintained the flexibility to conduct coordinated sensitivity experiments to explore uncertainty in forcing reconstructions as well as parameter uncertainty in dedicated Tier 2 simulations. Additional experiments (Tier 3) are defined to foster collaborative model experiments focusing on the early instrumental period and to extend the temporal range and the scope of the simulations. This paper outlines current and future research foci and common analyses for collaborative work between the PMIP and the observational communities (reconstructions, instrumental data).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000211928",,"1991-9603||1991-959X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/123932||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/211928","10.5194/gmd-10-4005-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/223889","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Climate and Earth system modelling||CMIP6||PMIP||Last millennium||Natural forcing","The PMIP4 contribution to CMIP6 - Part 3: The last millennium, scientific objective, and experimental design for the PMIP4 past1000 simulations","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T17:14:21Z",,,,"pub:186371",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"010180235",,"85033382934","000414599900001","Geosci. model dev.","11","Geoscientific Model Development","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These observations are consistent with theoretical considerations of a warming climate. However, until recently these trends have not been shown to consistently affect dry regions over land. A recent study, published by Donat et al. (2016), now identified significant increases in annual-maximum daily extreme precipitation (Rx1d) and annual precipitation totals (PRCPTOT) in dry regions. Here, we revisit the applied methods and explore the sensitivity of changes in precipitation extremes and annual totals to alternative choices of defining a dry region (i.e. in terms of aridity as opposed to precipitation characteristics alone). We find that (a) statistical artifacts introduced by data pre-processing based on a time-invariant reference period lead to an overestimation of the reported trends by up to 40%, and that (b) the reported trends of globally aggregated extremes and annual totals are highly sensitive to the definition of a ""dry region of the globe"". For example, using the same observational dataset, accounting for the statistical artifacts, and based on different aridity-based dryness definitions, we find a reduction in the positive trend of Rx1d from the originally reported +1.6%decade−1 to +0.2 to +0.9%decade−1 (period changes for 1981–2010 averages relative to 1951–1980 are reduced to −1.32 to +0.97% as opposed to +4.85% in the original study). If we include additional but less homogenized data to cover larger regions, the global trend increases slightly (Rx1d: +0.4 to +1.1%decade−1), and in this case we can indeed confirm (partly) significant increases in Rx1d. However, these globally aggregated estimates remain uncertain as considerable gaps in long-term observations in the Earth's arid and semi-arid regions remain. In summary, adequate data pre-processing and accounting for uncertainties regarding the definition of dryness are crucial to the quantification of spatially aggregated trends in precipitation extremes in the world's dry regions. In view of the high relevance of the question to many potentially affected stakeholders, we call for a well-reflected choice of specific data processing methods and the inclusion of alternative dryness definitions to guarantee that communicated results related to climate change be robust.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000128415",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-21-441-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128415","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Have precipitation extremes and annual totals been increasing in the world's dry regions over the last 60 years?","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T19:44:21Z",,,,"pub:191325",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593655408e8c798700","010847162",,"85010788203","000395175400002","Hydrol.

Laboratory verification and validation experiments confirm the accuracy of the thermodynamic conditions of temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) in HINC with uncertainties in T of ±0.4 K and in RH with respect to water (RHw) of ±1.5 %, which translates into an uncertainty in RH with respect to ice (RHi) of ±3.0 % at T > 235 K. For further validation of HINC as a field instrument, two measurement campaigns were conducted in winters 2015 and 2016 at the High Altitude Research Station Jungfraujoch (JFJ; Switzerland, 3580 m a. s. l. ) to sample ambient INPs. During winters 2015 and 2016 the site encountered free-tropospheric conditions 92 and 79 % of the time, respectively. We measured INP concentrations at 242 K at water-subsaturated conditions (RHw = 94 %), relevant for the formation of ice clouds, and in the water-supersaturated regime (RHw = 104 %) to represent ice formation occurring under mixed-phase cloud conditions. In winters 2015 and 2016 the median INP concentrations at RHw = 94 % was below the minimum detectable concentration. At RHw = 104 %, INP concentrations were an order of magnitude higher, with median concentrations in winter 2015 of 2.8 per standard liter (std L−1; normalized to standard T of 273 K and pressure, p, of 1013 hPa) and 4.7 std L−1 in winter 2016. The measurements are in agreement with previous winter measurements obtained with the Portable Ice Nucleation Chamber (PINC) of 2.2 std L−1 at the same location. During winter 2015, two events caused the INP concentrations at RHw = 104 % to significantly increase above the campaign average. First, an increase to 72.1 std L−1 was measured during an event influenced by marine air, arriving at the JFJ from the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea. The contribution from anthropogenic or other sources can thereby not be ruled out. Second, INP concentrations up to 146.2 std L−1 were observed during a Saharan dust event. To our knowledge this is the first time that a clear enrichment in ambient INP concentration in remote regions of the atmosphere is observed during a time of marine air mass influence, suggesting the importance of marine particles on ice nucleation in the free troposphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000225752",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-15199-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/225752","en","Copernicus GmbH",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The Horizontal Ice Nucleation Chamber (HINC): INP measurements at conditions relevant for mixed-phase clouds at the High Altitude Research Station Jungfraujoch","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-05T02:54:48Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85030562309","000418426000001","Atmos. chem. phys.","24","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Even though the processes involved are complex, aerosol–cloud interactions are often analyzed by means of bivariate relationships. In this study, 15 years (2001–2015) of monthly satellite-retrieved near-global aerosol products are combined with reanalysis data of various meteorological parameters to predict satellite-derived marine liquid-water cloud occurrence and properties by means of region-specific artificial neural networks. The statistical models used are shown to be capable of predicting clouds, especially in regions of high cloud variability. On this monthly scale, lower-tropospheric stability is shown to be the main determinant of cloud fraction and droplet size, especially in stratocumulus regions, while boundary layer height controls the liquid-water amount and thus the optical thickness of clouds. While aerosols show the expected impact on clouds, at this scale they are less relevant than some meteorological factors. Global patterns of the derived sensitivities point to regional characteristics of aerosol and cloud processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000192420",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-9535-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/192420","en","European Geophysical Society",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Understanding the drivers of marine liquid-water cloud occurrence and properties with global observations using neural networks","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T05:03:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85027217508","000407330200004","Atmos. chem. phys.","15","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The accuracy of these models is vital, not only for understanding and predicting air quality globally, but also since they are used to quantify the contribution of ozone in the troposphere and lower stratosphere to climate change, where its greenhouse effect is largest. We briefly describe available northern mid-latitude ozone measurements, which include representative and reliable data from European sites that extend back to the 1950s. We use the SOCOLv3 (Solar Climate Ozone Links version 3) global chemistry-climate model to investigate the individual terms of the tropospheric ozone budget. These include: inflow from the stratosphere, dry deposition, and chemical formation and destruction. For 1960 to 2000 SOCOLv3 indicates a tropospheric ozone increase at 850 hPa over the Swiss Alps (Arosa) of 17 ppb, or around 30%. This increase is smaller than that seen in the surface ozone measurements but similar to other chemistry-climate models, including those with more complex NMVOC (Non Methane Volatile Organic Compound) schemes than SOCOLv3’s. It is likely that the underestimated increase in tropospheric ozone could be explained by issues in the underlying emissions inventories used in the model simulations, with ozone precursor emissions, particularly NOx (NO + NO2), from the 1960s being too large.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000192370",,"2073-4433",,"10.3390/atmos8090163","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/192370","en","MDPI",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ozone||troposphere||climate change||long-term ozone changes||model evaluation||SOCOL","Tropospheric ozone at northern mid-latitudes: Modeled and measured long-term changes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T04:59:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,"SPARC International Project office","138017","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,,,"85029826844","000411527500008",,"9","Atmosphere","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we use the ECHAM6-HAM global climate model coupled to an aerosol module to analyse whether an impact of anthropogenic aerosol particles on the timing and amount of precipitation can be detected in North Pacific warm conveyor belts. Warm conveyor belts are the strongest precipitation-producing airstreams in extratropical cyclones and are identified here with a Lagrangian technique, i.e. by objectively identifying the most strongly ascending trajectories in North Pacific cyclones. These conveyor belts have been identified separately in 10-year ECHAM6-HAM simulations with present-day and pre-industrial aerosol conditions. Then, the evolution of aerosols and cloud properties has been analysed in detail along the identified warm conveyor belt trajectories. The results show that, under present-day conditions, some warm conveyor belt trajectories are strongly polluted (i.e. high concentrations of black carbon and sulfur dioxide) due to horizontal transport from eastern Asia to the oceanic region where warm conveyor belts start their ascent. In these polluted trajectories a weak delay and reduction of precipitation formation occurs compared to clean warm conveyor belt trajectories. However, all warm conveyor belts consist of both polluted and clean trajectories at the time they start their ascent, and the typically more abundant clean trajectories strongly reduce the aerosol impact from the polluted trajectories. The main conclusion then is that the overall amount of precipitation is comparable in pre-industrial conditions, when all warm conveyor belt trajectories are clean, and in present-day conditions, when warm conveyor belts consist of a mixture of clean and polluted trajectories.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191105",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-6243-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191105","en","European Geophysical Society",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Effect of anthropogenic aerosol emissions on precipitation in warm conveyor belts in the western North Pacific in winter - a model study with ECHAM6-HAM","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T02:50:03Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85019713978","000401801100004","Atmos. chem. phys.","10","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These particles are inherently hygroscopic, that is, they take-up moisture from the air, which affects the extent to which they interact with solar radiation. We demonstrate that the hygroscopic growth of inorganic sea salt is 8–15% lower than pure sodium chloride, most likely due to the presence of hydrates. We observe an increase in hygroscopic growth with decreasing particle size (for particle diameters <150 nm) that is independent of the particle generation method. We vary the hygroscopic growth of the inorganic sea salt within a general circulation model and show that a reduced hygroscopicity leads to a reduction in aerosol-radiation interactions, manifested by a latitudinal-dependent reduction of the aerosol optical depth by up to 15%, while cloud-related parameters are unaffected. We propose that a value of κs=1.1 (at RH=90%) is used to represent the hygroscopicity of inorganic sea salt particles in numerical models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191771",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/ncomms15883","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191771","en","Nature Publishing Group",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Revising the hygroscopicity of inorganic sea salt particles","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:38:15Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,"Physical states of mixed organic-inorganic aerosols","146760","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,,"85021740738","000404576000001","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

With the recent advent of fast laser-based spectroscopic methods, it has become possible to measure the stable isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapour in situ at a high temporal resolution. Here we present results from such comprehensive airborne spectroscopic isotope measurements in water vapour over the western Mediterranean at a high spatial and temporal resolution. Measurements have been acquired by a customized Picarro L2130-i cavity-ring down spectrometer deployed onboard the Dornier 128 D-IBUF aircraft together with a meteorological flux measurement package during the HyMeX SOP1 (Hydrological cycle in Mediterranean Experiment special observation period 1) field campaign in Corsica, France, during September and October 2012. Taking into account memory effects of the air inlet pipe, the typical time resolution of the measurements was about 15–30 s, resulting in an average horizontal resolution of about 1–2 km. Cross-calibration of the water vapour measurements from all humidity sensors showed good agreement under most flight conditions but the most turbulent ones. In total 21 successful stable isotope flights with 59 flight hours have been performed. Our data provide quasi-climatological autumn average conditions and vertical profiles of the stable isotope parameters δD, δ18O, and d-excess during the study period. A d-excess minimum in the overall average profile is reached in the region of the boundary-layer top, possibly caused by precipitation evaporation. This minimum is bracketed by higher d-excess values near the surface caused by non-equilibrium fractionation, and a maximum above the boundary layer related to the increasing d-excess in very depleted and dry high-altitude air masses. Repeated flights along the same pattern reveal pronounced day-to-day variability due to changes in the large-scale circulation. During a period marked by a strong inversion at the top of the marine boundary layer, vertical gradients in stable isotopes reached up to 25.4 ‰ 100 m−1 for δD and 24.0 ‰ 100 m−1 for the d-excess.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191721",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-6125-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191721","en","European Geophysical Society",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The stable isotopic composition of water vapour above Corsica during the HyMeX SOP1 campaign: insight into vertical mixing processes from lower-tropospheric survey flights","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-06T03:34:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85019650916","000401476300002","Atmos. chem. phys.","9","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Accurately quantifying this relationship from space is challenging due in part to contamination of aerosol statistics near clouds. Aerosol retrievals near clouds can be influenced by stray cloud particles in areas assumed to be cloud-free, particle swelling by humidification, shadows and enhanced scattering into the aerosol field from (3-D radiative transfer) clouds. To screen for this contamination we have developed a new cloud–aerosol pairing algorithm (CAPA) to link cloud observations to the nearest aerosol retrieval within the satellite image. The distance between each aerosol retrieval and nearest cloud is also computed in CAPA. Results from two independent satellite imagers, the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), show a marked reduction in the strength of the intrinsic aerosol indirect radiative forcing when selecting aerosol pairs that are located farther away from the clouds (−0.28±0.26 W m−2) compared to those including pairs that are within 15 km of the nearest cloud (−0.49±0.18 W m−2). The larger aerosol optical depths in closer proximity to cloud artificially enhance the relationship between aerosol-loading, cloud albedo, and cloud fraction. These results suggest that previous satellite-based radiative forcing estimates represented in key climate reports may be exaggerated due to the inclusion of retrieval artefacts in the aerosol located near clouds.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000211926",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-13151-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/211926","en","European Geophysical Society",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Unveiling aerosol-cloud interactions - Part 1: Cloud contamination in satellite products enhances the aerosol indirect forcing estimate","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-11-22T08:54:21Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85033218029","000414601800004","Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For phase 1 of the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI-1) and, later, for phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) two such stratospheric aerosol data sets were compiled, whose functional capability and representativeness are compared here. For CCMI-1, the ""SAGE-4λ"" data set was compiled, which hinges on the measurements at four wavelengths of the SAGE (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment) II satellite instrument and uses ground-based lidar measurements for gap-filling immediately after the 1991 Mt Pinatubo eruption, when the stratosphere was too optically opaque for SAGE II. For CMIP6, the new ""SAGE-3λ"" data set was compiled, which excludes the least reliable SAGE II wavelength and uses measurements from CLAES (Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer) on UARS, the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, for gap-filling following the Mt Pinatubo eruption instead of ground-based lidars. Here, we performed SOCOLv3 (Solar Climate Ozone Links version 3) chemistry–climate model simulations of the recent past (1986–2005) to investigate the impact of the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991 on stratospheric temperature and ozone and how this response differs depending on which aerosol data set is applied. The use of SAGE-4λ results in heating and ozone loss being overestimated in the tropical lower stratosphere compared to observations in the post-eruption period by approximately 3 K and 0.2 ppmv, respectively. However, less heating occurs in the model simulations based on SAGE-3λ, because the improved gap-filling procedures after the eruption lead to less aerosol loading in the tropical lower stratosphere. As a result, simulated tropical temperature anomalies in the model simulations based on SAGE-3λ for CMIP6 are in excellent agreement with MERRA and ERA-Interim reanalyses in the post-eruption period. Less heating in the simulations with SAGE-3λ means that the rate of tropical upwelling does not strengthen as much as it does in the simulations with SAGE-4λ, which limits dynamical uplift of ozone and therefore provides more time for ozone to accumulate in tropical mid-stratospheric air. Ozone loss following the Mt Pinatubo eruption is overestimated by up to 0.1 ppmv in the model simulations based on SAGE-3λ, which is a better agreement with observations than in the simulations based on SAGE-4λ. Overall, the CMIP6 stratospheric aerosol data set, SAGE-3λ, allows SOCOLv3 to more accurately simulate the post-Pinatubo eruption period.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000211925",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-13139-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/211925","en","European Geophysical Society",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Impacts of Mt Pinatubo volcanic aerosol on the tropical stratosphere in chemistry-climate model simulations using CCMI and CMIP6 stratospheric aerosol data","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-11-22T08:54:21Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85033370086","000414601800003","Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

When pressure is applied to water, the melting and the freezing points both decrease. Conversely, melting and freezing temperatures increase under negative pressure, i.e. when water is stretched. This study presents an extrapolation of homogeneous ice nucleation temperatures from positive to negative pressures as a basis for further exploration of ice nucleation under negative pressure. It predicts that increasing negative pressure at temperatures below about 262 K eventually results in homogeneous ice nucleation while at warmer temperature homogeneous cavitation, i. e. bubble nucleation, dominates. Negative pressure occurs locally and briefly when water is stretched due to mechanical shock, sonic waves, or fragmentation. The occurrence of such transient negative pressure should suffice to trigger homogeneous ice nucleation at large supercooling in the absence of ice-nucleating surfaces. In addition, negative pressure can act together with ice-inducing surfaces to enhance their intrinsic ice nucleation efficiency. Dynamic ice nucleation can be used to improve properties and uniformity of frozen products by applying ultrasonic fields and might also be relevant for the freezing of large drops in rainclouds.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000221361",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-017-16787-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/221361","en","Nature Publishing Group",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ice nucleation triggered by negative pressure","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-12-15T03:00:43Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85036644217","000416891400036","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Within the Aerosol_cci project the susceptibility of cloud properties to changes in aerosol properties is derived from the high-resolution AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer) data set using the Cloud–Aerosol Pairing Algorithm (CAPA) (as described in our companion paper) and compared to susceptibilities from the global aerosol climate model ECHAM6-HAM2 and MODIS–CERES (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer – Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) data. For ECHAM6-HAM2 the dry aerosol is analysed to mimic the effect of CAPA. Furthermore the analysis is done for different environmental regimes. The aerosol–liquid water path relationship in ECHAM6-HAM2 is systematically stronger than in AATSR–CAPA data and cannot be explained by an overestimation of autoconversion when using diagnostic precipitation but rather by aerosol swelling in regions where humidity is high and clouds are present. When aerosol water is removed from the analysis in ECHAM6-HAM2 the strength of the susceptibilities of liquid water path, cloud droplet number concentration and cloud albedo as well as ERFaci agree much better with those of AATSR–CAPA or MODIS–CERES. When comparing satellite-derived to model-derived susceptibilities, this study finds it more appropriate to use dry aerosol in the computation of model susceptibilities. We further find that the statistical relationships inferred from different satellite sensors (AATSR–CAPA vs. MODIS–CERES) as well as from ECHAM6-HAM2 are not always of the same sign for the tested environmental conditions. In particular the susceptibility of the liquid water path is negative in non-raining scenes for MODIS–CERES but positive for AATSR–CAPA and ECHAM6-HAM2. Feedback processes like cloud-top entrainment that are missing or not well represented in the model are therefore not well constrained by satellite observations. In addition to aerosol swelling, wet scavenging and aerosol processing have an impact on liquid water path, cloud albedo and cloud droplet number susceptibilities. Aerosol processing leads to negative liquid water path susceptibilities to changes in aerosol index (AI) in ECHAM6-HAM2, likely due to aerosol-size changes by aerosol processing. Our results indicate that for statistical analysis of aerosol–cloud interactions the unwanted effects of aerosol swelling, wet scavenging and aerosol processing need to be minimised when computing susceptibilities of cloud variables to changes in aerosol.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000211924",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-13165-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/211924","en","European Geophysical Society",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Unveiling aerosol-cloud interactions - Part 2: Minimising the effects of aerosol swelling and wet scavenging in ECHAM6-HAM2 for comparison to satellite data","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-11-22T08:54:21Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85033227771","000414601800005","Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recently, several ozone composites have been published, but trends disagree by latitude and altitude, even between composites built upon the same instrument data. We confirm that the main causes of differences in decadal trend estimates lie in (i) steps in the composite time series when the instrument source data changes and (ii) artificial sub-decadal trends in the underlying instrument data. These artefacts introduce features that can alias with regressors in multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis; both can lead to inaccurate trend estimates. Here, we aim to remove these artefacts using Bayesian methods to infer the underlying ozone time series from a set of composites by building a joint-likelihood function using a Gaussian-mixture density to model outliers introduced by data artefacts, together with a data-driven prior on ozone variability that incorporates knowledge of problems during instrument operation. We apply this Bayesian self-calibration approach to stratospheric ozone in 10° bands from 60° S to 60° N and from 46 to 1 hPa (∼ 21–48 km) for 1985–2012. There are two main outcomes: (i) we independently identify and confirm many of the data problems previously identified, but which remain unaccounted for in existing composites; (ii) we construct an ozone composite, with uncertainties, that is free from most of these problems – we call this the BAyeSian Integrated and Consolidated (BASIC) composite. To analyse the new BASIC composite, we use dynamical linear modelling (DLM), which provides a more robust estimate of long-term changes through Bayesian inference than MLR. BASIC and DLM, together, provide a step forward in improving estimates of decadal trends. Our results indicate a significant recovery of ozone since 1998 in the upper stratosphere, of both northern and southern midlatitudes, in all four composites analysed, and particularly in the BASIC composite. The BASIC results also show no hemispheric difference in the recovery at midlatitudes, in contrast to an apparent feature that is present, but not consistent, in the four composites. Our overall conclusion is that it is possible to effectively combine different ozone composites and account for artefacts and drifts, and that this leads to a clear and significant result that upper stratospheric ozone levels have increased since 1998, following an earlier decline.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000202027",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-17-12269-2017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/202027","en","European Geophysical Society",,"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Reconciling differences in stratospheric ozone composites","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-10-29T02:48:11Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,"SPARC International Project office","138017","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,,,"85031825402","000413018900001","Atmos. chem. phys.","20","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Comparisons with in situ methane measurements at both local and global scales show good agreement. We used the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model tagged simulation, which accounts for the contribution of each emission source and one sink in the total methane, simulated over 2005–2012. After regridding according to NDACC vertical layering using a conservative regridding scheme and smoothing by convolving with respective FTIR seasonal averaging kernels, the GEOS-Chem simulation shows an increase of atmospheric methane total columns of 0.35 ± 0.03 % year−1 between 2005 and 2012, which is in agreement with NDACC measurements over the same time period (0.30 ± 0.04 % year−1, averaged over 10 stations). Analysis of the GEOS-Chem-tagged simulation allows us to quantify the contribution of each tracer to the global methane change since 2005. We find that natural sources such as wetlands and biomass burning contribute to the interannual variability of methane. However, anthropogenic emissions, such as coal mining, and gas and oil transport and exploration, which are mainly emitted in the Northern Hemisphere and act as secondary contributors to the global budget of methane, have played a major role in the increase of atmospheric methane observed since 2005.

However, climate extremes are frequently associated with adverse impacts on socio-economic and ecological systems. For example, heat in combination with drought may severely affect the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, and in some cases these events have the potential to undo several years of ecosystem carbon sequestration. Moreover, the intensity and frequency of several types of climate extremes, such as heat, cold, and heavy rainfall, have been changing in recent years. These changes are projected to continue in the 21st century, thus raising concerns about the capacity of ecological and socio-economic systems to cope with these events in the future.  Nonetheless, our scientific understanding of climate extremes and the mechanistic pathways through which these events propagate into ecological or socio-economic systems, remains limited. The impact of climate extremes varies widely depending on their type and spatio-temporal structure, and these impacts are mediated by the vulnerability and exposure of the system under scrutiny. Therefore, the quantification of these phenomena, and the attribution to their respective drivers across space and time is often ambiguous. Accordingly, closing scientific knowledge gaps and improving methodologies to scrutinise climate extremes and their impacts constitutes a research priority of high societal relevance.  The overarching objective of the present PhD thesis is to improve the quantification of, and contribute to the understanding of climate extremes and their impact on ecosystem-atmosphere interactions. To address these objectives, the thesis relies on joint analyses and integration of observation-based datasets and model ensemble simulations. Specifically, the thesis explores (1) a wide range of generic statistical-methodological considerations, (2) approaches to enable sound process-oriented model ensemble simulations using observation-based constraints, towards (3) a comprehensive attribution of ecosystem impacts arising from climate extremes.  1. Statistical quantification of extremes in observed or simulated spatio-temporal gridded datasets (Part I).  An investigation and quantification of extremes in spatio-temporal datasets requires robust statistical methodologies and diagnostics. Therefore, the thesis scrutinises statistical methods, both empirically and analytically, to explore recent changes in temperature and precipitation extremes in gridded observations. These analyses reveal that conventional statistical methods that are based on a reference period standardisation might induce substantial biases in spatially aggregated estimates of extremes. For example, the occurrence of extremes that exceed two standard deviations in standardised data could be overestimated by 48.2% outside a given reference period of 30 years in independent and identically distributed Gaussian data. Analytical corrections for these kinds of statistical errors are derived in the thesis.  Because climate extremes are inevitably rare in temporally and spatially limited observational records, ensemble simulations constitute an indispensable and complementary tool to scrutinise climate extremes from a statistical perspective, circumventing small sample issues in observations. Hence, the thesis also illustrates how model ensembles can be used as surrogate observations to benchmark statistical methods and metrics for an accurate assessment of climate extremes in observations.  2. Observation-based constraints improve model ensemble simulations of climate extremes and ecosystem impacts (Part II).  Climate model ensemble simulations generated for the purpose of quantifying and attributing climate extremes typically exhibit biases in their output that hinder any straightforward simulation or assessment of impacts. Therefore, I develop, apply, and evaluate tools to constrain climate model ensembles based on observational diagnostics related to land-atmosphere interactions. The application of these constraints simultaneously reduces multivariate biases in model ensembles and thus might offer a novel route to bias correction for climate impact simulations and analyses of climate extremes.  3. Extremes events in the terrestrial biosphere: drivers and attribution (Part III).  Linking or attributing extreme responses in the terrestrial biosphere to climatic drivers is not straightforward because respective analyses often rely on small sample sizes or even singular events in observations. Therefore, I construct an ensemble of climate-ecosystem impact simulations, constrained by observational diagnostics developed in Part II, that is designed (a) to systematically investigate and attribute changes in the intensity and frequency of simulated ecosystem productivity extremes (""EPEs"") to the respective drivers, and (b) to assess the effect of timing and seasonal interaction of EPEs in the terrestrial biosphere. Thus, a perspective centred on ecosystem impacts is adopted.  An analysis of these simulations reveals that (a) recent trends in the intensity of EPEs in Europe are contrasting seasonally, i.e. spring EPEs show consistent trends towards increased carbon uptake, while trends in summer EPEs are predominantly negative (higher net carbon release under drought and heat in summer) or close to neutral. Furthermore, the analyses reveal that (b) spring-summer interacting carbon cycle effects due to climate extremes and thus their timing plays an important role in shaping EPEs in Europe. These interacting effects include both partial compensation of drought or heat wave induced carbon losses in summer due to increased carbon uptake in the preceding spring (driven by higher temperatures), and conversely, spring ""carry-over"" effects into summer arising from depleted soil moisture that exacerbates summer carbon losses.  In conclusion, the thesis lays out a comprehensive framework for systematically quantifying and attributing the impacts of climate extremes in the terrestrial biosphere using joint analyses of observations and model ensembles. The thesis shows that firstly, scrutinising statistical methods and diagnostics, and evaluating observation-based constraints on model ensembles, are key to an improved understanding as well as quantification of climate extremes and their impacts. Secondly, a consequent probabilistic interpretation of climate-ecosystem model ensemble simulations offers novel perspectives on the mechanistic pathways and interacting effects of terrestrial ecosystem responses to climate extremes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000176836",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/176836","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Climate extremes||Land-atmosphere interactions||ensembles||Climate change||carbon cycle||Bias correction","Climate Extremes and their Impact on Ecosystem-Atmosphere Interactions","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2017-08-14T17:48:19Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24361",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, climate change can be a fluid concept for the public to understand as it intrinsically uncertain and involves long time scales. Given the importance of the assessment reports published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) it is essential that this accrued evidence is accessible to policymakers. However, little is understood about how the representation of the science in these reports is perceived, comprehended and used in the decision process. This has only contributed to the overwhelming criticism of the IPCC communication approach, which arguably is not new information but has been apparent in the literature for some time now. Still, few have attempted to systematically evaluate how climate science is visually represented in the IPCC publications. This thesis attempts to fill this gap in understanding by examining how climate visualisations could be more effectively designed and communicated to non-technical audiences.  In a first step, an empirical test was conducted on a central figure from the Summary for Policymakers (SPMs) published in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The results highlight how novice readers, even highly educated ones, are unable to distinguish between different types of uncertainties shown without substantial guidance. Instead, readers saw a great deal of uncertainty in this figure but falsely attributed it to the climate model(s) and ignored the scenario uncertainties. The inability to distinguish between the various sources of climate uncertainties exemplifies the importance of rigorously pretesting SPM visuals. Following up on these findings, a further study was conducted to examine four visual devices typically used by Working Group I (WGI) in the SPMs for the IPCC AR4 and Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) plus two open sourced infographics. Pre-attentive visual features were found to significantly influence the judgement and confidence of readers. While the infographic supported the extraction of relevant information it was not considered to be as legitimate as the scientific looking SPM figures. Thus, providing further evidence that the design structure itself carries important perceptual information. Using an excerpt of the AR5 Synthesis Report (SYR) SPM the final study of this thesis examined the semantic arrangement of the text and visuals in this report. Certain improvement measures were implemented and the new layout was found to be more aesthetically pleasing and attractive than the original. Such findings illustrate that certain improvements in the visual communication can be achieved without altering the IPCC mandate and procedures.  As the preparation work for the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) begins, the timing of this thesis is highly relevant. While we can have no influence on the final outcome of the next assessment cycle, it is our intention to provide IPCC authors with timely and relevant guidance. This work has contributed to our greater understanding of visual communication in the context of climate change but it has also underscored some of the fundamental shortcomings in this research area.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000218167",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/218167","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","climate change||Visualisation analysis||Communication||uncertainty analysis||Science communication||Interdisciplinary research","An interdisciplinary study on scientific visual communication in the context of climate change","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::0 - Computer science, information & general works::0 - Computer science, information & general works||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2017-12-06T10:41:48Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24598",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, since the 1970s, the emissions of greenhouse gases by human activities have become the dominant factor of climate change. Today, global warming is one of the main challenges of the modern society. On centennial time-scales, the solar contribution could still be important for climate. A factor closely related with solar activity is energetic particle precipitation. The impact of energetic particles on atmospheric composition and climate is relatively new area of research. Our aim is: (i) to investigate the influence of solar activity on terrestrial climate during the long term solar changes and (ii) to investigate the impact of energetic particle precipitation, specifically electrons, on atmospheric chemistry and climate. For these purposes we are using SOCOL3-MPIOM chemistry-climate model with interactive ocean. Measurement data from atmospheric monitoring stations shows a significant temperature increase During the early 20th century (1910 – 1940). This period coincided with an increase in both greenhouse gases and solar activity. To determine the main driver for the temperature increase we conducted a comprehensive model study. We considered separately solar UV radiation, solar visible and infrared radiation, energetic particle precipitation, greenhouse gases, ozone precursors, and volcanic eruptions. Globally, our results suggest that the surface warming was mostly induced by increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases. In Europe, however, this temperature increase may have been dominated by an increase of ozone precursors emissions (CO and NOx). The solar radiation in visible and infrared wavebands produced a smaller, yet detectable contribution in temperature trends, especially around Labrador Sea. In 1970s, some human-emitted substances were found to be depleting ozone layer. This was confirmed by observations and an ozone hole over Antarctica was found leading to the prohibition of ozone depleting substances emissions in 1987. Since the ozone layer is the protective shield of Earth against solar UV radiation, a thinning ozone layer is harmful to living beings. At the same time, however, solar UV radiation is responsible for producing ozone. Recent observations of the Sun show that solar activity is gradually decreasing and it has been hypothesized that the Sun might enter a new grand solar minimum in the 21st century. The change in solar radiation might impact the atmospheric chemical composition, temperature and regional climate. In order to investigate the effects of reduced solar activity on these variables, we conducted a model study covering the 21st and 22nd centuries that assumes the Sun will enter a phase of grand solar minimum. Focusing at the end of 21st century, we found that an unusually strong grand solar minimum enhances cooling of the stratosphere and mesosphere due to the presence of high concentrations of the greenhouse gases. We find that the global warming leads to an acceleration of the meridional circulation from tropics to poles and combined with the lower rates of ozone production due to the reduced solar activity, stratospheric ozone concentrations decrease over tropics. Though, based on the ban of ozone depleting substances ozone recovery is expected to happen within the 21st century, we show that total ozone would not recover globally to the levels before the ozone hole as long as grand minimum lasts. This could lead to increase of UV radiation reaching the surface with potential implications for Earth’s ecosystem. Energetic particles constantly bombard the Earth and, as mentioned above, their precipitation into the Earth’s atmosphere is another climate forcing related to solar activity. As part of these particles, energetic electrons can initiate cascades of chemical reactions of which some lead to the production of odd nitrogen oxides and odd hydrogen oxides (NOx and HOx). Due to their low energy (< 30 keV) auroral electrons produce NOx only above the mesosphere while continuously precipitating from magnetosphere. In the polar winter, NOx can descend inside the polar vortex down to the stratosphere where it depletes ozone. Only a recent advance in climate modeling allows implementing this effect of the auroral electrons, which motivated us to analyze their impact on atmospheric chemistry during the Southern Hemispheric winter. Results indicate that around 90% of winter NOx in the polar regions in the upper stratosphere comes from the precipitation of auroral electrons. In accordance with satellite observations, ozone anomalies of around 30% in the mesosphere and around 15% in the stratosphere are found during winters with intense electron precipitation. Electrons of higher energies (middle energy; 30 – 300 keV), precipitate from Earth’s outer radiation belt. They are able to penetrate to lower altitudes than auroral, producing NOx and HOx directly in the mesosphere. Satellite observations of higher energy electron fluxes became available only recently. In order to investigate their impact on atmospheric chemistry and climate, we have included them in our model. We confirm that these electrons, during geomagnetically active periods, significant amounts of NOx and HOx are produced and thus induce ozone depletion. Ozone anomalies in the mesosphere and stratosphere can reach up to 15% and 8%, respectively compared to climatological mean state. Furthermore, by depleting ozone they induce changes in atmospheric temperature and dynamics. Particularly during winters with high electron precipitation, we found anomalous mesospheric warming and stratospheric cooling in both Northern and Southern polar regions. The change in atmospheric temperature and dynamics leads to impact on the surface temperature during boreal winter: cooling around North Pole and warming over continental Asia. Using a single model, we made substantial advances in understanding the influence of solar radiation and energetic electron precipitation on Earth’s chemistry and climate. Nevertheless, we suggest, more models shall include these processes and continue broadening our knowledge about solar influence on climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000215269",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/215269","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"The Influence of Spectral Solar Irradiance and Energetic Particle Precipitation on Climate","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2017-11-29T14:12:07Z","2018-11-29",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24362",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
