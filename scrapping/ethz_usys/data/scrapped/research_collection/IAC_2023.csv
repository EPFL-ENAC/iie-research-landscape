It starts by first clarifying terminological issues concerning “big data” and related terms and by giving an overview of big data elements that can be found in climate research. Second, it discusses data in climate research with a focus on new developments regarding the increase in the volume and complexity of climate data and on how the uncertainty of climate datasets may be assessed. Finally, the chapter addresses the topic of machine learning in climate research and specifically the use of machine learning for the data-driven modeling of climate phenomena.

It dominates surface winds at the valley bottom, contributes to the vertical air mass exchange with the free tropo- sphere, and plays a crucial role in the horizontal air mass exchange with neighboring plains and valleys. The accurate prediction of the valley wind system is therefore crucial for forecasting the weather in complex terrain.  In this study, we assess the ability of the ICON model to resolve along-valley winds in the Inn Valley, by comparing the simulation to measurements from a char- acteristic valley wind day during the CROSSINN campaign (CROSSINN = Cross- valley flow in the Inn Valley). The three-dimensional observations allow us to eval- uate the simulation beyond classical statistical validation techniques and to further investigate the underlying processes (process-based evaluation). Particularly, the thermal forcing is investigated using radiosounding-derived valley-plain tempera- ture and pressure gradients. Besides the model evaluation, we provide a compre- hensive and detailed overview of the observed development of the valley boundary layer during the selected day (13 September 2019, the 8th intensive observational period (IOP8) of CROSSINN).  At 1 km horizontal grid spacing, the ICON model can simulate the daytime up- valley flow well, including its strength, timing, and vertical structure (for the Inn Valley with ridge-to-ridge distance of 10 km or 10 dx). However, during the night the model is not able to correctly represent valley-plain temperature and pressure contrasts, thus deviating from the observed nighttime down-valley flow. We identify three main challenges for the simulation of IOP 8. The first challenge is the observed westerly down-valley flow during the night and morning of IOP 8, which may in- volve a scale interaction with the synoptic westerly flow. The second challenge is the complex interplay between the up-valley wind, the slope circulation, and the cross-valley vortex, which affects the detachment of the up-valley wind from the surface and its transition to higher altitudes.The third challenge pertains to the sta- ble boundary layer and valley cold air pool during the night after IOP 8. The model limitations in representing these processes result in the failure to simulate thermal forcing and the connected down-valley flow in the second night.  The main limitations of the model include the mis-representation of synoptic flow (limited predictability), smaller-scale thermally-driven flows (limited resolu- tion), and cold air pools (stable boundary layer issues). In summary, this study contributes to a better understanding of along-valley winds under non-idealized conditions, and provides ICON’s first process-based model evaluation on thermally driven flows.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000610141",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/610141","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Boundary layer flow||Valley wind system||Along-valley wind||Mountain meteorology||Model evaluation||ICON","Mechanisms of Along-Valley Winds","Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::530 - Physics","2023-04-30T18:51:59Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

If they reach high intensities, they pose a major environmental risk to the densely populated coasts along the sea. Although progress has been made in modelling the dynamics and physical processes relevant for the formation of Mediterranean cyclones, the prediction of extreme Mediterranean cyclones still remains a challenge. While forecast performance is often verified in a climatological context based on years of forecast data, this thesis takes a novel approach and aims to understand how model developments actually affect forecast performance for individual extreme weather events. To this end, we compare three different forecast types from the ECMWF: deterministic forecasts (higher resolution), ensemble fore- casts (lower resolution), and ensemble hindcasts (more modern model versions). On the one hand, this allows us to study the relation between forecast accuracy and model version, and on the other hand, this shows how well a historic event would have been predicted with more recent model ver- sions. In addition, we compare different initialisation times to analyse how forecast accuracy depends on forecast lead time. Our evaluation is based on mean sea level pressure, horizontal wind speed, and precipitation. We focus on both the spatial distribution of forecast errors, and the accuracy of spatially and/or temporally averaged quantities. We find three main errors for forecasts at long lead times: an uncertain position of the cyclone, a timing error of the mature stage (at least 0.5 d), and an underestimated cyclone intensity (winds too weak, precipitation too scarce). These uncertainties become smaller with decreasing lead time, and we notice a distinct jump in forecast accuracy at lead times between 4.5 d and 5 d before the mature stage of the cyclone. However, even the short lead time forecasts do not predict strong winds and heavy precipitation with sufficient accuracy to infer the societal impact of the Mediterranean cyclones. Overall, the ensemble hindcasts are the most accurate forecasts, followed by the deterministic forecasts, and the ensemble forecasts. The advantages of the hindcasts are smaller positional uncer- tainties, and better accuracy at longer lead times (extended skill horizon). Since the hindcasts are based on more recent model versions, this highlights the benefits of the model improvements over time. Still, the forecast accuracy is very variable and each event shows unique error patterns. This reflects the large case-to-case variability of extreme Mediterranean cyclones. Our case study approach indicates potential sources of forecast errors, but specifically designed experiments would be needed in future research, to obtain a detailed analysis of forecast uncertainties.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000608732",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/608732","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Meteorology||Weather prediction||extratropical cyclones","Predictability of extreme Mediterranean cyclones in past and current ECMWF models","Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2023-04-21T07:50:54Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Accurate representation of CAPs in numerical weather prediction models is important because they de termine local temperatures, may deteriorate air quality, and promote high-impact weather such as freezing rain. The CAP episode from 15-16 October, 2017, in the Inn Valley (Austria) has been selected for an evaluation of simulations conducted with the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model 1 km horizontal grid resolution. As this case was part of the Penetration and Interruption of Alpine Foehn (PIANO) field campaign, high abundance of observational data allows for a thorough analy sis of the horizontal and vertical structure of the CAP, as well as of the processes driving the CAP life cycle. The observational data reveals that this CAP episode featured a near-surface air temperature decrease of 17 K during formation and ma ture phase. The vertical expansion of the CAP is limited by a topping inversion at about 1000 m above ground level. ICON exhibits a significant warm bias below the top of the inversion, but manages to simulate the timing of the CAP life cycle well. The emission of longwave radiation from the Earth’s surface towards the atmo sphere proved to be the main mechanism for the simulated cooling, while turbulent heating was responsible for the dissipation of the simulated CAP. The discrepancies between the simulations and observations are mainly related to the representation of radiation and turbulence in the model as well as to the insufficient representation of the complex topography due to a too coarse horizontal resolution of the model.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000611435",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/611435","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","numerical weather prediction||Cold pools||ICON","ICON Model Evaluation: A Cold Air Pool Case Study","Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2023-05-10T09:20:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We bias-adjust and downscale two Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) ensemble outputs, with natural (labelled as hist-nat, driven only by solar and volcanic forcing) and natural plus anthropogenic forcing (labelled as hist, driven by all-forcings), to 0.25∘×0.25∘ spatial resolution. Each ensemble contains six models from ISIMIP, based on the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). The presented downscaling methodology is necessary to create a reliable climate state for regional climate impact studies. Our analysis shows a higher risk of extreme heat events (factor 4 in signal-to-noise ratio) over large parts of CA due to anthropogenic influence. Furthermore, a higher likelihood of extreme precipitation over CA, especially over Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, can be attributed to anthropogenic forcing (over 100% changes in intensity and 20% in frequency). Given that these regions show a high risk of rainfall-triggered landslides and floods during historical times, we report that human-induced climate warming can contribute to extreme precipitation events over vulnerable areas of CA. Our high-resolution data set can be used in impact studies focusing on the attribution of extreme events in CA and is freely available to the scientific community.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000609846",,"2045-2322","10.1038/s41598-023-33921-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/609846","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Anthropogenic influence on extreme temperature and precipitation in Central Asia","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-04-27T15:44:14Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85153910141",,"Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Early warning systems help to reduce these impacts by helping communities prepare for hazardous climate-related events. However, state-of-the-art prediction systems can often not make accurate forecasts of heatwaves more than two weeks in advance, which are required for advance warnings. We therefore investigate the potential of statistical and machine learning methods to understand and predict central European summer heatwaves on time scales of several weeks. As a first step, we identify the most important regional atmospheric and surface predictors based on previous studies and supported by a correlation analysis: 2-m air temperature, 500-hPa geopotential, precipitation, and soil moisture in central Europe, as well as Mediterranean and North Atlantic sea surface temperatures, and the North Atlantic jet stream. Based on these predictors, we apply machine learning methods to forecast two targets: summer temperature anomalies and the probability of heatwaves for 1–6 weeks lead time at weekly resolution. For each of these two target variables, we use both a linear and a random forest model. The performance of these statistical models decays with lead time, as expected, but outperforms persistence and climatology at all lead times. For lead times longer than two weeks, our machine learning models compete with the ensemble mean of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast’s hindcast system. We thus show that machine learning can help improve subseasonal forecasts of summer temperature anomalies and heatwaves.||Significance Statement  Heatwaves (prolonged extremely warm temperatures) cause thousands of fatalities worldwide each year. These damaging events are becoming even more severe with climate change. This study aims to improve advance predictions of summer heatwaves in central Europe by using statistical and machine learning methods. Machine learning models are shown to compete with conventional physics-based models for forecasting heatwaves more than two weeks in advance. These early warnings can be used to activate effective and timely response plans targeting vulnerable communities and regions, thereby reducing the damage caused by heatwaves.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000609655",,"2769-7525","10.1175/AIES-D-22-0038.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/609655","en","American Meteorological Society",,,"Extreme events||Forecasting||Heat wave||Machine learning||Subseasonal variability||Teleconnections","Subseasonal Prediction of Central European Summer Heatwaves with Linear and Random Forest Machine Learning Models","Journal Article||Journal Article","Embargoed",,,"2023-04-26T12:40:21Z","2023-10-13",,,,"yes","Dynamical constraints for the predictability of heat waves in current future climates||Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application||Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events","847456||170523||198896","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF||SNF","H2020||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,"133032746",,,"Artif.

Additionally, models have difficulties simulating explosive cyclone growth. These biases are one of the reasons for the uncertainties in projections of future climate over Europe, and the underlying causes have yet to be determined. All three biases are shown to be related, and diabatic processes are pointed to as a likely cause. To demonstrate this, two hemispherically symmetric storm tracks forming downstream of an idealized sea surface temperature (SST) front on an aquaplanet are examined using the seamless weather and climate prediction model ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic and its grid refinement capabilities. The analyzed perpetual boreal winter has a global grid spacing of 20 km, two bi-directionally interacting grid nests over the Northern Hemisphere that refine the grid to 10-km spacing over much of the stormtrack and further to 5-km spacing near the SST front. In contrast, no grid refinement is performed for the Southern Hemisphere. Feature-based cyclone tracking shows that the poleward propagation in the NH is enhanced, so the high-resolution storm track is less equatorward and less zonal; explosive deepening rates are more frequent and precipitation rates are amplified. The implication is that resolving diabatic processes on the storm scale improves all three intersecting biases in the representation of storm tracks. While new challenges arise at cloud resolving scales, much improvement for the representation of storm tracks will be gained once climate models resolve the meso-γ scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000596915",,"1942-2466","10.1029/2022ms003482","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/596915","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Toward eliminating the decades‐old ”too zonal and too equatorward” storm‐track bias in climate models","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-02-03T09:56:39Z",,,,,"yes","Global Lagrangian Cloud Dynamics","848698","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85148546372",,,"2","Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

WCBs are strongly ascending airstreams in extratropical cyclones that are responsible for most of their precipitation. In conjunction with the cloud formation, latent heat is released, which has an impact on the potential vorticity distribution and therefore on the atmospheric circulation in the middle and upper troposphere. Because of these and other impacts of WCBs, it is of great importance to investigate changes in their frequencies, regions of occurrence, and physical characteristics in a warmer climate. To this aim, future climate simulations (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 - RCP8.5 - scenario; 2091-2100) are performed with the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) and compared to present-day climate (1991-1999). Trajectories are calculated based on 6-hourly 3D wind fields, and WCBs are identified as trajectories that ascend at least 600 hPa in 2 d. WCBs are represented reasonably well in terms of location and occurrence frequency compared to WCBs in the ERA-Interim reanalyses. In a future climate, WCB inflow regions in the North Pacific are systematically shifted northward in winter, which is in agreement with the northward shift of the storm track in this region. In the North Atlantic, increased frequencies are discernible in the southwest and there is a decrease to the south of Iceland. Finally, in the Southern Hemisphere, WCB frequencies increase in the South Atlantic in both seasons and to the east of South Africa and the Indian Ocean in June-July-August (JJA). These changes are partly consistent with corresponding changes in the occurrence frequencies of extratropical cyclones, i.e. the driving weather systems of WCBs. Changes are also found in the WCB characteristics, which have implications for WCB impacts in a future climate. The increase in inflow moisture in the different regions and seasons - ∼23 %-33 % (∼14 %-20 %) in winter (summer) - leads to (i) an increase in WCB-related precipitation - ∼13 %-23 % (∼7 %-28 %) in winter (summer) - especially in the upper percentiles and thus a possible increase in extreme precipitation related to WCBs, (ii) a strong increase in diabatic heating - ∼20 %-27 % (∼17 %-33 %) in winter (summer) - in the mid-troposphere, and (iii) a higher outflow level - ∼10 K (∼10-16 K) in winter (summer) - which favours WCBs more strongly interacting with the upper-level Rossby waveguide. In summary, by investigating a distinct weather system, the WCB, and how it changes in its occurrence frequency and characteristics in a future climate, this study provides new insights into the dynamics and impacts of climate change in the extratropical storm track regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000600372",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-4-133-2023","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/600372","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Warm conveyor belts in present-day and future climate simulations - Part 1: Climatology and impacts","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-02-24T04:56:55Z",,,,,"yes","Understanding the influence of warm conveyor belts in extratropical cyclones on tropopause dynamics: analysis with observations, reanalyses and global climate simulations||An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","185049||787652","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","Projekte MINT||H2020",,,"85147937706",,"Weather Clim.

Air filtration and ventilation mechanically reduce the concentration of airborne viruses and are necessary tools for disease mitigation. However, they ignore the potential impact of the chemical environment surrounding aerosolized viruses, which determines the aerosol pH. Atmospheric aerosol gravitates toward acidic pH, and enveloped viruses are prone to inactivation at strong acidity levels. Yet, the acidity of expiratory aerosol particles and its effect on airborne virus persistence have not been examined. Here, we combine pH dependent inactivation rates of influenza A virus (IAV) and SARSCoV-2 with microphysical properties of respiratory fluids using a biophysical aerosol model. We find that particles exhaled into indoor air (with relative humidity >= 50%) become mildly acidic (pH similar to 4), rapidly inactivating IAV within minutes, whereas SARSCoV-2 requires days. If indoor air is enriched with nonhazardous levels of nitric acid, aerosol pH drops by up to 2 units, decreasing 99%-inactivation times for both viruses in small aerosol particles to below 30 s. Conversely, unintentional removal of volatile acids from indoor air may elevate pH and prolong airborne virus persistence. The overlooked role of aerosol acidity has profound implications for virus transmission and mitigation strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591839",,"0013-936X||1520-5851","10.1021/acs.est.2c05777","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591839","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","influenza virus||SARS-CoV-2||aerosol acidity||airborne transmission||risk mitigation","Expiratory Aerosol pH: The Overlooked Driver of Airborne Virus Inactivation","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-01-12T07:57:21Z",,,,,"yes","Infectivity of influenza viruses in expiratory aerosols under ambient temperatures and humidities (IVEA)||Acidic pH inactivation of SARS-CoV-2  in exhaled breath and expectoration (ApHiCoV)","189939||196729","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Sinergia||Special Call on Coronaviruses",,,"85144384693","000901861300001","Environ.

These factors result in a low signal-to-noise ratio of potential regional and even global trends. Here, we use a statistical method – ridge regression – to create physically interpretable fingerprints for detection of forced changes in mean and extreme precipitation with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The fingerprints are constructed using CMIP6 multi-model output masked to match coverage of three gridded precipitation observational datasets – GHCNDEX, HadEX3, and GPCC –, and are then applied to these observational datasets to assess the degree of forced change detectable in the real-world climate.  We show that the signature of forced change is detected in all three observational datasets for global metrics of mean and extreme precipitation. Forced changes are still detectable from changes in the spatial patterns of precipitation even if the global mean trend is removed from the data. This shows detection of forced change in mean and extreme precipitation beyond a global mean trend, and increases confidence in the detection method's power, as well as in climate models' ability to capture the relevant processes that contribute to large-scale patterns of change.  We also find, however, that detectability depends on the observational dataset used. Not only coverage differences but also observational uncertainty contribute to dataset disagreement, exemplified by times of emergence of forced change from internal variability ranging from 1998 to 2004 among datasets. Furthermore, different choices for the period over which the forced trend is computed result in different levels of agreement between observations and model projections. These sensitivities may explain apparent contradictions in recent studies on whether models under- or overestimate the observed forced increase in mean and extreme precipitation. Lastly, the detection fingerprints are found to rely primarily on the signal in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere, which is at least partly due to observational coverage, but potentially also due to the presence of a more robust signal in the Northern Hemisphere in general.","application/zip||application/netcdf||application/pdf||text/csv||text/plain||application/dbase||application/octet-stream||application/x-shapefile","10.3929/ethz-b-000589377",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589377","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Detection and attribution||Precipitation","Robust global detection of forced changes in mean and extreme precipitation despite observational disagreement on the magnitude of change - code and data","Dataset","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2022-12-29T09:01:56Z",,"indefinite","292278994-08-17T07:12:55Z",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Projected increases in heatwave frequency and severity thus lead to the need for prediction to enhance preparedness and minimize adverse impacts. In this Review, we document current capabilities for heatwave prediction at daily to decadal timescales and outline projected changes under anthropogenic warming. Various local and remote drivers and feedbacks influence heatwave development. On daily timescales, extratropical atmospheric blocking and global land–atmosphere coupling are most pertinent, and on subseasonal to seasonal timescales, soil moisture and ocean surface anomalies contribute. Knowledge of these drivers allows heatwaves to be skilfully predicted at daily to weekly lead times. Predictions are challenging beyond timescales of a few weeks, but tendencies for above-average temperatures can be estimated. Further into the future, heatwaves are anticipated to become more frequent, persistent and intense in nearly all inhabited regions, with trends amplified by soil drying in some areas, especially the mid-latitudes. There is also an increased occurrence of humid heatwaves, especially in southern Asia. A better understanding of the relevant drivers and their model representation, including atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric and soil moisture, and surface cover should be prioritized to improve heatwave prediction and projection.",,,,"2662-138X","10.1038/s43017-022-00371-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587105","en","Nature",,,,"Prediction and projection of heatwaves","Review Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-12-14T12:23:08Z",,,,,"yes","Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application||Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events||European Climate Prediction System||Understanding and quantifying the occurrence of  very rare climate extremes in a changing climate","170523||198896||776613||178778","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||EC||SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche||H2020||Projekte MINT",,,"85143915960","000898684500001","Nat Rev Earth Environ",,"Nature Reviews Earth & Environment","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Heatwaves in particular can in certain cases be predicted on timescales of several weeks in advance. Heatwave predictability is commonly assessed in terms of heatwave intensity. In addition to heatwave intensity, we assess the predictability of heatwave onset and duration, being crucial components of early warning systems and emergency preparedness plans. The forecast skill of heatwaves is investigated over the European region in the sub-seasonal forecasting system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The heatwaves are first detected in ERA-Interim reanalysis data over the period 1998-2017 and then allocated into 6 clusters in the following regions: (a) Black Sea (BSea), (b) Russia (Ru), (c) Western Europe (WEu), (d) North Sea (NSea), (e) Scandinavia (Sc), and (f) Eastern Europe (EEu). The European regions with the highest predictability in heatwave onset and duration are the clusters Ru, Sc and NSea. The WEu cluster has the lowest bias in heatwave intensity and is found to be the most predictable region in terms of the number of heatwave events with predictable intensity at lead week-2. Heatwave intensity is generally found to be the most predictable characteristic of European heatwaves, being predictable by the model ensemble mean up to lead times of 3 weeks. Furthermore, this analysis identifies the most predictable heatwaves, allowing for a further investigation of the physical mechanisms and heatwave characteristics leading to enhanced heatwave forecast skill over different European regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000580965",,"0035-9009||1477-870X","10.1002/qj.4394","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580965","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Heatwaves||sub-seasonal predictability||Europe||ECMWF||heatwave onset||heatwave duration||extreme events","Sub‐seasonal predictability of onset, duration, and intensity of European heat extremes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-11-16T08:27:52Z",,,,,"yes","Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application||Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events","170523||198896","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,"85143885257","000895943600001","Q.

Observational evidence comes from case studies and satellite imagery, but the climatology and annual cycle of vortex shedding are often poorly understood. Using the non-hydrostatic limited-area COSMO model driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis, we conducted a 10-year-long simulation over a mesoscale domain covering the Madeira and Canary archipelagos at high spatial (grid spacing of 1 km) and temporal resolutions. Basic properties of vortex streets were analysed and validated through a 6 d long case study in the lee of Madeira Island. The simulation compares well with satellite and aerial observations and with existing literature on idealised simulations. Our results show a strong dependency of vortex shedding on local and synoptic-flow conditions, which are to a large extent governed by the location, shape and strength of the Azores high. As part of the case study, we developed a vortex identification algorithm. The algorithm is based on a set of criteria and enabled us to develop a climatology of vortex shedding from Madeira Island for the 10-year simulation period. The analysis shows a pronounced annual cycle with an increasing vortex-shedding rate from April to August and a sudden decrease in September. This cycle is consistent with mesoscale wind conditions and local inversion height patterns.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000598244",,"2698-4016||2698-4008","10.5194/wcd-4-189-2023","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/598244","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Vortex streets to the lee of Madeira in a kilometre-resolution regional climate model","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-02-13T14:35:03Z",,,,,"yes","European Climate Prediction System","776613","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85148005864",,"Weather Clim.

The presence of ice-nucleating particles (INPs), a unique fraction of atmospheric aerosols, is vital to trigger the primary formation of ice crystals in MPCs by lowering the energy barrier during the phase transition. Despite the extraordinary scarcity of atmospheric INPs, their role in cloud-phase feedback to climate is indispensable, particularly in the Arctic, where the climate is experiencing accelerated warming (i.e., Arctic amplification). However, unconstrained representations of complex interactions between clouds and aerosols in climate models induce substantial uncertainties in the cloud-phase feedback. These uncertainties are largely hindered by insuﬀicient knowledge on the abundance, variability, properties, sources and predictability of atmospheric INPs. The principal objective of this dissertation is to narrow this knowledge gap by expanding the observational data coverage of Arctic INPs and associated aerosol properties based on extensive in situ measurements. For this purpose, three field campaigns were conducted at different Arctic sites and during different seasons.  During the Ny-Ålesund AeroSol Cloud ExperimeNT (NASCENT) campaign in Svalbard, Norway, in autumn 2019 and spring 2020, INP concentrations and aerosol properties were determined by a set of ground-based measurements. A distinguishable seasonal difference in INP concentrations was not observed during the measurement period. A robust relationship between INP concentrations and the associated physical properties of aerosols could also not be established. In addition, any season-dependent variable (e.g., aerosol burden, fluorescent particle abundance or ambient temperature) would induce a seasonal bias in the prediction of INP concentrations , which is contradictory to our observations of no seasonal difference. We developed a simplistic approach for predicting INP concentrations  based on an atmospheric random dilution model, in which a log-normal frequency distribution of INP concentrations is hypothesized. The novel INP parameterization exhibits consistent predictability of atmospheric INP concentrations in Arctic transition seasons (autumn and spring) as a sole function of nucleation temperature without retrieving additional aerosol property parameters. In addition to developing an INP parameterization, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of ambient aerosol properties within selected cases to deduce the nature and origin of INPs. The heat-lability of INPs exhibited in most samples implies the presence of proteinaceous INPs. Significant correlations were found between autumnal INP concentrations at higher ice nucleation temperatures (e.g., T > -15 °C) and fluorescent particle concentration, high wind speeds over the ocean and concentration of methanesulfonic acid (MSA, an oxidation product of dimethylsulfide (DMS), a precursor gas from marine biological productivity). Therefore, marine biogenic aerosols likely serve as important sources of INPs at the Arctic coastal site during the ice-melting seasons. Moreover, for case studies, while high-latitude dust sources from long-range transport (e.g., coastal Greenland) could contribute to INP abundance, diversity in relative aerosol compositions may have a negligible impact.  We also investigated the summertime INPs from the ship-based Arctic Century Expedition in 2021 over the previously unexplored Eurasian Arctic Ocean. Immersion-mode INP concentrations varied geographically, with high INP concentrations frequently observed over the ice-free ocean and over the marginal ice zones, in particular in the vicinity of land. INP concentrations were relatively low when the ship was located within the ice pack. Results from heat tests, chemical composition analyses and case studies suggest that marine biogenic INPs sporadically contribute to the Arctic INP populations at warm temperatures (T > -15 °C). INP concentrations-resolved backward trajectories demonstrate that peak INP concentrations occurred in locations close to northern Novaya Zemlya, with air masses originating from the western Siberian coast. Moreover, in situ measurements of aerosolized INPs via a sea spray aerosol (SSA) bubble tank generator revealed a high correlation with ambient INP concentrations but no correlation with INP abundance in the subsurface seawater. Our results suggest the potential importance of the aerosolization mechanism for partitioning INPs between the ocean and the atmosphere.  In summary, the present dissertation facilitates a fundamental understanding of primary ice formation relevant for Arctic MPCs by quantifying the abundance, variability and predictability of atmospheric INPs and elucidating the nature and origin of responsible aerosols. Further constraining the role of INPs, particularly their dynamic variations in the warming Arctic, is highly encouraged to reduce the model uncertainties in analyzing the cloud-phase feedback to Arctic amplification.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000605091",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/605091","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Arctic amplification||ice nucleating particles||Cloud microphysics||Climate change","Determining the Abundance, Variability, Sources and Predictability of IceNucleating Particles in the Arctic","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2023-03-27T09:44:39Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,"29136",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanism by which ice interacts with the air. The commonly accepted picture is the presence of a quasi-liquid layer (QLL) on the surface of the ice that increases in thickness with increasing temperature or with increasing concentrations of soluble species. X-ray excited electron spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and partial electron yield X-ray absorption spectroscopy (PEY-XAS) are well-suited surface science techniques to investigate the QLL at the interface between the ice and the air of the atmosphere. While XPS enables a quantitative surface sensitive elemental and chemical composition analysis, PEY-XAS provides insights into the structure of the hydrogen bonding (HB) network in the ice lattice close to the surface. In the frame of this thesis, I investigated the thickness of the QLL on ice as a function of temperature. I developed a careful analysis of the different uncertainties related to PEY-XAS, with a special focus on the assessment of the probing depth in PEY-XAS, using a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of electron scattering. The results indicate that, at the probing kinetic energy (KE) window typically used to detect electrons in PEY-XAS, the escape depth is about ∼3 times larger compared to that of unscattered electrons and that gas phase scattering decreases this factor down to ∼1.5, at 5 mbar. Consideration of electron scattering in PEY-XAS is novel and the improved analysis of the PEY-XAS data reveals that the QLL is of the order of ∼2nm close to the melting point. After the QLL investigation on pure ice, I studied the adsorption of hexylamine (HA) on ice to complement the large literature that is available about the adsorption of acids on ice. I measured the surface coverage of HA as a function of gas-phase partial pressure, and for two different temperatures. I found that a saturated monolayer is present already at a partial pressure of 2 × 10−5mbar, and that more than half of the HA molecules are protonated. The PEY-XAS data revealed that the adsorbed HA on ice at -20°C increases the fraction of water molecules in disordered configurations, and give a PEY-XAS signal similar to that of pure ice at -1°C. This is expected and has been observed in the literature with different acids such as HCl. Finally, I studied the temperature dependence of the surface disorder in liquid water and found that the latter increases with temperature, similar to the QLL on ice. As a logical continuation of the MC simulation results, I established the proof-of-principle of PEY-XAS depth profiling ability on an ice sample, by probing the HB network and the carbon contamination as a function of depth. Last but not least, I investigated the direct impact of gas phase pressure (in this experiment, N2) on the surface disorder of the ice and found no impact at -120°C.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000605153",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/605153","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Ice surface||XPS surface analysis||PEY-XAS||QLL","The thickness of the quasi-liquid layer on ice and its interaction with atmospheric gases as seen by X-ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopies","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2023-03-27T12:15:32Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,"28726",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These are risks expected to become severe due to the potentially detrimental convergence of changing climate conditions with the exposure and vulnerability of human and natural systems. Other papers in this special issue treat each of eight RKRs holistically by assessing their current status and future evolution as a result of this convergence. However, in these papers, such assessment cannot always be organized according to a systematic gradation of climatic changes. Often the big-picture evolution of risk has to be extrapolated from either qualitative effects of “low”, “medium” and “high” warming, or limited/focused analysis of the consequences of particular mitigation choices (e.g., benefits of limiting warming to 1.5 or 2C), together with consideration of the socio-economic context and possible adaptation choices.  In this study we offer a representation – as systematic as possible given current literature and assessments – of the future evolution of the hazard components of RKRs.  We identify the relevant hazards for each RKR, based upon the WGII authors’ assessment, and we report on their current state and expected future changes in magnitude, intensity and/or frequency, linking these changes to Global Warming Levels (GWLs) to the extent possible. We draw on the assessment of changes in climatic impact-drivers relevant to RKRs described in the 6th Assessment Report by Working Group I supplemented when needed by more recent literature.  For some of these quantities - like regional trends in oceanic and atmospheric temperature and precipitation, some heat and precipitation extremes, permafrost thaw and Northern Hemisphere snow cover - a strong and quantitative relationship with increasing GWLs has been identified. For others - like frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones and extra-tropical storms, and fire weather - that link can only be described qualitatively. For some processes - like the behavior of ice sheets, or changes in circulation dynamics - large uncertainties about the effects of different GWLs remain, and for a few others - like ocean pH and air pollution - the composition of the scenario of anthropogenic emissions is most relevant, rather than the warming reached. In almost all cases, however, the basic message remains that every small increment in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and associated warming will bring changes in climate phenomena that will contribute to increasing risk of impacts on human and natural systems, in the absence of compensating changes in these systems’ exposure and vulnerability, and in the absence of effective adaptation. Our picture of the evolution of RKR-relevant climatic impact-drivers complements and enriches the treatment of RKRs in the other papers in at least two ways: by filling in their often only cursory or limited representation of the physical climate aspects driving impacts, and by providing a fuller representation of their future potential evolution, an important component – if never the only one – of the future evolution of risk severity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000612230",,"2212-0963","10.1016/j.crm.2023.100516","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/612230","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"The hazard components of representative key risks The physical climate perspective","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-05-15T14:02:58Z",,,,,"yes","PROjecTing sEa-level rise : from iCe sheets to local implicaTions","869304","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85159271014",,,,"Climate Risk Management","40","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) at which this Snowball bifurcation occurs changes through Earth's history, most notably because of the slowly increasing solar luminosity. Quantifying this critical CO2 concentration is not only interesting from a climate dynamics perspective but also constitutes an important prerequisite for understanding past Snowball Earth episodes, as well as the conditions for habitability on Earth and other planets. Earlier studies are limited to investigations with very simple climate models for Earth's entire history or studies of individual time slices carried out with a variety of more complex models and for different boundary conditions, making comparisons and the identification of secular changes difficult. Here, we use a coupled climate model of intermediate complexity to trace the Snowball bifurcation of an aquaplanet through Earth's history in one consistent model framework. We find that the critical CO2 concentration decreased more or less logarithmically with increasing solar luminosity until about 1 billion years ago but dropped faster in more recent times. Furthermore, there was a fundamental shift in the dynamics of the critical state about 1.2 billion years ago (unrelated to the downturn in critical CO2 values), driven by the interplay of wind-driven sea-ice dynamics and the surface energy balance: for critical states at low solar luminosities, the ice line lies in the Ferrel cell, stabilised by the poleward winds despite moderate meridional temperature gradients under strong greenhouse warming. For critical states at high solar luminosities, on the other hand, the ice line rests at the Hadley cell boundary, stabilised against the equatorward winds by steep meridional temperature gradients resulting from the increased solar energy input at lower latitudes and stronger Ekman transport in the ocean.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000610968",,"2190-4987||2190-4979","10.5194/esd-14-533-2023","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/610968","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Tracing the Snowball bifurcation of aquaplanets through time reveals a fundamental shift in critical-state dynamics","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-05-08T07:21:07Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,"85159364863","000981646000001",,"3","Earth System Dynamics","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
