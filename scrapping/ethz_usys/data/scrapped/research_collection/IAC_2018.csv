In contrast to liquid state particles, the gas phase equilibration to ambient relative humidity (RH) can be kinetically limited and governed by condensed phase diffusion. In water diffusion experiments on highly viscous single aerosol particles levitated in an electrodynamic balance, we observed a characteristic shift behavior of the Mie scattering resonances indicative of the changing radial structure of the particle, thus providing an experimental method to track the diffusion process inside the particle. Due to the plasticizing effect of water, theory predicts extremely steep, front-like water concentration gradients inside highly viscous particles exposed to a rapid increase in RH. The resulting quasi step-like concentration profile motivates the use of a simple core-shell model describing the morphology of the non-equilibrium particle during humidification. The particle growth and reduction of the shell refractive index can be observed experimentally as redshift and blueshift behavior of the Mie resonances, respectively. We can deduce the particle radius as well as a core-shell radius ratio from the measured shift pattern and Mie scattering calculations. Using both the growth information obtained from the Mie resonance redshift and thermodynamic equilibrium data, we can infer a comprehensive picture of the time evolution of the diffusion fronts in the framework of our core-shell model. The observed shift behavior of the Mie resonances provides direct evidence of very steep diffusion fronts caused by the plasticizing effect of water and a method to validate previous diffusivity measurements.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000314681",,"0021-9606||1089-7690",,"10.1063/1.5052216","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/314681","en","American Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Time evolution of steep diffusion fronts in highly viscous aerosol particles measured with Mie resonance spectroscopy","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-01-10T03:27:38Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85059398604",,"000454626000044","J.

The physics package of the global ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) modeling framework has been extended to simulate passive moisture tracers and the stable isotopologues HDO and H182O.  The extension builds on the infrastructure provided by ICON-ART, which allows for high flexibility with respect to the number of related water tracers that are simulated. The physics of isotopologue fractionation follow the model COSMOiso. We first present a detailed description of the physics of fractionation that have been implemented in the model. The model is then evaluated on a range of temporal scales by comparing with measurements of precipitation and vapor.  A multi-annual simulation is compared to observations of the isotopologues in precipitation taken from the station network GNIP (Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation). ICON-ART-Iso is able to simulate the main features of the seasonal cycles in δD and δ18O as observed at the GNIP stations. In a comparison with IASI satellite retrievals, the seasonal and daily cycles in the isotopologue content of vapor are examined for different regions in the free troposphere. On a small spatial and temporal scale, ICON-ART-Iso is used to simulate the period of two flights of the IAGOS-CARIBIC aircraft in September 2010, which sampled air in the tropopause region influenced by Hurricane Igor. The general features of this sample as well as those of all tropical data available from IAGOS-CARIBIC are captured by the model.  The study demonstrates that ICON-ART-Iso is a flexible tool to analyze the water cycle of ICON.

SLOE events are induced by cold advection in the rear of extratropical cyclones. The link between SLOE and d emerges from the fact that a substantial fraction of moisture that precipitates in Reykjavik in winter originates from SLOE events. It is shown that positive anomalies of monthly d co‐occur with positive anomalies in the frequency of SLOE events at the moisture source of Reykjavik precipitation. An intensification and a northeastwards shift of the North Atlantic storm track acts as a driver for the enhanced SLOE frequency in months with positive anomalies in d. This link also implies that in the subpolar North Atlantic, variations of d in monthly (or seasonal) precipitation reveal information about the storm track dynamics in the vicinity of Iceland. Potential implications of this finding for the interpretation of d as a proxy for the location and intensity of storm tracks are discussed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000311015",,,,"10.1002/asl.865","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/311015","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","atmospheric water cycle||Extratropical cyclones||precipitation moisture sources||Stable water isotopes||storm track dynamics||strong ocean evaporation","On the link between the North Atlantic storm track and precipitation deuterium excess in Reykjavik","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-12-15T04:16:34Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85055578990",,"000452162800002",,"12","Atmospheric Science Letters","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The 2015 Paris Agreement aims at reducing climate-related risks by reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero and limiting global-mean temperature increase. Here we quantify the effect of these constraints on global sea-level rise until 2300, including Antarctic ice-sheet instabilities. We estimate median sea-level rise between 0.7 and 1.2 m, if net-zero greenhouse gas emissions are sustained until 2300, varying with the pathway of emissions during this century. Temperature stabilization below 2 °C is insufficient to hold median sea-level rise until 2300 below 1.5 m. We find that each 5-year delay in near-term peaking of CO2 emissions increases median year 2300 sea-level rise estimates by ca. 0.2 m, and extreme sea-level rise estimates at the 95th percentile by up to 1 m. Our results underline the importance of near-term mitigation action for limiting long-term sea-level rise risks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000245198",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-018-02985-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/245198","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate-change impacts||Cryospheric science||Projection and prediction","Committed sea-level rise under the Paris Agreement and the legacy of delayed mitigation action","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-03-01T04:06:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach","641816||641816","10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100007352","SBFI||SBFI","H2020||H2020",,,,,"85042295999",,"000425503500001","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Between 0 °C and -38 °C, liquid water and ice crystals can coexist. Cloud ice initiated by freezing of cloud droplets at these temperatures needs to be catalyzed by an ice nucleating particle (INP). Further growth then often involves collisions of ice crystals and cloud droplets or depositional growth of the ice crystals at the expense of the cloud droplets due to the lower water vapor pressure over the ice crystal than over the liquid droplet surface. At temperatures colder than -38 °C, ice can not only originate from freezing of cloud droplets, but also by freezing of deliquesced aerosols and direct deposition of water vapor onto an INP. The complexity of the ice formation processes is reflected in the spread of simulated cloud ice contents in the current generation of global climate models (GCM). This work describes the implementation and first results of a new cloud microphysics scheme in the ECHAM6-HAM2 GCM aimed to reduce the number of weakly constrained parameters involved in the representation of cloud ice formation and evolution. It does no longer rely on heuristic conversion rates between in-cloud ice crystals and precipitating snow but uses only one single, prognostic ice category which better represents the spectrum of ice crystals in clouds. Because precipitating snow is no longer diagnosed, the trajectory of ice crystals must be fully prognostic. Numerical stability of vertical advection is achieved by an adaptive time step in the microphysics routine which leads to an increase in computation time of roughly 25%. The new scheme significantly reduces the conceptual complexity of the model. Tuning parameters for the ice crystal fall speeds and the conversion to snow are no longer needed. With the introduction of a new cloud cover parameterization the high bias of high cloud cover in the base model version ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3 could be reduced. Overall, the new model is in reasonable agreement with observations in key variables while some deficiencies remain. New model diagnostics are introduced to disentangle the relative importance of ice formation pathways to provide a sound cause-and-effect relation between the simulated cloud fields and the process parameterizations. This analysis revealed that immersion and contact freezing in supercooled liquid clouds only dominate ice formation in roughly 5% of the simulated clouds, a small fraction compared to roughly 64% of the clouds governed by freezing in the cirrus temperature regime below -38 °C. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that even in the mixed-phase temperature regime between -38 °C and 0 °C, the dominant source of ice is the sedimentation of ice crystals that originated in the cirrus regime. The new scheme is used to assess changes in the cloud fields in response to a warming climate. The equilibrium response of the global mean surface temperature to an instantaneous doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations is found to be 3.8 °C which is within the spread of the current generation of GCMs but substantially larger than the base model version ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3 with a value of 2.5 °C. This difference could be narrowed down to different cloud optical depth feedbacks and needs further investigation. Even though clouds are predominantly glaciated already below temperatures of roughly -5 °C, the cloud phase feedback is suppressed. Since most cloud ice is formed in clouds with a large vertical extent and high optical thickness, phase transitions do not significantly increase the optical depth of the cloud.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000309518",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/309518","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Cloud microphysics||Climate sensitivity||Numerical simulation||Cloud ice","Ice clouds: from ice crystals to their response in a warming climate","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2018-12-09T21:49:01Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"A new parameterization scheme for ice and snow in climate models","160177","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)","25312",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

China is the world’s largest emitter of anthropogenic air pollutants, which causes major negative health consequences. The Chinese government has implemented several policies to reduce air pollution, with success in some but far from all sectors. In addition to the health benefits, reducing air pollution will have side-benefits, such as an increase in the electricity generated by the solar photovoltaic panels via an increase in surface solar irradiance through a reduction of haze and aerosol-impacted clouds. We use the global aerosol-climate model ECHAM6-HAM2 with the bottom-up emissions inventory from the Community Emission Data System and quantify the geographically specific increases in generation and economic revenue to the Chinese solar photovoltaic fleet as a result of reducing or eliminating air pollution from the energy, industrial, transport, and residential and commercial sectors. We find that by 2040, the gains will be substantial: the projected solar photovoltaic fleet would produce between 85–158 TWh/year of additional power in clean compared to polluted air, generating US$6.9–10.1 billion of additional annual revenues in the solar photovoltaic sector alone. Furthermore, we quantify the cost of adopting best-practice emission standards in all sectors and find that the revenue gains from the increased solar photovoltaic generation could offset up to about 13–17% of the costs of strong air pollution control measures designed to reach near-zero emissions in all sectors. Hence, reducing air pollution in China will not only have clear health benefits, but the side-effect of increased solar power generation would also offset a sizeable share of the costs of air pollution control measures.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000309077",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0207028","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/309077","en","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Blue skies over China: The effect of pollution-control on solar power generation and revenues","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-12-06T05:53:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Desertection - Social challenges of trans-Mediterranean renewable power cooperation||The transition to a renewable electricity system and its interactions with other policy aims","313553||715132","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC","FP7||H2020",,,,,"85056952623",,"000451054800037","PLoS ONE","11","PLoS ONE","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we show that determining factors for their IN activity include surface ion exchange, NH3 or NH4+ adsorption, as well as surface degradation due to the slow dissolution of the minerals. We performed immersion freezing experiments with the (Na-Ca)-feldspar andesine, the K-feldspar sanidine, the clay mineral kaolinite, the micas muscovite and biotite, and gibbsite (Al(OH)3, a mineral form of aluminum hydroxide) and compare their IN efficiencies with those of the previously characterized K-feldspar microcline and quartz. Samples were suspended in pure water as well as in aqueous solutions of NH3, (NH4)2SO4, NH4Cl and Na2SO4, with solute concentrations corresponding to water activities aw = 0.88–1.0. Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on emulsified micron-sized droplets, we derived onset temperatures of heterogeneous (Thet) and homogeneous (Thom) freezing as well as heterogeneously frozen water volume fractions (Fhet). Suspensions in pure water of andesine, sanidine and kaolinite yield Thet = 242.8 K, 241.2 K and 240.3 K, respectively, while no discernable heterogeneous freezing signal is present in case of the micas or gibbsite (i.e. Thet ≈ Thom ≈ 237.0 K). The presence of NH3 and/or NH4+-salts as solutes has distinct effects on the IN efficiency of most of the investigated minerals. When feldspars and kaolinite are suspended in very dilute solutions of NH3 or NH4+-salts (< 0.1 molal, corresponding to aw > ~ 0.99), Thet shifts to higher temperatures (by 2.6–7.0 K compared to the pure water suspension). Even micas and gibbsite develop weak heterogeneous freezing activities in ammonia solutions. Conversely, suspensions containing Na2SO4 cause Thet of feldspars to clearly fall below the water-activity-based immersion freezing description (Δaw = const) even in very dilute Na2SO4 solutions, while Thet of kaolinite follows the Δaw = const curve. The water activity determines how the freezing temperature is affected by solute concentration alone, i.e. if the surface properties of the ice nucleating particles are not affected by the solute. Therefore, the complex behavior of the IN activities can only be explained in terms of solute-surface-specific processes. We suggest that the immediate exchange of the native cations (K+/Na+/Ca2+) with protons, when feldspars are immersed in water, is a prerequisite for their high IN efficiency. On the other hand, excess cations from dissolved alkali salts prevent surface protonation, thus explaining the decreased IN activity in such solutions. In kaolinite, the lack of exchangeable cations in the crystal lattice explains why the IN activity is insensitive to the presence of alkali salts (Δaw = const). We hypothesize that adsorption of NH3 and NH4+ on the feldspar surface rather than ion exchange is the main reason for the anomalous increased Thet in dilute solutions of NH3 or NH4+-salts. This is supported by the response of kaolinite to NH3 or NH4+, despite lacking exchangeable ions. Finally, on longer timescales (hours to days) the dissolution of the feldspars in water or solutions becomes an important process leading to depletion of Al and formation of an amorphous layer enriched in Si within less than an hour. This hampers the IN activity of andesine the most, followed by sanidine, then eventually microcline, the least soluble feldspar.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000318976",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-2018-1021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/318976","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ice nucleation activity of silicates and aluminosilicates in pure water and aqueous solutions.

According to the relative diffusional growth rate (RDGR) theory, the hydrometeor with the faster diffusional radius growth is charged positively in such collisions. We explore sensitivities of the RDGR theory to nonspherical hydrometeors and six parameters (pressure, temperature, liquid water content, sizes of ice crystals, graupel, and cloud droplets). Idealized simulations of a thundercloud with two‐moment cloud microphysics provide a realistic sampling of the parameter space. Nonsphericity and anisotropic diffusional growth strongly control the extent of positive graupel charging. We suggest a tuning parameter to account for anisotropic effects not represented in bulk microphysics schemes. In a susceptibility analysis that uses automated differentiation, we identify ice crystal size as most important RDGR parameter, followed by graupel size. Simulated average ice crystal size varies with temperature due to ice multiplication and heterogeneous freezing of droplets. Cloud microphysics and ice crystal size thus indirectly determine the structure of charge reversal lines in the traditional temperature‐water‐content representation. Accounting for the variability of ice crystal size and potentially habit with temperature may help to explain laboratory results and seems crucial for RDGR parameterizations in numerical models. We find that the contribution of local water vapor from evaporating rime droplets to diffusional graupel growth is only important for high effective water content. In this regime, droplet size and pressure are the dominant RDGR parameters. Otherwise, the effect of local graupel growth is masked by small ice crystal sizes that result from ice multiplication.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000311459",,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2018JD028356","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/311459","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"A Modeling Study on the Sensitivities of Atmospheric Charge Separation According to the Relative Diffusional Growth Rate Theory to Nonspherical Hydrometeors and Cloud Microphysics","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-12-18T04:13:20Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85056332660",,"000452001400027","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","21","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","123","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Insights into the relationship between the ENSO–North Atlantic teleconnection and the cyclogenesis changes are provided by diagnosing the relative roles of stationary wave propagation and transient eddies in setting cyclogenesis-conducive large-scale circulation anomalies. During La Niña winters, Rocky Mountain and Greenland cyclogenesis are enhanced, while Gulf Stream cyclogenesis is reduced. Diagnostics suggest that stationary waves of tropical origin work in tandem with transient eddies to amplify the ridge over the northeastern Pacific, establishing background flow anomalies that favor Rocky Mountain cyclogenesis; downstream, more transient eddies with an anticyclonic tilt push the North Atlantic jet poleward, favoring cyclogenesis near Greenland, while contributions from stationary waves are small. During central Pacific El Niño winters, the cyclogenesis situation is essentially the opposite: Rocky Mountain and Greenland cyclogenesis are reduced, while Gulf Stream cyclogenesis is enhanced. The analyses are consistent with stationary waves and transient eddies acting to weaken the climatological ridge over the northeastern Pacific, creating a more zonal Pacific jet; downstream, transient eddies with a cyclonic tilt push the North Atlantic jet equatorward, favoring Gulf Stream cyclogenesis. Anomalies in cyclogenesis frequencies, and the relative roles of transient and stationary waves, during eastern Pacific El Niño winters are associated with larger uncertainties.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302371",,"0022-4928||1520-0469",,"10.1175/JAS-D-17-0340.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302371","en","American Meteorological Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ENSO||Extratropical cyclones||Rossby waves||Teleconnections||Cyclogenesis||cyclolysis||Storm tracks","Extratropical Cyclogenesis Changes in Connection with Tropospheric ENSO Teleconnections to the North Atlantic: Role of Stationary and Transient Waves","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-11-09T05:22:05Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Influence of El Niño on the life cycle of extratropical cyclones in the North Atlantic","167747","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Rückkehr CH Advanced Postdoc.Mobility",,,,,"85056126310",,"000448364800002","J. atmos. sci.","11","Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences","75","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The outlet to the Nile is controlled by two hydropower dams of which the allowed discharge is dictated by the Agreed Curve, an equation relating outflow to lake level. Some regional climate models project a decrease in precipitation and an increase in evaporation over Lake Victoria, with potential important implications for its water balance and resulting level. Yet, little is known about the potential consequences of climate change for the water balance of Lake Victoria. In this second part of a two-paper series, we feed a new water balance model for Lake Victoria presented in the first part with climate simulations available through the COordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa framework. Our results reveal that most regional climate models are not capable of giving a realistic representation of the water balance of Lake Victoria and therefore require bias correction. For two emission scenarios (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5), the decrease in precipitation over the lake and an increase in evaporation are compensated by an increase in basin precipitation leading to more inflow. The future lake level projections show that the dam management scenario and not the emission scenario is the main controlling factor of the future water level evolution. Moreover, inter-model uncertainties are larger than emission scenario uncertainties. The comparison of four idealized future management scenarios pursuing certain policy objectives (electricity generation, navigation reliability and environmental conservation) uncovers that the only sustainable management scenario is mimicking natural lake level fluctuations by regulating outflow according to the Agreed Curve. The associated outflow encompasses, however, ranges from 14m3day−1 (−85%) to 200m3day−1 (+100%) within this ensemble, highlighting that future hydropower generation and downstream water availability may strongly change in the next decades even if dam management adheres to he Agreed Curve. Our results overall underline that managing the dam according to the Agreed Curve is a key prerequisite for sustainable future lake levels, but that under this management scenario, climate change might potentially induce profound changes in lake level and outflow volume.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302244",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-22-5527-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302244","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Modelling the water balance of Lake Victoria (East Africa) - Part 2: Future projections","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-11-09T05:05:43Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85055789397",,"000448331300002","Hydrol.

The water level of Lake Victoria is determined by its water balance, consisting of precipitation on the lake, evaporation from the lake, inflow from tributary rivers and lake outflow, controlled by two hydropower dams. Due to a scarcity of in situ observations, previous estimates of individual water balance terms are characterized by substantial uncertainties, which means that the water balance is often not closed independently. In this first part of a two-paper series, we present a water balance model for Lake Victoria, using state-of-the-art remote sensing observations, high-resolution reanalysis downscaling and outflow values recorded at the dam. The uncalibrated computation of the individual water balance terms yields lake level fluctuations that closely match the levels retrieved from satellite altimetry. Precipitation is the main cause of seasonal and interannual lake level fluctuations, and on average causes the lake level to rise from May to July and to fall from August to December. Finally, our results indicate that the 2004–2005 drop in lake level can be about half attributed to a drought in the Lake Victoria Basin and about half to an enhanced outflow, highlighting the sensitivity of the lake level to human operations at the outflow dam.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302227",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-22-5509-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302227","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Modelling the water balance of Lake Victoria (East Africa) - Part 1: Observational analysis","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-11-09T05:02:53Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85055811422",,"000448331300001","Hydrol.

However, recent model development has focused on implementing irrigation where other land management practices such as conservation agriculture (CA) has been limited due to the lack of global spatially explicit datasets describing where this form of management is practiced. Here, we implement a representation of CA into the Community Earth System Model and show that the quality of simulated surface energy fluxes improves when including more information on how agricultural land is managed. We also compare the climate response at the subgrid scale where CA is applied. We find that CA generally contributes to local cooling (~1°C) of hot temperature extremes in mid‐latitude regions where it is practiced, while over tropical locations CA contributes to local warming (~1°C) due to changes in evapotranspiration dominating the effects of enhanced surface albedo. In particular, changes in the partitioning of evapotranspiration between soil evaporation and transpiration are critical for the sign of the temperature change: a cooling occurs only when the soil moisture retention and associated enhanced transpiration is sufficient to offset the warming from reduced soil evaporation. Finally, we examine the climate change mitigation potential of CA by comparing a simulation with present‐day CA extent to a simulation where CA is expanded to all suitable crop areas. Here, our results indicate that while the local temperature response to CA is considerable cooling (>2°C), the grid‐scale changes in climate are counteractive due to negative atmospheric feedbacks. Overall, our results underline that CA has a nonnegligible impact on the local climate and that it should therefore be considered in future climate projections.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000295218",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.14362","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/295218","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CESM||climate‐effective land management||CLM||land‐based mitigation||subgrid‐scale influences||temperature extremes||tillage","Modelled biophysical impacts of conservation agriculture on local climates","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-10-12T10:06:22Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85050866584",,"000445728800024","Glob.

While the effect of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations on Earth's radiation budget is well constrained, that due to anthropogenic aerosols is not, partly due to a lack of observations. However, long‐term surface measurements of changes in downward solar radiation (SDSR), an often used proxy for aerosol radiative impact, are available worldwide over the last half century. We compare SDSR changes from ∼1,400 stations to those from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Version 5 global climate simulations over the period 1961–2005. The observed SDSR shows a strong early downward trend followed by a weaker trend reversal, broadly consistent with historical aerosol emissions. However, despite considerable changes to known aerosol emissions over time, the models show negligible SDSR trends, revealing a lethargic response to aerosol emissions and casting doubt on the accuracy of their future climate projections.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302413",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2018GL078298","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302413","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Lethargic Response to Aerosol Emissions in Current Climate Models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-11-09T05:46:34Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85053519377",,"000447761300053","Geophys.

However, primary formation of ice in clouds is not fully understood. In the presence of ice nucleating particles (INPs), the phase change to ice is promoted, but identification and quantification of INPs in a natural environment remains challenging because of their low numbers. In this paper, we quantify INP number concentrations in the free troposphere (FT) as measured at the High Altitude Research Station Jungfraujoch (JFJ), during the winter, spring, and summer of the years 2014–2017. INPs were measured at conditions relevant for mixed‐phase cloud formation at T = 241/242 K. To date, this is the longest timeline of semiregular measurements akin to online INP monitoring at this site and sampling conditions. We find that INP concentrations in the background FT are on average capped at 10/stdL (liter of air at standard conditions [T = 273 K and p = 1013 hPa]) with an interquartile range of 0.4–9.6/stdL, as compared to measurements during times when other air mass origins (e.g., Sahara or marine boundary layer) prevailed. Elevated concentrations were measured in the field campaigns of 2016, which might be due to enhanced influence from Saharan dust and marine boundary layer air arriving at the JFJ. The upper limit of INP concentrations in the background FT is supported by measurements performed at similar conditions, but at different locations in the FT, where we find INP concentrations to be below 13/stdL most of the time.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302416",,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2018JD028338","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302416","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","atmospheric ice nucleation||mixed‐phase clouds||free troposphere","Background Free-Tropospheric Ice Nucleating Particle Concentrations at Mixed-Phase Cloud Conditions","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-11-09T05:46:34Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding","603445","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,,"85053443665",,"000447807300028","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","18","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","123","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is an alternative microphysics module to the default modal microphysics scheme M7 in ECHAM-HAMMOZ. The SALSA2.0 implementation within ECHAM-HAMMOZ is evaluated against observations of aerosol optical properties, aerosol mass, and size distributions, comparing also to the skill of the M7 implementation. The largest differences between the implementation of SALSA2.0 and M7 are in the methods used for calculating microphysical processes, i.e., nucleation, condensation, coagulation, and hydration. These differences in the microphysics are reflected in the results so that the largest differences between SALSA2.0 and M7 are evident over regions where the aerosol size distribution is heavily modified by the microphysical processing of aerosol particles. Such regions are, for example, highly polluted regions and regions strongly affected by biomass burning. In addition, in a simulation of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption in which a stratospheric sulfate plume was formed, the global burden and the effective radii of the stratospheric aerosol are very different in SALSA2.0 and M7. While SALSA2.0 was able to reproduce the observed time evolution of the global burden of sulfate and the effective radii of stratospheric aerosol, M7 strongly overestimates the removal of coarse stratospheric particles and thus underestimates the effective radius of stratospheric aerosol. As the mode widths of M7 have been optimized for the troposphere and were not designed to represent stratospheric aerosol, the ability of M7 to simulate the volcano plume was improved by modifying the mode widths, decreasing the standard deviations of the accumulation and coarse modes from 1.59 and 2.0, respectively, to 1.2 similar to what was observed after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. Overall, SALSA2.0 shows promise in improving the aerosol description of ECHAM-HAMMOZ and can be further improved by implementing methods for aerosol processes that are more suitable for the sectional method, e.g., size-dependent emissions for aerosol species and size-resolved wet deposition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000295507",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-11-3833-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/295507","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"SALSA2.0: The sectional aerosol module of the aerosol-chemistry-climate model ECHAM6.3.0-HAM2.3-MOZ1.0","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-10-12T15:25:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding","603445","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,,"85054053370",,"000445698200001","Geosci. model dev.","9","Geoscientific Model Development","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, we model how the change in morphology affects the shortwave radiative forcing, in particular for particles containing organic carbon as a molecular absorber, often termed ""brown carbon"" (BrC). Preferentially, such an absorber will redistribute to the organic phase after LLPS. We limited our investigation to particle diameters between 0.04 and 0.5µm, atmospherically relevant organic-to-inorganic mass ratios typical for aged aerosol (1:4<OIR<4:1) and absorptivities ranging from zero (purely scattering) to highly absorbing brown carbon. For atmospherically relevant O:C ratios, core-shell morphology is expected for phase-separated particles. We compute the scattering and absorption cross sections for realistic eccentric core-shell morphologies. For the size range of interest here, we show that assuming the core-shell morphology to be concentric is sufficiently accurate and numerically much more efficient than averaging over eccentric morphologies. In the UV region, where BrC absorbs strongest, phase-separated particles may exhibit a scattering cross section up to 50% larger than those of homogenously mixed particles, while their absorption cross section is up to 20% smaller. Integrating over the full solar spectrum, due to the strong wavelength dependence of BrC absorptivity, limits the shortwave radiative impact of LLPS in the thin aerosol layer approximation. For particles with very substantial BrC absorption there will be a radiative forcing enhancement of 4%–11.8% depending on the Ångström exponent (AAE) of BrC absorptivity for the case of small surface albedos and a decrease of up to 18% for surfaces with high reflectivity. However, for those of moderate absorptivity, LLPS will have no significant shortwave radiative impact.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000293139",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-13511-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/293139","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Shortwave radiative impact of liquid-liquid phase separation in brown carbon aerosols","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-10-03T21:44:00Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85053932211",,"000445398900002","Atmos. chem. phys.","18","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In particular, most West African states explicitly focus on hybrid mixes of variable renewable power sources—solar, wind and hydropower—in their targets for the electricity sector. Hydropower, the main current RE resource in West Africa, is strongly sensitive to monsoon rainfall variability, which has led to power crises in the past. Therefore, solar and wind power could play a stronger role in the future as countries move to power systems with high shares of RE. Considering the policy focus on diversified RE portfolios, there is a strong need to provide climate services for assessing how these resources could function together in a power mix. In this study, climate data from the state-of-the-art ERA5 reanalysis is used to assess the synergies of solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power potential in West Africa at hourly resolution. A new metric, the stability coefficient C_stab, is developed to quantify the synergies of solar PV and wind power for achieving a balanced power output and limiting storage needs. Using this metric, it is demonstrated that there is potential for exploiting hybrid solar/wind power in a larger area of West Africa, covering more important centers of population and closer to existing grid structures, than would be suggested by average maps of solar and wind resource availability or capacity factor for the region. The results of this study highlight why multi-scale temporal synergies of power mixes should be considered in RE system planning from the start.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000289792",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aad8f6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/289792","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Renewable energy||Power mix||West Africa||Energy policy||Reanalysis data||Climate services","A new approach for assessing synergies of solar and wind power: implications for West Africa","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-09-15T04:40:48Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85055811030",,"000443763800001","Environ.

Only a small fraction of aerosols called ice nucleating particles (INPs) catalyze ice formation, with their nature and origin remaining unclear. In this study, we investigate potential predictor parameters of meteorological conditions and aerosol properties for INP concentrations at mixed-phase cloud condition at 242 K. Measurements were conducted at the High Altitude Research Station Jungfraujoch (Switzerland, 3580 m a.s.l.), which is located predominantly in the free troposphere (FT) but can occasionally receive injections from the boundary layer (BLI). Measurements are taken during a long-term study of eight field campaigns, allowing for the first time an interannual (2014–2017) and seasonal (spring, summer, and winter) distinction of high-time-resolution INP measurements. We investigate ranked correlation coefficients between INP concentrations and meteorological parameters and aerosol properties. While a commonly used parameterization lacks in predicting the observed INP concentrations, the best INP predictor is the total available surface area of the aerosol particles, with no obvious seasonal trend in the relationship. Nevertheless, the predicting capability is less pronounced in the FT, which might be caused by ageing effects. Furthermore, there is some evidence of anthropogenic influence on INP concentrations during BLI. Our study contributes to an improved understanding of ice nucleation in the free troposphere, however, it also underlines that a knowledge gap of ice nucleation in such an environment exists.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000295634",,"2073-4433",,"10.3390/atmos9090363","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/295634","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","INP parameterization||Ice nucleation||Free troposphere","Impact of air mass conditions and aerosol properties on ice nucleating particle concentrations at the High Altitude Research Station Jungfraujoch","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-10-13T07:39:55Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85053612294",,"000448137500038",,"9","Atmosphere","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Moreover, agricultural land managed under CA is proposed to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation through reduced emission of greenhouse gases, increased solar radiation reflection, and the sustainable use of soil and water resources. Due to the lack of official reporting schemes, the amount of agricultural land managed under CA systems is uncertain and spatially explicit information about the distribution of CA required for various modeling studies is missing. Here, we present an approach to downscale present‐day national‐level estimates of CA to a 5 arcminute regular grid, based on multicriteria analysis. We provide a best estimate of CA distribution and an uncertainty range in the form of a low and high estimate of CA distribution, reflecting the inconsistency in CA definitions. We also design two scenarios of the potential future development of CA combining present‐day data and an assessment of the potential for implementation using biophysical and socioeconomic factors. By our estimates, 122–215 Mha or 9%–15% of global arable land is currently managed under CA systems. The lower end of the range represents CA as an integrated system of permanent no‐tillage, crop residue management and crop rotations, while the high estimate includes a wider range of areas primarily devoted to temporary no‐tillage or reduced tillage operations. Our scenario analysis suggests a future potential of CA in the range of 533–1130 Mha (38%–81% of global arable land). Our estimates can be used in various ecosystem modeling applications and are expected to help identifying more realistic climate mitigation and adaptation potentials of agricultural practices.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000284355",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.14307","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/284355","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Crop residue management||Land management||land-based mitigation||no-till farming||sustainable intensification||zero tillage","A spatially explicit representation of conservation agriculture for application in global change studies","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-24T08:30:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85051549260",,,"Glob.

Prescribing the observed large‐scale circulation improves the modeled weather patterns as well as many related fields. However, the larger part of the temperature and precipitation biases of the free atmosphere configuration remains after nudging, in particular, for extremes. Our results suggest that thermodynamical processes, including land‐atmosphere coupling and atmospheric parameterizations, drive the errors present in Community Earth System Model.

The magnitude of this effect is well captured for initializations in late October and November in the model with the largest ensemble size. While the QBO appears to modulate the extratropical tropospheric circulation in some of the models as well, the importance of a polar stratospheric pathway, through the Holton‐Tan effect, for the tropospheric anomalies is unclear.

Because SSWs are able to cause significant surface weather anomalies on intra-seasonal timescales, several previous studies have focused on their potential future change, as might be induced by anthropogenic forcings. However, a wide range of results have been reported, from a future increase in the frequency of SSWs to an actual decrease. Several factors might explain these contradictory results, notably the use of different metrics for the identification of SSWs and the impact of large climatological biases in single-model studies. To bring some clarity, we here revisit the question of future SSW changes, using an identical set of metrics applied consistently across 12 different models participating in the Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative. Our analysis reveals that no statistically significant change in the frequency of SSWs will occur over the 21st century, irrespective of the metric used for the identification of the event. Changes in other SSW characteristics – such as their duration, deceleration of the polar night jet, and the tropospheric forcing – are also assessed: again, we find no evidence of future changes over the 21st century.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000284330",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-11277-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/284330","en","European Geophysical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"No robust evidence of future changes in major stratospheric sudden warmings: A multi-model assessment from CCMI","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-24T08:24:18Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85051523384",,"000441403800005","Atmos. chem. phys.","15","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recently, remote-sensing observations have been used to assess the contrast in albedo, evapotranspiration (ET), and land surface temperature (LST) between forest and nearby open land on a global scale. These observations provide an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the ability of land surface models to simulate the biogeophysical effects of forests. Here, we evaluate the representation of the difference of forest minus open land (i.e., grassland and cropland) in albedo, ET, and LST in the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) using various remote-sensing and in situ data sources. To extract the local sensitivity to land cover, we analyze plant functional type level output from global CLM4.5 simulations, using a model configuration that attributes a separate soil column to each plant functional type. Using the separated soil column configuration, CLM4.5 is able to realistically reproduce the biogeophysical contrast between forest and open land in terms of albedo, daily mean LST, and daily maximum LST, while the effect on daily minimum LST is not well captured by the model. Furthermore, we identify that the ET contrast between forests and open land is underestimated in CLM4.5 compared to observation-based products and even reversed in sign for some regions, even when considering uncertainties in these products. We then show that these biases can be partly alleviated by modifying several model parameters, such as the root distribution, the formulation of plant water uptake, the light limitation of photosynthesis, and the maximum rate of carboxylation. Furthermore, the ET contrast between forest and open land needs to be better constrained by observations to foster convergence amongst different land surface models on the biogeophysical effects of forests. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of comparing subgrid model output to local observations to improve current land surface models' ability to simulate land cover change effects, which is a promising approach to reduce uncertainties in future assessments of land use impacts on climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000283274",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-15-4731-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/283274","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Evaluating and improving the Community Land Model’s sensitivity to land cover","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-18T07:05:48Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach","641816||641816","10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100007352","SBFI||SBFI","H2020||H2020",,,,,"85051349034",,"000441056800001",,"15","Biogeosciences","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous analyses have suggested that at these low CCN concentrations the liquid water content (LWC) and radiative properties of the clouds are determined primarily by the CCN concentrations, conditions that have previously been referred to as the tenuous cloud regime. The intercomparison includes results from three large eddy simulation models (UCLALES-SALSA, COSMO-LES, and MIMICA) and three numerical weather prediction models (COSMO-NWP, WRF, and UM-CASIM). We test the sensitivities of the model results to different treatments of cloud droplet activation, including prescribed cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCs) and diagnostic CCN activation based on either fixed aerosol concentrations or prognostic aerosol with in-cloud processing.  There remains considerable diversity even in experiments with prescribed CDNCs and prescribed ice crystal number concentrations (ICNC). The sensitivity of mixed-phase Arctic cloud properties to changes in CDNC depends on the representation of the cloud droplet size distribution within each model, which impacts autoconversion rates. Our results therefore suggest that properly estimating aerosol–cloud interactions requires an appropriate treatment of the cloud droplet size distribution within models, as well as in situ observations of hydrometeor size distributions to constrain them.  The results strongly support the hypothesis that the liquid water content of these clouds is CCN limited. For the observed meteorological conditions, the cloud generally did not collapse when the CCN concentration was held constant at the relatively high CCN concentrations measured during the cloudy period, but the cloud thins or collapses as the CCN concentration is reduced. The CCN concentration at which collapse occurs varies substantially between models. Only one model predicts complete dissipation of the cloud due to glaciation, and this occurs only for the largest prescribed ICNC tested in this study. Global and regional models with either prescribed CDNCs or prescribed aerosol concentrations would not reproduce these dissipation events. Additionally, future increases in Arctic aerosol concentrations would be expected to decrease the frequency of occurrence of such cloud dissipation events, with implications for the radiative balance at the surface. Our results also show that cooling of the sea-ice surface following cloud dissipation increases atmospheric stability near the surface, further suppressing cloud formation. Therefore, this suggests that linkages between aerosol and clouds, as well as linkages between clouds, surface temperatures, and atmospheric stability need to be considered for weather and climate predictions in this region.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000282796",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-11041-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/282796","en","European Geosciences Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A model intercomparison of CCN-limited tenuous clouds in the high Arctic","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-16T07:51:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85051253863",,"000441015800001","Atmos. chem. phys.","15","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Its spatial distribution is strongly modulated by the underlying orography. Yet the vertical transport of soil water and especially the generation of groundwater runoff at the bottom of the soil column are currently treated in a crude way in most atmospheric and climate models. This potentially leads to large biases in near‐surface temperatures during midlatitude summertime conditions, when the soils may dry out. Here we present a new formulation for groundwater and runoff formation. It is based on Richards equation, allows for saturated aquifers, includes a slope‐dependent groundwater discharge, and enables a subgrid‐scale treatment of the underlying orography. The proposed numerical implementation ensures a physically consistent treatment of the water fluxes in the soil column, using ideas from flux‐corrected transport methodologies. An implementation of this formulation into TERRA_ML, the land surface model of the regional climate model of the COnsortium for Small‐scale MOdeling (COSMO) in CLimate Mode (CCLM), is validated both in idealized and real‐case simulations. Idealized simulations demonstrate the important role of the lower boundary condition at the bottom of the soil column and display a physically meaningful recharge and discharge of the saturated zone. Validation against measurements at selected stations shows an improved seasonal evolution of soil water content. Finally, decade‐long climate simulations over Europe exhibit a realistic representation of the groundwater distribution across continental scales and mountainous areas, an improved annual cycle of surface latent heat fluxes, and as a consequence reductions of long‐standing biases in near‐surface temperatures in semiarid regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000293144",,"1942-2466",,"10.1029/2017MS001260","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/293144","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","land‐atmosphere coupling||runoff formation||soil water transport","A Groundwater and Runoff Formulation for Weather and Climate Models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-10-03T22:42:15Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85052543450",,"000444801100006",,"8","Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Seven RCMs are considered, five of which were also coupled with an oceanic model. All simulations were forced at the lateral boundaries by the ERA-Interim reanalysis for a common 20-year period (1989–2008). Six different cyclone tracking methods have been applied to all twelve RCM simulations and to the ERA-Interim reanalysis in order to assess the RCMs from the perspective of different cyclone definitions. All RCMs reproduce the main areas of high cyclone occurrence in the region south of the Alps, in the Adriatic, Ionian and Aegean Seas, as well as in the areas close to Cyprus and to Atlas mountains. The RCMs tend to underestimate intense cyclone occurrences over the Mediterranean Sea and reproduce 24–40 % of these systems, as identified in the reanalysis. The use of grid nudging in one of the RCMs is shown to be beneficial, reproducing about 60 % of the intense cyclones and keeping a better track of the seasonal cycle of intense cyclogenesis. Finally, the most intense cyclones tend to be similarly reproduced in coupled and uncoupled model simulations, suggesting that modeling atmosphere–ocean coupled processes has only a weak impact on the climatology and intensity of Mediterranean cyclones.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000122740",,"0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-016-3398-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/122740","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Assessment of an ensemble of ocean–atmosphere coupled and uncoupled regional climate models to reproduce the climatology of Mediterranean cyclones","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-06-12T16:06:23Z",,,,"pub:185067","yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"imp593654e06e41344679","000036174",,"84994323448",,"000439141800016","Clim Dyn","3","Climate Dynamics","51","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Typically these employ global and regional climate models (GCMs and RCMs), as well as one or several impact models. It is a common belief that the errors in such model chains behave approximately additive, thus the uncertainty should increase with each modeling step. If this hypothesis was true, the application of RCMs would not lead to any intrinsic improvement (beyond higher-resolution details) of the GCM results. Here, we investigate the bias patterns (offset during the historical period against observations) and climate change signals of two RCMs that have downscaled a comprehensive set of GCMs following the EURO-CORDEX framework. Our results show that the biases of the RCMs and GCMs are not additive and not independent. The two RCMs are systematically reducing the biases and modifying climate change signals of the driving GCMs, even on scales that are considered well resolved by the driving GCMs. The GCM projected summer warming at the end of the century is substantially reduced by both RCMs. These results are important, as the projected summer warming and its likely impact on the water cycle are among the most serious concerns regarding European climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000277267",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aacc77","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/277267","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","regional climate||dynamical downscaling||climate projections","Bias patterns and climate change signals in GCM-RCM model chains","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-07-22T13:15:00Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85053422827",,"000437490600002","Environ.

This can increase food prices, and hence raises food security concerns. Here we show how an inclusive policy design can avoid these adverse side-effects. Food-security support through international aid, bioenergy tax, or domestic reallocation of income can shield impoverished and vulnerable people from the additional risk of hunger that would be caused by the economic effects of policies narrowly focussing on climate objectives only. In the absence of such support, 35% more people might be at risk of hunger by 2050 (i.e. 84 million additional people) in a 2 °C-consistent scenario. The additional global welfare changes due to inclusive climate policies are small (<0.1%) compared to the total climate mitigation cost (3.7% welfare loss), and the financial costs of international aid amount to about half a percent of high-income countries' GDP. This implies that climate policy should treat this issue carefully. Although there are challenges to implement food policies, options exist to avoid the food security concerns often linked to climate mitigation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000279099",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aad0f7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/279099","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","climate change mitigation||food security||1.5 and 2 degree goal||inclusive policy","Inclusive climate change mitigation and food security policy under 1.5 degrees C climate goal","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-07-28T04:51:11Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000438607700003","Environ.

In this study, we assess the ability of the MAR («Modèle Atmosphérique Régional») RCM to reproduce observed changes in Eg↓, and we investigate the added value of MAR with respect to reanalyses. Simulations were performed at a horizontal resolution of 5 km for the period 1959–2010 by forcing MAR with different reanalysis products: ERA40/ERA-interim, NCEP/NCAR-v1, ERA-20C, and 20CRV2C. Measurements of Eg↓ from the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) and from the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (RMIB), as well as cloud cover observations from Belgocontrol and RMIB, were used for the evaluation of the MAR model and the forcing reanalyses. Results show that MAR enables largely reducing the mean biases that are present in the reanalyses. The trend analysis shows that only MAR forced by ERA40/ERA-interim shows historical trends, which is probably because the ERA40/ERA-interim has a better horizontal resolution and assimilates more observations than the other reanalyses that are used in this study. The results suggest that the solar brightening observed since the 1980s in Belgium has mainly been due to decreasing cloud cover.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000280011",,"2073-4433",,"10.3390/atmos9070262","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/280011","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","regional and mesoscale modelling||reanalysis||global radiative flux||cloud cover||Europe","Global radiative flux and cloudiness variability for the period 1959-2010 in Belgium: A comparison between reanalyses and the regional climate model MAR","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-02T07:41:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85050467001",,"000445141400026",,"7","Atmosphere","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Additionally, a decrease in the area and thickness of sea ice could lead to enhanced Arctic ship traffic, for example due to shorter routes of cargo ships. Changes in the emissions of aerosol particles can then influence cloud properties, precipitation, surface albedo, and radiation. Next to changes in aerosol emissions, clouds will also be affected by increases in Arctic temperatures and humidities. In this study, we quantify how future aerosol radiative forcings and cloud radiative effects might change in the Arctic in late summer (July–August) and early autumn (September–October).  Simulations were conducted for the years 2004 and 2050 with the global aerosol–climate model ECHAM6-HAM2. For 2050, simulations with and without additional ship emissions in the Arctic were carried out to quantify the impact of these emissions on the Arctic climate.  In the future, sea salt as well as dimethyl sulfide emissions and burdens will increase in the Arctic. The increase in cloud condensation nuclei, which is due to changes in aerosol particles and meteorology, will enhance cloud droplet number concentrations over the Arctic Ocean (+10% in late summer and +29% in early autumn; in-cloud values averaged between 75 and 90°N). Furthermore, both liquid and total water path will increase (+10% and +8% in late summer; +34% and +26% in early autumn) since the specific humidity will be enhanced due to higher temperatures and the exposure of the ocean's surface.  Changes in both aerosol radiative forcings and cloud radiative effects at the top of the atmosphere will not be dominated by the aerosol particles and clouds themselves but by the decrease in surface albedo (and by the increase in surface temperature for the longwave cloud radiative effect in early autumn). Mainly due to the reduction in sea ice, the aerosol radiative forcing will become less positive (decreasing from 0.53 to 0.36Wm−2 in late summer and from 0.15 to 0.11Wm−2 in early autumn). The decrease in sea ice is also mainly responsible for changes in the net cloud radiative effect, which will become more negative in late summer (changing from −36 to −46Wm−2). Therefore, the cooling component of both aerosols and clouds will gain importance in the future.  We found that future Arctic ship emissions related to transport and oil and gas extraction (Peters et al. 2011) will not have a large impact on clouds and radiation: changes in aerosols only become significant when we increase these ship emissions by a factor of 10. However, even with 10-fold ship emissions, the net aerosol radiative forcing shows no significant changes. Enhanced black carbon deposition on snow leads to a locally significant but very small increase in radiative forcing over the central Arctic Ocean in early autumn (no significant increase for average between 75 and 90°N). Furthermore, the 10-fold higher ship emissions increase the optical thickness and lifetime of clouds in late summer (net cloud radiative effect changing from −48 to −52Wm−2). These aerosol–cloud effects have a considerably larger influence on the radiative forcing than the direct effects of particles (both aerosol particles in the atmosphere and particles deposited on snow). In summary, future ship emissions of aerosols and their precursor gases might have a net cooling effect, which is small compared to other changes in future Arctic climate such as those caused by the decrease in surface albedo.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000280192",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-10521-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/280192","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"How important are future marine and shipping aerosol emissions in a warming Arctic summer and autumn?","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-03T05:14:59Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding","603445","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,,"85050666082",,"000439635700001","Atmos. chem. phys.","14","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Pinatubo on stratospheric aerosol properties and atmospheric state. The aerosol module is coupled to the radiative and chemical modules and includes comprehensive sulfur chemistry and microphysics, in which the particle size distribution is represented by 40 size bins with radii spanning from 0.39nm to 3.2µm. SOCOL-AER simulations are compared with satellite and in situ measurements of aerosol parameters, temperature reanalyses, and ozone observations. In addition to the reference model configuration, we performed series of sensitivity experiments looking at different processes affecting the aerosol layer. An accurate sedimentation scheme is found to be essential to prevent particles from diffusing too rapidly to high and low altitudes. The aerosol radiative feedback and the use of a nudged quasi-biennial oscillation help to keep aerosol in the tropics and significantly affect the evolution of the stratospheric aerosol burden, which improves the agreement with observed aerosol mass distributions. The inclusion of van der Waals forces in the particle coagulation scheme suggests improvements in particle effective radius, although other parameters (such as aerosol longevity) deteriorate. Modification of the Pinatubo sulfur emission rate also improves some aerosol parameters, while it worsens others compared to observations. Observations themselves are highly uncertain and render it difficult to conclusively judge the necessity of further model reconfiguration. The model revealed problems in reproducing aerosol sizes above 25km and also in capturing certain features of the ozone response. Besides this, our results show that SOCOL-AER is capable of predicting the most important global-scale atmospheric effects following volcanic eruptions, which is also a prerequisite for an improved understanding of solar geoengineering effects from sulfur injections to the stratosphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000277269",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-11-2633-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/277269","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Stratospheric aerosol evolution after Pinatubo simulated with a coupled size-resolved aerosol-chemistry-climate model, SOCOL-AERv1.0","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-07-22T13:46:53Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Impact of Artificial Stratospheric Sulfate Aerosols investigated with a coupled aerosol-chemistry climate model (IASSA)","130478","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,,"85049728434",,"000437781200002","Geosci. model dev.","7","Geoscientific Model Development","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Thus, several studies suggest that mountain-top in situ cloud microphysical measurements are influenced by surface processes, e.g., blowing snow, hoar frost or riming on snow-covered trees, rocks and the snow surface. This limits the relevance of such measurements for the study of microphysical properties and processes in free-floating clouds.  This study assesses the impact of surface processes on in situ cloud observations at the Sonnblick Observatory in the Hohen Tauern region, Austria. Vertical profiles of ICNCs above a snow-covered surface were observed up to a height of 10m. The ICNC decreases at least by a factor of 2 at 10m if the ICNC at the surface is larger than 100L−1. This decrease can be up to 1 order of magnitude during in-cloud conditions and reached its maximum of more than 2 orders of magnitudes when the station was not in cloud. For one case study, the ICNC for regular and irregular ice crystals showed a similar relative decrease with height. This suggests that either surface processes produce both irregular and regular ice crystals or other effects modify the ICNCs near the surface. Therefore, two near-surface processes are proposed to enrich ICNCs near the surface. Either sedimenting ice crystals are captured in a turbulent layer above the surface or the ICNC is enhanced in a convergence zone because the cloud is forced over a mountain. These two processes would also have an impact on ICNCs measured at mountain-top stations if the surrounding surface is not snow covered. Conclusively, this study strongly suggests that ICNCs measured at mountain-top stations are not representative of the properties of a cloud further away from the surface.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000274383",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-8909-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/274383","en","European Geophysical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Impact of surface and near-surface processes on ice crystal concentrations measured at mountain-top research stations","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-07-06T16:07:05Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85049231540",,"000436460900001","Atmos. chem. phys.","12","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While a large spread in the cloud feedback arises from low-level clouds, it was recently shown that mixed-phase clouds are also important for ECS. If mixed-phase clouds in the current climate contain too few supercooled cloud droplets, too much ice will change to liquid water in a warmer climate. As shown by Tan et al. (2016), this overestimates the negative cloud-phase feedback and underestimates ECS in the CAM global climate model (GCM). Here we use the newest version of the ECHAM6-HAM2 GCM to investigate the importance of mixed-phase and ice clouds for ECS.  Although we also considerably underestimate the fraction of supercooled liquid water globally in the reference version of the ECHAM6-HAM2 GCM, we do not obtain increases in ECS in simulations with more supercooled liquid water in the present-day climate, different from the findings by Tan et al. (2016). We hypothesize that it is not the global supercooled liquid water fraction that matters, but only how well low- and mid-level mixed-phase clouds with cloud-top temperatures in the mixed-phase temperature range between 0 and −35°C that are not shielded by higher-lying ice clouds are simulated. These occur most frequently in midlatitudes, in particular over the Southern Ocean where they determine the amount of absorbed shortwave radiation. In ECHAM6-HAM2 the amount of absorbed shortwave radiation over the Southern Ocean is only significantly overestimated if all clouds below 0°C consist exclusively of ice. Only in this simulation is ECS significantly smaller than in all other simulations and the cloud optical depth feedback is the dominant cloud feedback. In all other simulations, the cloud optical depth feedback is weak and changes in cloud feedbacks associated with cloud amount and cloud-top pressure dominate the overall cloud feedback. However, apart from the simulation with only ice below 0°C, differences in the overall cloud feedback are not translated into differences in ECS in our model. This insensitivity to the cloud feedback in our model is explained with compensating effects in the clear sky.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000274397",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-8807-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/274397","en","European Geophysical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The importance of mixed-phase and ice clouds for climate sensitivity in the global aerosol-climate model ECHAM6-HAM2","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-07-06T16:09:04Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85049192092",,"000435954400002","Atmos. chem. phys.","12","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We consider a total of 155 simulations from 20 models, including a range of sensitivity studies which examine the impact of climate change on ozone recovery. For the control simulations (unconstrained by nudging towards analysed meteorology) there is a large spread (±20DU in the global average) in the predictions of the absolute ozone column. Therefore, the model results need to be adjusted for biases against historical data. Also, the interannual variability in the model results need to be smoothed in order to provide a reasonably narrow estimate of the range of ozone return dates. Consistent with previous studies, but here for a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) of 6.0, these new CCMI simulations project that global total column ozone will return to 1980 values in 2049 (with a 1σ uncertainty of 2043–2055). At Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes column ozone is projected to return to 1980 values in 2045 (2039–2050), and at Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes in 2032 (2020–2044). In the polar regions, the return dates are 2060 (2055–2066) in the Antarctic in October and 2034 (2025–2043) in the Arctic in March. The earlier return dates in the Northern Hemisphere reflect the larger sensitivity to dynamical changes. Our estimates of return dates are later than those presented in the 2014 Ozone Assessment by approximately 5–17 years, depending on the region, with the previous best estimates often falling outside of our uncertainty range. In the tropics only around half the models predict a return of ozone to 1980 values, around 2040, while the other half do not reach the 1980 value. All models show a negative trend in tropical total column ozone towards the end of the 21st century. The CCMI models generally agree in their simulation of the time evolution of stratospheric chlorine and bromine, which are the main drivers of ozone loss and recovery. However, there are a few outliers which show that the multi-model mean results for ozone recovery are not as tightly constrained as possible. Throughout the stratosphere the spread of ozone return dates to 1980 values between models tends to correlate with the spread of the return of inorganic chlorine to 1980 values. In the upper stratosphere, greenhouse gas-induced cooling speeds up the return by about 10–20 years. In the lower stratosphere, and for the column, there is a more direct link in the timing of the return dates of ozone and chlorine, especially for the large Antarctic depletion. Comparisons of total column ozone between the models is affected by different predictions of the evolution of tropospheric ozone within the same scenario, presumably due to differing treatment of tropospheric chemistry. Therefore, for many scenarios, clear conclusions can only be drawn for stratospheric ozone columns rather than the total column. As noted by previous studies, the timing of ozone recovery is affected by the evolution of N2O and CH4. However, quantifying the effect in the simulations analysed here is limited by the few realisations available for these experiments compared to internal model variability. The large increase in N2O given in RCP 6.0 extends the ozone return globally by ∼15 years relative to N2O fixed at 1960 abundances, mainly because it allows tropical column ozone to be depleted. The effect in extratropical latitudes is much smaller. The large increase in CH4 given in the RCP 8.5 scenario compared to RCP 6.0 also lengthens ozone return by ∼15 years, again mainly through its impact in the tropics. Overall, our estimates of ozone return dates are uncertain due to both uncertainties in future scenarios, in particular those of greenhouse gases, and uncertainties in models. The scenario uncertainty is small in the short term but increases with time, and becomes large by the end of the century. There are still some model–model differences related to well-known processes which affect ozone recovery. Efforts need to continue to ensure that models used for assessment purposes accurately represent stratospheric chemistry and the prescribed scenarios of ozone-depleting substances, and only those models are used to calculate return dates. For future assessments of single forcing or combined effects of CO2, CH4, and N2O on the stratospheric column ozone return dates, this work suggests that it is more important to have multi-member (at least three) ensembles for each scenario from every established participating model, rather than a large number of individual models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000272806",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-8409-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/272806","en","European Geophysical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Estimates of ozone return dates from Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative simulations","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-06-28T05:31:32Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85048757516",,"000435406800003","Atmos. chem. phys.","11","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recent efforts to incorporate anthropogenic activities in these models have enabled more realistic comparisons with observations. Here we evaluate simulations from an ensemble of six models participating in the second phase of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Inter-comparison Project (ISIMIP2a). We simulate monthly runoff in 40 catchments, spatially distributed across eight global hydrobelts. The performance of each model and the ensemble mean is examined with respect to their ability to replicate observed mean and extreme runoff under human-influenced conditions. Application of a novel integrated evaluation metric to quantify the models' ability to simulate timeseries of monthly runoff suggests that the models generally perform better in the wetter equatorial and northern hydrobelts than in drier southern hydrobelts. When model outputs are temporally aggregated to assess mean annual and extreme runoff, the models perform better. Nevertheless, we find a general trend in the majority of models towards the overestimation of mean annual runoff and all indicators of upper and lower extreme runoff. The models struggle to capture the timing of the seasonal cycle, particularly in northern hydrobelts, while in southern hydrobelts the models struggle to reproduce the magnitude of the seasonal cycle. It is noteworthy that over all hydrological indicators, the ensemble mean fails to perform better than any individual model—a finding that challenges the commonly held perception that model ensemble estimates deliver superior performance over individual models. The study highlights the need for continued model development and improvement. It also suggests that caution should be taken when summarising the simulations from a model ensemble based upon its mean output.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000272526",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aac547","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/272526","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","global hydrological models||land surface models||human impacts||extreme events||model evaluation||model validation","Worldwide evaluation of mean and extreme runoff from six global-scale hydrological models that account for human impacts","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-06-27T04:16:40Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85049770640",,"000435137000001","Environ.

The toxicity of such metals will depend on the their chemical state, size distribution, and mixing state. Using online soot-particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SP-AMS), we quantified the mass of five metals (V, Ni, Fe, Na, and Ba) in HFO-PM soot particles produced by a marine diesel research engine. The in-soot metal concentrations were compared to in-PM2.5 measurements by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). We found that <3% of total PM2.5 metals was associated with soot particles, which may still be sufficient to influence in-cylinder soot burnout rates. Since these metals were most likely present as oxides, whereas studies on lower-temperature boilers report a predominance of sulfates, this result implies that the toxicity of HFO PM depends on its combustion conditions. Finally, we observed a 4-to-25-fold enhancement in the ratio V:Ni in soot particles versus PM2.5, indicating an enrichment of V in soot due to its lower nucleation/condensation temperature. As this enrichment mechanism is not dependent on soot formation, V is expected to be generally enriched within smaller HFO-PM particles from marine engines, enhancing its toxicity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000271717",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.8b01764","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/271717","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Trace Metals in Soot and PM<inf>2.5</inf>from Heavy-Fuel-Oil Combustion in a Marine Engine","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-06-22T13:53:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85048400434",,"000434892900068","Environ.

Despite several assessments, the current knowledge on NETs is still diffuse and incomplete, but also growing fast. Here, we synthesize a comprehensive body of NETs literature, using scientometric tools and performing an in-depth assessment of the quantitative and qualitative evidence therein. We clarify the role of NETs in climate change mitigation scenarios, their ethical implications, as well as the challenges involved in bringing the various NETs to the market and scaling them up in time. There are six major findings arising from our assessment: first, keeping warming below 1.5 °C requires the large-scale deployment of NETs, but this dependency can still be kept to a minimum for the 2 °C warming limit. Second, accounting for economic and biophysical limits, we identify relevant potentials for all NETs except ocean fertilization. Third, any single NET is unlikely to sustainably achieve the large NETs deployment observed in many 1.5 °C and 2 °C mitigation scenarios. Yet, portfolios of multiple NETs, each deployed at modest scales, could be invaluable for reaching the climate goals. Fourth, a substantial gap exists between the upscaling and rapid diffusion of NETs implied in scenarios and progress in actual innovation and deployment. If NETs are required at the scales currently discussed, the resulting urgency of implementation is currently neither reflected in science nor policy. Fifth, NETs face severe barriers to implementation and are only weakly incentivized so far. Finally, we identify distinct ethical discourses relevant for NETs, but highlight the need to root them firmly in the available evidence in order to render such discussions relevant in practice.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000267664",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aabf9b","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/267664","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","negative emissions||carbon dioxide removal (CDR)||soil carbon sequestration and biochar||afforestation and reforestation||enhanced weathering||direct air capture||bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)","Negative emissions-Part 1: Research landscape and synthesis","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2018-06-05T16:34:44Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85049794304",,"000432813100001","Environ.

However, a bottom-up, systematic, reproducible, and transparent literature assessment of the different options to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is currently missing. In part 1 of this three-part review on NETs, we assemble a comprehensive set of the relevant literature so far published, focusing on seven technologies: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering, ocean fertilisation, biochar, and soil carbon sequestration. In this part, part 2 of the review, we present estimates of costs, potentials, and side-effects for these technologies, and qualify them with the authors' assessment. Part 3 reviews the innovation and scaling challenges that must be addressed to realise NETs deployment as a viable climate mitigation strategy. Based on a systematic review of the literature, our best estimates for sustainable global NET potentials in 2050 are 0.5–3.6 GtCO2 yr−1 for afforestation and reforestation, 0.5–5 GtCO2 yr−1 for BECCS, 0.5–2 GtCO2 yr−1 for biochar, 2–4 GtCO2 yr−1 for enhanced weathering, 0.5–5 GtCO2 yr−1 for DACCS, and up to 5 GtCO2 yr−1 for soil carbon sequestration. Costs vary widely across the technologies, as do their permanency and cumulative potentials beyond 2050.

This simple parameterization was initially proposed by Hans W:son Ahlmann. The physical background of the relationship between P and T on the equilibrium line, however, has been left unexplained since Ahlmann first questioned the mathematical form of the relationship. This relationship can be explained when the thermal and hydrological processes of the ELA formation are investigated. The present authors studied the energy exchange processes that prevail on the ELA during the melt season. The inclusion of solar radiation brings Ahlmann's hypothesis closer to energy balance, and improves his P/T diagram. By comparing the observed fluxes from the polar through the mid-latitude to the equatorial glaciers, it was found that these glaciers in different climatic regions share important similarities at the ELA. Further, it was found that the classic P/T curve originally proposed by Ahlmann in the early 20th century is a concise expression of the conservation principle of energy and mass at the ELA of glaciers, and takes the form of a polynomial of the fourth order.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000268451",,"0022-1430||1727-5652","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268451||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/274004","10.1017/jog.2018.41","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/274034","en","International Glaciological Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","accumulation||glacier mass balance||Ice and climate||ice/atmosphere interactions||Surface mass budget","Climate on the equilibrium line altitudes of glaciers: theoretical background behind Ahlmann's P/T diagram","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-06-08T06:57:59Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85047149996",,"000434777300013","J Glaciol","245","Journal of Glaciology","64","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Besides trends in overall wetting or drying, changes in temporal characteristics of wetting and drying are of crucial importance in determining the climate hazard posed by such changes. This is particularly the case for tropical regions, where most precipitation occurs during the rainy season and changes in rainy season onset and length have substantial consequences. Here we present projections for changes in tropical rainy season lengths for mean temperature increase of 1.5 °C and 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. Based on multi-ensemble quasi-stationary simulations at these warming levels, our analysis indicates robust changes in rainy season characteristics in large parts of the tropics despite substantial natural variability. Specifically, we report a robust shortening of the rainy season for all of tropical Africa as well as north-east Brazil. About 27% of West Africa is projected to experience robust changes in the rainy season length with a mean shortening of about 7 days under 1.5 °C. We find that changes in the temporal characteristics are largely unrelated to changes in overall precipitation, highlighting the importance of investigating both separately.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000271161",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aab797","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/271161","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","1.5 degrees C||tropics||rainy season||onset||climate change||climate modelling","Robust changes in tropical rainy season length at 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-06-21T04:35:59Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85049806548",,"000434489800003","Environ.

However, soil moisture limitation is known to strongly affect plant physiology.      Here, we investigate light use efficiency, the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) to absorbed light. We derive its fractional reduction due to soil moisture (fLUE), separated from VPD and greenness changes, using artificial neural networks trained on eddy covariance data, multiple soil moisture datasets and remotely sensed greenness.  This reveals substantial impacts of soil moisture alone that reduce GPP by up to 40% at sites located in sub‐humid, semi‐arid or arid regions. For sites in relatively moist climates, we find, paradoxically, a muted fLUE response to drying soil, but reduced fLUE under wet conditions.  fLUE identifies substantial drought impacts that are not captured when relying solely on VPD and greenness changes and, when seasonally recurring, are missed by traditional, anomaly‐based drought indices. Counter to common assumptions, fLUE reductions are largest in drought‐deciduous vegetation, including grasslands. Our results highlight the necessity to account for soil moisture limitation in terrestrial primary productivity data products, especially for drought‐related assessments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000256239",,"0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.15123","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/256239","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","drought impacts||eddy covariance||gross primary productivity (GPP)||light use efficiency||photosynthesis||soil moisture||standardized precipitation index||vapour pressure deficit (VPD)","Quantifying soil moisture impacts on light use efficiency across biomes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-04-09T06:57:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85046657146",,"000437029600021","New Phytol.","4","New Phytologist","218","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Consequences of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on agricultural productivity have direct and immediate relevance for human societies. Future crop yields will be affected by anthropogenic climate change as well as direct effects of emissions such as CO2 fertilization. At the same time, the climate sensitivity to future emissions is uncertain. Here we investigate the sensitivity of future crop yield projections with a set of global gridded crop models for four major staple crops at 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming above pre-industrial levels, as well as at different CO2 levels determined by similar probabilities to lead to 1.5 °C and 2 °C, using climate forcing data from the Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts project. For the same CO2 forcing, we find consistent negative effects of half a degree warming on productivity in most world regions. Increasing CO2 concentrations consistent with these warming levels have potentially stronger but highly uncertain effects than 0.5 °C warming increments. Half a degree warming will also lead to more extreme low yields, in particular over tropical regions. Our results indicate that GMT change alone is insufficient to determine future impacts on crop productivity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000268297",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aab63b","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268297","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","1.5 degrees C||GGCMI||HAPPI","Crop productivity changes in 1.5 °C and 2 °C worlds under climate sensitivity uncertainty","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-06-08T05:13:15Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85047811644",,"000433078800003","Environ.

However, this teleconnection is nonlinear and nonstationary owing to the superposition and interaction of a multitude of influences on this region. The stratosphere is one of the major players in terms of the influence of the ENSO signal on this sector. Nevertheless, there are tropospheric dynamical links between the North Pacific and the North Atlantic that are clearly influenced by ENSO. This tropospheric pathway of ENSO to the NAE has received less attention. In view of this, the present study revisits the tropospheric pathway of ENSO to the North Atlantic using ECMWF reanalysis products. Anomalous propagation of transient and quasi-stationary waves across North America is analyzed with respect to their sensitivity to ENSO. Transient (quasi-stationary zonal waves 1–3) wave activity flux (WAF) from the Pacific to the Atlantic increases during El Niño (La Niña) conditions leading to a negative (positive) phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This response is observed from January to March for El Niño and only visible during February for La Niña events. However, the stratosphere strongly modulates this response. For El Niño (La Niña) conditions a weaker (stronger) stratospheric vortex tends to reinforce the negative (positive) NAO with the stratosphere and troposphere working in tandem, contributing to a stronger and more persistent tropospheric circulation response. These findings may have consequences for the prediction of the NAO during times with an inactive stratosphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000251043",,"0894-8755||1520-0442",,"10.1175/jcli-d-17-0716.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/251043","en","American Meteorological Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","ENSO||Rossby waves||Teleconnections||North Atlantic Oscillation||Stratosphere","The Tropospheric Pathway of the ENSO-North Atlantic Teleconnection","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-03-19T16:55:11Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application","170523","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,,"85047073988",,"000432465200009","J. climate","11","Journal of Climate","31","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For all three fuels, ∼80% of submicron PM was organic (and sulfate, for HFO at higher engine loads). Emission factors varied only slightly with engine load. Refractory black carbon (rBC) particles were not thickly coated for any fuel; rBC was therefore externally mixed from organic and sulfate PM. For MGO and DF PM, rBC particles were lognormally distributed in size (mode at drBC≈120 nm). For HFO, much larger rBC particles were present. Combining the rBC mass concentrations with in situ absorption measurements yielded an rBC mass absorption coefficient MACBC,780nm of 7.8 ± 1.8 m2/g at 780 nm for all three fuels. Using positive deviations of the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) from unity to define brown carbon (brC), we found that brC absorption was negligible for MGO or DF PM (AAE(370,880 nm)≈1.0 ± 0.1) but typically 50% of total 370‐nm absorption for HFO PM. Even at 590 nm, ∼20  of the total absorption was due to brC. Using absorption at 880 nm as a reference for BC absorption and normalizing to organic PM mass, we obtained a MACOM,370nm of 0.4 m2/g at typical operating conditions. Furthermore, we calculated an imaginary refractive index of (0.045 ± 0.025)(λ/370nm)−3 for HFO PM at 370 nm>λ > 660 nm, more than twofold greater than previous recommendations. Climate models should account for this substantial brC absorption in HFO PM.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000273183",,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2017JD027818","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/273183","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Brown and Black Carbon Emitted by a Marine Engine Operated on Heavy Fuel Oil and Distillate Fuels: Optical Properties, Size Distributions, and Emission Factors","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-07-01T05:43:08Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85048418006",,"000436110800025","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","11","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","123","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we show that there are large differences in the global-scale atmospheric transport properties among the models participating in the IGAC SPARC Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative (CCMI). Specifically, we find up to 40 % differences in the transport timescales connecting the Northern Hemisphere (NH) midlatitude surface to the Arctic and to Southern Hemisphere high latitudes, where the mean age ranges between 1.7 and 2.6 years. We show that these differences are related to large differences in vertical transport among the simulations, in particular to differences in parameterized convection over the oceans. While stronger convection over NH midlatitudes is associated with slower transport to the Arctic, stronger convection in the tropics and subtropics is associated with faster interhemispheric transport. We also show that the differences among simulations constrained with fields derived from the same reanalysis products are as large as (and in some cases larger than) the differences among free-running simulations, most likely due to larger differences in parameterized convection. Our results indicate that care must be taken when using simulations constrained with analyzed winds to interpret the influence of meteorology on tropospheric composition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000268435",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-7217-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268435","en","European Geophysical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Large-scale tropospheric transport in the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI) simulations","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-06-08T06:56:32Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85047734884",,"000433159600001","Atmos. chem. phys.","10","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This claim has been questioned due to the inhomogeneity and low spatial‐temporal coverage of Rs observations. Based on direct comparisons of ~200 observed and sunshine duration (SunDu) derived Rs station pairs, meeting data record lengths exceeding 60 months and spatial distances less than 110 km, we show that meteorological observations of SunDu can be used as a proxy for measured Rs. Our revised results from ~2,600 stations show global dimming from the 1950s to the 1980s over China (−1.90 W/m2 per decade), Europe (−1.36 W/m2 per decade), and the United States (−1.10 W/m2 per decade), brightening from 1980 to 2009 in Europe (1.66 W/m2 per decade) and a decline from 1994 to 2010 in China (−1.06 W/m2 per decade). Even if 1994–2010 is well known as a period of global brightening, the observed and SunDu‐derived Rs over China still exhibit declining trends. Trends in Rs from 1923 to 1950 are also found over Europe (1.91 W/m2 per decade) and the United States (−1.31 W/m2 per decade), but the results in Europe may not well represent the actual trend for the European continent due to poor spatial sampling.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000268470",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2018GL077424","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268470","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"A Revisit of Global Dimming and Brightening Based on the Sunshine Duration","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-06-08T07:00:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85046420886",,"000434111700059","Geophys.

It has been argued that model uncertainty can be decreased by giving more weight to those models in multimodel ensembles that are more skillful and realistic for a specific process or application. In addition, some models in multimodel ensembles are not independent. We use a weighting approach proposed recently that takes into account both model performance and interdependence and apply it to investigate projections of summer maximum temperature climatology over North America in two regions of different sizes. We quantify the influence of predicting diagnostics included in the method, look at ways how to choose them, and assess the influence of the observational data set used. The trend in shortwave radiation, mean precipitation, sea surface temperature variability, and variability and trend in maximum temperature itself are the most promising constraints on projections of summer maximum temperature over North America. The influence of the observational data sets is large for summer temperature climatology, since the observational and reanalysis products used for absolute maximum temperatures disagree. Including multiple predicting diagnostics leads to more similar results for different data sets. We find that the weighted multimodel mean reduces the change in summer daily temperature maxima compared to the nonweighted mean slightly (0.05–0.45 °C) over the central United States. We show that it is essential to have reliable observations for key variables to be able to constrain multimodel ensembles of future projections.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000268868",,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2017JD027992","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268868","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","weighting||multimodel ensemble||summer temperature||independence||performance","Prospects and Caveats of Weighting Climate Models for Summer Maximum Temperature Projections Over North America","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-06-09T07:18:45Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85047880544",,"000434132400007","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","9","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","123","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous studies have reported a large spread in the simulation of AoA by GCMs and coupled chemistry–climate models (CCMs). Compared to observational estimates, simulated AoA is mostly too low. Here we attempt to untangle the processes that lead to the AoA differences between the models and between models and observations. AoA is influenced by both mean transport by the residual circulation and two-way mixing; we quantify the effects of these processes using data from the CCM inter-comparison projects CCMVal-2 (Chemistry–Climate Model Validation Activity 2) and CCMI-1 (Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative, phase 1). Transport along the residual circulation is measured by the residual circulation transit time (RCTT). We interpret the difference between AoA and RCTT as additional aging by mixing. Aging by mixing thus includes mixing on both the resolved and subgrid scale. We find that the spread in AoA between the models is primarily caused by differences in the effects of mixing and only to some extent by differences in residual circulation strength. These effects are quantified by the mixing efficiency, a measure of the relative increase in AoA by mixing. The mixing efficiency varies strongly between the models from 0.24 to 1.02. We show that the mixing efficiency is not only controlled by horizontal mixing, but by vertical mixing and vertical diffusion as well. Possible causes for the differences in the models' mixing efficiencies are discussed. Differences in subgrid-scale mixing (including differences in advection schemes and model resolutions) likely contribute to the differences in mixing efficiency. However, differences in the relative contribution of resolved versus parameterized wave forcing do not appear to be related to differences in mixing efficiency or AoA.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000266082",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-6699-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/266082","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Quantifying the effect of mixing on the mean age of air in CCMVal-2 and CCMI-1 models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-05-26T04:46:53Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85047001465",,"000432204900002","Atmos. chem. phys.","9","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The two approaches yield similar overall results regarding changes in climate extremes on land, and reveal a substantial difference in the occurrence of regional extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C. Land processes mediated through soil moisture feedbacks and land-use forcing play a major role for projected changes in extremes at 1.5°C in most mid-latitude regions, including densely populated areas in North America, Europe and Asia. This has important implications for low-emissions scenarios derived from integrated assessment models (IAMs), which include major LUCs in ambitious mitigation pathways (e.g. associated with increased bioenergy use), but are also shown to differ in the simulated LUC patterns. Biogeophysical effects from LUCs are not considered in the development of IAM scenarios, but play an important role for projected regional changes in climate extremes, and are thus of high relevance for sustainable development pathways.

Article 4 points to this long-term goal and the need to achieve ‘balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases'. This statement on ‘greenhouse gas balance’ is subject to interpretation, and clarifications are needed to make it operational for national and international climate policies. We study possible interpretations from a scientific perspective and analyse their climatic implications. We clarify how the implications for individual gases depend on the metrics used to relate them. We show that the way in which balance is interpreted, achieved and maintained influences temperature outcomes. Achieving and maintaining net-zero CO2-equivalent emissions conventionally calculated using GWP100 (100-year global warming potential) and including substantial positive contributions from short-lived climate-forcing agents such as methane would result in a sustained decline in global temperature. A modified approach to the use of GWP100 (that equates constant emissions of short-lived climate forcers with zero sustained emission of CO2) results in global temperatures remaining approximately constant once net-zero CO2-equivalent emissions are achieved and maintained. Our paper provides policymakers with an overview of issues and choices that are important to determine which approach is most appropriate in the context of the Paris Agreement.

Results are based on regional downscaling of transient climate change simulations for the 21st century with global climate models (GCMs) from the fifth-phase Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We use an ensemble of EURO-CORDEX high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) simulations undertaken at a computational grid of 12.5 km horizontal resolution covering Europe. The ensemble consists of a range of RCMs that have been used for downscaling different GCMs under the RCP8.5 forcing scenario. The results indicate considerable near-surface warming already at the lower 1.5 °C of warming. Regional warming exceeds that of the global mean in most parts of Europe, being the strongest in the northernmost parts of Europe in winter and in the southernmost parts of Europe together with parts of Scandinavia in summer. Changes in precipitation, which are less robust than the ones in temperature, include increases in the north and decreases in the south with a borderline that migrates from a northerly position in summer to a southerly one in winter. Some of these changes are already seen at 1.5 °C of warming but are larger and more robust at 2 °C. Changes in near-surface wind speed are associated with a large spread among individual ensemble members at both warming levels. Relatively large areas over the North Atlantic and some parts of the continent show decreasing wind speed while some ocean areas in the far north show increasing wind speed. The changes in temperature, precipitation and wind speed are shown to be modified by changes in mean sea level pressure, indicating a strong relationship with the large-scale circulation and its internal variability on decade-long timescales. By comparing to a larger ensemble of CMIP5 GCMs we find that the RCMs can alter the results, leading either to attenuation or amplification of the climate change signal in the underlying GCMs. We find that the RCMs tend to produce less warming and more precipitation (or less drying) in many areas in both winter and summer.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000265233",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-9-459-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/265233","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"European climate change at global mean temperature increases of 1.5 and 2 degrees C above pre-industrial conditions as simulated by the EURO-CORDEX regional climate models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-05-22T04:34:55Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85046841113",,"000431804900001",,"2","Earth System Dynamics","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Many recent model studies demonstrate that changes in initial soil moisture content result in modified convective precipitation. However, to quantify the resulting precipitation changes, the chaotic behavior of the atmospheric system needs to be considered. Slight changes in the simulation setup, such as the chosen model domain, also result in modifications to the simulated precipitation field. This causes an uncertainty due to stochastic variability, which can be large compared to effects caused by soil moisture variations. By shifting the model domain, we estimate the uncertainty of the model results. Our novel uncertainty estimate includes 10 simulations with shifted model boundaries and is compared to the effects on precipitation caused by variations in soil moisture amount and local distribution. With this approach, the influence of soil moisture amount and distribution on convective precipitation is quantified. Deviations in simulated precipitation can only be attributed to soil moisture impacts if the systematic effects of soil moisture modifications are larger than the inherent simulation uncertainty at the convection-resolving scale.  We performed seven experiments with modified soil moisture amount or distribution to address the effect of soil moisture on precipitation. Each of the experiments consists of 10 ensemble members using the deep convection-resolving COSMO model with a grid spacing of 2.8 km. Only in experiments with very strong modification in soil moisture do precipitation changes exceed the model spread in amplitude, location or structure. These changes are caused by a 50% soil moisture increase in either the whole or part of the model domain or by drying the whole model domain. Increasing or decreasing soil moisture both predominantly results in reduced precipitation rates. Replacing the soil moisture with realistic fields from different days has an insignificant influence on precipitation. The findings of this study underline the need for uncertainty estimates in soil moisture studies based on convection-resolving models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000342132",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-6413-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/342132","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Assessing the uncertainty of soil moisture impacts on convective precipitation using a new ensemble approach","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-05-15T07:03:26Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","9","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This article describes and evaluates the model version ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3-MOZ1.0 with a focus on the tropospheric gas-phase chemistry. A 10-year model simulation was performed to test the stability of the model and provide data for its evaluation. The comparison to observations concentrates on the year 2008 and includes total column observations of ozone and CO from IASI and OMI, Aura MLS observations of temperature, HNO3, ClO, and O3 for the evaluation of polar stratospheric processes, an ozonesonde climatology, surface ozone observations from the TOAR database, and surface CO data from the Global Atmosphere Watch network. Global budgets of ozone, OH, NOx, aerosols, clouds, and radiation are analyzed and compared to the literature. ECHAM-HAMMOZ performs well in many aspects. However, in the base simulation, lightning NOx emissions are very low, and the impact of the heterogeneous reaction of HNO3 on dust and sea salt aerosol is too strong. Sensitivity simulations with increased lightning NOx or modified heterogeneous chemistry deteriorate the comparison with observations and yield excessively large ozone budget terms and too much OH. We hypothesize that this is an impact of potential issues with tropical convection in the ECHAM model.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000265168",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-11-1695-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/265168","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The chemistry-climate model ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3-MOZ1.0","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-05-18T17:28:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding","603445","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,,"85046833399",,"000431411600001","Geosci. model dev.","5","Geoscientific Model Development","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This raises the question whether a map of warming or precipitation change in a world 1.5 °C warmer than preindustrial can be emulated from existing simulations that reach higher warming targets, or whether entirely new simulations are required. Here we show that also for this type of low warming in strong mitigation scenarios, climate change signals are quite linear as a function of global temperature. Therefore, emulation techniques amounting to linear rescaling on the basis of global temperature change ratios (like simple pattern scaling) provide a viable way forward. The errors introduced are small relative to the spread in the forced response to a given scenario that we can assess from a multi-model ensemble. They are also small relative to the noise introduced into the estimates of the forced response by internal variability within a single model, which we can assess from either control simulations or initial condition ensembles. Challenges arise when scaling inadvertently reduces the inter-model spread or suppresses the internal variability, both important sources of uncertainty for impact assessment, or when the scenarios have very different characteristics in the composition of the forcings. Taking advantage of an available suite of coupled model simulations under low-warming and intermediate scenarios, we evaluate the accuracy of these emulation techniques and show that they are unlikely to represent a substantial contribution to the total uncertainty.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000265125",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aabef2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/265125","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","BRACE1.5||Paris agreement||benefits of mitigation||pattern scaling||low-warming scenarios||climate model emulation","Evaluating the accuracy of climate change pattern emulation for low warming targets","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-05-18T16:30:11Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85048141889",,"000431454000002","Environ.

This can potentially be attained through an increased understanding of the relationship between heatwaves and one of their main dynamical drivers, atmospheric blocking. In the 1979–2015 period, we find that there is a significant correlation between summer heatwave magnitudes and the number of days influenced by atmospheric blocking in Northern Europe and Western Russia. Using three large global climate model ensembles, we find similar correlations, indicating that these three models are able to represent the relationship between extreme temperature and atmospheric blocking, despite having biases in their simulation of individual climate variables such as temperature or geopotential height. Our results emphasize the need to use large ensembles of different global climate models as single realizations do not always capture this relationship. The three large ensembles further suggest that the relationship between summer heatwaves and atmospheric blocking will not change in the future. This could be used to statistically model heatwaves with atmospheric blocking as a covariate and aid decision-makers in planning disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000265164",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aaba55","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/265164","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","summer heatwaves||atmospheric blocking||large global climate model ensembles","Influence of blocking on Northern European and Western Russian heatwaves in large climate model ensembles","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-05-18T17:25:39Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The mutual interaction of individual weather systems and weather regimes","148177","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,,"85048121590",,"000431402500001","Environ.

Based on the results of a very high-resolution global model, we show that, even at 1.5 °C warming, a significant increase in heat wave magnitude is expected over Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. Compared to a 1.5 °C world, under 2 °C warming the frequency of extreme heat waves would double over most of the globe. In a 1.5 °C world, 13.8% of the world population will be exposed to severe heat waves at least once every 5 years. This fraction becomes nearly three times larger (36.9%) under 2 °C warming, i.e. a difference of around 1.7 billion people. Limiting global warming to 1.5 °C will also result in around 420 million fewer people being frequently exposed to extreme heat waves, and ~65 million to exceptional heat waves. Nearly 700 million people (9.0% of world population) will be exposed to extreme heat waves at least once every 20 years in a 1.5 °C world, but more than 2 billion people (28.2%) in a 2 °C world.

Using a number of observation- and model-based methods, we find that there was an anthropogenic contribution to the extremes in southern Europe, with a qualitative consensus across all methodologies. There was a consensus across the methodologies that there has been a significant increase in the risk of hot summers in southern Europe with climate change. Most approaches also suggested a slight drying, but none of the results were statistically significant. The unusually wet summer in northern Europe was made more likely by the observed atmospheric circulation pattern in 2012, but no evidence was found for a long-term trend in circulation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000192225",,"0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-017-3822-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/192225","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Attribution||Precipitation||Drought","Multiple perspectives on the attribution of the extreme European summer of 2012 to climate change","Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2017-10-06T04:46:35Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85026436952",,"000429650700022","Clim Dyn","9-10","Climate Dynamics","50","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To investigate the effect of solutes on their IN efficiency, we performed immersion freezing experiments with the K-feldspar microcline, which is highly IN active. Freezing of emulsified droplets with microcline suspended in aqueous solutions of NH3, (NH4)2SO4, NH4HSO4, NH4NO3, NH4Cl, Na2SO4, H2SO4, K2SO4 and KCl, with solute concentrations corresponding to water activities aw  =  0.9–1.0, were investigated by means of a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The measured heterogeneous IN onset temperatures, Thet(aw), deviate strongly from ThetΔawhet(aw), the values calculated from the water-activity-based approach (where ThetΔawhet(aw) = Tmelt(aw + Δawhet) with a constant offset Δawhet with respect to the ice melting point curve). Surprisingly, for very dilute solutions of NH3 and NH4+ salts (molalities ≲1 mol kg−1 corresponding to aw ≳ 0.96), we find IN temperatures raised by up to 4.5 K above the onset freezing temperature of microcline in pure water (Thet(aw = 1)) and 5.5 K above ThetΔawhet(aw), revealing NH3 and NH4+ to significantly enhance the IN of the microcline surface. Conversely, more concentrated NH3 and NH4+ solutions show a depression of the onset temperature below ThetΔawhet(aw) by as much as 13.5 K caused by a decline in IN ability accompanied with a reduction in the volume fraction of water frozen heterogeneously. All salt solutions not containing NH4+ as cation exhibit nucleation temperatures Thet(aw) < ThetΔawhet(aw) even at very small solute concentrations. In all these cases, the heterogeneous freezing peak displays a decrease as solute concentration increases. This deviation from Δawhet  =  const. indicates specific chemical interactions between particular solutes and the microcline surface not captured by the water-activity-based approach. One such interaction is the exchange of K+ available on the microcline surface with externally added cations (e.g., NH4+). However, the presence of a similar increase in IN efficiency in dilute ammonia solutions indicates that the cation exchange cannot explain the increase in IN temperatures. Instead, we hypothesize that NH3 molecules hydrogen bonded on the microcline surface form an ice-like overlayer, which provides hydrogen bonding favorable for ice to nucleate on, thus enhancing both the freezing temperatures and the heterogeneously frozen fraction in dilute NH3 and NH4+ solutions. Moreover, we show that aging of microcline in concentrated solutions over several days does not impair IN efficiency permanently in case of near-neutral solutions since most of it recovers when aged particles are resuspended in pure water. In contrast, exposure to severe acidity (pH ≲1.2) or alkalinity (pH ≳11.7) damages the microcline surface, hampering or even destroying the IN efficiency irreversibly. Implications for IN in airborne dust containing microcline might be multifold, ranging from a reduction of immersion freezing when exposed to dry, cold and acidic conditions to a 5 K enhancement during condensation freezing when microcline particles experience high humidity (aw≳0.96) at warm (252–257 K) and NH3/NH4+-rich conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000267937",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-7057-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/267937","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ice nucleation activity of silicates and aluminosilicates in pure water and aqueous solutions - Part 1: The K-feldspar microcline","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-06-07T04:36:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Ice freezing on mineral dust samples","156251","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,"85047630745",,"000433000900003","Atmos. chem. phys.","10","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The potential for skillful seasonal forecasts of the winter NAO using an ensemble‐based dynamical prediction system has only recently been demonstrated. Here we show that the winter predictability can be significantly improved by refining a dynamical ensemble through subsampling. We enhance prediction skill of surface temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure over essential parts of the Northern Hemisphere by retaining only the ensemble members whose NAO state is close to a “first guess” NAO prediction based on a statistical analysis of the initial autumn state of the ocean, sea ice, land, and stratosphere. The correlation coefficient between the reforecasted and observation‐based winter NAO is significantly increased from 0.49 to 0.83 over a reforecast period from 1982 to 2016, and from 0.42 to 0.86 for a forecast period from 2001 to 2017. Our novel approach represents a successful and robust alternative to further increasing the ensemble size, and potentially can be used in operational seasonal prediction systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000268369",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1002/2018GL077209","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268369","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Improved Teleconnection-Based Dynamical Seasonal Predictions of Boreal Winter","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-06-08T06:47:05Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application","170523","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,,"85045279784",,"000435745500033","Geophys.

Important elements of such events are rain showers and thunderstorms, which are poorly represented in models with parameterized convection. In this study, simulations with 12 km horizontal grid spacing (convection-parameterizing model, CPM) and 2 km grid spacing (convection-resolving model, CRM) are employed to investigate the change in the diurnal cycle of convection with warmer climate. For this purpose, simulations of 11 days in June 2007 with a pronounced diurnal cycle of convection are compared with surrogate simulations from the same period. The surrogate climate simulations mimic a future climate with increased temperatures but unchanged relative humidity and similar synoptic-scale circulation. Two temperature scenarios are compared: one with homogeneous warming (HW) using a vertically uniform warming and the other with vertically dependent warming (VW) that enables changes in lapse rate.  The two sets of simulations with parameterized and explicit convection exhibit substantial differences, some of which are well known from the literature. These include differences in the timing and amplitude of the diurnal cycle of convection, and the frequency of precipitation with low intensities. The response to climate change is much less studied. We can show that stratification changes have a strong influence on the changes in convection. Precipitation is strongly increasing for HW but decreasing for the VW simulations. For cloud type frequencies, virtually no changes are found for HW, but a substantial reduction in high clouds is found for VW. Further, we can show that the climate change signal strongly depends upon the horizontal resolution. In particular, significant differences between CPM and CRM are found in terms of the radiative feedbacks, with CRM exhibiting a stronger negative feedback in the top-of-the-atmosphere energy budget.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000261001",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-5253-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/261001","en","EGU","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The sensitivity of alpine summer convection to surrogate climate change: An intercomparison between convection-parameterizing and convection-resolving models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-04-27T05:13:12Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85045678525",,"000430450200003","Atmos. chem. phys.","8","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To this end we first consider the quality of individual daily records using a combination of quality flags from data providers and automated screening methods. Subsequently, streamflow time-series indices are computed for yearly, seasonal and monthly resolution. The paper provides a generalized assessment of the homogeneity of all generated streamflow time-series indices, which can be used to select time series that are suitable for a specific task. The newly generated global set of streamflow time-series indices is made freely available with an digital object identifier at https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.887470 and is expected to foster global freshwater research, by acting as a ground truth for model validation or as a basis for assessing the role of human impacts on the terrestrial water cycle.

It also describes the development of three metadata products (freely available at https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.887477): (1) a GSIM catalogue collating basic metadata associated with each time series, (2) catchment boundaries for the contributing area of each gauge, and (3) catchment metadata extracted from 12 gridded global data products representing essential properties such as land cover type, soil type, and climate and topographic characteristics. The quality of the delineated catchment boundary is also made available and should be consulted in GSIM application. The second paper in the series then explores production and analysis of streamflow indices. Having collated an unprecedented number of stations and associated metadata, GSIM can be used to advance large-scale hydrological research and improve understanding of the global water cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000261003",,"1866-3516||1866-3508",,"10.5194/essd-10-765-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/261003","en","Copernicus Publ.","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The Global Streamflow Indices and Metadata Archive (GSIM)-Part 1: The production of a daily streamflow archive and metadata","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-04-27T05:13:12Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85045539880",,"000430306700001","Earth syst. sci. data","2","Earth System Science Data","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, the representation of drought persistence in GCMs is assessed by comparing state‐of‐the‐art GCM model simulations to observation‐based data sets. For doing so, we consider dry‐to‐dry transition probabilities at monthly and annual scales as estimates for drought persistence, where a dry status is defined as negative precipitation anomaly. Though there is a substantial spread in the drought persistence bias, most of the simulations show systematic underestimation of drought persistence at global scale. Subsequently, we analyzed to which degree (i) inaccurate observations, (ii) differences among models, (iii) internal climate variability, and (iv) uncertainty of the employed statistical methods contribute to the spread in drought persistence errors using an analysis of variance approach. The results show that at monthly scale, model uncertainty and observational uncertainty dominate, while the contribution from internal variability is small in most cases. At annual scale, the spread of the drought persistence error is dominated by the statistical estimation error of drought persistence, indicating that the partitioning of the error is impaired by the limited number of considered time steps. These findings reveal systematic errors in the representation of drought persistence in current GCMs and suggest directions for further model improvement.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000261754",,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1002/2017JD027577","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/261754","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Drought Persistence Errors in Global Climate Models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-05-02T05:20:08Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85045195406",,"000430786500009","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","7","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","123","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It redistributes moisture and heat vertically and thus changes the stratification ofthe atmosphere. The associated clouds interact with radiation and generate precipitation. Convective precipitation can be very intense and may cause flooding and trigger land slides. A good understanding and simulation of moist convection is therefore of crucial importance for both numerical weather prediction and climate projections. Nowadays, the available computational resources allow for simulations with explicitly resolved convection over increasingly large domains. This study aims at analysing, howthe degree ofdetail in the representation oftopography and surface fields influences the simulation of orographic moist convection. Nine days (11-19 July 2006) of fair-weather orographic moist convection over the Alps are analysed. Two sets of COSMO simulations are compared, each consisting of three runs at horizontal grid spacings of 4.4, 2.2, and 1.1 km: one with fixed and one with varying representation of topography and surface fields with model resolution. The results show that with higher degree of detail in the topography and surface fields, the convergence/divergence of the mesoscale flow over the Alps during the day/night (Alpine pumping) is enhanced. Convection is triggered later, its maximum intensity is reduced and it lasts for a longer time. The longer duration compensates for the reduced intensity such that total accumulated precipitation at the surface increases. This additional precipitation is mostly generated by secondary convective cells over the Po Valley and the Southern edge of the Alpine arc. The single convective cells are weaker and smaller, but their number increases. The cloud field changes accordingly - the convective clouds are more numerous but smaller. Generally, a higher degree of detail in the topography and surface fields affects the simulation of orographic moist convection substantially. Overall, these findings indicate the expected changes that will occur with increasing model resolution due to the coupling between the atmosphere and the land surface","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000288269",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/288269","en","Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science (IAC), ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Moist-Convection||Orography||Alpine Weather","The Influence of the Resolution of Topography and Surface Fields on the Simulation of Orographic Moist Convection","Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2018-09-10T18:50:27Z","2019-03-01",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Mean and extreme precipitation is projected to increase under warming over the two monsoon regions, more strongly in the 2.0 °C warmer world. Moisture budget analysis shows that increases in evaporation and atmospheric moisture lead to the additional increases in mean precipitation with good inter-model agreement. Analysis of daily precipitation characteristics reveals that more-extreme precipitation will have larger increase in intensity and frequency responding to the half a degree additional warming, which is more clearly seen over the South Asian monsoon region, indicating non-linear scaling of precipitation extremes with temperature. Strong inter-model relationship between temperature and precipitation intensity further demonstrates that the increased moisture with warming (Clausius-Clapeyron relation) plays a critical role in the stronger intensification of more-extreme rainfall with warming. Results from CMIP5 coupled global climate models under a transient warming scenario confirm that half a degree additional warming would bring more frequent and stronger heavy precipitation events, exerting devastating impacts on the human and natural system over the Asian monsoon region.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000260642",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aab55d","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/260642","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","HAPPI||Paris Agreement||Asian summer monsoon||extreme precipitation||Clausius-Clapeyron relation","Impacts of half a degree additional warming on the Asian summer monsoon rainfall characteristics","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-04-26T02:40:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85047482612",,"000429957800002","Environ.

It is thus of key importance for stakeholders to assess the possible implications of different global temperature thresholds on these quantities. Using a subset of climate model simulations from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), we derive here the sensitivity of regional changes in precipitation and in precipitation minus evapotranspiration to global temperature changes. The simulations span the full range of available emission scenarios, and the sensitivities are derived using a modified pattern scaling approach. The applied approach assumes linear relationships on global temperature changes while thoroughly addressing associated uncertainties via resampling methods. This allows us to assess the full distribution of the simulations in a probabilistic sense. Northern high-latitude regions display robust responses towards wetting, while subtropical regions display a tendency towards drying but with a large range of responses. Even though both internal variability and the scenario choice play an important role in the overall spread of the simulations, the uncertainty stemming from the climate model choice usually accounts for about half of the total uncertainty in most regions. We additionally assess the implications of limiting global mean temperature warming to values below (i) 2 K or (ii) 1.5 K (as stated within the 2015 Paris Agreement). We show that opting for the 1.5 K target might just slightly influence the mean response, but could substantially reduce the risk of experiencing extreme changes in regional water availability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000251688",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-9-227-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/251688","en","Copernicus Publ.","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Regional scaling of annual mean precipitation and water availability with global temperature change","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-03-22T04:12:09Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85043592559",,"000427315400001",,"1","Earth System Dynamics","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Understanding the role of natural forcings and their influence on global warming is thus of great interest. Here we investigate the impact of a recently proposed 21st century grand solar minimum on atmospheric chemistry and climate using the SOCOL3-MPIOM chemistry–climate model with an interactive ocean element. We examine five model simulations for the period 2000–2199, following the greenhouse gas concentration scenario RCP4.5 and a range of different solar forcings. The reference simulation is forced by perpetual repetition of solar cycle 23 until the year 2199. This reference is compared with grand solar minimum simulations, assuming a strong decline in solar activity of 3.5 and 6.5 W m−2, respectively, that last either until 2199 or recover in the 22nd century. Decreased solar activity by 6.5 W m−2 is found to yield up to a doubling of the GHG-induced stratospheric and mesospheric cooling. Under the grand solar minimum scenario, tropospheric temperatures are also projected to decrease compared to the reference. On the global scale a reduced solar forcing compensates for at most 15 % of the expected greenhouse warming at the end of the 21st and around 25 % at the end of the 22nd century. The regional effects are predicted to be significant, in particular in northern high-latitude winter. In the stratosphere, the reduction of around 15 % of incoming ultraviolet radiation leads to a decrease in ozone production by up to 8 %, which overcompensates for the anticipated ozone increase due to reduced stratospheric temperatures and an acceleration of the Brewer–Dobson circulation. This, in turn, leads to a delay in total ozone column recovery from anthropogenic halogen-induced depletion, with a global ozone recovery to the pre-ozone hole values happening only upon completion of the grand solar minimum.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000278124",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/251704||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/221532","10.5194/acp-18-3469-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/278124","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Implications of potential future grand solar minimum for ozone layer and climate","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-12-15T11:30:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85043394123","https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/18/3469/2018/acp-18-3469-2018-assets.html","000426918800008","Atmos. chem. phys.",,"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, despite our increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms, the magnitudes of the impacts of different types of extremes on GPP and Reco within and between ecosystems remain poorly predicted.  Here we aim to identify the major factors controlling the amplitude of extreme-event impacts on GPP, Reco, and the resulting net ecosystem production (NEP). We focus on the impacts of heat and drought and their combination. We identified hydrometeorological extreme events in consistently downscaled water availability and temperature measurements over a 30-year time period. We then used FLUXNET eddy covariance flux measurements to estimate the CO2 flux anomalies during these extreme events across dominant vegetation types and climate zones.  Overall, our results indicate that short-term heat extremes increased respiration more strongly than they downregulated GPP, resulting in a moderate reduction in the ecosystem's carbon sink potential. In the absence of heat stress, droughts tended to have smaller and similarly dampening effects on both GPP and Reco and, hence, often resulted in neutral NEP responses. The combination of drought and heat typically led to a strong decrease in GPP, whereas heat and drought impacts on respiration partially offset each other. Taken together, compound heat and drought events led to the strongest C sink reduction compared to any single-factor extreme. A key insight of this paper, however, is that duration matters most: for heat stress during droughts, the magnitude of impacts systematically increased with duration, whereas under heat stress without drought, the response of Reco over time turned from an initial increase to a downregulation after about 2 weeks. This confirms earlier theories that not only the magnitude but also the duration of an extreme event determines its impact.  Our study corroborates the results of several local site-level case studies but as a novelty generalizes these findings on the global scale. Specifically, we find that the different response functions of the two antipodal land–atmosphere fluxes GPP and Reco can also result in increasing NEP during certain extreme conditions. Apparently counterintuitive findings of this kind bear great potential for scrutinizing the mechanisms implemented in state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere models and provide a benchmark for future model development and testing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000224136",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-15-1293-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/253686","en","Copernicus Publ.","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Impacts of droughts and extreme temperature events on gross primary production and ecosystem respiration: a systematic assessment across ecosystems and climate zones","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-12-21T18:07:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85042916984",,"000426750400002",,"5","Biogeosciences","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

With the recent international commitment to limit global warming to well below 2°C, emission reductions need to be ambitious and could involve major land‐use change (LUC). Land‐based mitigation efforts to curb emissions growth include increasing terrestrial carbon sequestration through reforestation, or the adoption of bioenergy crops. These activities influence local climate through biogeophysical feedbacks, however, it is uncertain how important they are for a 1.5° climate target. This was the motivation for HAPPI‐Land: the half a degree additional warming, prognosis, and projected impacts—land‐use scenario experiment. Using four Earth system models, we present the first multimodel results from HAPPI‐Land and demonstrate the critical role of land use for understanding the characteristics of regional climate extremes in low‐emission scenarios. In particular, our results show that changes in temperature extremes due to LUC are comparable in magnitude to changes arising from half a degree of global warming. We also demonstrate that LUC contributes to more than 20% of the change in temperature extremes for large land areas concentrated over the Northern Hemisphere. However, we also identify sources of uncertainty that influence the multimodel consensus of our results including how LUC is implemented and the corresponding biogeophysical feedbacks that perturb climate. Therefore, our results highlight the urgent need to resolve the challenges in implementing LUC across models to quantify the impacts and consider how LUC contributes to regional changes in extremes associated with sustainable development pathways.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000260991",,"2328-4277",,"10.1002/2017EF000744","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/260991","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Biogeophysical Impacts of Land-Use Change on Climate Extremes in Low-Emission Scenarios: Results From HAPPI-Land","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-04-27T05:12:07Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach","641816","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,,,"85045531364",,"000430171600008",,"3","Earth's Future","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, this cost‐benefit approach may not guarantee robustness under uncertain future conditions, for instance under climatic changes. In this paper, we expand risk‐based decision analysis to explore possible ways of enhancing robustness in engineered water resources systems under different risk attitudes. Risk is measured as the expected annual cost of water use restrictions, while robustness is interpreted in the decision‐theoretic sense as the ability of a water resource system to maintain performance—expressed as a tolerable risk of water use restrictions—under a wide range of possible future conditions. Linking risk attitudes with robustness allows stakeholders to explicitly trade‐off incremental increases in robustness with investment costs for a given level of risk. We illustrate the framework through a case study of London's water supply system using state‐of‐the ‐art regional climate simulations to inform the estimation of risk and robustness.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000260988",,"2328-4277",,"10.1002/2017EF000730","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/260988","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Risk, Robustness and Water Resources Planning Under Uncertainty","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-04-27T05:10:33Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85043469539",,"000430171600013",,"3","Earth's Future","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Tambora in 1815 was the largest volcanic eruption of the past 500 years. The eruption had significant climatic impacts, leading to the 1816 “year without a summer”, and remains a valuable event from which to understand the climatic effects of large stratospheric volcanic sulfur dioxide injections. The eruption also resulted in one of the strongest and most easily identifiable volcanic sulfate signals in polar ice cores, which are widely used to reconstruct the timing and atmospheric sulfate loading of past eruptions. As part of the Model Intercomparison Project on the climatic response to Volcanic forcing (VolMIP), five state-of-the-art global aerosol models simulated this eruption. We analyse both simulated background (no Tambora) and volcanic (with Tambora) sulfate deposition to polar regions and compare to ice core records. The models simulate overall similar patterns of background sulfate deposition, although there are differences in regional details and magnitude. However, the volcanic sulfate deposition varies considerably between the models with differences in timing, spatial pattern and magnitude. Mean simulated deposited sulfate on Antarctica ranges from 19 to 264 kg km−2 and on Greenland from 31 to 194 kg km−2, as compared to the mean ice-core-derived estimates of roughly 50 kg km−2 for both Greenland and Antarctica. The ratio of the hemispheric atmospheric sulfate aerosol burden after the eruption to the average ice sheet deposited sulfate varies between models by up to a factor of 15. Sources of this inter-model variability include differences in both the formation and the transport of sulfate aerosol. Our results suggest that deriving relationships between sulfate deposited on ice sheets and atmospheric sulfate burdens from model simulations may be associated with greater uncertainties than previously thought.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000221531",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/244487||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/221531","10.5194/acp-18-2307-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/253165","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Multi-model comparison of the volcanic sulfate deposition from the 1815 eruption of Mt.

They impact the global radiation budget with their varying optical properties and can trigger precipitation events. The governing microphysical processes are complex and ice formation mechanisms are still not understood completely rendering the accurate representation of MPCs in atmo- spheric models difficult. Determining the size distribution and phase fractions down to the micrometer scale is still a major challenge for current generation instruments. In this work a new device is presented, the high-speed Particle Phase Discriminator (PPD-HS). PPD-HS was originally developed for discrimination of spherical and aspherical particles based on (reduced information of) spatial distribution of forward scattered light of single particles. Here we use a variety of test particles (e.g. oil droplets, salt crystals) between approximately 3 and 15μm in diameter, to present a new method how phase discrimination can reliably be achieved. A misclassification of 8.7% between spherical and aspherical particle was found. PPD-HS was subsequently used to discriminate phase of (real) cloud particles under mixed-phase cloud conditions in a continuous flow diffusion chamber setup. A size detection limit of 1 μm and a phase discrimination limit of 2.5 μm was found for PPD-HS.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000566869",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566869","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","clouds; mixed-phase clouds; cloud droplets; ice crystals; phase discrimination; meteorology; instrumentation development","The high-speed particle phase discriminator - PPD-HS","Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2022-08-26T13:29:40Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In fact, a train derailment on 19 January 2007 was attributed to the strong cross-valley winds occuring during a Laseyer event. This event further highlighted a very characteristic feature of this wind storm: the regional wind aloft (as measured at the station Ebenalp) was westerly, and thus opposing the easterly winds needed in the valley (measured at Wasserauen) to lift the coach off the railway tracks. In this study, wind observations at several sites are used to detect and characterize Laseyer events between 1998–2009. Two main conclusions are: (i) strong easterly winds at Wasserauen occur almost exclusively concurrently with strong westerly winds on Ebenalp, whereby the directional window of the westerly winds on Ebenalp is very narrow (265°–295°); (ii) the gust speeds at Wasserauen increase abruptly at the Laseyer's onset, a smoother maximum in gust speeds on Ebenalp is discernible, and, remarkably, the free-tropospheric mean wind speed measured at the nearby Säntis mountain peak exhibits a mimimum – indicating that the Laseyer wind is typically associated with a transient meso-scale flow situation. Potential mechanisms leading to the Laseyer wind storm are presented, including rotor circulations, recirculation bubbles, vortex shedding and gravity waves. No conclusive answer can be given, but it is argued that classic rotors and gravity waves play only a minor role due to the narrowness of the valley.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000239023",,"0941-2948||1610-1227",,"10.1127/metz/2017/0854","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/239023","en","Borntraeger","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","wind storm||Laseyer||rotor","The Laseyer wind storm - case studies and a climatology","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-02-07T02:42:10Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000423222900002","Meteorol.

The synoptic environment as well as the mesoscale structure and the dynamics of the easterly wind are examined with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses and a simulation with the mesoscale non-hydrostatic limited-area weather prediction model COSMO with a grid spacing of 2.2 km.The large-scale synoptic situation leading to this Puelche event is characterized by a mid-tropospheric cut-off low above the mountain range, the formation of a coastal surface low, as well as high pressure extending over the southern Andes. Easterly winds extend throughout the entire troposphere, indicative of a deep foehn flow. In the free troposphere, the easterlies are geostrophically balanced and develop in association with increasing pressure to the south. In contrast, within the planetary boundary layer, the easterly winds occur predominantly due to an increasing cross-range large-scale pressure gradient with only a weak geostrophic component. Kinematic trajectories indicate that a significant part of the Puelche air mass originates from above an inversion on the upstream side of the Andes. Some air parcels, however, ascend on the upstream side to crest height as the boundary layer deepens during daytime and/or flow through gaps across the mountain range. Hence, this Puelche event shares characteristics of both a blocked and a non-blocked foehn type.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000239024",,"0941-2948||1610-1227",,"10.1127/metz/2017/0841","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/239024","en","Borntraeger","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","Puelche||Andes||foehn mechanisms||downslope flows||COSMO simulation||trajectories","Dynamics of a Puelche foehn event in the Andes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-02-07T02:47:04Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000423222900006","Meteorol.

This area of ca. 1230 km2 is characterized by contrasting geomorphologic, climatic and lithological patterns, resulting in different landslide types. In this study, the spatial pattern of landslide susceptibility is investigated based on an extensive field inventory constructed for five representative areas within the region (153 km2) and containing over 450 landslides. To achieve a reliable susceptibility assessment, the effects of (1) using different topographic data sources and spatial resolutions and (2) changing the scale of assessment by comparing local and regional susceptibility models on the susceptibility model performances are investigated using a pixel-based logistic regression approach. Topographic data are extracted from different digital elevation models (DEMs) based on radar interferometry (SRTM and TanDEM-X) and optical stereophotogrammetry (ASTER DEM). Susceptibility models using the radar-based DEMs tend to outperform the ones using the ASTER DEM. The model spatial resolution is varied between 10, 20, 30 and 90 m. The optimal resolution depends on the location of the investigated area within the region but the lowest model resolution (90 m) rarely yields the best model performances while the highest model resolution (10 m) never results in significant increases in performance compared to the 20 m resolution. Models built for the local case studies generally have similar or better performances than the regional model and better reflect site-specific controlling factors. At the regional level the effect of distinguishing landslide types between shallow and deep-seated landslides is investigated. The separation of landslide types allows us to improve model performances for the prediction of deep-seated landslides and to better understand factors influencing the occurrence of shallow landslides such as tangent curvature and total rainfall. Finally, the landslide susceptibility assessment is overlaid with a population density map in order to identify potential landslide risk hotspots, which could direct research and policy action towards reduced landslide risk in this under-researched, landslide-prone region.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000234015",,"1561-8633||1684-9981",,"10.5194/nhess-18-105-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/234015","en","European Geosciences Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Field-based landslide susceptibility assessment in a data-scarce environment: the populated areas of the Rwenzori Mountains","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-01-25T02:54:47Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85040576462",,"000419722400001","Nat. hazards earth syst. sci.","1","Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We describe a new laboratory setup that couples an electrodynamic balance (EDB) to a mass spectrometer (MS). The EDB stores a single laboratory-generated particle in an electric field under atmospheric conditions for an arbitrarily long length of time. The particle is then transferred via gas flow to an ionization region that vaporizes and ionizes the analyte molecules before MS measurement. We demonstrate the feasibility of the technique by tracking evaporation of polyethylene glycol molecules and finding agreement with a kinetic model. Fitting data to the kinetic model also allows determination of vapor pressures to within a factor of 2. This EDB–MS system can be used to study fundamental chemical and physical processes involving particles that are difficult to isolate and study with other techniques. The results of such measurements can be used to improve our understanding of atmospheric particles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000231842",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-11-33-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/231842","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","aerosol||air quality||atmospheric chemistry||electric field||Electrodynamics||evaporation||experimental apparatus||Gas flow||ionization||laboratory method||Mass spectrometry||Spectrometer||Tracking","Electrodynamic balance–mass spectrometry of single particles as a new platform for atmospheric chemistry research","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-01-20T03:58:33Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85040330652",,"000419548000001","Atmos. meas. tech.","1","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Fourteen different combinations of global and regional climate models with a target resolution of 12 km and two different emission scenarios are considered. As raw snowfall amounts are not provided by all RCMs, a newly developed method to separate snowfall from total precipitation based on near-surface temperature conditions and accounting for subgrid-scale topographic variability is employed. The evaluation of the simulated snowfall amounts against an observation-based reference indicates the ability of RCMs to capture the main characteristics of the snowfall seasonal cycle and its elevation dependency but also reveals considerable positive biases especially at high elevations. These biases can partly be removed by the application of a dedicated RCM bias adjustment that separately considers temperature and precipitation biases.  Snowfall projections reveal a robust signal of decreasing snowfall amounts over most parts of the Alps for both emission scenarios. Domain and multi-model mean decreases in mean September–May snowfall by the end of the century amount to −25 and −45 % for representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Snowfall in low-lying areas in the Alpine forelands could be reduced by more than −80 %. These decreases are driven by the projected warming and are strongly connected to an important decrease in snowfall frequency and snowfall fraction and are also apparent for heavy snowfall events. In contrast, high-elevation regions could experience slight snowfall increases in midwinter for both emission scenarios despite the general decrease in the snowfall fraction. These increases in mean and heavy snowfall can be explained by a general increase in winter precipitation and by the fact that, with increasing temperatures, climatologically cold areas are shifted into a temperature interval which favours higher snowfall intensities. In general, percentage changes in snowfall indices are robust with respect to the RCM postprocessing strategy employed: similar results are obtained for raw, separated, and separated–bias-adjusted snowfall amounts. Absolute changes, however, can differ among these three methods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000233992",,"1994-0416||1994-0424",,"10.5194/tc-12-1-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/233992","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Future snowfall in the Alps: projections based on the EURO-CORDEX regional climate models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-01-25T02:24:38Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85042363189",,"000419380500001",,"1","The Cryosphere","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Progress has been achieved since then, but the quote still summarizes the difficulties met by the scientific community to reach a detailed understanding of the interactions between two highly complex systems: aerosols and clouds. These difficulties arise mainly because aerosol-cloud interactions, compared to e.g. greenhouse gases, entangle complex thermodynamics, microphysics, optics and multi-phase chemistry within local and short-term scales. Today, the radiative forcing caused by anthropogenic aerosols concentrations and interactions with clouds and solar radiation remains the largest obstacle to the understanding and accurate quantification of the global anthropogenic radiative forcing.  Attempting to push the degree of complexity a step further in the description of aerosol-cloud interactions could be perceived as unreasonable but it has recently become clear that this is necessary to accurately simulate the climate forcing of aerosols. Black carbon (BC), a subset of the particulate matter known to be both a strong radiation absorber and insoluble in water, has been shown to coagulate with organic and inorganic material and act as a nucleus for these materials to condense on, forming a water-soluble coating surrounding the BC core. In the early 21st century, vigorous efforts were undertaken to identify and quantify the interactions of BC with clouds and radiation, as well as the resulting feedbacks with other components of the climate system. A detailed review published in 2013 ranked BC second only to carbon dioxide (CO2) and slightly ahead of methane (CH4) in promoting global warming, despite its relatively sparse presence in the atmosphere. Moreover, modelling studies that simulate emission inventories revealed that the dominant fraction of atmospheric BC originates from human activities through incomplete combustion of solid and liquid fuels. Controlling BC emissions, by e.g. reducing the incomplete combustion from heat engines, therefore appears as a strategic lever to mitigate anthropogenic climate modifications. However, several aspects linked to the mixing state of BC can explain the current difficulty to bound the climate impacts of BC: the timescale for coating acquisition is still not clear; the modifications of particle optical properties due to coating acquisition is still discussed; and the amount of coating required for cloud droplet activation, a process that strongly facilitates removal from the atmosphere, is still not accurately quantified. The work presented in this thesis firstly addresses the latter aspect before focusing on the characterization of BC properties at a high-altitude site.  In this thesis, we strived for a better characterization of BC and a more quantitative description of BC activation in different cloud environments. The relative influences of particle properties and cloud supersaturation on cloud droplet activation of BC were investigated by performing two field campaigns, allowing for the sampling of BC at different degrees of aging as well as different cloud supersaturations. Firstly, a field campaign was conducted at Irchel campus in the city of Zurich during winter 2015/2016. The droplet activation of BC at very low supersaturation (fog) was investigated depending on BC size and mixing state, two highly variable parameters in such an environment because of the variety of sources and atmospheric age (e.g. fresh traffic and residential emissions, aged background aerosol). Secondly, the high-altitude research station Jungfraujoch, positioned on a mountain ridge in the Swiss Alps (3580 m a.s.l.) and frequently located within clouds served as a measurement site during summer 2016 (CLACE2016 campaign). The importance of each factor influencing cloud droplet activation of heavily aged BC (size, mixing state, hygroscopicity, cloud supersaturation) was studied and linked to the fraction of BC-containing particles activated to cloud droplets. Such research questions could be addressed by in-fog/cloud sampling and switching between different inlets. This permitted to selectively sample interstitial (unactivated) particles, cloud droplet residual particles and the total aerosol (sum of interstitial aerosol and droplet residual particles). By comparing instrumental data behind these three inlets, we were able to retrieve important information such as the number fraction of BC-containing, BC-free and total aerosol that activated to fog or cloud droplets (i.e. activated fractions), as well as differences in particle properties. The main instrument utilized during these campaigns was the single-particle soot photometer (SP2), which provides information on the BC core mass-equivalent diameter as well as the optical diameter of BC-containing and BC-free particles. Relating the optical diameter to the BC core diameter provides quantitative information on the BC mixing state at a single-particle level. Activation cut-off diameters from activated fractions combined with cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNC) data were utilized to retrieve cloud effective peak supersaturation (SSpeak). In addition, information on the bulk aerosol hygroscopicity and mixing state was retrieved. Besides the cloud activation properties of BC, the concentration, size distribution and mixing state of BC were characterized at the Jungfraujoch site both in summer and winter using SP2 data from the aforementioned CLACE2016 campaign and the CLACE2014 campaign, respectively. We also investigated the dependence of these properties on the type of air mass, i.e. free troposphere (FT) versus planetary boundary layer (PBL)-influenced conditions and wind direction.  In Zurich, close to emission sources, the aerosol was a mixture of freshly-emitted externally mixed particles and more internally mixed residential or background aerosol. Both degrees of mixing state coexisted with variable respective contributions depending on the time of the day: peak morning emissions during working days caused the major input of freshly emitted particles while residential and background aerosol was mainly sampled at night. At the Jungfraujoch, we observed a strong seasonality in the mixing state of BC, with a large degree of internal mixing in summer when the site is strongly influenced by PBL injections and a very high degree of external mixing in winter when the site is predominantly located in the FT. Although already assumed in some models focusing in BC aging during transport to remote region in order to agree with measurements of BC concentrations, the strong degree of BC external mixing in winter was reported in very few field studies. Whilst the mixing state was found to influence the droplet activation behaviour of BC, we showed that it is not the dominant controlling parameter. Instead, the cloud peak supersaturation (SSpeak) was the main factor driving the fraction of particles that activated to droplet both on number and mass bases. In fog, where very low supersaturations were encountered (SSpeak≈0.05 %), less than 1 % of both BC-free and BC-containing particles could activate to fog droplets; whereas for both subsets, virtually 100 % of the particle population were activated in highly-supersaturated clouds (SSpeak>0.5 %). As SSpeak decreased, the size and mixing state of BC-containing particles became increasingly important criteria modulating the SSpeak–driven droplet activation: large and thickly coated BC activated more efficiently. For example, the number fraction of particles containing a 100 nm BC core acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in fog reached 50 % with coatings of approximately 150 nm, but BC with no or very thin coating was required to form a cloud droplet at the mountain site. Comparing particles of equal size, those with thicker coatings were more likely to take up water and form a droplet at low and medium supersaturation. These results provide an experimental confirmation of the Kelvin and Raoult effects, which are combined in the κ-Köhler theory describing droplet activation. We tested the ability of this theory, combined with a simplified particle shape representation (spherical core and concentric coating) and the Zdanovski-Stokes-Robinson (ZSR) mixing rule to predict whether a BC-containing particle stays in the interstitial phase or activates to a droplet with knowledge of BC core size, coating thickness, and peak supersaturation. A successful closure between predicted and observed droplet activation of BC-containing particles was achieved both in fog and clouds.   This is the first time that the relation between BC particle properties and their droplet activation in real clouds has been quantitatively studied with such detail. These results confirm that atmospheric aging indeed increases the potential of BC-containing particles to activate to cloud droplets as qualitatively expected and quantitatively predicted by theory. These findings inform model simulations how to treat BC activation to cloud droplets, as mixing state information and simplified theory can be applied in a consistent manner. This depends of course on the level of complexity of the aerosol scheme which goes all the way to particle-resolved simulations. The relation between aerosol as well as BC activated fractions (on mass basis) and SSpeak presented in this work, along with characteristic BC particle properties (BC core size and coating thickness distributions), can serve as reference data to assess whether aerosol and BC mass activated fractions obtained in models are within the correct range and for the correct reason. Similarly, the strong seasonality of BC mixing state observed in the FT at the Jungfraujoch could be a first step towards a re-assessment of the climate impact of BC. If this characteristic is verified at large spatial scales, the consideration of the longer lifetime and reduced light absorption due to a higher degree of BC external mixing than previously thought could lead to such a re-assessment. By decreasing the degree of uncertainty of model simulations, these results can contribute to a better assessment of the climate forcing of BC.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000334851",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/334851","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Black carbon||Aerosol-cloud interactions","Cloud and fog droplet activation of atmospheric black carbon: In-situ observations of the influence of particle size, mixing state and ambient supersaturation","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2019-03-29T12:28:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25625",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Some common key elements are identified, indicating potential for fruitful exchange across communities. Operational model development is compelling, driven by factors that broadly fall into four categories: model skill, basic physics, advances in computer architecture, and new aspects to be covered, from costumer needs over physics to observational data. Evaluation of model skill as part of the operational chain goes beyond an automated skill score. Permanent interaction between “pure research” and “operational forecast” people is beneficial to both sides. This includes joint model development projects, although ultimate responsibility for the operational code remains with the forecast provider. The pace of model development reflects operational lead times. The points are illustrated with selected examples, many of which reflect the author’s background and personal contacts, notably with the Swiss Weather Service and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, Germany. In view of current and future challenges, large collaborations covering a range of expertise are a must − within and across climate, weather, and space weather.

Deep convection is the widespread, diurnal response of the atmosphere to its vertical destabilization by surface warming and radiative cooling aloft. As a side effect of deep-convective dynamics strong updrafts, lightning strikes, devastating hail, and gusty winds are produced. The most serious impact however relates to abrupt flooding after heavy rain making deep convection not only one of the most memorable but also the most severe weather phenomena. Despite the extraordinary importance of deep convection for weather and climate, numerical weather prediction and climate simulations continue to suffer from the side effects of the misrepresentation of many underlying physical processes in the numerical models. The challenge to represent deep convection is not surprising, given that deep convection is non-linear, multi-scale, multi-phase, three-dimensional, turbulent flow that is highly sensitive to initial and boundary conditions. In order to better understand the role of deep convection for the hydrological cycle and to improve the representation of deep convection in atmospheric models, a deeper understanding of the basic physical processes is therefore required. This is particularly pressing during episodes of weak synoptic forcing, when the abrupt formation of deep convective thunderstorms is exceedingly difficult to simulate. However it is promising, that numerous observations reveal that thunderstorms initiate at preferential locations, which seem to be strongly tied to heterogeneities on the Earth's surface. This thesis therefore aims to shed light on the physical influence of two major components of the Earth's surface on deep convection. On the one hand the focus is put on orography (mountains), the most dominant and widespread surface characteristic controlling weather and climate far beyond its immediate surrounding. On the other hand a focus is put on soil moisture which exerts a much more uncertain influence on deep convection due to its substantial variability in space and time. In order to gain a better understanding on the influence of these two land surface components on deep convection, a state-of-the-art computer model of the coupled atmosphere-land system is used. With that, ensembles of idealized convection-resolving simulations with a numerical grid spacing of 1 km and full physics parameterizations (except for shallow and deep convection) are systematically run. The first part of the thesis focuses on the feedback between soil moisture and precipitation. In particular the relative importance of soil moisture heterogeneity in flat and mountainous terrain is quantified. The sign of the feedback strongly depends on the patchiness of soil moisture. While the feedback is positive for horizontally uniform soil moisture (more rain over increased soil moisture), the feedback turns strongly negative at localized soil moisture anomalies (more rain over dry soil anomalies). The negative feedback stems from the explicitly resolved shallow circulations in the planetary boundary layer that develop at soil moisture transition zones. A similar mechanism emerges in presence of an isolated mountain. Mountains drier than their surrounding thermally develop stronger upslope flows and therefore receive more rain than moister mountains. However, the strength of the feedback sensitively depends on the dominance of the mountain. A relatively low mountain of 500 m in height is sufficient to neutralize the soil-moisture-precipitation feedback, i.e. the rain amounts over a dry or a moist mountain do not differ. The second part of the thesis is dedicated to the relative importance of orographic scales for deep convection. To that end deep convective activity at an isolated mountain of varying height and width is simulated. Despite a strong impact of the mountain slope on the converging upslope flows, and the intensity of deep convection, an approximately linear scaling between mountain rain and mountain volume emerges in the statistical mean. Tests with alternative mountain profiles, multiple peaks and large-scale flow suggest, that the scaling is present over a surprisingly large portion of parameter space. Only in the limit of tall mountains and relatively strong large-scale flow a systematic breakdown of the scaling is found. A simple conceptual framework relates the linear scaling to the enhanced energy density in the atmosphere above mountains. The breakdown of the scaling is explained in terms of the venting of the elevated mountain heat anomaly by the large-scale flow. Since the large horizontal scales of mountains contribute disproportionally to the mountain volume, the volume scaling suggests that small-scale terrain (such as single peaks in a mountainous area) are, in the statistical mean, of minor importance for deep convective precipitation during episodes of weak synoptic forcing. In summary, this thesis is testimony to the dominance of orography, and its large-scale features in particular, in controlling the statistical behavior of deep convection and ultimately the continental water cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000313601",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/313601","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Theoretical and Numerical Studies of Deep Convection Over Orography and Soil-Moisture Heterogeneities","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2019-01-03T14:24:01Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25356",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Light-absorbing particulates (including black carbon, organic carbon, and mineral dust) deposited on snow can reduce surface albedo and contribute to the near-worldwide melting of snow and ice. This study focused on understanding the role of black carbon and other water-insoluble light-absorbing particulates in the snow cover of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The results found that the black carbon, organic carbon, and dust concentrations in snow cover generally ranged from 202 to 17 468 ng g−1, 491 to 13 880 ng g−1, and 22 to 846 µg g−1, respectively, with higher concentrations in the central to northern areas of the TP. Back trajectory analysis suggested that the northern TP was influenced mainly by air masses from Central Asia with some Eurasian influence, and air masses in the central and Himalayan region originated mainly from Central and South Asia. The relative biomass-burning-sourced black carbon contributions decreased from ∼ 50 % in the southern TP to ∼ 30 % in the northern TP. The relative contribution of black carbon and dust to snow albedo reduction reached approximately 37 and 15 %, respectively. The effect of black carbon and dust reduced the snow cover duration by 3.1 ± 0.1 to 4.4 ± 0.2 days. Meanwhile, the black carbon and dust had important implications for snowmelt water loss over the TP. The findings indicate that the impacts of black carbon and mineral dust need to be properly accounted for in future regional climate projections, particularly in the high-altitude cryosphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000242164",,"1994-0416||1994-0424",,"10.5194/tc-12-413-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/242164","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Black carbon and mineral dust in snow cover on the Tibetan Plateau","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-02-20T03:12:54Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85041710197",,"000424286200001",,"2","The Cryosphere","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Significant advances in meteorological ensemble forecasting have led to skilful predictions of meteorological variables beyond the medium-range forecast horizon. Using these meteorological ensemble forecasts to force hydrological models can provide valuable probabilistic streamflow forecasts. Such predictions at the subseasonal time horizon can have a great impact for planning purposes in various economic and public sectors. Currently, the scientific basis for the predictability of subseasonal forecasts is being investigated and various meteorological organizations are running numerical weather predictions models for the subseasonal time-scale. In order to improve our knowledge to predict streamflows in small to medium sized mountainous catchments at the subseasonal time scales this PhD thesis focuses on the interface between the meteorological and the hydrological predictions and the assessment of the performance thereof. Thus, the current state of subseasonal hydrometeorological predictions is explored and statistical bias correction and downscaling methods are investigated to optimally combine meteorological and hydrological prediction models bridging the gap of application scales. Furthermore, a hydropower optimization system making use of the resulting streamflow predictions has been explored. In a first step the historical forecasts from subseasonal ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System have been analysed in terms of their performance to predict temperature and precipitation at 1637 measurement stations across Europe. Aside of the uncorrected direct model output, different post-processing techniques have been applied and their effect on the forecast performance is analysed. The results clearly demonstrate the need for post-processing the subseasonal predictions to achieve skilful subseasonal forecast for point observations. Post-processed forecasts indicate positive skill with respect to climatology for up to 19-25 days lead time (corresponding to forecast week 3) in case of weekly mean temperature. Forecast skills of weekly precipitation sums stay positive up to 5-11 days lead time (corresponding to forecast week 1) and clearly outperform the uncorrected forecasts. These statistically corrected subseasonal meteorological predictions with daily resolution are used to generate streamflow forecasts with the hydrological model PREAVH in small to medium size mountainous catchments (with areas between 80 and 1700 km2) of different hydroclimatic characteristics. Furthermore, the performance of the resulting streamflow forecasts is compared with the forecast performance of a traditional ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) approach based on historical meteorological observations. The study clearly demonstrates the superiority of the subseasonal NWP-hydro prediction system. It is found that the benefits are most pronounced in the snow-dominated catchments and this underlines the importance of snow-related processes in subseasonal hydrometeorological predictions. In an additional analysis, the ensemble streamflow predictions were assessed in terms of their benefits for water resource management. To this end, the uncorrected meteorological predictions are used to generate streamflow forecasts and the effect of different hydrological post-processing techniques on the forecast performance is analysed. Besides the total runoff itself, multiple hydrologically relevant variables are analysed for 370 sub-catchments covering entire Switzerland: areal catchment precipitation, total baseflow and soil moisture storage. The results stress the importance of persistence and memory effects on the performance of streamflow forecasts. Subsurface processes were found to show a delayed response of one week in forecast performance. This can be of particular importance for applications in water resource management. Finally, the resulting subseasonal ensemble streamflow predictions were used in a hydropower optimization setup in the Swiss Alps to further assess the potential of the forecast in terms of their economic value. We found that the gain in forecast performance can indeed further translate into monetary benefits, i.e. economic value of a forecast. Depending on the optimization scheme used, the average additional gain of up to 4% could be expected in terms of revenues if such predictions were used in an operational manner instead of the climatological predictions (corresponding to an increase of 0.2 Mio EUR/yr in the Verzasca catchment investigated in this study).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000342681",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/342681","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Towards operational subseasonal hydrometeorological ensemble predictions in mountainous catchments","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2019-05-17T09:51:14Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Supply of electricity for 2050: hydropower and geo-energies","153985","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 70: Gesuch","25496",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This paper examines changes in extremes of high temperatures averaged over three consecutive days. Changes in this measure of extreme temperature are also compared to changes in hot season temperatures. We find that over land this measure of extreme high temperature increases from about 0.5 to 1.5 °C over present-day values in the 1.5 °C stabilization scenario, depending on location and model. We further find an additional 0.25 to 1.0 °C increase in extreme high temperatures over land in the 2.0 °C stabilization scenario. Results from the HAPPI models are consistent with similar results from the one available fully coupled climate model. However, a complicating factor in interpreting extreme temperature changes across the HAPPI models is their diversity of aerosol forcing changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000256144",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-9-299-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/256144","en","Copernicus Publ.","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Changes in extremely hot days under stabilized 1.5 and 2.0 °C global warming scenarios as simulated by the HAPPI multi-model ensemble","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-04-08T04:21:59Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85044671293",,"000428595200001",,"1","Earth System Dynamics","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

An efficient and versatile method that finds a subset which maintains certain key properties from the full ensemble is needed, but very little work has been done in this area. Therefore, users typically make their own somewhat subjective subset choices and commonly use the equally weighted model mean as a best estimate. However, different climate model simulations cannot necessarily be regarded as independent estimates due to the presence of duplicated code and shared development history.  Here, we present an efficient and flexible tool that makes better use of the ensemble as a whole by finding a subset with improved mean performance compared to the multi-model mean while at the same time maintaining the spread and addressing the problem of model interdependence. Out-of-sample skill and reliability are demonstrated using model-as-truth experiments. This approach is illustrated with one set of optimisation criteria but we also highlight the flexibility of cost functions, depending on the focus of different users. The technique is useful for a range of applications that, for example, minimise present-day bias to obtain an accurate ensemble mean, reduce dependence in ensemble spread, maximise future spread, ensure good performance of individual models in an ensemble, reduce the ensemble size while maintaining important ensemble characteristics, or optimise several of these at the same time. As in any calibration exercise, the final ensemble is sensitive to the metric, observational product, and pre-processing steps used.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000246202",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-9-135-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/246202","en","Copernicus Publ.","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Selecting a climate model subset to optimise key ensemble properties","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-03-06T03:49:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85042539908",,"000425792300001",,"1","Earth System Dynamics","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The rate of increase depends on the strength or rarity of the events; very strong and rare events tend to follow the Clausius–Clapeyron relation, whereas weaker events or precipitation averages increase at a smaller rate than expected from the Clausius–Clapeyron relation. An often overlooked aspect is seasonal occurrence of such events, which might change in the future. To address the impact of seasonality, we use a large ensemble of regional and global climate model simulations, comprising tens of thousands of model years of daily temperature and precipitation for the past, present, and future. In order to make the data comparable, they are quantile mapped to observation-based time series representative of the Aare catchment in Switzerland. Model simulations show no increase in annual maximum 1-day precipitation events (Rx1day) over the last 400 years and an increase of 10%–20% until the end of the century for a strong (RCP8.5) forcing scenario. This fits with a Clausius–Clapeyron scaling of temperature at the event day, which increases less than annual mean temperature. An important reason for this is a shift in seasonality. Rx1day events become less frequent in late summer and more frequent in early summer and early autumn, when it is cooler. The seasonality shift is shown to be related to summer drying. Models with decreasing annual mean or summer mean precipitation show this behaviour more strongly. The highest Rx1day per decade, in contrast, shows no change in seasonality in the future. This discrepancy implies that decadal-scale extremes are thermodynamically limited; conditions conducive to strong events still occur during the hottest time of the year on a decadal scale. In contrast, Rx1day events are also limited by other factors. Conducive conditions are not reached every summer in the present, and even less so in the future. Results suggest that changes in the seasonal cycle need to be accounted for when preparing for moderately extreme precipitation events and assessing their socio-economic impacts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000281173",,"1561-8633||1684-9981",,"10.5194/nhess-18-2047-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/281173","en","European Geosciences Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Changing seasonality of moderate and extreme precipitation events in the Alps","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-08T05:35:51Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85050892970",,"000440049200002","Nat. hazards earth syst. sci.","7","Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Characterising and understanding this response is critical for accurately assessing the near-term regional impacts of climate change and the benefits of limiting warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, as advocated by the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The HAPPI experimental design allows an assessment of uncertainty in the circulation response due to model dependence and internal variability. Internal variability is found to dominate the multi-model mean response of the jet streams, storm tracks, and stationary waves across most of the midlatitudes; larger signals in these features are mostly consistent with those seen in more strongly forced warming scenarios. Signals that emerge in the 1.5 °C experiment are a weakening of storm activity over North America, an inland shift of the North American stationary ridge, an equatorward shift of the North Pacific jet exit, and an equatorward intensification of the South Pacific jet. Signals that emerge under an additional 0.5 °C of warming include a poleward shift of the North Atlantic jet exit, an eastward extension of the North Atlantic storm track, and an intensification on the flanks of the Southern Hemisphere storm track. Case studies explore the implications of these circulation responses for precipitation impacts in the Mediterranean, in western Europe, and on the North American west coast, paying particular attention to possible outcomes at the tails of the response distributions. For example, the projected weakening of the Mediterranean storm track emerges in the 2 °C warmer world, with exceptionally dry decades becoming 5 times more likely.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000260962",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-9-359-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/260962","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Midlatitude atmospheric circulation responses under 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C warming and implications for regional impacts","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-04-27T03:42:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85045552073",,"000430120100001",,"2","Earth System Dynamics","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In addition to the well-established distinction between warm and cold fronts, the PCA exposes several new dimensions of variability: (i) front intensity, (ii) surface fluxes and (iii) along-front transports, linked to the intensity of the associated conveyor belts. These new dimensions of variability are regionally and seasonally robust and a lagged composite analysis demonstrates that each of the new front types evolves in a dynamically characteristic way. Further, the new front types can be related to established ones like katafronts and anafronts. The new front types are finally redefined based on simple parameter thresholds to simplify their application in future studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000245169",,"0035-9009||1477-870X",,"10.1002/qj.3199","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/245169","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","fronts||front classification||feature detection","Beyond cold and warm: an objective classification for maritime midlatitude fronts","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-03-01T03:58:19Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85042325520",,"000425645200020","Q.

Raindrops interact with water vapour in ambient air while sedimenting from the cloud base to the ground. They constantly exchange water molecules with the environment and, in sub-saturated air, they evaporate partially or entirely. The latter of these below-cloud processes is important for predicting the resulting surface rainfall amount and it influences the boundary layer profiles of temperature and moisture through to evaporative latent cooling and humidity changes. However, despite its importance, it is very difficult to quantify this process from observations. Stable water isotopes provide such information, as they are influenced by both rain evaporation and equilibration. This study elucidates this option by introducing a novel interpretation framework for stable water isotope measurements performed simultaneously at high temporal resolution in both near-surface vapour and rain. We refer to this viewing device as the ∆δ∆d-diagram, which shows the isotopic composition (δ2H, d-excess) of equilibrium vapour from precipitation samples relative to the ambient vapour. It is shown that this diagram facilitates the diagnosis of below-cloud processes and their effects on the isotopic composition of vapour and rain since equilibration and evaporation lead to different pathways in the two-dimensional phase space of the ∆δ∆d-diagram. For a specific cold front in Central Europe, the analysis shows that below-cloud processes lead to distinct and temporally variable imprints on the isotope signal in surface rain. The influence of evaporation on this signal is particularly strong during periods with a weak precipitation rate. After the frontal passage, the near-surface atmospheric layer is characterised by higher relative humidity and a lower melting layer, leading to weaker below-cloud evaporation and equilibration. Measurements from four cold frontal events reveal a surprisingly similar slope of ∆d/∆δ = −0.30 in the phase space, indicating a potentially characteristic signature of below-cloud processes for this type of rain events.","application/zip||text/plain","10.3929/ethz-b-000271617",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/271617","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Stable water isotopes||below-cloud processes||precipitation evaporation||atmospheric dynamics||Water cycle||Precipitations (Meteorology)||Cold fronts (Meteorology)","Research Data supporting ""A new interpretative framework for below-cloud effects on stable water isotopes in vapour and rain""","Dataset","Open access",,,"2015-10-09/2015-11-27","2018-06-22T12:36:13Z",,"indefinite","292278994-08-17T07:12:55Z",,"yes",,,,"CHN, Zürich","47.3795","8.5485",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Compared to the previous workshop in 2007, participation was doubled, reflecting a vibrant research area. Experimental methods involved sampling of aerosol particles by direct processing ice nucleation measuring systems from the same volume of air in separate experiments using different ice nucleating particle (INP) types, and collections of aerosol particle samples onto filters or into liquid for sharing amongst measurement techniques that post-process these samples. In this manner, any errors introduced by differences in generation methods when samples are shared across laboratories were mitigated. Furthermore, as much as possible, aerosol particle size distribution was controlled so that the size limitations of different methods were minimized. The results presented here use data from the workshop to assess the comparability of immersion freezing measurement methods activating INPs in bulk suspensions, methods that activate INPs in condensation and/or immersion freezing modes as single particles on a substrate, continuous flow diffusion chambers (CFDCs) directly sampling and processing particles well above water saturation to maximize immersion and subsequent freezing of aerosol particles, and expansion cloud chamber simulations in which liquid cloud droplets were first activated on aerosol particles prior to freezing. The AIDA expansion chamber measurements are expected to be the closest representation to INP activation in atmospheric cloud parcels in these comparisons, due to exposing particles freely to adiabatic cooling.  The different particle types used as INPs included the minerals illite NX and potassium feldspar (K-feldspar), two natural soil dusts representative of arable sandy loam (Argentina) and highly erodible sandy dryland (Tunisia) soils, respectively, and a bacterial INP (Snomax®). Considered together, the agreement among post-processed immersion freezing measurements of the numbers and fractions of particles active at different temperatures following bulk collection of particles into liquid was excellent, with possible temperature uncertainties inferred to be a key factor in determining INP uncertainties. Collection onto filters for rinsing versus directly into liquid in impingers made little difference. For methods that activated collected single particles on a substrate at a controlled humidity at or above water saturation, agreement with immersion freezing methods was good in most cases, but was biased low in a few others for reasons that have not been resolved, but could relate to water vapor competition effects. Amongst CFDC-style instruments, various factors requiring (variable) higher supersaturations to achieve equivalent immersion freezing activation dominate the uncertainty between these measurements, and for comparison with bulk immersion freezing methods. When operated above water saturation to include assessment of immersion freezing, CFDC measurements often measured at or above the upper bound of immersion freezing device measurements, but often underestimated INP concentration in comparison to an immersion freezing method that first activates all particles into liquid droplets prior to cooling (the PIMCA-PINC device, or Portable Immersion Mode Cooling chAmber–Portable Ice Nucleation Chamber), and typically slightly underestimated INP number concentrations in comparison to cloud parcel expansions in the AIDA chamber; this can be largely mitigated when it is possible to raise the relative humidity to sufficiently high values in the CFDCs, although this is not always possible operationally.  Correspondence of measurements of INPs among direct sampling and post-processing systems varied depending on the INP type. Agreement was best for Snomax® particles in the temperature regime colder than −10°C, where their ice nucleation activity is nearly maximized and changes very little with temperature. At temperatures warmer than −10°C, Snomax® INP measurements (all via freezing of suspensions) demonstrated discrepancies consistent with previous reports of the instability of its protein aggregates that appear to make it less suitable as a calibration INP at these temperatures. For Argentinian soil dust particles, there was excellent agreement across all measurement methods; measures ranged within 1 order of magnitude for INP number concentrations, active fractions and calculated active site densities over a 25 to 30°C range and 5 to 8 orders of corresponding magnitude change in number concentrations. This was also the case for all temperatures warmer than −25°C in Tunisian dust experiments. In contrast, discrepancies in measurements of INP concentrations or active site densities that exceeded 2 orders of magnitude across a broad range of temperature measurements found at temperatures warmer than −25°C in a previous study were replicated for illite NX. Discrepancies also exceeded 2 orders of magnitude at temperatures of −20 to −25°C for potassium feldspar (K-feldspar), but these coincided with the range of temperatures at which INP concentrations increase rapidly at approximately an order of magnitude per 2°C cooling for K-feldspar.  These few discrepancies did not outweigh the overall positive outcomes of the workshop activity, nor the future utility of this data set or future similar efforts for resolving remaining measurement issues. Measurements of the same materials were repeatable over the time of the workshop and demonstrated strong consistency with prior studies, as reflected by agreement of data broadly with parameterizations of different specific or general (e.g., soil dust) aerosol types. The divergent measurements of the INP activity of illite NX by direct versus post-processing methods were not repeated for other particle types, and the Snomax® data demonstrated that, at least for a biological INP type, there is no expected measurement bias between bulk collection and direct immediately processed freezing methods to as warm as −10°C. Since particle size ranges were limited for this workshop, it can be expected that for atmospheric populations of INPs, measurement discrepancies will appear due to the different capabilities of methods for sampling the full aerosol size distribution, or due to limitations on achieving sufficient water supersaturations to fully capture immersion freezing in direct processing instruments. Overall, this workshop presents an improved picture of present capabilities for measuring INPs than in past workshops, and provides direction toward addressing remaining measurement issues.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000306690",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-11-6231-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/306690","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The Fifth InternationalWorkshop on Ice Nucleation phase 2 (FIN-02): laboratory intercomparison of ice nucleation measurements","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-11-28T05:06:07Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85057050535",,"000450426300002","Atmos. meas. tech.","11","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In several regions on Earth, soil moisture plays an important role for climate via its control on the partitioning of net radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes; consequently, soil moisture also impacts on temperature and precipitation. The Global Land–Atmosphere Coupling Experiment–Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (GLACE-CMIP5) aims to quantify the impact of soil moisture on these important climate variables and to trace the individual coupling mechanisms. GLACE-CMIP5 provides experiments with different soil moisture prescriptions that can be used to isolate the effect of soil moisture on climate. Using a theoretical framework that relies on the distinct relation of soil moisture with evaporative fraction (the ratio of latent heat flux over net radiation) in different soil moisture regimes, the climate impact of the soil moisture prescriptions in the GLACE-CMIP5 experiments can be emulated and quantified. The framework-based estimation of the soil moisture effect on the evaporative fraction agrees very well with estimations obtained directly from the GLACE-CMIP5 experiments (pattern correlation of 0.85). Moreover, the soil moisture effect on the daily maximum temperature is well captured in regions where soil moisture exerts a strong control on latent heat fluxes. The theoretical approach is further applied to quantify the soil moisture contribution to the projected change of the temperature on the hottest day of the year, confirming recent estimations by other studies.

However, recently available ET products show persistent uncertainties that are impeding a precise attribution of human-induced climate change. Here, we aim at comparing a range of independent global monthly land ET estimates with historical model simulations from the global water, agriculture, and biomes sectors participating in the second phase of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2a). Among the independent estimates, we use the EartH2Observe Tier-1 dataset (E2O), two commonly used reanalyses, a pre-compiled ensemble product (LandFlux-EVAL), and an updated collection of recently published datasets that algorithmically derive ET from observations or observations-based estimates (diagnostic datasets). A cluster analysis is applied in order to identify spatio-temporal differences among all datasets and to thus identify factors that dominate overall uncertainties. The clustering is controlled by several factors including the model choice, the meteorological forcing used to drive the assessed models, the data category (models participating in the different sectors of ISIMIP2a, E2O models, diagnostic estimates, reanalysis-based estimates or composite products), the ET scheme, and the number of soil layers in the models. By using these factors to explain spatial and spatio-temporal variabilities in ET, we find that the model choice mostly dominates (24%–40% of variance explained), except for spatio-temporal patterns of total ET, where the forcing explains the largest fraction of the variance (29%). The most dominant clusters of datasets are further compared with individual diagnostic and reanalysis-based estimates to assess their representation of selected heat waves and droughts in the Great Plains, Central Europe and western Russia. Although most of the ET estimates capture these extreme events, the generally large spread among the entire ensemble indicates substantial uncertainties.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000274354",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aac4bb","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/274354","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","ISIMIP2a||evapotranspiration||uncertainty||cluster analysis||hydrological extreme events","Evapotranspiration simulations in ISIMIP2a-Evaluation of spatio-temporal characteristics with a comprehensive ensemble of independent datasets","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-07-06T14:25:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85056414729",,"000436020600001","Environ.

A key process in this respect is the control of soil moisture on the partitioning of net radiation into latent and sensible heat fluxes. Especially near-surface air temperatures can be considerably affected by modified shares of these fluxes. Different metrics have been developed to assess the soil moisture effects on latent heat flux, on near-surface air temperature, and on other climate variables. In this thesis, the soil moisture--climate coupling strength is quantified by employing a simple framework that connects evaporative fraction $\mathrm{EF}$ (the amount of net radiation used for latent heat flux) to soil moisture $\theta$. This $\mathrm{EF}(\theta)$ framework allows to differentiate between dry, transitional, and wet soil moisture regimes, each having a distinct soil moisture control on the surface heat fluxes. Additionally, the contributions of different land surface variables and radiation components to near-surface air temperature variability are estimated.  In the first part of this thesis, the $\mathrm{EF}(\theta)$ framework is used to estimate the spatial and temporal occurrence of the soil moisture regimes for three different data sources (two reanalysis datasets and a combination of observation-based datasets with a remote-sensing driven land surface model). The transitional regime, in which soil moisture affects evaporative fraction and thus possibly also near-surface air temperature, can be found in multiple regions of the world, such as Africa, India, and Australia. The regime classification allows furthermore to quantify the soil moisture--temperature coupling strength separately in the different soil moisture regimes. In several regions of the world, soil moisture variations in the transitional regime substantially impact near-surface air temperature. In contrast, soil moisture effects on temperature are almost negligible in the wet regime. Passages between the soil moisture regimes due to seasonal weather and climate variations can lead to changing soil moisture--temperature coupling strengths in the course of the year. The distinct soil moisture effects on evaporative fraction and near-surface air temperature in the different soil moisture regimes highlight the suitability of the $\mathrm{EF}(\theta)$ framework to assess spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture--climate coupling.  In the second part of the thesis, the $\mathrm{EF}(\theta)$ framework is further used to quantify the impact of soil moisture on climate in a set of idealized climate model experiments. The Global Land-Atmosphere Climate Experiment--Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (GLACE-CMIP5) includes three idealized simulations with diverse soil moisture prescriptions that allow to study the influence of different soil moisture levels on atmospheric conditions. The impact of soil moisture differences between the GLACE-CMIP5 experiments can be explained by a theoretical estimation of the soil moisture effect on evaporative fraction that is based on the sensitivities in the different soil moisture regimes of the $\mathrm{EF}(\theta)$ framework. The resulting soil moisture effects on evaporative fraction agree well with estimations obtained directly from the GLACE-CMIP5 experiments. Similarly, the theoretical estimation captures the soil moisture effects on temperature well in regions where soil moisture exerts a strong control on latent heat fluxes. The theoretical approach can further be used to quantify the soil moisture contribution to projected future increases of the temperature on the hottest day of the year, confirming the results of recent estimations by other studies. As for the theoretical estimation only data of the interactive simulation are needed, it can additionally be used to emulate GLACE-CMIP5-style soil moisture prescription experiments with an extended set of models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). The CMIP5 models generally agree with the GLACE-CMIP5 models on the regions where soil moisture shifts significantly impact near-surface air temperatures and, additionally, yield more robust and reliable estimations of the geographical patterns with strong soil moisture--climate coupling. Although the theoretical approach is designed to capture only the local soil moisture effects on climate, it also enables to differentiate local from non-local soil moisture--atmosphere feedbacks where sensitivity experiments (such as GLACE-CMIP5) are available. The theoretical approach constitutes thus a simple and powerful tool to quantify soil moisture--climate coupling in both GLACE-CMIP5 and CMIP5 models without the need of performing additional simulations.  In the third part of the thesis, the contribution of several land surface variables and radiation components to near-surface air temperature variability is estimated using CMIP5 model output. Employing stepwise multiple linear regression and focusing on incoming shortwave radiation, incoming longwave radiation, land surface albedo, and soil moisture as explanatory variables a large fraction of interannual temperature variability and almost all of the multidecadal temperature trend on land can be explained. While the radiation components are essential explanatory variables for almost all land area, albedo and soil moisture significantly contribute to the model performance in some confined regions. This highlights the dominating role of radiation and atmospheric processes for near-surface air temperature variability that can, however, also substantially be impacted by the state of the land surface.  Overall, the results of this thesis emphasize the suitability of the soil moisture regime classification to describe the soil moisture effect on atmospheric conditions in several reanalyses, global climate models, and a remote-sensing driven land surface model. Soil moisture impacts on near-surface air temperature are additionally found to act at different timescales, highlighting the importance of a proper understanding of soil moisture--climate coupling both for short-term temperature variability as well as for long-term temperature trends.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000270159",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/270159","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Quantifying Effects of Land-Climate Interactions on Spatiotemporal Variations of Near-Surface Air Temperature","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2018-06-14T14:25:14Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"24950",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In central Europe extreme temperatures are projected to change more strongly than global mean temperatures, and soil moisture–temperature feedbacks significantly contribute to this regional amplification. Because of their strong societal, ecological and economic impacts, robust projections of temperature extremes are needed. Unfortunately, in current model projections, temperature extremes in central Europe are prone to large uncertainties. In order to understand and potentially reduce the uncertainties of extreme temperature projections in Europe, we analyze global climate models from the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) ensemble for the business-as-usual high-emission scenario (RCP8.5). We find a divergent behavior in long-term projections of summer precipitation until the end of the 21st century, resulting in a trimodal distribution of precipitation (wet, dry and very dry). All model groups show distinct characteristics for the summer latent heat flux, top soil moisture and temperatures on the hottest day of the year (TXx), whereas for net radiation and large-scale circulation no clear trimodal behavior is detectable. This suggests that different land–atmosphere coupling strengths may be able to explain the uncertainties in temperature extremes. Constraining the full model ensemble with observed present-day correlations between summer precipitation and TXx excludes most of the very dry and dry models. In particular, the very dry models tend to overestimate the negative coupling between precipitation and TXx, resulting in a warming that is too strong. This is particularly relevant for global warming levels above 2°C. For the first time, this analysis allows for the substantial reduction of uncertainties in the projected changes of TXx in global climate models. Our results suggest that long-term temperature changes in TXx in central Europe are about 20% lower than those projected by the multi-model median of the full ensemble. In addition, mean summer precipitation is found to be more likely to stay close to present-day levels. These results are highly relevant for improving estimates of regional climate-change impacts including heat stress, water supply and crop failure for central Europe.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000287746",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-9-1107-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/287746","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Varying soil moisture-atmosphere feedbacks explain divergent temperature extremes and precipitation projections in central Europe","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-09-07T16:20:04Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85052740969",,"000443199200001",,"3","Earth System Dynamics","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Since increases in frequency and magnitude of extreme temperatures can be expected in a warming world, heatwaves like these are only a small taste of the climate risks ahead. Thus, reliable estimates of projected changes in temperature extremes are required at regional to local scales, such that actionable information for stakeholders and decision-makers can be derived. However, current numerical simulations of the climate system differ substantially between Earth System Models (ESMs), especially in regions such as the mid-latitudes, which are projected to experience remarkable changes in hot extremes. To reduce the related uncertainties, a necessary first step is to identify and understand the complex processes leading to these uncertainties.    Land–atmosphere feedbacks have been identified to be particularly important, as they drive the development of hot temperature extremes, especially in the mid-latitudes. For instance, drying soils can induce positive soil moisture-temperature feedbacks, since soil moisture controls the partitioning between the surface sensible and latent heat flux, amplifying hot extremes in summer. The contribution of soil moisture-temperature feedbacks to the near-surface temperature on the hottest days of each year is quantified in Chapter 2. To this end, a suite of idealized climate simulations designed to decouple land and atmosphere processes (GLACE-CMIP5) are investigated, which therefore allow the isolation of the effects of soil moisture on climate. These simulations show that regions with the strongest temperature increase of the hottest days are the same regions that expose strong sensitivity to changes in soil moisture. In central Europe and central North America, soil moisture–temperature feedbacks contribute more than 70% to the additional warming of the hottest days beyond global mean temperature, realized when land–atmosphere feedbacks are not suppressed. The drying of the soils not only modulates surface heat fluxes, but also decreases cloud cover, which again increases temperature by the associated changes in the radiation balance and precipitation.  Some ESM simulations submitted to the CMIP5 archive show strong trends for temperature extremes in central Europe, while others do so much less. The analysis reveals that the divergent changes in projected temperature extremes can be explained by three positive soil moisture–atmosphere feedbacks, in particular by the relationship between soil moisture desiccation and summer precipitation. Exploiting the strong relation between summer precipitation and surface temperature during the hottest days of each year in central Europe, a novel metric of land–atmosphere coupling is derived (Chapter 3). The selected simulation subset reduces uncertainties related to land-atmosphere coupling, while the full CMIP5 ensemble tends to overestimate warming of temperature extremes, and summer precipitation drying in central Europe.   Finally, a case study for the 2018 global heatwave is conducted (Chapter 4). Unfortunately, the hot temperatures recorded during the 2018 early boreal summer led to the death of hundreds of people, triggered wildfires and crop failure and caused damages to infrastructure in North America, Europe, and Asia. The observed heatwave area between May and July 2018, coinciding with densely populated and key agricultural regions in northern mid-latitudes was record-breaking. More than a fifth of these regions experienced extreme heat on average every day between May and July 2018. Using current ESM simulations from the CMIP5 ensemble, the human influence on this type of event is assessed by estimating probabilities of exceeding 2018 heatwave areas, with and without anthropogenic forcing. Based on these estimates, it is virtually certain (i.e. >99% according to IPCC calibrated language) that a 2018-like global heatwave event could not have occurred without human-induced climate change and that natural variability can be virtually excluded for the first time as a cause for such extraordinary global-scale heatwaves. Additionally, the results indicate that the heatwave area over regions with high exposure (densely populated and key agricultural regions) in the northern mid-latitudes will linearly increase with global mean temperature at a rate of 16% per degree warming. In an even warmer climate, similar global-scale heatwave areas can be expected to become much less exceptional, under a +2 °C global warming a 2018-like event could occur nearly every year. In contrast, strong mitigation would directly translate into reduced heatwave areas and decrease the associated heat-related impacts.  Overall this thesis demonstrates that strong future changes of hot temperature extremes in mid-latitudes can be expected in a warming climate and that land–atmosphere feedbacks substantially contribute to projected changes. The misrepresentation of these underlying feedbacks can cause uncertainties in projected changes of hot extremes in mid-latitudes. Thus, the improved representation of these feedbacks in climate models will be critical to reduce uncertainties in model projections. Given the risks and impacts emerging from hot extremes are appalling, this thesis provides strong support for strong mitigation actions and limiting global warming to a global mean temperature change of +1.5 °C at most.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000323120",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/323120","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","heatwaves||temperature extremes||climate change||CMIP5 projections||land-atmosphere interactions||soil moisture-temperature feedbacks","Temperature extremes in a changing climate – Processes, emergent constraints and impacts","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2019-02-05T15:53:35Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate","617518||617518||617518||617518","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC||EC||EC","FP7||FP7||FP7||FP7","25668",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

One is a recently installed state-of-the-art monolithic mini-lysimeter with a tension-controlled lower boundary; the other is a large backfilled free-drainage lysimeter in operation since 1976. For this study, the mini-lysimeter measurements were processed using the Adaptive-Window and Adaptive-Threshold (AWAT) filter. The resulting water-balance estimates were then compared with those of the lower resolution large lysimeter, whose processing has remained unchanged since its installation. A number of additional, retrospectively applicable processing steps for the large lysimeter were then tested to mitigate the main sources of error for this instrument. Those found to be most beneficial were the application of a 10-min moving average to the mass measurements and the setting of ET and condensation to zero in hours with liquid precipitation. In spite of the differences in design, a generally close agreement between the two lysimeters was observed, which was further improved with the optimized large-lysimeter processing. A comparison of the lysimeter mass increases associated with liquid precipitation further revealed, however, that the large lysimeter experiences a previously unknown under-catch of about 11.5%, which could also be important for other lysimeter facilities. This under-catch led to a reduction in large-lysimeter seepage during the analyzed period, although the ET flux was not found to be affected.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000256180",,"1539-1663",,"10.2136/vzj2017.01.0026","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/256180","en","SSSA","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Comparative study of a long-established large weighing lysimeter and a state-of-the-art mini-lysimeter","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-04-09T04:04:55Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85044713550",,"000439696300001","Vadose Zone J.","1","Vadose Zone Journal","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, large uncertainties still exist in our understanding of the formation of cold, high-altitude cirrus and warmer, lower-altitude mixed-phase clouds. Ice formation in the atmosphere happens via both homogeneous ice nucleation (IN) occurring in an aqueous liquid droplet and heterogeneous IN induced by a foreign particle termed ice nucleating particle (INP) at warmer temperatures than homogeneous IN. Natural mineral dust (typically a complex mixture of several minerals) is a well-established class of INPs and is known to play a key role in atmospheric IN, although, we still lack a comprehensive knowledge of which properties make a mineral dust particle an efficient INP. Given that both sub- and supermicron-sized dust particles are efficiently transported over long distances, they can undergo physical and chemical changes due to e.g. photochemical aging, chemical reactions with trace gases and inorganic species. Such interactions can cause a complete change in the IN efficiency of potential INPs. It is difficult to resolve the interactions of individual solutes with mineral surfaces in a mixture of several minerals. Therefore, this PhD thesis focuses on understanding fundamental effects of solutes on the IN efficiency of single minerals (viz. aluminosilicates and silicas) and elucidating the interactions of mineral surfaces with pure water and inorganic solutions on a microphysical scale. For this purpose, a differential scanning calorimeter was used to detect immersion freezing (INP submerged in aqueous droplets) of emulsified aqueous droplets containing suspended particles of single minerals, namely K-feldspars (microcline and sanidine), (Na, Ca)-feldspar (andesine), kaolinite, quartz, micas (muscovite and biotite), gibbsite and amorphous silica. The suspensions were either prepared with pure water or aqueous solutions of sulfuric acid, ammonia and several inorganic salts, namely - ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate, ammonium bisulfate, sodium sulfate, potassium chloride, potassium sulfate and sodium hydroxide. Results show that heterogeneous IN onset temperatures for various minerals deviate from the previously established water-activity-based immersion freezing description because of the interactions between the INP surface and solutes. Interestingly, a general enhancement in IN efficiency (in terms of both, freezing onset temperatures (Thet) and heterogeneously frozen water volume fraction (Fhet)) of aluminosilicates is observed in the presence of dilute ammonia and ammonium salts. In addition, aqueous suspensions of micas and gibbsite, which did not show a heterogeneous freezing signal in emulsion freezing experiments in pure water, developed IN activity in the presence of ammonia. In contrast, Thet of quartz (a crystalline form of silica) follows the water-activity-based immersion freezing description, yet its Fhet is slightly enhanced in ammonium sulfate, ammonium bisulfate and sodium sulfate but decreased in ammonia and sodium hydroxide. Hence, the silicas respond to externally added solutes quite differently compared to the aluminosilicates. In addition, IN efficiency is drastically hampered under severe pH conditions (e.g. feldspars under acidic and alkaline conditions; quartz under alkaline conditions). The IN activity of quartz particles disappeared almost completely after aging for 7 months in pure water in a glass vial. During this time quartz slowly grew by incorporating silicic acid leached from the glass vial. Conversely, the synthesized amorphous silica samples showed no discernable heterogeneous freezing signal unless they were milled. We therefore suggest that milling, hence creation of defects, rather than crystallinity is the prime reason for the IN activity of silica surfaces. In summary, these investigations show that a high surface density of OH and NH groups providing sites for hydrogen bonding, surface charge influencing the orientation of water molecules, surface degradation due to the slow dissolution of the minerals and surface defects introduced by milling are all relevant factors for the IN activity of aluminosilicate and silica surfaces. Implications for IN on airborne dust consisting of aluminosilicates and silicas, especially when they undergo atmospheric aging, might be multifold. Therefore, the chemical exposure history of the particles is a relevant determinant of the IN efficiency of airborne dust.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000299543",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/299543","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Ice Nucleation||Mineral Dust||Feldspar||Silicates","Enhanced Ice Nucleation Efficiency of Mineral Dust Particles in Ammonia/Ammonium Solution Droplets","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2018-10-29T16:03:28Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Ice freezing on mineral dust samples","156251","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT","25239",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The lake in question is Lake Kivu, one of the African Great Lakes, and was selected for its remarkably uniform climate and availability of multi-year over-lake meteorological observations. Rain may have a cooling effect on the lake surface by lowering the near-surface air temperature, by the direct rain heat flux into the lake, by mixing the lake surface layer through the flux of kinetic energy and by convective mixing of the lake surface layer. The potential importance of the rainfall effect is discussed in terms of both heat flux and kinetic energy flux. To estimate the rainfall effect on the mean diurnal cycle of lake surface temperature, the data are binned into categories of daily rainfall amount. They are further filtered based on comparable values of daily mean net radiation, which reduces the influence of radiative-flux differences. Our results indicate that days with heavy rainfall may experience a reduction in lake surface temperature of approximately 0.3 K by the end of the day compared to days with light to moderate rainfall. Overall this study highlights a new potential control on lake surface temperature and suggests that further efforts are needed to quantify this effect in other regions and to include this process in land surface models used for atmospheric prediction.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000312308",,"1027-5606||1607-7938","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/312308||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/311525","10.5194/hess-22-6357-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/333064","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Estimating the effect of rainfall on the surface temperature of a tropical lake","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-12-18T09:58:33Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85058335722",,"000452663500001","Hydrol.

In this study, we used the regional air quality model, CAMx (Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions) to simulate and quantify, with various sensitivity runs (where the year 2010 served as the base case), the effects of increased radiation between 1990 and 2010 on photolysis rates (with the PHOT1, PHOT2 and PHOT3 scenarios, which represented the radiation in 1990) and biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions (with the BIO scenario, which represented the biogenic emissions in 1990), and their consequent impacts on summer surface ozone concentrations over Europe between 1990 and 2010. The PHOT1 and PHOT2 scenarios examined the effect of doubling and tripling the anthropogenic PM2.5 concentrations, respectively, while the PHOT3 investigated the impact of an increase in just the sulfate concentrations by a factor of 3.4 (as in 1990), applied only to the calculation of photolysis rates. In the BIO scenario, we reduced the 2010 SSR by 3% (keeping plant cover and temperature the same), recalculated the biogenic emissions and repeated the base case simulations with the new biogenic emissions. The impact on photolysis rates for all three scenarios was an increase (in 2010 compared to 1990) of 3–6% which resulted in daytime (10:00–18:00 Local Mean Time – LMT) mean surface ozone differences of 0.2–0.7ppb (0.5–1.5%), with the largest hourly difference rising as high as 4–8ppb (10–16%). The effect of changes in BVOC emissions on daytime mean surface ozone was much smaller (up to 0.08ppb,  ∼ 0.2%), as isoprene and terpene (monoterpene and sesquiterpene) emissions increased only by 2.5–3 and 0.7%, respectively. Overall, the impact of the SSR changes on surface ozone was greater via the effects on photolysis rates compared to the effects on BVOC emissions, and the sensitivity test of their combined impact (the combination of PHOT3 and BIO is denoted as the COMBO scenario) showed nearly additive effects. In addition, all the sensitivity runs were repeated on a second base case with increased NOx emissions to account for any potential underestimation of modeled ozone production; the results did not change significantly in magnitude, but the spatial coverage of the effects was profoundly extended. Finally, the role of the aerosol–radiation interaction (ARI) changes in the European summer surface ozone trends was suggested to be more important when comparing to the order of magnitude of the ozone trends instead of the total ozone concentrations, indicating a potential partial damping of the effects of ozone precursor emissions' reduction.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000278729",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-9741-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/278729","en","European Geophysical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Solar ""brightening"" impact on summer surface ozone between 1990 and 2010 in Europe - A model sensitivity study of the influence of the aerosol-radiation interactions","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-07-27T06:57:26Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85049861339",,"000438286400001","Atmos. chem. phys.","13","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is known to contain enhanced tropospheric trace gases and aerosols, due to rapid lifting from the boundary layer by deep convection and subsequent horizontal confinement. Given its dynamical structure, the ASMA represents an efficient pathway for the transport of pollutants to the global stratosphere. A detailed understanding of the thermal structure and processes in the ASMA requires accurate in situ measurements. Within the StratoClim project we performed state-of-the-art balloon-borne measurements of temperature, water vapor, ozone and aerosol backscatter from two stations on the southern slopes of the Himalayas. In total, 63 balloon soundings were conducted during two extensive monsoon-season campaigns, in August 2016 in Nainital, India (29.4°N, 79.5°E), and in July–August 2017 in Dhulikhel, Nepal (27.6°N, 85.5°E); one shorter post-monsoon campaign was also carried out in November 2016 in Nainital. These measurements provide unprecedented insights into the UTLS thermal structure, the vertical distributions of water vapor, ozone and aerosols, cirrus cloud properties and interannual variability in the ASMA. Here we provide an overview of all of the data collected during the three campaign periods, with focus on the UTLS region and the monsoon season. We analyze the vertical structure of the ASMA in terms of significant levels and layers, identified from the temperature and potential temperature lapse rates and Lagrangian backward trajectories, which provides a framework for relating the measurements to local thermodynamic properties and the large-scale anticyclonic flow. Both the monsoon-season campaigns show evidence of deep convection and confinement extending up to 1.5–2km above the cold-point tropopause (CPT), yielding a body of air with high water vapor and low ozone which is prone to being lifted further and mixed into the free stratosphere. Enhanced aerosol backscatter also reveals the signature of the Asian tropopause aerosol layer (ATAL) over the same region of altitudes. The Dhulikhel 2017 campaign was characterized by a 5K colder CPT on average than in Nainital 2016 and a local water vapor maximum in the confined lower stratosphere, about 1km above the CPT. Data assessment and modeling studies are currently ongoing with the aim of fully exploring this dataset and its implications with respect to stratospheric moistening via the ASMA system and related processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000304456",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-15937-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/304456","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Balloon-borne measurements of temperature, water vapor, ozone and aerosol backscatter on the southern slopes of the Himalayas during StratoClim 2016-2017","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-11-18T06:48:51Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"BATTREX-CH: The Swiss contribution to the international BAlloonsonde Tropical TRopopause EXperiment","147127","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,,"85056332381",,"000449479800003","Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we show a comprehensive in situ data set of ice crystal complexity coupled with measurements of the cloud angular scattering functions collected during a number of observational airborne campaigns at diverse geographical locations. Our results demonstrate that an overwhelming fraction (between 61% and 81%) of atmospheric ice crystals sampled in the different regions contain mesoscopic deformations and, as a consequence, a similar flat and featureless angular scattering function is observed. A comparison between the measurements and a database of optical particle properties showed that severely roughened hexagonal aggregates optimally represent the measurements in the observed angular range. Based on this optical model, a new parameterization of the cloud bulk asymmetry factor was introduced and its effects were tested in a global climate model. The modelling results suggest that, due to ice crystal complexity, ice-containing clouds can induce an additional short-wave cooling effect of −1.12Wm2 on the top-of-the-atmosphere radiative budget that has not yet been considered.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000304162",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-15767-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/304162","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Additional global climate cooling by clouds due to ice crystal complexity","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-11-16T05:41:51Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85056125093",,"000449342400003","Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study presents the first systematic comparison of the representation of the 11-year solar cycle ozone response (SOR) in chemistry–climate models (CCMs) and in pre-calculated ozone databases specified in climate models that do not include chemistry, with a special focus on comparing the recommended protocols for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and Phase 6 (CMIP5 and CMIP6). We analyse the SOR in eight CCMs from the Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative (CCMI-1) and compare these with results from three ozone databases for climate models: the Bodeker Scientific ozone database, the SPARC/Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate (AC&C) ozone database for CMIP5 and the SPARC/CCMI ozone database for CMIP6. The peak amplitude of the annual mean SOR in the tropical upper stratosphere (1–5hPa) decreases by more than a factor of 2, from around 5 to 2%, between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ozone databases. This substantial decrease can be traced to the CMIP5 ozone database being constructed from a regression model fit to satellite and ozonesonde measurements, while the CMIP6 database is constructed from CCM simulations. The SOR in the CMIP6 ozone database therefore implicitly resembles the SOR in the CCMI-1 models. The structure in latitude of the SOR in the CMIP6 ozone database and CCMI-1 models is considerably smoother than in the CMIP5 database, which shows unrealistic sharp gradients in the SOR across the middle latitudes owing to the paucity of long-term ozone measurements in polar regions. The SORs in the CMIP6 ozone database and the CCMI-1 models show a seasonal dependence with enhanced meridional gradients at mid- to high latitudes in the winter hemisphere. The CMIP5 ozone database does not account for seasonal variations in the SOR, which is unrealistic. Sensitivity experiments with a global atmospheric model without chemistry (ECHAM6.3) are performed to assess the atmospheric impacts of changes in the representation of the SOR and solar spectral irradiance (SSI) forcing between CMIP5 and CMIP6. The larger amplitude of the SOR in the CMIP5 ozone database compared to CMIP6 causes a likely overestimation of the modelled tropical stratospheric temperature response between 11-year solar cycle minimum and maximum by up to 0.55K, or around 80% of the total amplitude. This effect is substantially larger than the change in temperature response due to differences in SSI forcing between CMIP5 and CMIP6. The results emphasize the importance of adequately representing the SOR in global models to capture the impact of the 11-year solar cycle on the atmosphere. Since a number of limitations in the representation of the SOR in the CMIP5 ozone database have been identified, we recommend that CMIP6 models without chemistry use the CMIP6 ozone database and the CMIP6 SSI dataset to better capture the climate impacts of solar variability. The SOR coefficients from the CMIP6 ozone database are published with this paper.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000284329",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-11323-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/284329","en","European Geophysical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The representation of solar cycle signals in stratospheric ozone - Part 2: Analysis of global models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-24T08:24:18Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85051503137",,"000441403800008","Atmos. chem. phys.","15","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Thus, charcoal records from lake sediments have become the primary source for reconstructing past fire activity. Microscopic charcoal particles are generated during forest and grassland fires and can be transported over large distances before being deposited into natural archives. In this paper, we implement microscopic charcoal particles into a global aerosol–climate model to better understand the transport of charcoal on a large scale. Atmospheric transport and interactions with other aerosol particles, clouds, and radiation are explicitly simulated. To estimate the emissions of the microscopic charcoal particles, we use recent European charcoal observations from lake sediments as a calibration data set. We found that scaling black carbon fire emissions from the Global Fire Assimilation System (a satellite-based emission inventory) by approximately 2 orders of magnitude matches the calibration data set best. The charcoal validation data set, for which we collected charcoal observations from all over the globe, generally supports this scaling factor. In the validation data set, we included charcoal particles from lake sediments, peats, and ice cores. While only the Spearman rank correlation coefficient is significant for the calibration data set (0.67), both the Pearson and the Spearman rank correlation coefficients are positive and significantly different from zero for the validation data set (0.59 and 0.48, respectively). Overall, the model captures a significant portion of the spatial variability, but it fails to reproduce the extreme spatial variability observed in the charcoal data. This can mainly be explained by the coarse spatial resolution of the model and uncertainties concerning fire emissions. Furthermore, charcoal fluxes derived from ice core sites are much lower than the simulated fluxes, which can be explained by the location properties (high altitude and steep topography, which are not well represented in the model) of most of the investigated ice cores. Global modelling of charcoal can improve our understanding of the representativeness of this fire proxy. Furthermore, it might allow past fire emissions provided by fire models to be quantitatively validated. This might deepen our understanding of the processes driving global fire activity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000285894",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-11813-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/285894","en","European Geophysical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Implementing microscopic charcoal particles into a global aerosol-climate model","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-31T04:30:40Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85052128158",,"000442099800003","Atmos. chem. phys.","16","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They are therefore of particular interest in mixed-phase cloud temperature regimes, where supercooled liquid droplets can persist for extended periods of time in the absence of INPs. When INPs are introduced to such an environment, the cloud can quickly glaciate following ice multiplication processes and the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen (WBF) process. The WBF process can also cause the ice to grow to precipitation size and precipitate out. All of these processes alter the radiative properties.  Despite their potential influence on climate, the ice nucleation ability and importance of different aerosol species is still not well understood and is a field of active research. In this study, we use the aerosol–climate model ECHAM6-HAM2 to examine the global relevance of marine organic aerosol (MOA), which has drawn much interest in recent years as a potentially important INPs in remote marine regions. We address the uncertainties in emissions and ice nucleation activity of MOA with a range of reasonable set-ups and find a wide range of resulting MOA burdens. The relative importance of MOA as an INP compared to dust is investigated and found to depend strongly on the type of ice nucleation parameterisation scheme chosen. On the zonal mean, freezing due to MOA leads to relative increases in the cloud ice occurrence and in-cloud number concentration close to the surface in the polar regions during summer. Slight but consistent decreases in the in-cloud ice crystal effective radius can also be observed over the same regions during all seasons. Regardless, MOA was not found to affect the radiative balance significantly on the global scale, due to its relatively weak ice activity and a low sensitivity of cloud ice properties to heterogeneous ice nucleation in our model.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000284323",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-11423-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/284323","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Global relevance of marine organic aerosol as ice nucleating particles","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-24T08:24:18Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85051602009",,"000441652600002","Atmos. chem. phys.","15","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Soot types were selected to represent a range of physicochemical properties associated with combustion particles. Their ice nucleation ability was determined as a function of particle size using relative humidity (RH) scans in the Horizontal Ice Nucleation Chamber (HINC). We complement our ice nucleation results by a suite of particle characterization measurements, including determination of particle surface area, fractal dimension, temperature-dependent mass loss (ML), water vapor sorption and inferred porosity measurements. Independent of particle size, all soot types reveal absence of ice nucleation below and at water saturation in the MPC regime (T > 235K). In the cirrus regime (T ≤ 235K), soot types show different freezing behavior depending on particle size and soot type, but the freezing is closely linked to the soot particle properties. Specifically, our results suggest that if soot aggregates contain mesopores (pore diameters of 2–50nm) and have sufficiently low water–soot contact angles, they show ice nucleation activity and can contribute to ice formation in the cirrus regime at RH well below homogeneous freezing of solution droplets. We attribute the observed ice nucleation to a pore condensation and freezing (PCF) mechanism. Nevertheless, soot particles without cavities of the right size and/or too-high contact angles nucleate ice only at or well above the RH required for homogeneous freezing conditions of solution droplets. Thus, our results imply that soot particles able to nucleate ice via PCF could impact the microphysical properties of ice clouds.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000293175",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-13363-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/293175","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ice nucleation abilities of soot particles determined with the Horizontal Ice Nucleation Chamber","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-10-04T03:55:43Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85053782998",,"000445092500001","Atmos. chem. phys.","18","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It features a widely used description of cloud water with two categories for cloud droplets and raindrops. The unique aspect of the new scheme is the break with the traditional approach to describe cloud ice analogously. Here we parameterize cloud ice by a single category that predicts bulk particle properties (P3). This method has already been applied in a regional model and most recently also in the Community Atmosphere Model 5 (CAM5). A single cloud ice category does not rely on heuristic conversion rates from one category to another. Therefore, it is conceptually easier and closer to first principles. This work shows that a single category is a viable approach to describe cloud ice in climate models. Prognostic representation of sedimentation is achieved by a nested approach for sub-stepping the cloud microphysics scheme. This yields good results in terms of accuracy and performance as compared to simulations with high temporal resolution. Furthermore, the new scheme allows for a competition between various cloud processes and is thus able to unbiasedly represent the ice formation pathway from nucleation to growth by vapor deposition and collisions to sedimentation. Specific aspects of the P3 method are evaluated. We could not produce a purely stratiform cloud where rime growth dominates growth by vapor deposition and conclude that the lack of appropriate conditions renders the prognostic parameters associated with the rime properties unnecessary. Limitations inherent in a single category are examined.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000260996",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-11-1557-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/260996","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Prognostic parameterization of cloud ice with a single category in the aerosol-climate model ECHAM(v6.3.0)-HAM(v2.3)","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-04-27T05:12:33Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85045687235",,"000430352200002","Geosci. model dev.","4","Geoscientific Model Development","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We investigate annual-mean tropospheric column ozone in 15 models participating in the SPARC–IGAC (Stratosphere–troposphere Processes And their Role in Climate–International Global Atmospheric Chemistry) Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI). These models exhibit a positive bias, on average, of up to 40%–50% in the Northern Hemisphere compared with observations derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument and Microwave Limb Sounder (OMI/MLS), and a negative bias of up to  ∼ 30% in the Southern Hemisphere. SOCOLv3.0 (version 3 of the Solar-Climate Ozone Links CCM), which participated in CCMI, simulates global-mean tropospheric ozone columns of 40.2DU – approximately 33% larger than the CCMI multi-model mean. Here we introduce an updated version of SOCOLv3.0, ""SOCOLv3.1"", which includes an improved treatment of ozone sink processes, and results in a reduction in the tropospheric column ozone bias of up to 8DU, mostly due to the inclusion of N2O5 hydrolysis on tropospheric aerosols. As a result of these developments, tropospheric column ozone amounts simulated by SOCOLv3.1 are comparable with several other CCMI models. We apply Gaussian process emulation and sensitivity analysis to understand the remaining ozone bias in SOCOLv3.1. This shows that ozone precursors (nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide, methane and other volatile organic compounds, VOCs) are responsible for more than 90% of the variance in tropospheric ozone. However, it may not be the emissions inventories themselves that result in the bias, but how the emissions are handled in SOCOLv3.1, and we discuss this in the wider context of the other CCMI models. Given that the emissions data set to be used for phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project includes approximately 20% more NOx than the data set used for CCMI, further work is urgently needed to address the challenges of simulating sub-grid processes of importance to tropospheric ozone in the current generation of chemistry–climate models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000305910",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-16155-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/305910","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Tropospheric ozone in CCMI models and Gaussian process emulation to understand biases in the SOCOLv3 chemistry-climate model","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-11-24T15:47:22Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85056610467",,"000450003300001","Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Its performance can be highly enhanced by having recourse to r-adaptivity. Here, a vertical adaptive mesh method is developed for DG finite elements. This method, originally designed for finite difference schemes, is based on the vertical diffusion of the mesh nodes, with the diffusivity controlled by the density jumps at the mesh element interfaces. The mesh vertical movement is determined by means of a conservative arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) formulation. Though conservativity is naturally achieved, tracer consistency is obtained by a suitable construction of the mesh vertical velocity field, which is defined in such a way that it is fully compatible with the tracer and continuity equations at a discrete level. The vertically adaptive mesh approach is implemented in the three-dimensional version of the geophysical and environmental flow Second-generation Louvain-la-Neuve Ice-ocean Model (SLIM 3D; www.climate.be/slim). Idealised benchmarks, aimed at simulating the oscillations of a sharp thermocline, are dealt with. Then, the relevance of the vertical adaptivity technique is assessed by simulating thermocline oscillations of Lake Tanganyika. The results are compared to measured vertical profiles of temperature, showing similar stratification and outcropping events.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000256176",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-11-1161-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/256176","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A fully consistent and conservative vertically adaptive coordinate system for SLIM 3D v0.4 with an application to the thermocline oscillations of Lake Tanganyika","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-04-09T04:01:53Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85044765323",,"000428836100002","Geosci. model dev.","3","Geoscientific Model Development","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, there is a large uncertainty in the rate of regional ozone recovery in the Northern Hemisphere. Here we identify a Eurasia-North America dipole mode in the total column ozone over the Northern Hemisphere, showing negative and positive total column ozone anomaly centres over Eurasia and North America, respectively. The positive trend of this mode explains an enhanced total column ozone decline over the Eurasian continent in the past three decades, which is closely related to the polar vortex shift towards Eurasia. Multiple chemistry-climate-model simulations indicate that the positive Eurasia-North America dipole trend in late winter is likely to continue in the near future. Our findings suggest that the anticipated ozone recovery in late winter will be sensitive not only to the ozone-depleting substance decline but also to the polar vortex changes, and could be substantially delayed in some regions of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000235754",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-017-02565-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/235754","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Stratospheric ozone loss over the Eurasian continent induced by the polar vortex shift","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-01-29T04:05:42Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85040771739",,,"Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Due to isotopic fractionation, they record information about condensation and evaporation processes during the transport of air parcels, and therefore present a valuable means for studying the global water cycle. However, the meteorological processes driving isotopic variations are complex and not very well understood so far, in particular on short (hourly to daily) timescales. This study presents a Lagrangian method for attributing the isotopic composition of air parcels to meteorological processes, which provides new insight into the isotopic history of air parcels. It is based on the temporal evolution of the isotope ratios, the humidity, the temperature, and the location of the air parcels. Here these values are extracted along 7-day backward trajectories started every 6 hours from near the surface in a 30-year regional climate simulation over Europe with the isotope-enabled version of the model of the Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling (COSMOiso). The COSMOiso simulation has a horizontal resolution of 0.25° and is driven at the lateral boundaries by a T106 global climate simulation with the isotope-enabled version of the European Centre Hamburg model (ECHAMwiso). Both simulations are validated against measurements from the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP), which shows that nesting COSMOiso within ECHAMwiso improves the representation of δ2H and deuterium excess in monthly accumulated precipitation. The method considers all isotopic changes that occur inside the COSMOiso model domain, which, on average, correspond to more than half of the mean and variability in both δ2H and deuterium excess at the air parcels' arrival points. Along every trajectory, the variations in the isotope values are quantitatively decomposed into eight process categories (evaporation from the ocean, evapotranspiration from land, mixing with moister air, mixing with drier air, liquid cloud formation, mixed phase cloud formation, ice cloud formation, and no process). The results show that for air parcels arriving over the ocean, evaporation from the ocean is the primary factor controlling δ2H and deuterium excess. Over land, evapotranspiration from land and mixing with moister air are similarly important. Liquid and mixed phase cloud formation contribute to the variability of δ2H and deuterium excess, especially over continental Europe. In summary, the presented method helps to better understand the linkage between the meteorological history of air parcels and their isotopic composition, and may support the interpretation of stable water isotope measurements in future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000242152",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-1653-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/242152","en","Copernicus GmbH","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Lagrangian process attribution of isotopic variations in near-surface water vapour in a 30-year regional climate simulation over Europe","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-02-20T02:27:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85041641381",,"000424258700002","Atmos. chem. phys.","3","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is then transported to the extratropics by the Brewer–Dobson circulation (BDC), forming a protective ""ozone layer"" around the globe. Human emissions of halogen-containing ozone-depleting substances (hODSs) led to a decline in stratospheric ozone until they were banned by the Montreal Protocol, and since 1998 ozone in the upper stratosphere is rising again, likely the recovery from halogen-induced losses. Total column measurements of ozone between the Earth's surface and the top of the atmosphere indicate that the ozone layer has stopped declining across the globe, but no clear increase has been observed at latitudes between 60° S and 60° N outside the polar regions (60–90°). Here we report evidence from multiple satellite measurements that ozone in the lower stratosphere between 60° S and 60° N has indeed continued to decline since 1998. We find that, even though upper stratospheric ozone is recovering, the continuing downward trend in the lower stratosphere prevails, resulting in a downward trend in stratospheric column ozone between 60° S and 60° N. We find that total column ozone between 60° S and 60° N appears not to have decreased only because of increases in tropospheric column ozone that compensate for the stratospheric decreases. The reasons for the continued reduction of lower stratospheric ozone are not clear; models do not reproduce these trends, and thus the causes now urgently need to be established.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000241781",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-1379-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/241781","en","Copernicus GmbH","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Evidence for a continuous decline in lower stratospheric ozone offsetting ozone layer recovery","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-02-17T03:09:24Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85041684300",,"000424257700001","Atmos. chem. phys.","2","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
