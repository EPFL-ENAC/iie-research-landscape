We recover 221 k nonredundant structural variations (SVs) from the pangenomes, of which 135 k (61%) are common to all three. SVs derived from assembly-based calling show high agreement with the consensus calls from the pangenomes (96%), but validate only a small proportion of variations private to each graph. Pggb and cactus, which also incorporate base-level variation, have approximately 95% exact matches with assembly-derived small variant calls, which significantly improves the edit rate when realigning assemblies compared to minigraph. We use the three pangenomes to investigate 9566 variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), finding 63% have identical predicted repeat counts in the three graphs, while minigraph can over or underestimate the count given its approximate coordinate system. We examine a highly variable VNTR locus and show that repeat unit copy number impacts the expression of proximal genes and non-coding RNA.

To understand the underlying forest dynamics, we need a long-term but also relatively high-frequency, networked monitoring system, as traditionally used in meteorology or hydrology. While there are numerous existing forest monitoring sites, particularly in temperate regions, the resulting data streams are rarely connected and do not provide information promptly, which hampers real-time assessments of forest responses to extreme climate events. The technology to build a better global forest monitoring network now exists. This white paper addresses the key structural components needed to achieve a novel meta-network. We propose to complement - rather than replace or unify - the existing heterogeneous infrastructure with standardized, quality-assured linking methods and interacting data processing centers to create an integrated forest monitoring network. These automated (research topic-dependent) linking methods in atmosphere, biosphere, and pedosphere play a key role in scaling site-specific results and processing them in a timely manner. To ensure broad participation from existing monitoring sites and to establish new sites, these linking methods must be as informative, reliable, affordable, and maintainable as possible, and should be supplemented by near real-time remote sensing data. The proposed novel meta-network will enable the detection of emergent patterns that would not be visible from isolated analyses of individual sites. In addition, the near real-time availability of data will facilitate predictions of current forest conditions (nowcasts), which are urgently needed for research and decision making in the face of rapid climate change.

Dew as an additional water source can promote ecosystem carbon assimilation. It is known that grassland ecosystems keep high evapotranspiration as long as soil water is available. However, it is rarely being investigated whether dew can mitigate the impact of such extreme climatic events on grassland ecosystem carbon and water exchange. Here we use stable isotopes in meteoric waters and leaf sugars, eddy covariance fluxes for H2O vapor and CO2, in combination with meteorological and plant physiological measurements, to investigate the combined effect of dew and heat-drought stress on plant water status and net ecosystem production (NEP) in an alpine grassland (2000 m elevation) during the June 2019 European heatwave. Before the heatwave, enhanced NEP in the early morning hours can be attributed to leaf wetting by dew. However, dew benefits on NEP were cancelled out by the heatwave, due to the minor contribution of dew in leaf water. Heat-induced reduction in NEP was intensified by the combined effect of drought stress. The recovery of NEP after the peak of the heatwave could be linked to the refilling of plant tissues during nighttime. Among-genera differences of plant water status affected by dew and heat-drought stress can be attributed to differences in their foliar dew water uptake, and their reliance on soil moisture or the impact of the atmospheric evaporative demand. Our results indicate that dew influence on alpine grassland ecosystems varies according to the environmental stress and plant physiology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000611415",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2023.1136037","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/611415","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","heatwave||dew||alpine grassland||drought||stable isotope||net ecosystem production","Dew benefits on alpine grasslands are cancelled out by combined heatwave and drought stress","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-05-10T08:40:23Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The importance of fog and dew for Swiss grasslands today and in the future (Acronym: IFDewS)||Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies","175733||774124","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","Projekte MINT||H2020",,,,,"Front.

Nowadays, ecological restoration goes far beyond recovering a degraded ecosystem according to a historic reference. Instead, more specific restoration goals are set, following global environmental strategies that are individually highly important, but often conflicting. Furthermore, various pitfalls exist regarding the evaluation of ecosystem degradation and, directly related to this, the question what is the most desirable ecological state of an ecosystem. Ignoring such issues can lead to a failure of restoration projects and do more ecological (and social) harm than good. A crucial aspect in tackling conflicting goals and circumnavigating restoration pitfalls is the considerate choice of the indicators to assess ecosystem degradation and restoration capacity.  In this Perspective, grasslands and rangelands are used exemplarily for ecosystems with globally high restoration demand. I discuss potential restoration pitfalls related to enhancing carbon sequestration, soil fertility, and ecosystem service multifunctionality. For all three goals, strong trade-offs and unwanted side effects exist. For example, while increasing carbon storage and restoring soil fertility are widely acknowledged environmental goals, both can compromise other restoration targets such as grassland biodiversity and further ecosystem services, depending on the specific context. Thus, there are no universally applicable indicators for ecosystem degradation and restoration. Instead, indicator systems have to account not only for strong trade-offs among restoration goals but also for a number of environmental and socio-ecological misconceptions, such as presented for the case of grassland ecosystems.  I argue that one-sided goal setting and an imprudent choice of indicators can misguide the science-policy dialogue and related restoration efforts. To avoid this, restoration programs must integrate holistic assessments of their objectives across spatial scales and with all stakeholders concerned. The associated ecological indicator system for restoration success and program performance must therefore also be based on multidisciplinary and participatory approaches. Restoration and degradation indicators have to further ensure the target ecosystem is correctly and comprehensively identified, and the manifold conflicting land management objectives associated with heterogeneous human societies are taken into account. Researchers can assist this process by by-default considering the socio-ecological context of a restoration target and by identifying trade-offs arising from potential solutions, before these are suggested to the public. Only when all these aspects are considered, restoration projects at the local to global scale will result in long-term sustainable outcomes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000606250",,"1470-160X||1872-7034",,"10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110185","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/606250","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Carbon sequestration||Ecological restoration||Ecosystems services multifunctionality||Grassland ecosystems||Rangelands||Soil fertility","Pitfalls in global grassland restoration challenge restoration programs and the science-policy dialogue","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-04-03T06:56:57Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85151366544",,"000966335500001",,,"Ecological Indicators","149","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, our knowledge about the processes leading to fog evolution is still fragmentary, and their adequate representation in numerical-weather-prediction and climate models remains challenging. Water vapor isotopes are widely used to investigate Earth's water cycle dynamics and can provide process-based insights into fog evolution. Although isotopes of water vapor and droplets during radiation fog have been reported, the intra-event isotope dynamics and the mechanisms controlling water vapor isotope variability during radiation fog evolution have hardly been investigated. We use water vapor isotopes (δ2Hv, dv) combined with meteorological and eddy-covariance measurements, plus vertical profiles from a high-resolution numerical-weather-prediction model (COSMO-1), to study the processes that influence radiation fog evolution. Variability in surface-humidity and water vapor isotopes is tied to the different stages (shallow, transitional, and deep fog) of radiation fog evolution and affected by condensation, turbulent entrainment, fog droplet deposition at the surface, and evaporation processes. Strong water vapor isotopic fluctuations during radiation fog are linked to fog lifting to stratus-clouds during nighttime that lead to fog dissipation at ground level. Our results reveal highly correlated atmospheric-specific-humidity (qa) and water vapor isotopes during dew formation which is typical before the onset of radiation fog and in combination with fog; whilst during fog periods, δ2Hv and dv show larger temporal variability than qa due to their sensitivity to fog dynamics. Particularly, during fog growth, entrainment of air from the fog-top caused increasing dv, which was otherwise constant during condensation. Furthermore, δ2Hv variability during the transition into deep fog likely indicated the alternation of condensation-induced-decrease and entrainment-induced-increase of δ2Hv. Compared to the temporal isotope variability (with a magnitude of 34.6‰ for δ2Hv) associated with large-scale cold-frontal-clouds, radiation fog evolution is found to be associated with isotope variability of a similar amplitude (24.6‰ for δ2Hv).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000605701",,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2023.109430","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/605701","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Radiation fog evolution||Condensation||Entrainment||Evaporation||Water vapor isotopes||Cold frontal clouds","Identifying key stages of radiation fog evolution using water vapor isotopes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-03-30T06:44:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The importance of fog and dew for Swiss grasslands today and in the future (Acronym: IFDewS)","175733","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85151268980",,"000968527100001","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","334","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The main purpose of this study is to analyze gender bias in ecosystem restoration covering three dimensions: research, outreach, and practice. We used scientific publications from the Restoration Ecology journal, mentions of these articles in Altmetric Explorer and Twitter, and projects from the Society for Ecological Restoration's database. First, we study gender bias among people leading ecosystem restoration initiatives in the three dimensions. Second, we assessed factors that could influence gender bias, including year, target ecosystem, and socioeconomic country development. Third, we analyzed whether the impact of scientific knowledge in society depends on the gender of the scientific team. Our results indicate that men were primary leaders in research, outreach, and practice initiatives in ecosystem restoration. There seems to be a trend over time toward equality in research, but gender inequality is still present in most types of ecosystems, with women leading more projects in more developed countries. The impact of scientific knowledge is independent of the author's gender, but research of male senior authors seems to reach society more easily.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim to uncover the genetic underpinnings of traits. Multivariate association testing and the meta-analysis of summary statistics from single-trait GWAS enable detecting variants associated with multiple phenotypes. In this study, we used array-derived genotypes and phenotypes for 24 reproduction, production, and conformation traits to explore differences between the two methods and used imputed sequence variant genotypes to fine-map six quantitative trait loci (QTL).  Results We considered genotypes at 44,733 SNPs for 5,753 pigs from the Swiss Large White breed that had deregressed breeding values for 24 traits. Single-trait association analyses revealed eleven QTL that affected 15 traits. Multi-trait association testing and the meta-analysis of the single-trait GWAS revealed between 3 and 6 QTL, respectively, in three groups of traits. The multi-trait methods revealed three loci that were not detected in the single-trait GWAS. Four QTL that were identified in the single-trait GWAS, remained undetected in the multi-trait analyses. To pinpoint candidate causal variants for the QTL, we imputed the array-derived genotypes to the sequence level using a sequenced reference panel consisting of 421 pigs. This approach provided genotypes at 16 million imputed sequence variants with a mean accuracy of imputation of 0.94. The fine-mapping of six QTL with imputed sequence variant genotypes revealed four previously proposed causal mutations among the top variants.  Conclusions Our findings in a medium-size cohort of pigs suggest that multivariate association testing and the meta-analysis of summary statistics from single-trait GWAS provide very similar results. Although multi-trait association methods provide a useful overview of pleiotropic loci segregating in mapping populations, the investigation of single-trait association studies is still advised, as multi-trait methods may miss QTL that are uncovered in single-trait GWAS.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000607297",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-023-09295-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/607297","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Genome-wide association study||Multivariate analyses||Meta-analyses||Pleiotropy||Imputation","Comparison of two multi-trait association testing methods and sequence-based fine mapping of six additive QTL in Swiss Large White pigs","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-04-11T19:22:39Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85152106094",,,"BMC Genomics","1","BMC Genomics","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it is contested whether such citizens’ assemblies in their currently most implemented form can contribute to a profound sustainability transformation. In 2022, 85 citizens gathered to deliberate the Swiss food system transformation. The Swiss Citizens' Assembly on Food Policy (BEP) was unique in that it was the first national assembly and applied Scharmer's Theory U approach, which generates new collective intentions in a non-agonistic way. I focus on the question of whether the process’ framing was capable of realizing its transformational and democratic potential. Combining ethnographic approaches (participant observation, autoethnography, and semi-structured interviews) and constructivist grounded theory, I gained insights into how facilitators and citizens experienced the deliberative process and what emerged from these different experiences. I placed these emergences in the context of contestation, expertise, and time, drawing on critiques related to sustainability transformation by both deliberative and agonistic scholars. My results indicate that the BEP could empower collective action and make a more citizen-led democracy imaginable. However, proactive measures are needed to address structural problems and societal ideas that impede a truly democratic and transformative deliberative process. This includes (1) enhancing contestatory forms of communication next to harmonic ones in consensus-seeking cultures, (2) challenging the dominance of rational argumentation in Western policy-making processes and empowering citizens’ ways of knowing, and, especially in polarized contexts, (3) recognizing plurality within a narrow consensus-oriented framework. These insights have been echoed in numerous studies of participatory and deliberative processes, but are rarely applied in citizens’ assemblies in Western democracies. By proactively experimenting with the above, food democracy can be envisioned.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/611744","en",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Food system transformation||Deliberation||Deliberative democracy||Sustainability transformations||Citizens' Assemblies||Ethnography||Grounded Theory||Agonism/antagonism||Expertise||Pluralism||Theory U||Participation","Contestation, Expertise, and Time: An Ethnographic Case Study of the Swiss Citizens’ Assembly on Food Policy","Master Thesis","Closed access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::320 - Political science||DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::320 - Political science||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,"2023-05-12T07:00:57Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, with increasing global warming due to climatic changes, its spatiotemporal evolution is uncertain and largely unknown. In this study we detected long-term (40 years; 1981–2020) SM patterns of global vegetated areas through spatial timeseries clustering using the state-of-the-art ERA5-Land dataset. In addition, we also analyzed long-term patterns of precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (bare soil evaporation (BSe) and vegetation transpiration (VT)), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Our results indicate that surface SM (0–7 cm depth) of about 48 % and 9 % of the global vegetated area is showing drying and wetting pattern over the past 40 years, respectively. The detected soil drying, and wetting patterns were largely consistent across different soil depth, with 90 % and 80 % pattern similarity of surface soil layer with 2nd soil layer (7–28 cm) and 3rd soil layer (28–100 cm), respectively. About 80 % of areas with drying soil pattern also showed increasing evapotranspiration and/or decreasing precipitation. Specifically, decreasing P, increasing BSe and VT pattern were detected for 11 % of the soil drying pattern area. Similarly, increasing BSe and VT pattern, only decreasing P and only increasing VT pattern were detected for 17 %, 25 % and 12 % of soil drying areas, respectively. Both decreasing precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration patterns showed about 40 % similarity with decreasing soil moisture patterns. Across different landcover types, broadleaved forests, and cropland areas showed largest drying pattern. Under the future global warming scenario, the global soil water is expected to decrease as evapotranspiration would increase with inconsistent trend of global precipitation change. Our findings are of utmost importance for global soil water resource conservation and management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591781",,"0048-9697||1879-1026","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/595542||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591781","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161470","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/596707","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ERA5-Land||Space-time pattern mining||Hotspot||Coldspot||NDVI||Reanalysis","Spatiotemporal evolution of global long-term patterns of soil moisture","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-11T15:32:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Forest Vulnerability to Extreme and Repeated Climatic Stress (FEVER)","ETH-27 19-1","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,"85146421871",,"000923767900001","Sci.

However, many agri-food wastes and byproducts are typically high in lignocellulosic fibers (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin), making it resistant to efficient larval and/or microbial degradation. Ammonia pretreatment could be used to partially degrade lignocellulose, making the biowaste more easily degradable by the larvae and/or microorganisms. This study evaluated ammonia pretreatment for lignocellulose degradation and its effect on BSFL performance on four fibrous biowastes: brewers spent grain, cow manure, oat pulp, and grass clippings. First, the optimal ammonia dose (1 % or 5 % dry mass) and pretreatment time (three or seven days) were assessed by measuring fibers after treatment and further examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Second, BSFL rearing performance on ammonia-pretreated substrates was assessed with a 9-day feeding experiment. Three-day pretreatment with 5 % ammonia was chosen as it decreased the total fiber content by 8–23 % for all substrates except cow manure. Contrary to expectations, ammonia pretreatment with all substates decreased BSFL rearing performance metrics by more than half compared to the untreated control. Follow-up experiments suggested that ammonia pretreatment had a dose-dependent toxicity to BSFL. Interestingly, three-day fermentation of cow manure and oat pulp increased bioconversion rate by 25–31 %. This study shows that ammonia pretreatment is not suitable before BSFL rearing. Ammonia toxicity to BSFL and other pretreatments, such as fermentation, should be further studied.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000597208",,"0956-053X||1879-2456",,"10.1016/j.wasman.2023.01.033","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/597208","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Hermetia illucens||Waste management||Chemical pretreatment||Lignocellulose||Yard waste||Agri-food waste","Evaluation of ammonia pretreatment of four fibrous biowastes and its effect on black soldier fly larvae rearing performance","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-02-06T16:08:24Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"SUStainable INsect CHain","861976","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,"85148537638",,"000948517000001","Waste Manag",,"Waste Management","160","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02070 - Dep.

Genetic resistance is required to ensure yield stability and reduce the use of insecticides, yet the available resistance sources are limited. In this study, three common bean populations containing a total of 559 genotypes were evaluated in different yield and BLCrV resistance trials under natural infection in the field. A genome-wide association study identified the locus BLC7.1 on chromosome Pv07 at 3.31 Mbp, explaining between 8.22% to 16.08% of the phenotypic variation for BLCrV resistance. Comparatively, whole-genome regression models explained 51% to 78% of the variation and identified the same region on Pv07 to confer the resistance. The most significantly associated markers were located within the gene model Phvul.007G040400, which encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase subfamily III member and is likely involved in the innate immune response against the virus. The allelic diversity within this gene revealed five different haplotype groups, one of which was significantly associated with BLCrV resistance. As the same genome region was previously reported with resistance against other geminiviruses affecting common bean, our study highlights the role that historical breeding for virus resistance has played in the accumulation of positive alleles against newly emerging viruses. In addition, we provide novel diagnostic SNP markers for marker-assisted selection to exploit BLC7.1 for breeding against geminivirus diseases in one of the most important food security crops worldwide.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591610",,"0960-7412||1365-313X",,"10.1111/tpj.15810","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591610","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Begomovirus||Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)||Disease resistance||Genomic  prediction||Leucine-rich  repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK)||Marker-assisted selection (MAS)||Bean leaf crumple virus (BLCrV)","Genetic analysis of resistance to bean leaf crumple virus identifies a candidate LRR-RLK gene","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-11T11:41:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85143230742",,"000936963700001","Plant j.","1","The Plant Journal","114","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We analyzed chromosome composition of the F2 generation of Festuca × Lolium hybrids and reciprocal backcrosses to elucidate effects of male and female meiosis on the shift in parental genome composition. We studied male meiosis, including the attachment of chromosomes to the karyokinetic spindle and gene expression profiling of the kinetochore genes. We found that Lolium and Festuca homoeologues were transmitted differently to the F2 generation. Female meiosis led to the replacement of Festuca chromosomes by their Lolium counterparts. In male meiosis, Festuca univalents were attached less frequently to microtubules than Lolium univalents, lagged in divisions and formed micronuclei, which were subsequently eliminated. Genome sequence analysis revealed a number of non-synonymous mutations between copies of the kinetochore genes from Festuca and Lolium genomes. Furthermore, we found that outer kinetochore proteins NDC80 and NNF1 were exclusively expressed from the Lolium allele. We hypothesize that silencing of Festuca alleles results in improper attachment of Festuca chromosomes to karyokinetic spindle and subsequently their gradual elimination.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000599699",,"0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.18753","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/599699","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","centromere||chromosomeelimination||genome dominance||interspecifichybrid||kinetochore||NDC80||NNF1||pollenmeiosis","Both male and female meiosis contribute to non‐Mendelian inheritance of parental chromosomes in interspecific plant hybrids (Lolium x Festuca)","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-02-21T09:13:50Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85147589184",,"000931295400001","New Phytol.","2","New Phytologist","238","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Accordingly, we developed an approach that combines ecological data on all types of ecosystem services with information describing the ecosystem service priorities of multiple stakeholder groups. We identified landscape scenarios that maximize the overall ecosystem service supply relative to demand (multifunctionality) for the whole stakeholder community, while maintaining equitable distribution of ecosystem benefits across groups. For rural Germany, we show that the current landscape composition is close to optimal, and that most scenarios that maximize one or a few services increase inequities. This indicates that most major land-use changes proposed for Europe (for example, large-scale tree planting or agricultural intensification) could lead to social conflicts and reduced multifunctionality. However, moderate gains in multifunctionality (4%) and equity (1%) can be achieved by expanding and diversifying forests and de-intensifying grasslands. More broadly, our approach provides a tool for quantifying the social impact of land-use changes and could be applied widely to identify sustainable land-use transformations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000596814",,"2398-9629",,"10.1038/s41893-022-01045-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/596814","en","Nature",,,,"Landscape management strategies for multifunctionality and social equity","Journal Article","Embargoed",,,,"2023-02-02T14:21:57Z","2023-07-17",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85146270467",,"000914416100001","Nat Sustain","4","Nature Sustainability","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Wint., is the most important fungal disease in many growing areas of Malus × domestica Borkh. Strong monogenic resistances originating from wild Malus species build an important basis for resistance breeding. Most of these scab resistances have been mapped, and associated molecular markers are available. Within the VINQUEST network (www.vinquest.ch), differential hosts carrying single resistance genes (R-genes) are monitored for resistance breakdown around the world. To date, most commercially available scab resistant varieties carry the R-gene Rvi6 (Vf) originating from Malus floribunda 821. However, the pathogen has overcome Rvi6 in many areas of Europe and the U.S.A. Therefore, new varieties with durable resistance are urgently needed. Breeding for durable disease resistance against apple scab has been a major goal in the Agroscope apple-breeding program for almost 40 years. For effective resistance breeding, methods of stacking multiple R-genes against apple scab were implemented, such as screening with artificial scab inoculation and accelerated introgression cycle, complemented by the use of marker-assisted selection (MAS). MAS proved to be a useful and very efficient tool to select genotypes with stacked R-genes against apple scab. Recently, MAS in apple has progressed from using sequence-characterized amplified regions (SCAR) and simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers to more cost-effective single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. As part of the European FP7 Fruit Breedomics project, SNP markers for different scab resistances (Rvi2, Rvi4, Rvi5, Rvi6, Rvi11, Rvi12, Rvi15) were identified, and an outsourced genotyping pipeline was established. Since then, the marker set has been fine-tuned and extended to resistances against other diseases (e.g., fire blight, powdery mildew) and fruit quality traits.

To assess whether unintended effects occurred during the generation of the line, a field trial was conducted over five years with trees of the cisgenic line C44.4.146 and multiple control cultivars. A total of 44 tree- and fruit-related traits were assessed and compared over several years in the field.

The effect of a diet amended with leaf-powder of the different genotypes included in the field trial on the fitness of the arthropod decomposer species Drosophila melanogaster, and Folsomia candida was also investigated. The leaf material of C44.4.146 did not adversely affect the survival, growth, and fecundity of the two arthropods.

Here we investigated the first cisgenic fire blight resistant apple line C44.4.146 carrying the FB_MR5 resistance gene from Malus × robusta 5 for potential unintended effects. The leaf proteome and metabolome of field-grown plants of C44.4.146 were compared with its wild type ‘Gala Galaxy’ and placed into the context of natural variation found in selected mutants of ‘Gala’. For this, pooled leaf material of the same genotypes was used for protein and metabolite extractions and analysis using chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. The abundance of 3762 proteins and 827 metabolite features were compared. Between C44.4.146 and the untransformed wild type, the abundance of seven proteins and four metabolite features showed statistically significant differences. However, none of these abundances were statistically different between C44.4.146 and at least one of the other genotypes.

These factors require apple breeding to be flexible, fast, and efficient. Genomic selection has proven useful to increase the efficiency of selection for suitable traits. Three breeding institutions in Switzerland (Agroscope, Poma Culta, Lubera) united efforts to implement genomic selection in their breeding programs. This implementation is built upon the genomic and phenotypic data set of the multi-national apple reference population (apple REFPOP) that was previously deemed suitable for the application of genomic selection in breeding. The 534 apple REFPOP genotypes (269 accessions and 265 progeny from 27 parental combinations) were combined with 547 genotypes of three Swiss breeding programs (340 progeny from 23 parental combinations and 207 advanced selections). The available SNP data set of the apple REFPOP was complemented with genomic data of the three programs obtained using the Illumina Infinium® 20K SNP genotyping array. To study the impact of a temporal overlap between phenotypic information available for the apple REFPOP from years 2018-2020 and phenotypes of the Swiss breeding germplasm collected in 2021, the Swiss copy of the apple REFPOP was phenotyped again in 2021. These phenotypic data were connected to the genomic data set in a genomic prediction analysis, with progeny of the breeding programs as validation set and the training set composed of: i) the apple REFPOP with phenotypes from 2018 to 2020, ii) the apple REFPOP with phenotypes from 2018 to 2021, iii) and iv) the apple REFPOP (2018-2021) and advanced selections or progeny, and v) a set based on all available genotypes and phenotypes.

We aimed to evaluate and quantify the associations between biomarkers commonly suggested in the literature and %GB in individual cows as a hypothesis-generating stage for the prospective establishment of accurate %GB prediction models. Consumers and governments financially encourage sustainable, local milk production making grass-based feeding, in grassland-dominated regions, of major interest. Milk from grassland-fed cows differs from that of other feeding systems by inferential fatty acids (FA), β-carotene content and yellow color; however, these biomarkers have not been evaluated together for their association with %GB. Using approved methods of parametric regression analysis, gas chromatography (GC), mid-infrared spectra (MIR) and color spectroscopy, we aimed to develop a first step towards an easy-to-implement, cost-effective milk-based control to estimate %GB in dairy cow diets. The underlying database was generated with 24 cows each fed one of 24 different diets gradually increasing in grass silage and decreasing in corn silage. Our results indicate that GC-measured α-linolenic acid, total n-3 FA and the n-6:n-3 ratio, MIR-estimated PUFA and milk red-green color index a* are robust milk biomarkers for constructing accurate prediction models to determine %GB. Based on simplified regression analysis, diets containing 75% GB should contain ≥ 0.669 and 0.852 g α-linolenic acid and total n-3 FA per 100 g total FA, respectively, and an n-6:n-3 FA ratio of < 2.02 measured with GC; estimated with MIR, polyunsaturated FA should be ≥ 3.13 g/100 g total FA. β-carotene was not a good predictor for estimating %GB. Unexpectedly, the milk became greener with increasing %GB (negative a* values, ‒6.416 for 75% GB), suggesting the red-green color index, not yellow-blue, as a suitable biomarker.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000601619",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0282515","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/601619","en","PLOS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Evaluation and quantification of associations between commonly suggested milk biomarkers and the proportion of grassland-based feeds in the diets of dairy cows","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-03-06T07:43:45Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85149308930",,"000943271500019","PLoS ONE","3","PLoS ONE","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In a 6 × 6 Latin Square arrangement, six multiparous Holstein cows (milk yield: 36.6 ± 3.9 kg/d; 70 ± 13 d in milk) were assigned randomly to six treatments. The experiment included a 14-d adaptation and a 7-d data collection period, where intake, milk yield, and composition were recorded daily and excreta were collected. Cows had ad libitum access to one of six total mixed rations containing (dry matter [DM] basis) 750 g/kg DM silage. The silages were rich in either sainfoin (180 g/kg CP of DM), ryegrass (118 g/kg CP) or clover (220 g/kg CP). Each silage was supplemented with 20 g/kg DM of Acacia mearnsii extract or straw meal. The effects on N partitioning, ruminal volatile fatty acids (VFA) and microbiota, and NH3 volatilization from slurry reconstituted from fresh urine and feces were determined. The sainfoin-based diet reduced the apparent digestibility of organic matter, acid detergent fiber, and N compared with the ryegrass- and clover-based diets (P < 0.001). Acacia reduced the DM intake (P < 0.05) and apparent digestibility of organic matter and N across all silage types (P < 0.01). The digestibility of neutral detergent fiber was reduced with sainfoin, and ryegrass with Acacia (Silage × Acacia interaction P < 0.05). Acacia reduced the ruminal acetate proportion (P < 0.05) but did not affect ruminal propionate and n-butyrate or the microbiota composition. With ryegrass, the rumen fluid had lower acetate (P < 0.001) and greater n-butyrate proportions (P < 0.01) compared to sainfoin and clover, lower propionate proportions as compared with sainfoin (P < 0.05), and the lowest blood urea N concentration (P < 0.001). Acacia reduced energy-corrected milk yield (P < 0.05). Milk protein content was reduced with the sainfoin diet (P < 0.05). Sainfoin (compared to clover) and Acacia supplementation shifted the N excretion from urine to feces and decreased urinary urea N excretion and NH3 volatilization from the slurry (P < 0.05). The effects of the two tannin sources were widely additive in mitigating urinary urea N and NH3 volatilization.

Compared with typical maize silage/concentrate diets, grassland-based diets are associated with impaired nitrogen (N) and energy utilisation because of the comparably lower energy and higher CP content of these feeds. However, quantitative studies concerning the effects of increased dietary proportions of grassland-derived feeds on N and energy losses and utilisation and on methane emissions are missing and the compensation potential of using a limited proportion of an energy-rich forage is unknown. Therefore, we tested five diets with varying types and proportions of forage and concentrate. Three diets consisted of grass silage, maize silage, and concentrate in ratios of, g/kg DM, 100:600:300 (G100; control), 300:500:200 (G300), and 500:300:200 (G500), respectively. Two diets were composed of grass silage, corn-cob mix (CCM), and concentrate in ratios of, g/kg DM, 500:300:200 (G500CCM), and 750:150:100 (G750CCM), respectively. A high-protein concentrate (270 g CP/kg DM) was fed to G100, whereas a low-protein concentrate (140 g CP/kg DM) was used in the remaining diets. Diets were fed throughout the entire fattening period to groups of six Limousincrossbred bulls each. When weighing 246 ± 18 kg, each animal underwent a 7-day total daily faeces and urine collection, which was followed by measuring methane emissions in respiration chambers for 48 h. Total DM intake was similar across all diets, whereas the N intake varied (P < 0.05). Urinary N loss (g/day) was the highest for G750CCM (28.2) and G100 (26.6) and lowest for G500CCM (15.2) and G300 (16.9) (P < 0.001). Energy utilisation was comparable among all groups. Metabolisable energy intake decreased numerically only with increasing proportions of grass silage in the diet. Substituting maize silage with CCM counteracted the loss in metabolisable energy intake. Absolute methane emissions were not different across the groups, but methane emission intensity (mg/g body protein retention) varied (P < 0.05), being numerically lower for G100 (349) and G500CCM (401) compared with the other groups (488 on average). In conclusion, the results show that the grass silage proportion in beef cattle diets can be substantially increased when strategically combined with energy-dense forages, such as CCM. This also limits the need for concentrate and additional protein sources; in addition, the associated urinary N emissions, which are potentially noxious to the environment, are avoided.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000600207",,"1751-7311||1751-732X",,"10.1016/j.animal.2023.100722","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/600207","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Forage||Grassland||Growing bulls||Sustainable production systems||Urinary nitrogen","Nitrogen and energy losses and methane emissions from beef cattle fed diets with gradual replacement of maize silage and concentrate with grass silage and corn-cob mix","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-02-23T09:58:28Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85148675595",,"000944874500001",,"3","Animal","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

An enhanced understanding of their N transformation processes in soil under field conditions is necessary to better synchronize N availability and crop N demand. 15N labeled cattle slurry, produced by feeding a heifer with 15N labeled ryegrass hay, was used in an on-farm trial on two neighboring fields, cropped with maize or grass-clover, in order to assess crop N uptake and N dynamics in the topsoil. Recovery of applied total N in plant biomass was higher for mineral fertilizer (Min) (45–48%) than for slurry (Slu) (17–22%) when applied at the same rate of mineral N. Also, N derived from fertilizer in plant biomass was higher for Min than for Slu, due to both greater NH3 emissions and greater initial immobilization of slurry N. Despite initial differences between the two in the relative distribution of residual fertilizer N in soil N pools, already in the following spring the majority (77–89%) of residual N from both fertilizers was found in the non-microbial organic N pool. Of the applied total N, 18–26% remained in the topsoil after the first winter for Min, compared to 32–52% for Slu. Thus, the proportion of fertilizer N not taken up by the first crop after application, enters the soil organic N pool and must be re-mineralized to become plant available.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000544302",,"1385-1314||1573-0867",,"10.1007/s10705-022-10205-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/544302","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","15N labeling||on-farm trial||Farmer’s practice||N use efficiency||Soil N pools","Similar distribution of 15N labeled cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer in soil after one year","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-29T06:35:27Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85128902138",,"000788448600001","Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst","2","Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems","125","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The higher spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 compared to Landsat allows for satellite-based crop yield mapping even in relatively small scaled agricultural settings such as found in Switzerland and other central European regions. In this study, five years (2017–2021) of cereal crop yield data from a combine harvester were used to model crop yield within-field, on a spatial scale corresponding to the Sentinel-2 pixel level. Three established methods from literature using (i-ii) spectral indices and (iii) raw satellite reflectance as well as (iv) a recurrent neural network (RNN) were chosen for analysis. Although the RNN approach did not outperform the other methods, it was more efficient because of the comparatively simple end-to-end training of the model, resulting in much less time spent on data cleaning and feature extraction needed for spectral index time series analysis. The RNN was also able to discriminate cloudy data by itself, reaching similar performance levels as if using pre-processed, cloud-free data. Modelling was performed on individual years, all years combined and on unseen years using leave-one-year-out cross-validation. The models performed best when using data from all years (R2 up to 0.88, relative RMSE up to 10.49 %) and showed poor performance when predicting on unseen data years, especially for years with previously unknown weather patterns. This highlights the importance of yearly model calibration and the need for continuous data collection enabling long time series for future crop yield models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000595228",,"0378-4290||1872-6852",,"10.1016/j.fcr.2023.108824","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/595228","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sentinel-2||Crop yield||Spectral indices||Time series analysis||Random forest||Recurrent neural network||Precision farming||Cereals","Pixel-based yield mapping and prediction from Sentinel-2 using spectral indices and neural networks","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-27T04:33:47Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"PhenomEn","198091","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","COST",,"85146471467",,"000924238100001","Field crops res.",,"Field Crops Research","292","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the fate of nitrogen (N) from manure in the soil beyond the year of application remains poorly understood. The aim of this research was to understand the residual N fertiliser value of mineral fertiliser (Min) and cattle slurry (Slu) in relation to the partitioning of N from the fertilisers in different soil physical fractions. To this end, we characterised the fate of 15N-labelled Min and Slu in soil organic matter (SOM) physical fractions two years after field application and related it to plant uptake of residual N. A secondary objective was to compare two fractionation methods with respect to accuracy and easiness, namely a combined density and particle size fractionation, separating five fractions, and a simple particle size fractionation, separating two fractions. All fractions were analysed for 15N abundance. The residual N fertiliser value was determined as the uptake of 15N by ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) during 6 weeks. Furthermore, we deduced the source of 15N taken up by the plants from changes in the percentage of N derived from labelled fertilisers in each of the SOM physical fractions obtained by simple size fractionation before and after the pot experiment. Two years after application, most 15N was found in the fractions <20 μm, for both fractionation methods, i.e. in the mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM). The 15N recovery in these fractions in percent of the quantity of 15N originally applied as fertiliser tended to be higher for Slu (density-size fractionation: 19.8 ± 6.6%; simple size fractionation: 25.1 ± 6.6%) than for Min (density-size fractionation: 12.0 ± 2.1%; simple size fractionation: 16.8 ± 2.6%). Irrespective of the fertiliser type, about 2% of applied 15N was available to ryegrass plants two years after application. Out of these 2%, most 15N in the plants originated from MAOM, suggesting that the availability of the N stored in MAOM could be larger than previously thought. This finding is in line with the emerging view that MAOM is a dynamic fraction that plays an important role in the N cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000589505",,"0038-0717||1879-3428",,"10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108908","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589505","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","15N-labelled amendments||Soil organic matter||Physical fractions||Residual N value||Cattle slurry","Residual nitrogen from slurry and mineral fertiliser two years after application: Fractionation and plant availability","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-31T04:13:27Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85144308033",,"000912497100001","Soil biol. biochem.",,"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","177","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, when leaks exist, methane is released into the atmosphere, leading to a dramatic increase in the carbon footprint of natural gas, as methane is a much stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Therefore, we conducted a detailed study of methane emissions from gas-powered end-use appliances and then compared their climate impacts with those of electricity-powered appliances. We used the Munich Oktoberfest as a case study and then extended the study to 25 major natural gas consuming countries. This showed that electricity has been the more climate-friendly energy source at Oktoberfest since 2005, due to the extensive use of renewable electricity at the festival and the presence of methane emissions, particularly caused by the incomplete combustion of natural gas in cooking and heating appliances. By contrast, at the global level, our study shows that natural gas still produces lower end-use carbon emissions than electricity in 18 of the 25 countries studied. However, as the share of renewable energy in the electricity mix steadily increases in most countries, the carbon footprint of electricity will be lower than that of natural gas in these countries in the near future. These findings from our comparison of the total carbon emissions of electric and gas-powered end-use appliances can help inform the debate on how to effectively address climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000595543",,"2328-4277",,"10.1029/2022EF002877","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/595543","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate change||methane||carbon dioxide||emissions||carbon mitigation||global","Climate Impact Comparison of Electric and Gas-Powered End-User Appliances","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-29T07:28:46Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Forest Vulnerability to Extreme and Repeated Climatic Stress (FEVER)","ETH-27 19-1","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,"85148882398",,,,"2","Earth's Future","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Integrated soil fertility management tackles both by the combined application of mineral fertilizers and organic resource inputs but few studies examined its‘ long-term effectiveness. Objective: To address this knowledge gap, this study analysed maize yield trends in four long-term (31–37 cropping seasons) field experiments in Kenya with contrasting soil textures and under different climates. Methods: All sites had two maize cropping seasons per year, received a base P and K fertilization and tested combinations of organic resource addition (1.2 and 4 t C ha-1 yr-1 ranging from farmyard manure, to high-quality Tithonia diversifolia and Calliandra calothyrsus material to low-quality saw dust), combined with (+N) and without (-N) mineral N fertilizer (120 kg N ha-1 season-1). General maize yield trends across sites and site specific trends were analyzed. Results: Across sites, the no-input control experienced significant average maize yield reductions of 50 kg ha-1 yr-1 over the study period. In contrast, the treatment with farmyard manure +N maintained yields at both 1.2 and 4 t C ha-1 yr-1. High initial yields following additions of Tithonia and Calliandra, reduced over time. Assessment by site showed site specificity of maize yields and yield trends. For example, the two climatically favorable sites in western Kenya experienced yield gains with high quality organic resources at 4 t C ha-1 yr-1, leading to yields of up to 8 t ha-1 per season, while sites in central Kenya experienced yield losses, leading to 3.5 t ha-1 per season. Yield site specificity for ± mineral N treatments was stonger than for organic resource treatments, e.g. the clayey site in central Kenya in the end showed no yield differences between ± N, except for the 1.2 t C ha-1 yr-1 farmyard manure treatment. Yet, farmyard manure plus mineral N consistently achieved highest yields of all organic resource treatments at all sites and farmyard manure addition at 1.2 t C ha-1 yr-1 (about 5 t dry matter) was the most N-efficient treatment. Conclusions: At realistic application rates, maize yield in integrated soil fertility management is best sustained by a combined application of farmyard manure and mineral N. Implications: Mixed crop-livestock systems and a combined manure and mineral N application are key ingredients for sustained productivity of smallholder systems in sub-Saharan Africa.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000589507",,"0378-4290||1872-6852",,"10.1016/j.fcr.2022.108788","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589507","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ISFM||Maize yield potential||Residue quality||Food security||Sustainable intensification","Combining manure with mineral N fertilizer maintains maize yields: Evidence from four long-term experiments in Kenya","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-31T04:13:27Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Integrated soil fertility management for climate smart intensification of maize-based cropping systems in Kenya","172940||172940","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT||Projekte MINT",,"85144247460",,"000912533400001","Field crops res.",,"Field Crops Research","291","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we address this gap using a comprehensive dataset describing the supply of 16 cultural, regulating and provisioning ecosystem services in 150 European agricultural grassland plots, and detailed multi-scale data on land use and plant diversity. After controlling for land-use and abiotic factors, we show that both plot-level and surrounding plant diversity play an important role in the supply of cultural and aboveground regulating ecosystem services. In contrast, provisioning and belowground regulating ecosystem services are more strongly driven by field-level management and abiotic factors. Structural equation models revealed that surrounding plant diversity promotes ecosystem services both directly, probably by fostering the spill-over of ecosystem service providers from surrounding areas, and indirectly, by maintaining plot-level diversity. By influencing the ecosystem services that local stakeholders prioritized, biodiversity at different scales was also shown to positively influence a wide range of stakeholder groups. These results provide a comprehensive picture of which ecosystem services rely most strongly on biodiversity, and the respective scales of biodiversity that drive these services. This key information is required for the upscaling of biodiversity–ecosystem service relationships, and the informed management of biodiversity within agricultural landscapes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000580692",,"2397-334X",,"10.1038/s41559-022-01918-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580692","en","Nature","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"The supply of multiple ecosystem services requires biodiversity across spatial scales","Journal Article","Embargoed",,,,"2022-11-15T08:17:01Z","2023-05-15",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85141957635",,"000883247400001","Nat Ecol Evol","2","Nature Ecology & Evolution","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, as already available for dairy and beef cattle, empirical models are needed to predict CH4 emissions from sheep for accounting purposes. The objectives of this study were to: 1) collate an intercontinental database of enteric CH4 emissions from individual sheep; 2) identify the key variables for predicting enteric sheep CH4 absolute production (g/d per animal) and yield [g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)] and their respective relationships; and 3) develop and cross-validate global equations as well as the potential need for age-, diet-, or climatic region-specific equations. The refined intercontinental database included 2,135 individual animal data from 13 countries. Linear CH4 prediction models were developed by incrementally adding variables. A universal CH4 production equation using only DMI led to a root mean square prediction error (RMSPE, % of observed mean) of 25.4% and an RMSPE-standard deviation ratio (RSR) of 0.69. Universal equations that, in addition to DMI, also included body weight (DMI + BW), and organic matter digestibility (DMI + OMD + BW) improved the prediction performance further (RSR, 0.62 and 0.60), whereas diet composition variables had negligible effects. These universal equations had lower prediction error than the extant IPCC 2019 equations. Developing age-specific models for adult sheep (>1-year-old) including DMI alone (RSR = 0.66) or in combination with rumen propionate molar proportion (for research of more refined purposes) substantially improved prediction performance (RSR = 0.57) on a smaller dataset. On the contrary, for young sheep (<1-year-old), the universal models could be applied, instead of age-specific models, if DMI and BW were included. Universal models showed similar prediction performances to the diet- and region-specific models. However, optimal prediction equations led to different regression coefficients (i.e. intercepts and slopes) for universal, age-specific, diet-specific, and region-specific models with predictive implications. Equations for CH4 yield led to low prediction performances, with DMI being negatively and BW and OMD positively correlated with CH4 yield. In conclusion, predicting sheep CH4 production requires information on DMI and prediction accuracy will improve national and global inventories if separate equations for young and adult sheep are used with the additional variables BW, OMD and rumen propionate proportion. Appropriate universal equations can be used to predict CH4 production from sheep across different diets and climatic conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000588007",,"0959-6526",,"10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135523","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588007","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Age||Diet composition||Climatic regions||Prediction models||Rumen fermentation","Prediction of enteric methane emissions by sheep using an intercontinental database","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-19T07:41:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85144053697",,"000906604800001","J Cleaner Prod.",,"Journal of Cleaner Production","384","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Less is known about the impact of past climate change on atmospheric Hg deposition and cycling, and whether Hg isotopes covary with past climate. Here, we investigate Hg concentration and Hg isotope signatures in a 6600-year-old ombrotrophic peat record from Amsterdam Island (AMS, 37.8oS), and in modern rainfall and gaseous elemental Hg (Hg0) samples. Results show that Holocene atmospheric Hg deposition and plant Hg uptake covary with dust deposition, and are both lower under a high humidity regime associated with enhanced Southern Westerly Winds (SWW). Modern AMS gaseous Hg0 and rainfall HgII isotope signatures are similar to those in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Holocene peat Δ199Hg and Δ200Hg are significantly correlated (R2 = 0.67, P < 0.001, n = 58), consistently oscillating between the modern Hg0 and rainfall HgII end-members. Peat Δ200Hg and Δ199Hg provide evidence of plant uptake of Hg0 as the dominant pathway of Hg deposition to AMS peatland, with some exceptions during humid periods. In contrast to NH archives generally documenting a modern increase in Δ199Hg, recent peat layers (post-1900CE) from AMS show the lowest Δ199Hg in the peat profile (-0.42 ± 0.27 ‰, 1σ, n = 8). This potentially reflects changes in the isotopic composition of the SH atmospheric Hg pool in response to industrial emissions, including associated changes in atmospheric Hg chemistry, and/or changes in peat soil Hg mobility. We further find that the oscillations of Hg isotopes are consistent with established Holocene climate variability from dust proxies. We suggest peat Hg isotope records might be a valid rainfall indicator.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583105",,"0016-7037||1872-9533",,"10.1016/j.gca.2022.11.024","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583105","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Hg stable isotopes||Southern Hemisphere||Peat||Rain||Hg deposition","A peat core Hg stable isotope reconstruction of Holocene atmospheric Hg deposition at Amsterdam Island (37.8°S)","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-25T11:29:19Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85143535677",,"000907006200005","Geochim.

Previous chamber and laboratory experiments investigated air–leaf water exchange during dew deposition, but overlooked the importance of radiative cooling on air–leaf water exchange because the chamber is a heat trap, preventing radiative cooling. To complement these previous studies, we conducted a field study, in which we investigated the effect of radiatively-induced NRW inputs on leaf water isotope signals and air–leaf water exchange in a temperate grassland during the dry-hot summers of 2018 and 2019. We carried out field measurements of the isotope composition of atmospheric water vapor, NRW droplets on foliage, leaf water, xylem water of root crown, and soil water, combined with meteorological and plant physiological measurements. We combined radiation measurements with thermal imaging to estimate leaf temperatures using different methods, and computed the corresponding leaf conductance and air–leaf water exchange. Our results indicate that radiative cooling and leaf wetting induced a switch of direction in the net water vapor exchange from leaf-to-air to air-to-leaf. The leaf conductance and air–leaf water exchange varied by species due to the species-specific biophysical controls. Our results highlight the ecological relevance of radiative cooling and leaf wetting in natural temperate grasslands, a process which is expected to influence land surface water budgets and may impact plant survival in many regions in a drier climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583436",,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109256","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583436","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Dew and fog||Radiative cooling||Leaf wetting||Leaf temperature||Stable isotopes||Dry and hot summer","The role of radiative cooling and leaf wetting in air–leaf water exchange during dew and radiation fog events in a temperate grassland","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-28T11:20:24Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The importance of fog and dew for Swiss grasslands today and in the future (Acronym: IFDewS)","175733","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85142741602",,,"Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","328","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Co-occurring with species diversity is the diversity of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs). So far, their estimated number is more than 200 000 compounds, which are not directly involved in plant growth and development but play important roles in helping plants handle their environment including the mediation of plant-insect interactions. Here, we use plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a key olfactory communication channel that mediates plant-insect interactions, as a showcase of PSMs. In spite of the cumulative knowledge of the functional, ecological, and microevolutionary roles of VOCs, we still lack a macroevolutionary understanding of how they evolved with plant-insect interactions and contributed to species diversity throughout the long coevolutionary history of plants and insects. We first review the literature to summarize the current state-of-the-art research on this topic. We then present various relevant types of phylogenetic methods suitable to answer macroevolutionary questions on plant VOCs and suggest future directions for employing phylogenetic approaches in studying plant VOCs and plant-insect interactions. Overall, we found that current studies in this field are still very limited in their macroevolutionary perspective. Nevertheless, with the fast-growing development of metabolome analysis techniques and phylogenetic methods, it is becoming increasingly feasible to integrate the advances of these two areas. We highlight promising approaches to generate new testable hypotheses and gain a mechanistic understanding of the macroevolutionary roles of chemical communication in plant-insect interactions.",,,,,,"10.1111/jse.12933","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590320","en","Wiley",,,"coevolution||herbivore||macroevolution||phylogenetic methods||plant-insect interaction||pollinator||volatile organic compounds","Plant scent and plant-insect interactions-Review and outlook from a macroevolutionary perspective","Review Article","Metadata only",,,,"2023-01-05T05:11:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Deciphering the chemical language between plants and insects in ecological communities||RESPONSE - to society and policy needs through plant, food and energy sciences","193237||847585","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","PRIMA||H2020",,,,"000900956400001",,,"Journal of Systematics and Evolution",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, we investigated the Porg composition in different SOM fractions of a Gleysol soil using the Humeomics sequential chemical fractionation (SCF) procedure combined with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In summary, SCF procedure with subsequent NaOH-EDTA extraction of the soil residue extracted a total of 1769 mg P/kgsoil compared to 1682 mg P/kgsoil of a single-step NaOH-EDTA extraction. Approximately 38 % of the extracted Porg was present in the form of the unresolved Porg pool, which was represented by one or two underlying broad signals in the phosphomonoester region of solution 31P NMR spectra. The SCF revealed that phosphomonoesters were recovered in each fraction: 47 % of the unresolved phosphomonoesters were associated with the SOM fraction released by breaking ester bonds (40 %) and ether bonds (7 %), whereas about 30 % of this unresolved Porg pool appeared in the SOM fraction closely associated with the soil mineral phase. Furthermore, the extractability of inositol phosphates (IP) was increased from 312 mg P/kgsoil to 534 mg P/kgsoil (factor 1.7) using the SCF procedure compared to a single-step NaOH-EDTA extraction. Previous studies have reported the presence of IP in molecular size fractions greater than 10 kDa. Our findings on the removal of IP with the fractionation of the SOM could explain the presence of IP in these large associations. We demonstrate that major pools of Porg are closely associated with SOM structures, comprising a diverse array of chemical species and bonding types. These results forward our understanding of Porg stabilisation, P transformation, and P cycling in terrestrial ecosystems towards an association point of view.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000578776",,"0016-7061||1872-6259",,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.116227","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/578776","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Soil organic matter||Solution31P NMR spectroscopy||Sequential chemical fractionation||Phosphomonoester||Inositol phosphate||Organic phosphorus","Phosphorus species in sequentially extracted soil organic matter fractions","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-01T04:25:05Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Identifying the chemical nature of organic phosphorus in soil extracts with increasing molecular weight","169256","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85140437690",,"000882205000004","Geoderma",,"Geoderma","429","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Self-defined criteria, transparency, trust, and accessibility have made PGS an attractive alternative to exogenous certification in local markets in over 70 countries. There is also increasing interest in the possibilities for participatory certification in international trade for family farm-based products such as cocoa or coffee. Bolivia's PGS was established in 2012. By 2017, the country ranked second (after India) in number of PGS farmers. Since 2019, however, its numbers are declining. Visiting six PGS initiatives, we interviewed 38 persons from production, processing, distribution, support networks, and policymaking on the current situation of PGS in Bolivia; its challenges; its prospects in local, national, and international trade; and the role of Bolivia's governmental PGS support. While PGS certification in Bolivia faces challenges - including high fees, weak consumer demand, and insufficient links to broader value chains - it displays strong potential to make locally managed sustainability certification more accessible. We recommend that decision-makers ensure accessibility and help promote PGS with consumers. Importing countries could support PGS, in particular by incentivizing access of PGS-certified products to their national markets by recognizing them as organic via peer-to-peer certification.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576120",,"2168-3565||2168-3573",,"10.1080/21683565.2022.2131692","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576120","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sustainable trade||participatory certification||food sovereignty||Bolivia||Switzerland","""First we eat and then we sell"": participatory guarantee systems for alternative sustainability certification of Bolivian agri-food products","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-17T03:03:40Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85139473774",,"000864767900001",,"1","Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems","47","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We report on a field study over four years in a plot of apple tress supplied with insect side nets and covered with hail nets that were closed from shortly before flowering to harvest. A reduced number of arthropods in general, and large bees in particular, were recorded inside the netted plot compared with outside. However, wild bees colonized the plot before the net was closed and built up populations inside. An additional experiment demonstrated that small bees were able to cross the hail net. While the nets were effective in excluding large bees as active pollen vectors, the proportion of small bees acting as such remained unquantified. Furthermore, a companion study showed occasional cross-pollination events through the netting.

Allogamous Poaceae species exhibit a unique gametophytic SI system controlled by two multi-allelic and independent loci, S and Z. Despite intense research efforts in the last decades, the genes that determine the initial recognition mechanism are yet to be identified. Here, we report the fine-mapping of the Z-locus in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and provide evidence that the pollen and stigma components are determined by two genes encoding DUF247 domain proteins (ZDUF247-I and ZDUF247-II) and the gene sZ, respectively. The pollen and stigma determinants are located side-by-side and were genetically linked in 10,245 individuals of two independent mapping populations segregating for Z. Moreover, they exhibited high allelic diversity as well as tissue-specific gene expression, matching the expected characteristics of SI determinants known from other systems. Revisiting the S-locus using the latest high-quality whole-genome assemblies revealed a similar gene composition and structure as found for Z, supporting the hypothesis of a duplicated origin of the two-locus SI system of grasses. Ultimately, comparative genomic analyses across a wide range of self-compatible and self-incompatible Poaceae species revealed that the absence of a functional copy of at least one of the six putative SI determinants is accompanied by a self-compatible phenotype. Our study provides new insights into the origin and evolution of the unique gametophytic SI system in one of the largest and economically most important plant families.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591993",,"0737-4038||1537-1719",,"10.1093/molbev/msac259","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591993","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","self-incompatability (SI)||Poaceae||perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)","Fine-Mapping and Comparative Genomic Analysis Reveal the Gene Composition at the S and Z Self-incompatibility Loci in Grasses","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-12T15:01:50Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Unravelling self-incompatibility in Poaceae species||FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS OF GRASS REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS","197708||138983","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,"85145955620",,"000910888400002","Mol Biol Evol","1","Molecular Biology and Evolution","40","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, appropriate dairy cow management may in fact be part of the climate solution when viewed as part of the biogenic carbon cycle. Accordingly, governments and consumers are encouraging more sustainable, locally produced, climate friendly dairy production that often includes grassland-based feeding. However, this system is presumed to result in greater methane emissions compared to corn silage- or concentrate-based diets. An increase in urine nitrogen, associated with increased ammonia and nitrous oxide emission potential, questions the environmental usefulness of this strategy pertaining to global warming. This study is the first to compare the effects of incremental increases of grass silage proportion on enteric methane production as well as N and energy losses in dairy cows. Twenty-four mid- to end-lactation dairy cows were each fed one of 24 different diets, from two different harvest years, gradually increasing in grassland-based feeds (grass silage and hay) from about 500 to 1000 g/kg and concomitantly decreasing in corn silage. Each cow underwent a 7-day total collection period and was housed for 48 h in respiration chambers. Incremental data were subjected to an approved parametric regression analysis approach. The dietary increase in grassland-based feeds did not impair milk yield, N and energy utilisation. Simplified regression equations revealed that, contrary to current assumptions, there was a decline in methane production from 373 to 303 g/day when increasing grassland-based feeds from 500 to 1000 g/kg diet, and there was a trend for a decline in emission intensity from 20.6 to 17.6 g/kg of energy-corrected milk. However, urine nitrogen emissions clearly increased even when related to nitrogen intake; the latter from 260 to 364 g/kg when increasing grassland-based feeds from 500 to 1000 g/kg. Methane and urine nitrogen emissions were not affected by year of harvest.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000536912",,"0931-2439||1439-0396",,"10.1111/jpn.13696","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/536912","en","Wiley-VCH","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","ammonia||cattle||grassland‐based feed||methanogenesis||nitrogen||protein","Effects of incremental increases in grass silage proportions from different harvest years on methane emissions, urinary nitrogen losses, and protein and energy utilisation in dairy cows","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-15T03:57:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85125566037",,"000764945900001","J.

Arable land currently covers 14 million km(2) globally, but little is known about the role of arable fields as potential nesting habitats and how agricultural management, such as tillage system, affects nesting. We quantified nest density and nesting incidence (plot-level nest presence/absence) of ground-nesting bees in 12 conventionally tilled and 13 no-till winter cereal fields in southwestern Switzerland. In each field, nests were quantified in eight belt transects at increasing distances from field edges within an area of 400 m(2), and vegetation cover and soil properties were measured at nest sites and sites without nests. Nest density ranged from 0 (32% of fields) to 16 nests (mean: 4.0 nests) per 400 m(2), corresponding to 0 to 400 nests ha(-1) (mean: 101 nests ha(-1)). Fifteen nesting species were captured. Nest density was not significantly different between tillage systems. Nest density declined exponentially with distance from the field edge. Nest density and incidence were positively related to proportion of bare ground. Nests occurred across a wide range of soil textures and tended to increase with soil bulk density and sand content. Moreover, nest density tended to increase with the proportion of and proximity to areas under agri-environment scheme in the surrounding landscape. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that arable fields, irrespective of tillage system, are used as nesting sites by various ground-nesting bee species, including important crop pollinators. The concentration of nests along field edges suggests that incentives to maintain small field sizes and to increase edge density have a great potential to support nesting of ground-nesting bees in agricultural landscapes. Moreover, measures to reduce crop cover, for example, through increased row spacing, offer a promising way to promote nesting opportunities in arable fields, in particular, if floral-rich agri-environment scheme areas are locally available. Further studies are needed to better understand to what extent tilled arable fields are suitable nesting habitats for ground-nesting bees or whether they act as ecological traps due to the adverse effects of tillage on bee offspring.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000580566",,"0021-8901||1365-2664",,"10.1111/1365-2664.14317","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580566","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","agri-environment schemes||biodiversity||habitat requirements||nesting ecology||pollinator conservation||soil disturbance||soil-nesting bees||tillage","Nesting of ground-nesting bees in arable fields is not associated with tillage system per se, but with distance to field edge, crop cover, soil and landscape context","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-10T13:51:32Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85141426960",,"000873860000001","J.

Low-altitude aerial imagery obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has shown significant potential for weed detection in crops. However, most studies focused on wide-spaced row crops such as maize and sunflower and evaluated proposed methods on single or few well-characterized experimental sites at specific points in time representing a limited range of application scenarios. This study evaluated the feasibility of weed detection in on-farm wheat fields characterized by a narrow row spacing, throughout the early and late developmental stages using UAV imagery and ground-based high-resolution imagery. Image data was obtained for nine sites, representing a wide range of management and pedoclimatic conditions. These sites can be seen as a representative sample of scenarios that would be encountered in practice. A high within- and across-site as well as temporal variation was observed for weed infestation levels and weed population species composition, highlighting the need for spatially and temporally resolved weed mapping. Image-based classification of vegetation objects as crop or weed plants was achieved with an accuracy of 0.88 and 0.72 in ground-based high-resolution images and UAV-based aerial images captured from an altitude of 10 m, respectively. The accuracy of pixel-wise, vegetation-index-based weed infestation estimation during the late vegetative stages varied strongly across sites. Our results highlight the critical importance of a high ground resolution for weed detection using object-based image analysis during the critical growth stages of wheat and of robust methods that are applicable across a range of scenarios. This suggested that future research aiming at a rapid implementation of site-specific weed management in wheat should focus on the development of ground-based systems. Yet, aerial monitoring of wheat stands during late developmental stages using currently available equipment offers significant potential for reducing weed pressure with site-specific weed control measures in the context of crop rotations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591868",,"0168-1699||1872-7107",,"10.1016/j.compag.2022.107558","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591868","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Precision agriculture||Object-based image analysis||OBIA||Vegetation index||Site-specific management||Remote sensing","On-farm evaluation of UAV-based aerial imagery for season-long weed monitoring under contrasting management and pedoclimatic conditions in wheat","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-12T08:12:59Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85145668148",,"000911206700001","Comput. electron. agric.",,"Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","204","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Fruits and vegetables have the highest share of post-harvest losses, with 37 to 50% loss. Preserving fruits and vegetables as dried materials is one of the oldest and most established techniques for increasing off-season availability. Nevertheless, drying is an energy-intensive process due to the high latent heat of evaporation required to evaporate water. In addition, the existing drying methods are energy-intensive and costly, hence adding a substantial cost for high-volume, low-value products such as fruits and vegetables. Therefore, researchers and industry are continuously looking for more sustainable alternative solutions. Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) drying is a promising yet not commercialized technology for drying different biomaterials, including fruits and vegetables. This drying technique has gained the attention of researchers due to its promising features, such as low energy consumption, operation at ambient temperature, and good preservation of the nutritional content and sensory appeal of dried fruits and vegetables. Despite all these promising characteristics, researchers and industry have not yet been able to implement EHD drying as an industrial-scale unit operation. Currently, we lack comprehensive knowledge about the physics behind the EHD drying process, its energy consumption and exergy situation, its impact on product quality, its scalability, and the associated costs and economics. These challenges hinder the initiation of the next steps that could finally lead to industrial implementation.  Scope and approach:  This thesis addresses these challenges by exploring the underlying physics of EHD drying, introducing an optimized and scalable EHD drying configuration, and benchmarking the performance of EHD drying against standard conventional drying methods. To this end, the three main tools of a scientific approach, namely theoretical development, modeling and simulation, and experimental verification, are employed. First, the main dehydration mechanisms in EHD drying are identified, modeled by theoretical formulation, and analyzed. Using these theoretical models, we quantified the relative contribution of each dehydration mechanism to the overall mass transfer and ranked them based on their contribution. Then, a physics-based model which couples EHD-generated airflow directly to the convective heat and mass transfer from the food was developed and solved using the finite element method. This validated model enabled us to design a scalable configuration in silico. Different arrangements of electrodes were tested in silico to improve the energy efficiency and drying kinetics of this scalable configuration. After selecting the configuration based on the simulation results, a lab-scale setup was developed to experimentally verify the scalability of this novel configuration. Moreover, the sustainability of the scalable EHD drying was evaluated by quantifying the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The performance indicators were selected based on the current concerns and interests of the food industry, namely, drying kinetics, energy consumption and environmental impact, product quality, and final product cost. By comparing the KPIs between EHD drying and conventional drying methods, this thesis provides a clear overview for industry, farmers, and other stakeholders about the advantages and disadvantages of using EHD drying as an alternative to their current technologies, such as hot-air, solar, and freeze-drying. Pre-treatment methods were also combined with EHD drying to improve the drying rate of the EHD drying process to satisfy the high throughput demand of the food processing industry.  Key findings and conclusions:  Theoretical modeling of the different EHD-driven dehydration mechanisms shows that convective dehydration by ionic wind is the dominant dehydration mechanism, with a contribution of about 93% to the overall water flux for a capillary-porous material. The contribution of all the other water transport mechanisms, such as transmembrane flow and electro-osmosis, is only 7%. These findings prove that EHD drying is a convective-based drying and convection should be the focus of any design and process optimization in the next steps. Our experiments and simulations showed that using a mesh collector instead of a plate collector and smart activation of wires in the mesh results in more energy-efficient and uniform dehydration than the conventional EHD drying configurations employed in previous studies. Using these insights, we introduced a new configuration for EHD drying. This novel design is independent of fruit loading density showing better scalability in terms of production capacity compared to the conventional EHD drying designs. In addition, it significantly improves the drying rate by more than 65% and energy consumption by more than 60% compared to the conventional configurations. We also observed a 50% decrease in drying time compared to control drying (i.e., natural convection) by operating EHD at only 1 W. Finally, this technology was benchmarked against other conventional drying methods by KPI evaluation. The results show that compared to the currently used drying methods for small to medium-scale drying, EHD was found to be a more exergy and energy-efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable alternative that can provide higher-quality dried products. Using pre-treatment methods is one of the options to increase the drying rate in EHD drying. Therefore, pulsed electric fields (PEF), ultrasound, and blanching pre-treatment methods were studied to explore their impacts on the drying rate. Results show that only PEF pre-treatment could significantly (by 39%, p<0.05) decrease the drying time. However, it resulted in a 26% higher browning index than the untreated EHD-dried apples, which is not appealing to consumers. Other quality attributes, such as antioxidant activity, total phenolics, and rehydration ratio, were not significantly affected by the applied pre-treatment methods. The obtained insights into the EHD drying process, and the significant improvements of the EHD dryer with our optimized and up-scalable design, together with the holistic evaluation of its performance, could provide the push needed to finally implement EHD drying as an industrial unit on a full scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000602513",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/602513","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Food processing||Industrial dryers||Sustainability||Ionic wind||Techno-economic analysis||Physics-based simulation||Multiphysics modeling||Dehydration processes||Pretreatment","Electrohydrodynamics for dehydration of soft, heat-sensitive biological materials","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::620 - Engineering & allied operations||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::600 - Technology (applied sciences)",,"2023-03-09T18:31:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"28950",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

DNA released into the environment by organisms, i.e., environmental DNA (eDNA), can be used to monitor biodiversity in a scalable manner if equipped with the appropriate tool. However, the collection of eDNA in terrestrial environments remains a challenge because of the many potential surfaces and sources that need to be surveyed and their limited accessibility. Here, we propose to survey biodiversity by sampling eDNA on the outer branches of tree canopies with an aerial robot. The drone combines a force-sensing cage with a haptic-based control strategy to establish and maintain contact with the upper surface of the branches. Surface eDNA is then collected using an adhesive surface integrated in the cage of the drone. We show that the drone can autonomously land on a variety of branches with stiffnesses between 1 and 103 newton/meter without prior knowledge of their structural stiffness and with robustness to linear and angular misalignments. Validation in the natural environment demonstrates that our method is successful in detecting animal species, including arthropods and vertebrates.

The microbiome is intricately linked with soil structure, such as aggregation and pore connectivity, because this structure regulates the flow of water, oxygen and nutrients through the system. In this Review, we summarize the key functions of soil microbiomes in agroecosystems, highlight the dependence of these functions on the structural integrity of the soil, and discuss how agricultural practices influence the link between soil structure and microbiome functioning. System-level agricultural management practices can induce structural alterations to the soil, thereby changing the microbial processes occurring at the microscale. These changes have large-scale consequences, such as soil erosion, reduced soil fertility and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable approaches such as integrated soil fertility management and integrated pest management seek to improve soil structure and enhance microbial biodiversity, but we lack a mechanistic understanding of how multifaceted decisions at the farm level shape these context-dependent small-scale processes in the long term. Future research needs to bridge the microscale and field scale to inform agricultural management decisions for building climate-smart, resource-efficient and stress-resilient agroecosystems, and to harness the soil microbiome as a nature-based solution for sustainable agriculture.",,,,"2662-138X",,"10.1038/s43017-022-00366-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/584651","en","Nature",,,"Agroecology||Agriculture||Element cycles||Environmental sciences||Microbial ecology","Soil structure and microbiome functions in agroecosystems","Review Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-12-04T03:54:04Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85142300143",,"000886442300001","Nat Rev Earth Environ","1","Nature Reviews Earth & Environment","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Descriptions of this form of delayed implantation occurring in the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) date back to the 19th century, and since then diapause has been discovered in over 130 mammalian species across different orders. Hitherto, the roe deer remains the only ungulate species known to display diapause and the molecular mechanisms of diapause in the roe deer are yet to be elucidated. Successful implantation requires a tight communication between the developing embryo and the endometrium to enable the coordination of maternal and embryonic processes. During diapause, these processes take place at a slower pace allowing a gradual syn- chronization of maternal and embryonic cues. In the roe deer, only few endometrial changes are known to occur. One of these changes is a gradual reduction of luminar epithelial cell height. Based on similarities to other spe- cies, these changes in cell morphology may be linked to co-occurring modifications of the cytoskeleton as well as the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). We employed an im- munohistochemical approach to gain insights into changes in the distribution of ECM components between early, late, and post-diapause uteri. While our findings confirmed the reduction of epithelial cell height, the selected ECM factors displayed only marginal changes in estimated quantity and localization. Major ECM remodelling events are there- fore unlikely to occur prior to implantation. While the endometrium during diapause appears relatively static, the roe deer blastocyst continuously grows during diapause. It was unclear whether this growth occurred due to an increase in blastocoel volume accompanied by an increase in cell size or due to active proliferation. Furthermore, it remained to be clarified whether this growth was restricted to the trophectoderm (TE) or was accompanied by growth of the inner cell mass (ICM). We assessed the expression of the proliferation marker KI67 by immunofluorescence and nuclear staining and imaged the stained blastocysts using light sheet microscopy. Thereby, we found that the number of total nuclei increased almost 100-fold between September and December. The relative increase of nuclei in the ICM was only slightly lower than in the TE, whereas the fraction of Ki67 positive cells appeared lower in the TE. iii We hypothesize that this could be explained by differences in the duration of individual cell cycle phases, with TE cell having a shorter G1 phase. In addition to proliferation, we also detected considerable morphological changes, indic- ative of ongoing differentiation and thus development within the ICM. While RNA-Seq data of embryos spanning the period of diapause and elongation was available, the first version of the roe deer transcriptome lacked annotations for a significant proportion of potential developmental marker genes. To assess developmental progression during di- apause in the roe deer, we thus developed an alternative assembly and annotation strat- egy and localized a selection of molecular markers using immunofluorescence. We con- firmed that endoderm formation occurs during diapause, while gastrulation and neurula- tion likely only occur upon elongation. The morphological changes within the ICM were reflected by correlating gene expression patterns, indicating that in the roe deer develop- mental processes are not halted during diapause. Our studies demonstrate that while the endometrial ECM remains unchanged, the em- bryo slowly continues to proliferate and to develop. The elements that regulate this drastic reduction of developmental pace and whether the embryonic development indeed occurs fully independent of maternal signalling cues remains to be elucidated.||Die embryonale Diapause bei Säugetieren beschreibt eine vorübergehende Verringerung der Proliferation und des Entwicklungsfortschritts, welche im Blastozystenstadium auftritt. Die ersten Beschreibungen dieser Art der Implantationsverzögerung im europäischen Reh (Capreolus capreolus) gehen bis ins 19. Jahrhundert zurück und wurde seit dem in über 130 Säugetierarten aus verschiedenen Ordnungen nachgewiesen. Das Reh ist bis heute die einzige Huftierart, bei welcher eine Diapause nachgewiesen wurde und die molekularen Mechanismen der Diapause im Reh sind nach wie vor unklar. Eine erfolgreiche Implantation beruht auf der Koordination von mütterlichen und embryo- nalen Prozessen und erfordert somit eine enge Kommunikation zwischen dem sich ent- wickelnden Embryo und dem Endometrium. Während der Diapause laufen diese Pro- zesse ab, was eine allmähliche Synchronisation von mütterlichen und embryonalen Sig- nalen ermöglicht. Beim Reh sind jedoch nur wenige Veränderungen im Endometrium während der Dia- pause bekannt. Eine dieser Veränderungen ist die Reduktion der Epithelzellhöhe. Auf Grund von Ähnlichkeiten zu anderen Spezies, könnten solche Veränderungen der Zell- morphologie mit gleichzeitig auftretenden Modifikationen des Zytoskeletts sowie der um- gebenden extrazellulären Matrix (ECM) in Verbindung stehen. Mithilfe der Immunhisto- chemie haben wir Einblicke in die Verteilung von ECM-Komponenten in Uteri von Rehen während der frühen und späten, sowie nach der Diapause gewonnen. Während unsere Ergebnisse die Verringerung der Epithelzellhöhe bestätigten, wiesen die ausgewählten ECM-Faktoren bezüglich der geschätzten Proteinmenge und ihrer Lokalisierung nur mar- ginale Veränderungen auf. Es ist daher unwahrscheinlich, dass größere Rekonstrukti- onsprozesse der ECM vor der Implantation stattfinden. Obwohl das Endometrium während der Diapause relativ statisch scheint, wächst die Blastozyste des Rehs während der Diapause kontinuierlich. Es war unklar, ob dieses Wachstum aufgrund eines Anstieges des Blastocoelvolumens und einer Zunahme der Zellgröße, oder aufgrund von aktiver Proliferation auftritt. Weiterhin blieb zu klären, ob dieses Wachstum auf das Trophektoderm (TE) beschränkt war oder ob auch die inneren Zellmasse (ICM) in dieser Zeit wächst. Wir haben die Expression des Proliferationsmar- kers KI67 mittels Immunfluoreszenz und Kernfärbung bestimmt und die gefärbten Blasto- zysten mittels „Light-Sheet“-Mikroskopie abgebildet. Dabei stellten wir fest, dass die An- zahl der Gesamtkerne zwischen September und Dezember fast 100-fach anstieg. Die v relative Zellkernzunahme war in der ICM nur geringfügig geringer als im TE, während der Anteil an Ki67-positiven Zellen im TE geringer erschien. Wir vermuten, dass dies durch Unterschiede in der Dauer der einzelnen Zellzyklusphasen erklärt werden könnte, wobei TE-Zellen im Vergleich zu ICM-Zellen eine kürzere G1-Phase aufweisen würden. Neben der Proliferation stellten wir auch erhebliche morphologische Veränderungen in- nerhalb der ICM fest, die auf eine fortschreitende Differenzierung und damit Entwicklung hindeuten. Obwohl bereits RNA-Seq-Daten von Embryonen während Diapause und Elongation verfügbar waren, fehlten in der ersten Version des Reh-Transkriptoms die An- notationen eines signifikanten Anteils potenzieller Marker-Gene der Embryonalentwick- lung. Um den Entwicklungsfortschritt während der Diapause beim Reh zu beurteilen, ha- ben wir daher eine alternative Assembly- und Annotationsstrategie entwickelt, sowie eine Auswahl von molekularen Markern mittels Immunfluoreszenz lokalisiert. Wir konnten be- stätigen, dass die Bildung des Endoderms während der Diapause erfolgt, während die Gastrulation und die Neurulation wahrscheinlich erst während der Elongation auftreten. Die morphologischen Veränderungen in der ICM wurden dabei in korrelierenden Genex- pressionsmustern widergespiegelt, was darauf hindeutet, dass Entwicklungsprozesse beim Reh während der Diapause fortlaufen und nicht angehalten werden. Unsere Studien zeigen, dass, die endometriale ECM unverändert bleibt, während der Embryo langsam weiter proliferiert und sich entwickelt. Künftige Studien werden darüber Aufschluss geben, welche Elemente diese drastische Verringerung des Entwicklungs- tempos regulieren und ob die embryonale Entwicklung tatsächlich völlig unabhängig von mütterlichen Signalen erfolgt.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000603551",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/603551","en","ETH Zurich",,,"DIAPAUSE (ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY)||EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT (ZOOLOGY)||Cell cycle and cell division||REPRODUCTION (ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY)||Roe deer||Differentiation processes","Continuity During Embryonic Diapause in the European Roe Deer (Capreolus Capreolus)","Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences",,"2023-03-16T11:28:41Z","2024-03-16",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Embryonic Diapause in roe deer: a model for deciphering the control of developmental velocity||Embryonic Diapause: pluripotency on hold?","159734||185026","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften","29004",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The study was designed to assess the effects of combined N and K inputs added as mineral fertilizers on biomass production, leaf area index (LAI), tuber yield, N and K uptake, fertilizer N recovery in soil/plant system, and N and K input-output balances. The fertilizer N recovery was studied using 15N labeled urea. Increased N inputs increased the LAI, N and K uptake via increased biomass production, and tuber yield. Potassium input alone had no effect on LAI or tuber yield. After two seasons, 4 to 10% of the fertilizer N applied on yam, exported with the roots and tubers while 5 to 9% recovered in the senescent shoots, 29 to 62% of fertilizer N recovered in the first 50 cm of the soil and 25 to 58% of l fertilizer N had not been recovered in plant and soil system. Results suggest that nutrient management in yam should consider: (i) the amount of fertilizer N and K should cover the amount of N and K exported with the tuber harvest and (ii) yam should be followed by a crop with a long and fine root system to take up N in the soil profile.",,,,"0190-4167||1532-4087",,"10.1080/01904167.2022.2068428","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/546101","en","Taylor & Francis",,,"Yam||N and K mineral fertilizers||leaf area index||fresh tuber yield||N and K uptake||15N labeled urea||N-fertilizer recovery","Influence of nitrogen and potassium inputs on plant biomass and nitrogen use efficiency of Dioscorea alata","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-05-10T02:56:00Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000789240800001","J.

Here, we investigated the influence of phylogeny on the δ2Hne of twig xylem cellulose and xylem water, as well as leaf sugars and leaf water, across 73 Northern Hemisphere tree and shrub species growing in a common garden. 2H fractionation in plant carbohydrates followed distinct phylogenetic patterns, with phylogeny reflected more in the δ2Hne of leaf sugars than in that of twig xylem cellulose. Phylogeny had no detectable influence on the δ2Hne of twig or leaf water, showing that biochemistry, not isotopic differences in plant water, caused the observed phylogenetic pattern in carbohydrates. Angiosperms were more 2H-enriched than gymnosperms, but substantial δ2Hne variations also occurred at the order, family, and species levels within both clades. Differences in the strength of the phylogenetic signals in δ2Hne of leaf sugars and twig xylem cellulose suggest that the original phylogenetic signal of autotrophic processes was altered by subsequent species-specific metabolism. Our results will help improve 2H fractionation models for plant carbohydrates and have important consequences for dendrochronological and ecophysiological studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000613367",,"0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.18976","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/613367","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cellulose||Hydrogen isotopes||Photosynthesis||Phylogeny||Plant physiology||Sugar||Tree rings","Hydrogen isotope fractionation in carbohydrates of leaves and xylem tissues follows distinct phylogenetic patterns: a common garden experiment with 73 tree and shrub species","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-05-24T06:37:26Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"New Phytol.",,"New Phytologist",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
