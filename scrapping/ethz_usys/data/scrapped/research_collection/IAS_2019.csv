The area of investigation in the Central Alps in Switzerland faced the second warmest summer since the beginning of measurements in 1864. As a consequence, agriculture suffered from considerable production losses. But how were forests affected by the hot summer? We analyzed stem growth data, measured by automated point dendrometers, from 50 trees across nine sites covering the four main Swiss tree species spruce (Picea abies), fir (Abies alba), beech (Fagus sylvatica) and oak (Quercus spp.) in the years 2014 (relatively wet and cool) and 2015 (hot and dry). Annual growth and environmental conditions were determined by, and related to, the growing period based on daily resolved growth data. Our multi-species approach revealed a wide range of responses. Radial growth of spruce was largely reduced during the hot summer 2015 for sites located below 1500 m a.s.l.. Growth of beech responded even positively at several sites on the Swiss Plateau. Fir and oak did not significantly deviate from their respective average growth rate. We conclude that one hot summer actually matters for stem growth, but its effect is not a priori negative. The timing of the heat wave is of highest importance. A relatively wet previous year, a wet spring and the relatively late occurrence of the heat wave in the wood growth period led to a less strong growth reduction than what could have been expected from agricultural plants. Endogenous effects like mast fruiting and legacy effects from past conditions are suggested to further play an important role for stem growth.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000387504",,"0013-9998",,"10.12854/erde-2019-420","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387504","en","Gesellschaft für Erdkunde zu Berlin","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","Climate change||Tree growth||Heat wave 2015||Swiss forests||Point dendrometer||Stem radius changes||Picea abies||Abies alba||Fagus sylvatica||Quercus spp","How did Swiss forest trees respond to the hot summer 2015?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-01-05T03:32:11Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"ICOS-CH: Integrated Carbon Observation System in Switzerland","148992","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,"85077634201",,"000503866300002","Erde","4","Die Erde","150","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the human oncofertility clinic, there is increasing interest in developing this technique as an alternative to ovarian cortical tissue transplantation and to preserve the fertility of prepubertal cancer patients. However, the effect of IFC and hormonal stimulation on DNA methylation in the oocyte is not fully known, and there is legitimate concern over epigenetic abnormalities that could be induced by procedures applied during assisted reproductive technology (ART).  Results In this study, we present the first genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in MII oocytes obtained after natural ovulation, after IFC and after superovulation. We also performed a comparison between prepubertal and adult hormonally stimulated oocytes. Globally, the distinctive methylation landscape of oocytes, comprising alternating hyper- and hypomethylated domains, is preserved irrespective of the procedure. The conservation of methylation extends to the germline differential methylated regions (DMRs) of imprinted genes, necessary for their monoallelic expression in the embryo. However, we do detect specific, consistent, and coherent differences in DNA methylation in IFC oocytes, and between oocytes obtained after superovulation from prepubertal compared with sexually mature females. Several methylation differences span entire transcription units. Among these, we found alterations in Tcf4, Sox5, Zfp521, and other genes related to nervous system development.  Conclusions Our observations show that IFC is associated with altered methylation at specific set of loci. DNA methylation of superovulated prepubertal oocytes differs from that of superovulated adult oocytes, whereas oocytes from superovulated adult females differ very little from naturally ovulated oocytes. Importantly, we show that regions other than imprinted gDMRs are susceptible to methylation changes associated with superovulation, IFC, and/or sexual immaturity in mouse oocytes. Our results provide an important reference for the use of in vitro growth and maturation of oocytes, particularly from prepubertal females, in assisted reproductive treatments or fertility preservation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000387420",,"1868-7075||1868-7083",,"10.1186/s13148-019-0794-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387420","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","In vitro follicle culture||Prepubertal oocytes||Superovulation||Global DNA methylation","Genome-wide assessment of DNA methylation in mouse oocytes reveals effects associated with in vitro growth, superovulation, and sexual maturity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-01-03T03:43:26Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85077036155",,"000510645100001",,,"Clinical Epigenetics","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Its outcrossing nature is caused by self-incompatibility (SI), a genetic mechanism preventing self-pollination in most forage grasses. SI represents a constraint for hybrid breeding as it impedes the development of homozygous parental inbred lines by repeated selfings. The need of developing higher-yielding grass varieties is driving scientists and forage breeders to find ways to overcome SI. A possible solution is to temporarily suppress SI by exposing plants to high temperatures during flowering, a phenomenon called pseudo self-compatibility (PSC). To date, the genetic regulation of PSC in perennial ryegrass is unknown, mainly because of the complexity in assessing PSC phenotypically. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of variation for PSC in a set of perennial ryegrass genotypes using a semi in vivo pollination assay. Specifically, we incubated mature inflorescence at 30°C for two days and measured, with fluorescence microscopy, pollen tube growth after self-pollination. Overall, we observed a slight tendency for all genotypes to increase the rate of successful self-pollinations when exposed to the heat treatment. However, the PSC response was highly genotype-dependent, denoting genetic variation for this trait. Our work lays the ground for the first genetic mapping experiments aimed at disclosing genes controlling PSC in perennial ryegrass. In addition, it provides valuable insights on its exploitation for breeding powerful and resilient grass hybrids.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/386144","en","Zurich-Basel Plant Science Center",,,"PSeudo self-compatibility||self-incompatibility (SI)||Lolium perenne","Natural variation for pseudo self-compatibility in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) – an untapped resource for hybrid breeding",,"Other Conference Item","Metadata only",,,,,"2019-12-17T12:35:11Z",,,,"yes","Plant Response to Environment across Scales.

Fusarium graminearum is one of the most common FHB-causing species in wheat and barley cropping systems. We assessed the ability of different botanical extracts to suppress essential stages of the fungal life cycle using three strains of F. graminearum (FG0410, FG2113, and FG1145). The botanicals included aqueous extracts from white mustard (Sinapis alba) seed flour (Pure Yellow Mustard [PYM] and Tillecur [Ti]) as well as milled Chinese galls (CG). At 2% concentration (wt/vol), PYM and Ti completely inhibited growth of mycelium of all F. graminearum strains whereas, at 1%, CG reduced the growth by 65 to 83%, depending on the strain. While PYM and Ti reduced the germination of both conidia and ascospores at 2% (wt/vol), CG was only effective in reducing conidia germination. Perithecia formation of FG0410 but not FG2113 was suppressed by all botanicals. Moreover, application of botanicals on mature perithecia led to a two- to fourfold reduction in discharge of ascospores. Using liquid chromatography (LC) with diode array detection, we quantified the principal glucosinolate component sinalbin of PYM and Ti. LC time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to demonstrate that the bioactive matrix of CG contains different gallotannins as well as gallic and tannic acids. Possible antifungal mechanisms of the botanical matrices are discussed. The results of this study are promising and suggest that PYM, Ti, and CG should be explored further for efficacy at managing FHB.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000381698",,,,"10.1094/phyto-06-19-0205-r","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/381698","en","American Phytopathological Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Biological control||Botanicals||Disease control||Fusarium graminearum||Mycology","Use of Botanicals to Suppress Different Stages of the Life Cycle of Fusarium graminearum",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-11-29T21:43:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85075559633",,"000502011800013",,"12","Phytopathology","109","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In Ferralsol, decreases in N2O emissions and in the N2O to N2O + N2 ratio were observed in both biochar and lime treatments. In Cambisol, neither biochar nor lime decreased N2O emissions, despite significantly increasing soil pH.

Plant genetic diversity (i.e., the diversity within species) is closely linked to ecosystem functioning in grasslands and constitutes an important reservoir of genetic resources that can be used to breed improved cultivars of forage grass and legume species. Assessing genetic diversity in grassland plant species is demanding due to the large number of different species and the level of resolution needed. However, recent methodological advances could help in tackling this challenge at a larger scale. In this review, we outline the methods that can be used to measure genetic diversity in plants, highlighting their strengths and limitations for genetic diversity assessments of grassland plant species, with a special focus on forage plants. Such methods can be categorized into DNA fragment, hybridization array, and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods, and they differ in terms of resolution, throughput, and multiplexing potential. Special attention is given to HTS approaches (i.e., plastid genome skimming, whole genome re-sequencing, reduced representation libraries, sequence capture, and amplicon sequencing), because they enable unprecedented large-scale assessments of genetic diversity in non-model organisms with complex genomes, such as forage grasses and legumes. As no single method may be suited for all kinds of purposes, we also provide practical perspectives for genetic diversity analyses in forage breeding and genetic resource conservation efforts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000386451",,"2073-4395",,"10.3390/agronomy9120881","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/386451","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Grassland||Genetic diversity||Genetic resources||Forages||Plant breeding||Conservation","DNA-Based Assessment of Genetic Diversity in Grassland Plant Species: Challenges, Approaches, and Applications",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-12-18T12:57:44Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85076247158",,"000507280400099",,"12","Agronomy","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Choosing particular plant genotypes for domestication and subsequent cultivar selection can narrow the gene pools of crop plants to a degree that they are no longer able to benefit from microbial mutualists. Elevated mineral nutrient levels in cultivated soils also reduce the dependence of crops on nutritional support by mutualists such as mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia. Thus, current ways of crop production are predestined to compromise the propagation and function of microbial symbionts, limiting their long-term benefits for plant yield stability. The influence of mutualists on non-native plant establishment and spread, i.e. biological invasions, provides an unexplored analogue to contemporary crop production that accounts for mutualistic services from symbionts like rhizobia and mycorrhizae. The historical exposure of organisms to biotic interactions over evolutionary timescales, or so-called eco-evolutionary experience (EEE), has been used to explain the success of such invasions. In this paper, we stress that consideration of the EEE concept can shed light on how to overcome the loss of microbial mutualist functions following crop domestication and breeding. We propose specific experimental approaches to utilize the wild ancestors of crops to determine whether crop domestication compromised the benefits derived from root microbial symbioses or not. This can predict the potential for success of mutualistic symbiosis manipulation in modern crops and the maintenance of effective microbial mutualisms over the long term.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000384548",,"2041-2851",,"10.1093/aobpla/plz060","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/384548","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Adaptation||Biological invasions||Co-introductions||Crop breeding||Crop plant domestication||Crop wild relative||Ecological fitting||Plant-icrobe interactions||Range expansion||Root microbiomes","Lessons from invasion biology: Can eco-evolutionary experience sustain benefits from mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia in plant production?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-12-11T09:56:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85076536528",,"000510159100003",,"6","AoB Plants","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Such priming presumably entails costs—else the primed state should be constitutively expressed—yet those costs remain poorly documented, in part due to a lack of studies conducted under realistic ecological conditions. We explored how defence priming in goldenrod (Solidago altissima) influenced growth and reproduction under semi-natural field conditions by manipulating exposure to priming cues (volatile emissions of a specialist herbivore, Eurosta solidaginis), competition between neighbouring plants, and herbivory (via insecticide application).  Results We found that primed plants grew faster than unprimed plants, but produced fewer rhizomes, suggesting reduced capacity for clonal reproduction. Unexpectedly, this effect was apparent only in the absence of insecticide, prompting a follow-up experiment that revealed direct effects of the pesticide esfenvalerate on plant growth (contrary to previous reports from goldenrod). Meanwhile, even in the absence of pesticide, priming had little effect on herbivore damage levels, likely because herbivores susceptible to the primed defences were rare or absent due to seasonality.  Conclusions Reduced clonal reproduction in primed plants suggest that priming can entail significant costs for plants. These costs, however, may only become apparent when priming cues fail to provide accurate information about prevailing threats, as was the case in this study. Additionally, our insecticide data indicate that pesticides or their carrier compounds can subtly, but significantly, affect plant physiology and may interact with plant defences.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000343882",,"1471-2229",,"10.1186/s12870-019-1820-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/343882","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Competition||Defence||Fitness||Gall||Goldenrod||Herbivory||Insecticide||Priming","Costs of plant defense priming: exposure tovolatile cues from a specialist herbivoreincreases short-term growth but reducesrhizome production in tall goldenrod(Solidago altissima)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-05-24T06:31:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Exploring the ecology of plant eavesdropping on insect pheromonal communication","163145","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85066410804",,"000468805100001","BMC plant biol.",,"BMC Plant Biology","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We investigated the persistence of differences in CH4 emission between groups of cows categorized as either low or high emitters over a 5-mo period. Two feeding regimens (pasture vs. indoors) were used. Early- to mid-lactation Holstein Friesian cows were categorized as low or high emitters (n = 10 each) retrospectively, using predictions from milk mid-infrared (MIR) spectra, before the start of the experiment. Data from MIR estimates and from measurements with the GreenFeed (GF; C-Lock Technology Inc., Rapid City, SD) system over the 5-mo experiment were combined into 7-, 14-, and 28-d periods. Feed intake, eating and ruminating behavior, and ruminal fluid traits were determined in two 7-d measurement periods in the grazing season. The CH4 emission data were analyzed using a split-plot ANOVA, and the repeatability of each of the applied methods for determining CH4 emission was calculated. Traits other than CH4 emission were analyzed for differences between low and high emitters using a linear mixed model. The initial category-dependent differences in daily CH4 production persisted over the subsequent 5 mo and across 2 feeding regimens with both methods. The repeatability analysis indicated that the biweekly milk control scheme, and even a monthly scheme as practiced on farms, might be sufficient for confirming category differences. However, the relationship between CH4 data estimated by MIR and measured with GF for individual cows was weak (R2 = 0.26). The categorization based on CH4 production also generated differences in CH4 emission per kilogram of milk; differentiation between cow categories was not persistent based on milk MIR spectra and GF. Compared with the high emitters, low emitters tended to show a lower acetate-to-propionate ratio in ruminal volatile fatty acids, whereas feed intake and ruminating time did not differ. Interestingly, the low emitters spent less time eating than the high emitters. In conclusion, the CH4 estimation from analyzing the milk MIR spectra is an appropriate proxy to form and regularly control categories of cows with different CH4 production levels. The categorization was also sufficient to secure similar and persistent differences in emission intensity when estimated by MIR spectra of the milk. Further studies are needed to determine whether MIR data from individual cows are sufficiently accurate for breeding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000378080",,"0022-0302||1525-3198",,"10.3168/jds.2019-16804","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/378080","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","methane emission||among-animal differences||eating behavior||mid-infrared","Persistence of differences between dairy cows categorized as low or high methane emitters, as estimated from milk mid-infrared spectra and measured by GreenFeed",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-11-17T03:47:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85072777299",,"000496786100094","J.

Radiation and aridity differences among sites together explain 10% of the spatial variance of leaf unfolding date, and 40% of the variation in GDDreq. Radiation intensity is positively correlated with GDDreq and aridity is negatively correlated with GDDreq spatial variance. These results suggest that leaf unfolding of temperate deciduous trees is adapted to local mean climate, including water and light availability, through altered sensitivity to spring temperature. Such adaptation of heat requirement to background climate would imply that models using constant temperature response are inherently inaccurate at local scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000383597",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-019-13365-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/383597","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Spatial variance of spring phenology in temperate deciduous forests is constrained by background climatic conditions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-12-07T03:20:46Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"next-generation Modelling of the biosphere - Including New Data streams and optimality approaches","181115","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Eccellenza",,,,"85075621168",,"000498701400001","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Light and temperature acclimation balance photosynthetic processes in a complex interplay with the fluctuating environment. However, due to limitations in the measurements techniques, these acclimations are often described under steady-state conditions leading to inaccurate photosynthesis estimates in the field. Here we analyze the photosynthetic interaction with the fluctuating environment and canopy architecture over two seasons using a fully automated phenotyping system. We acquired over 700,000 chlorophyll fluorescence transients and spectral measurements under semi-field conditions in four crop species including 28 genotypes. As expected, the quantum efficiency of the photosystem II (Fv/Fm in the dark and Fq'/Fm' in the light) was determined by light intensity. It was further significantly affected by spectral indices representing canopy structure effects. In contrast, a newly established parameter, monitoring the efficiency of electron transport (Fr2/Fv in the dark respective Fr2'/Fq' in the light), was highly responsive to temperature (R2 up to 0.75). This parameter decreased with temperature and enabled the detection of cold tolerant species and genotypes. We demonstrated the ability to capture and model the dynamic photosynthesis response to the environment over entire growth seasons. The improved linkage of photosynthetic performance to canopy structure, temperature and cold tolerance offers great potential for plant breeding and crop growth modeling.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000379534",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2019.01482","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/379534","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Cold acclimation||Photosynthesis x environment interactions||Electron transport||Chlorophyll fluorescence||High-throughput phenotyping","Genotype Specific Photosynthesis x Environment Interactions Captured by Automated Fluorescence Canopy Scans Over Two Fluctuating Growing Seasons",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-11-22T06:24:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85076705924",,"000508950900001","Front.

The assessment of the links between food security and livelihoods is central for overcoming widespread food insecurity. However, assessments remain challenging due to food security's multi-dimensionality and the challenge of finding indicators that are comparable and applicable to various contexts. This study addresses this challenge by adapting a food security index (FSI) and uses it to assess the livelihood drivers of food security. The index captures the multi-dimensionality of food security using conventional food security indicators. The assessed indicators include measures of “food consumption score,” “household dietary diversity score,” “coping strategies index,” the “household food insecurity access scale,” and “months of adequate household food provisioning.” The study covered 600 randomly selected households representative of three agro-ecological zones located close to large-scale agricultural investment in Mount Kenya region in Kenya. We used linear regression to identify livelihood factors significantly influencing food security. Spearman's rank-order correlation and student's T-test demonstrated a strong and significant correlation between the composite FSI index and each classical indicators of food security. Overall, 32% of the households were food secure and 68% were food insecure. Households' ownership of productive hand tools, followed by off-farm income, consumption of own produced food, type of agro-ecological zone, farm income and number of main crops infested by pests had a significant effect on household food security. All these factors, except the number of main crops infested by pests, were found to positively influence household food security. Households in humid agro-ecological zone were less food secure than households in semi-humid and semi-arid zones. Household size, the size of accessible land and households' members' participation to large agricultural investments (as wage workers or sub-contract farmer) were not significantly influencing food security. Households of the Mount Kenya region need alternative off-farm income sources combined with further support to improve sustainable agriculture management with appropriate hand tools.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507624",,"2571-581X",,"10.3389/fsufs.2019.00098","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507624","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Livelihoods and Food Security Among Rural Households in the North-Western Mount Kenya Region",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-09-29T11:28:42Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Front.

Se realizó el estudio durante dos campañas en el periodo 2016 en el municipio de San Pedro, ya que es el municipio con mayor superficie cultivada con soya en Bolivia. La región tiene dos campañas agrícolas. Para el levantamiento de datos se optó por un enfoque de métodos mixtos: entrevistas abiertas (30), mapas parlantes (9) y flujos de proceso (9). Se contó con la participación de diversos actores clave en la producción de soya en zona de estudio. Los resultados muestran que en una hectárea de soya anualmente se aplican más de 35 kg de productos químicos (plaguicidas y otros insumos agrícolas) con diferentes grados de toxicidad. Encontramos que se emplean caldos compuestos hasta con 11 diferentes productos, siendo aplicados entre 6 a 13 veces en toda la etapa fenológica del cultivo. En el periodo de estudio se utilizaron en total 64 marcas de plaguicidas químicos de uso agrícola (PQUA). En total se han identificado 19 ingredientes activos que son clasificados como Plaguicidas Altamente Peligrosos (PAPs). Estos resultados muestran que los ecosistemas y los seres humanos están expuestos a serios riesgos. Es en tal sentido que se desarrollan una serie de recomendaciones, entre ellas potenciar la agroecológía como práctica, movimiento social y ciencia, y retirar los PAPs del mercado.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507623",,"1683-0768",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507623","es","Universidad Católica Boliviana","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","Plaguicidas Altamente Peligrosos||agroquímicos||toxicidad||salud||soya||Bolivia","Plaguicidas químicos usados en el cultivo de soya en el Departamento de Santa Cruz, Bolivia: riesgos para la salud humana y toxicidad ambiental",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-09-29T11:25:56Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"RevActaNova","3","Acta Nova","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We report an updated genome resource for Metrosideros polymorpha, the most dominant tree species in the Hawaiian native forests and a unique example of rapid and remarkable ecological diversification of woody species. Ninety-one percent of the bases in the sequence assembly (304 Mb) were organized into 11 pseudo-molecules, which would represent the chromosome structure of the species assuming the synteny to a close relative Eucalyptus. Our complementary approach using manual annotation and automated pipelines identified 11.30% of the assembly to be transposable elements, in contrast to 4.1% in previous automated annotation. By increasing transcript and protein sequence data, we predicted 27,620 gene models with high concordance from the supplied evidence. We believe that this assembly, improved for contiguity, and annotation will be valuable for future evolutionary studies of M. polymorpha and closely related species, facilitating the isolation of specific genes and the investigation of genome-wide polymorphisms associated with ecological divergence.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000377531",,"2160-1836",,"10.1534/g3.119.400643","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/377531","en","Genetics Society of America","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Hawaii||MAKER||Metrosideros polymorpha||reannotation||transposable||element","Updated Genome Assembly and Annotation for Metrosideros polymorpha, an Emerging Model Tree Species of Ecological Divergence",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-11-14T03:41:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85074620384",,"000495646300001","G3","11","G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Cows in the full-time grazing group were kept exclusively on pasture and milked twice daily in a mobile milking parlor. Cows in the part-time grazing group had access to pasture for 4 h and 2 h after their morning and evening milkings, respectively. The part-time grazing cows differed markedly in their feeding behavior; they exhibited shorter daily ingestion times and longer durations of ingestion and idling bouts than full-time grazing cows. Part-time grazing cows had lower milk protein and casein contents, but milk yield and milk coagulation properties did not differ from the full-time grazing cows. As a result of the fasting periods in the barn, part-time grazing cows synthesized less fatty acids de novo and mobilized body fat reserves, as evidenced by the higher proportion of oleic acid in their milk fat.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000377800",,"2076-2615",,"10.3390/ani9110908","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/377800","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Mountain pasture||Grazing behavior||Fatty acid||Milk coagulation||Milk quality||Dairy cattle","Grazing on Upland Pastures Part-Time Instead of Full-Time Affects the Feeding Behavior of Dairy Cows and Has Consequences on Milk Fatty Acid Profiles",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-11-15T03:35:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85074637445",,"000502299900054",,"11","Animals","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, appropriate short-term plastic responses to new environmental conditions might not require high levels of standing genetic variation. In this study, we tested whether mating system variation among populations, and associated changes in genetic variability, affected short-term responses to environmental challenges. We compared relative fitness and metabolome profiles of naturally outbreeding (genetically diverse) and inbreeding (genetically depauperate) populations of a perennial plant, Arabidopsis lyrata, under constant growth chamber conditions and an outdoor common garden environment outside its native range. We found no effect of inbreeding on survival, flowering phenology or short-term physiological responses. Specifically, naturally occurring inbreeding had no significant effects on the plasticity of metabolome profiles, using either multivariate approaches or analysis of variation in individual metabolites, with inbreeding populations showing similar physiological responses to outbreeding populations over time in both growing environments. We conclude that low genetic diversity in naturally inbred populations may not always compromise fitness or short-term physiological capacity to respond to environmental change, which could help to explain the global success of selfing mating strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000378925",,"0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2019.2109","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/378925","en","The Royal Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Changing environments and genetic variation: natural variation in inbreeding does not compromise short-term physiological responses",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-11-20T09:36:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85075307737",,"000504858800013","Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1915","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","286","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Whole-soil inoculations can help to steer plant-community assembly for nature restoration success. However, it is unclear how subsequent colonization by ruderal and late-successional plant species influences PSFs. Here we test the direction and strength of the PSFs for ruderal and target plant species on differently inoculated soils. We hypothesize that inoculation with late-successional field soil promotes positive and negative PSFs for late-successional and ruderal plants, respectively. We conducted a glasshouse experiment with three plant-growth phases. First, we inoculated a common nutrient-rich ex-arable recipient soil with either a heathland, grassland or an arable soil, and grew mixtures of three ruderal, and three late-successional target species in all soils. Subsequently, we divided the experimental units over four new pots and planted half with mixtures of three ruderal and half with mixtures of three late-successional plant species, to simulate local colonization by these species groups. After 9 weeks, we removed the plants and replanted the pots with ruderal and late-successional species mixtures in a full factorial design to quantify the induced PSFs, after a further 9 weeks of growth. We found that ruderal plants developed positive PSF on soils inoculated with arable soil and neutral feedback when soils were inoculated with grassland or heathland inoculum. The positive PSF was most pronounced for Myosotis arvensis, although all ruderal species showed the most positive PSFs on arable-inoculated soils. There was no significant effect of inoculation on the PSF of late-successional species. As a result of changing PSFs, the relative performance of ruderal and late-successional target species became more similar on soils inoculated with grassland or heathland inoculum, leading to higher evenness. We conclude that soil inoculation on nutrient-rich ex-arable soils can affect PSFs. Inoculation with grassland or heathland inoculum prevented ruderal species from developing positive PSF and shifted the competitive balance in favor of late-successional plants. Future studies need to address the longer-term dynamics of soil inoculation-induced shifts in PSFs, particularly because these are expected to develop over longer timescales in the slow-growing late-successional target species, as well as the impact of competitive plant-plant interactions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000387231",,"2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2019.00451","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387231","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","colonization||nature restoration||plant-community assembly||plant-soil feedback||soil inoculation","Soil Inoculation Steers Plant-Soil Feedback, Suppressing Ruderal Plant Species",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-12-29T15:54:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85076678931",,,"Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, no studies have been made to evaluate the quantitative contribution of homegardens to people's food and nutrient intake and security. Here we report three studies to test an improved homegarden production system, with agricultural and extension interventions, designed for the mid-country wet zone in Sri Lanka. The study assessed the impact of the improved system on crop type diversity, on dietary intake and diversity and food and nutritional security of the households. In Study 1, 100 households with homegardens were evaluated for their household characteristics and homegarden practices. Study 2 was on a sub sample of 20 households each with organized homegardens (OHG); households were provided with planting material, agricultural inputs and advice, and were regularly monitored by a field officer for methodical farming. These improved home gardens were contrasted with non-organized homegardens (NOHG; without intervention) to measure crop diversity through a simple species count. Study 3 assessed 25 sample households with OHG and 20 households with NOHG: dietary nutrient intake and diversity and household food security were quantified. Family food consumption was assessed using a 5-day diet diary. Perceived household food security status was determined using United States Department of Agriculture Food Security Module. Nutrient intakes, dietary adequacy, and contribution to dietary diversity from produce derived from homegarden were calculated. A total of 149 crop species were recorded in the homegardens with a 14% greater diversity in OHG than NOHG. Household food security was not significantly associated with organized or non-organized homegardens. The improved, organized home gardens provided diets with a greater contribution of energy, carbohydrates, fat, calcium, iron, zinc, folate, thiamin, niacin, vitamin C, and vitamin A compared with NOHG. The study demonstrates that households with OHG had greater dietary diversity from homegarden produce compared with that of households with NOHG leading to better food and micronutrient intake and nutritional security.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000369713",,"2571-581X",,"10.3389/fsufs.2019.00094","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/369713","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Crop diversity||Dietary Diversity||dietary intake||Homegardens||household food security||Micronutrients||Sri Lanka","Organized Homegardens Contribute to Micronutrient Intakes and Dietary Diversity of Rural Households in Sri Lanka",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-10-10T07:45:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85077614564",,,"Front.

One opportunity to reduce N application rates without major losses in yield is breeding for nutrient efficient crops. A key parameter that influences nutrient uptake efficiency is the root system architecture (RSA). To explore the impact of N availability on RSA and to investigate the impact of the growth environment, a diverse set of 36 inbred dent maize lines crossed to the inbred flint line UH007 as a tester was evaluated for N-response over 2 years on three different sites. RSA was investigated by excavating and imaging of the root crowns followed by image analysis with REST software. Despite strong site and year effects, trait heritability was generally high. Root traits showing the greatest heritability (> 0.7) were the width of the root stock, indicative of the horizontal expansion, and the fill factor, a measure of the density of the root system. Heritabilities were in a similar range under high or low N application. Under N deficiency the root stock size decreased, the horizontal expansion decreased and the root stock became less dense. However, there was little differential response of the genotypes to low N availability. Thus, the assessed root traits were more constitutively expressed rather than showing genotype-specific plasticity to low N. In contrast, strong differences were observed for ‘stay green’ and silage yield, indicating that these highly heritable traits are good indicators for responsiveness to low N.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000368550",,"0014-2336||1573-5060",,"10.1007/s10681-019-2472-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/368550","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Abiotic stress||Genotype environment interaction||Root system architecture||Nitrogen||Heritability||Shovelomics","Shovelomics root traits assessed on the EURoot maize panel are highly heritable across environments but show low genotype-by-nitrogen interaction",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-10-06T02:29:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Enhancing resource Uptake from Roots under stress in cereal crops","289300","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,"85073196319",,"000487079500001","Euphytica (Wagening.)","10","Euphytica","215","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study aimed at evaluating the growth of carcass components and organs of Swiss Large White pigs from birth to 140 kg BW depending on the CP and amino acid (AA) supply. A total of 66 entire males (EM), 58 castrates (CA) and 66 female (FE) pigs were used. From 20 kg BW onwards, they had either ad libitum access to a control (C) or a diet (LP) with 20% lower CP, lysine, methionine + cystine, threonine and tryptophan content compared to C. The weight of organs, primal cuts and external fat were recorded in eight EM and eight FE; at 10 kg BW, on two EM, CA and FE each, and at 20 kg BW, on eight pigs from each sex. From 40 to 140 kg BW at 20 kg intervals, measurements were recorded on four pigs per sex and dietary treatment. The weight of each component was related to empty body (EB) using allometric regressions. Kidneys were heavier (P<0.05) in C- than LP-pigs and in EM than CA and FE. Above 21 kg EB weight, growth rate of LP-FE overpassed (P<0.05) the one of C-pigs. Consequently, LP-FE had heavier (P<0.05) lean cuts than C-pigs in the finisher period. However, LP-CA and LP-EM displayed lower (P<0.05) weights and growth rates of the lean cuts than C-CA and C-EM. Shoulder and loin weights and growth rates were reduced (P<0.05) in LP-pigs when compared to C-pigs. Growth rates of the ham were greater (P<0.05) in LP-FE than C-FE, whereas in LP-EM and LP-CA they were lower (P<0.05) than their C-counterparts. Total amounts of subcutaneous fat, backfat, ham fat and shoulder fat were lower (P<0.05) in C- than LP-pigs. The total amount of subcutaneous fat, backfat and shoulder fat of C-CA was, regardless of diet, greater (P<0.05) than of C-FE. In the LP group, this difference was even more pronounced. The amount of deposited ham fat was greater (P<0.05) in LP-CA than LP-FE, but not in C-CA v. C-FE. Differences in kidney weights suggested a greater nitrogen clearance required in C-pigs. Overall, dietary restriction and sex did not affect all body parts to the same extent. This study further suggests the possibility to reduce the CP and AA supply in FE without compromising the yield of primal lean cuts or increasing the amount of subcutaneous fat.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000365050",,"1751-7311||1751-732X",,"10.1017/S1751731119000132","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/365050","en","Cambridge University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","allometric growth||carcass composition||organs||primal cuts||protein supply","Effects of dietary CP and amino acid restriction on the prowth dynamics of organs and body components in entire male, castrated and female pigs",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-09-19T07:29:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85062228905",,"000487064700016",,"10","Animal","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Such tools could greatly benefit resistance breeding, but their adoption is hampered by i) a lack of specificity to disease-related effects and ii) insufficient robustness to variation in reflectance caused by genotypic diversity and varying environmental conditions, which are fundamental elements of resistance breeding. We hypothesized that relying exclusively on temporal changes in canopy reflectance during pathogenesis may allow to specifically detect and quantify crop diseases while minimizing the confounding effects of genotype and environment. To test this hypothesis, we collected time-resolved canopy hyperspectral reflectance data for 18 diverse genotypes on infected and disease-free plots and engineered spectral–temporal features representing this hypothesis. Our results confirm the lack of specificity and robustness of disease assessments based on reflectance spectra at individual time points. We show that changes in spectral reflectance over time are indicative of the presence and severity of Septoria tritici blotch (STB) infections. Furthermore, the proposed time-integrated approach facilitated the delineation of disease from physiological senescence, which is pivotal for efficient selection of STB-resistant material under field conditions. A validation of models based on spectral–temporal features on a diverse panel of 330 wheat genotypes offered evidence for the robustness of the proposed method. This study demonstrates the potential of time-resolved canopy reflectance measurements for robust assessments of foliar diseases in the context of resistance breeding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000378019",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2019.01355","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/378019","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","high-throughput phenotyping||field-based phenotyping||feature engineering||feature selection||spectral vegetation index","In-Field Detection and Quantification of Septoria Tritici Blotch in Diverse Wheat Germplasm Using Spectral-Temporal Features",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-11-16T03:26:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Epidemiology of major wheat diseases: using eco-evolutionary models to learn from epidemic and genomic data","161453","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,"85074700778",,"000494463700001","Front.

The dataset describes the yearly grassland management for each grassland plot using 116 variables. General information includes plot identifier, study region and survey year. Additionally, grassland plot characteristics describe the presence and starting year of drainage and whether arable farming had taken place 25 years before our assessment, i.e. between 1981 and 2006. In each year, the size of the management unit is given which, in some cases, changed slightly across years. Mowing, grazing and fertilisation were systematically surveyed: Mowing is characterised by mowing frequency (i.e. number of cuts per year), dates of cutting and different technical variables, such as type of machine used or usage of conditioner. For grazing, the livestock species and age (e.g. cattle, horse, sheep), the number of animals, stocking density per hectare and total duration of grazing were recorded. As a derived variable, the mean grazing intensity was then calculated by multiplying the livestock units with the duration of grazing per hectare [LSU days/ha]. Different grazing periods during a year, partly involving different herds, were summed up to an annual grazing intensity for each grassland. For fertilisation, information on the type and amount of different types of fertilisers was recorded separately for mineral and organic fertilisers, such as solid farmland manure, slurry and mash from a bioethanol factory. Our fertilisation measures neglect dung dropped by livestock during grazing. For each type of fertiliser, we calculated its total nitrogen content, derived from chemical analyses by the producer or agricultural guidelines (Table 3). All three management types, mowing, fertilisation and grazing, were used to calculate a combined land use intensity index (LUI) which is frequently used to define a measure for the land use intensity. Here, fertilisation is expressed as total nitrogen per hectare [kg N/ha], but does not consider potassium and phosphorus. Information on additional management practices in grasslands was also recorded including levelling, to tear-up matted grass covers, rolling, to remove surface irregularities, seed addition, to close gaps in the sward.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000370190",,,,"10.3897/BDJ.7.e36387","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/370190","en","Pensoft Publishers","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Grassland management survey||Fertilisation||Grazing||Mowing||Livestock units||Biodiversity-Exploratories||Questionnaire||Farming practice||Grassland maintenance||Nitrogen||Temporal variation||Intensification of grassland use","Eleven years' data of grassland management in Germany",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-10-12T03:57:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000488080300001",,,"Biodiversity Data Journal","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We developed an automated image analysis to measure quantitative resistance to septoria tritici blotch (STB), a globally important wheat disease, enabling identification of small chromosome intervals containing plausible candidate genes for STB resistance. 335 winter wheat cultivars were included in a replicated field experiment that experienced natural epidemic development by a highly diverse but fungicide-resistant pathogen population. More than 5.4 million automatically generated phenotypes were associated with 13,648 SNP markers to perform the GWAS. We identified 26 chromosome intervals explaining 1.9-10.6% of the variance associated with four independent resistance traits. Sixteen of the intervals overlapped with known STB resistance intervals, suggesting that our phenotyping approach can identify simultaneously (i.e., in a single experiment) many previously defined STB resistance intervals. Seventeen of the intervals were less than 5 Mbp in size and encoded only 173 genes, including many genes associated with disease resistance. Five intervals contained four or fewer genes, providing high priority targets for functional validation. Ten chromosome intervals were not previously associated with STB resistance, perhaps representing resistance to pathogen strains that had not been tested in earlier experiments. The SNP markers associated with these chromosome intervals can be used to recombine different forms of quantitative STB resistance that are likely to be more durable than pyramids of major resistance genes. Our experiment illustrates how high-throughput automated phenotyping can accelerate breeding for quantitative disease resistance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000369259",,,,"10.34133/2019/3285904","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/369259","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Precision Phenotyping Reveals Novel Loci for Quantitative Resistance to Septoria Tritici Blotch",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-10-08T14:31:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Genomics of quantitative traits and chromosome instability in Zymoseptoria tritici||QTL mapping of virulence and other quantitative traits in the model plant pathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola||Epidemiology of major wheat diseases: using eco-evolutionary models to learn from epidemic and genomic data","155955||134755||161453","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)||Ambizione||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,,,,"Plant Phenomics","2019","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Moreover, most GWAS have been performed for single traits, thus not providing detailed insights into potentially existing pleiotropic effects of trait-associated loci.  Results To compile a comprehensive catalogue of large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTL) segregating in Brown Swiss cattle, we carried out association tests between partially imputed genotypes at 598,016 SNPs and daughter-derived phenotypes for more than 50 economically important traits, including milk production, growth and carcass quality, body conformation, reproduction and calving traits in 4578 artificial insemination bulls from two cohorts of Brown Swiss cattle (Austrian-German and Swiss populations). Across-cohort multi-trait meta-analyses of the results from the single-trait GWAS revealed 25 quantitative trait loci (QTL; P < 8.36 × 10− 8) for economically relevant traits on 17 Bos taurus autosomes (BTA). Evidence of pleiotropy was detected at five QTL located on BTA5, 6, 17, 21 and 25. Of these, two QTL at BTA6:90,486,780 and BTA25:1,455,150 affect a diverse range of economically important traits, including traits related to body conformation, calving, longevity and milking speed. Furthermore, the QTL at BTA6:90,486,780 seems to be a target of ongoing selection as evidenced by an integrated haplotype score of 2.49 and significant changes in allele frequency over the past 25 years, whereas either no or only weak evidence of selection was detected at all other QTL.  Conclusions Our findings provide a comprehensive overview of QTL segregating in Brown Swiss cattle. Detected QTL explain between 2 and 10% of the variation in the estimated breeding values and thus may be considered as the most important QTL segregating in the Brown Swiss cattle breed. Multi-trait association testing boosts the power to detect pleiotropic QTL and assesses the full spectrum of phenotypes that are affected by trait-associated variants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000362193",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-019-6066-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/362193","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Selection||Pleiotropy||Genome-wide association study||Runs of homozygosity||Extended haplotype homozygosity","Multi-trait meta-analyses reveal 25 quantitative trait loci for economically important traits in Brown Swiss cattle",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-09-03T16:48:04Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85071757203",,"000483734200001","BMC Genomics","1","BMC Genomics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Meaningful learning, where the participant is able to relate new information to existing knowledge, is a critical part of education about complex systems and requires the integration of reflective approaches to teaching and learning. We adapted the rich picture method in three summer schools in Switzerland, South Africa and Côte d’Ivoire (74 participants with 29 nationalities) to support the reflection of participants on their knowledge gained on complex food systems. Coding and comparing 51 pairs of pre- and post-course pictures of food systems clearly demonstrated newly gained knowledge: The number of sub-categories drawn significantly increased from 11 to 19 in the post-course pictures, the largest increase occurred for environmental sustainability (57%). The rich picture method is a highly valuable and simple tool to gain insight into how participants’ knowledge changes and where there are gaps in meeting the learning objectives. This is particularly useful within a highly diverse participant cohort, as it allows participants to discuss and reflect on their own learning experience in a personalized way. Additionally, the rich picture method provides insights for faculty to improve their approaches to teaching on food systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000367392",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su11184815","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/367392","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","food systems||sustainability||education||rich picture||reflective learning||reflective teaching||summer school","The rich picture method: A simple tool for reflective teaching and learning about sustainable food systems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-09-30T17:30:54Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85072612224",,"000489104700001",,"18","Sustainability","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Many eCO2 experiments suggest that nutrient limitations modulate the local magnitude of the eCO2 effect on plant biomass1,3,5, but the global extent of these limitations has not been empirically quantified, complicating projections of the capacity of plants to take up CO27,8. Here, we present a data-driven global quantification of the eCO2 effect on biomass based on 138 eCO2 experiments. The strength of CO2 fertilization is primarily driven by nitrogen (N) in ~65% of global vegetation and by phosphorus (P) in ~25% of global vegetation, with N- or P-limitation modulated by mycorrhizal association. Our approach suggests that CO2 levels expected by 2100 can potentially enhance plant biomass by 12 ± 3% above current values, equivalent to 59 ± 13 PgC. The future effect of eCO2 we derive from experiments is geographically consistent with past changes in greenness9, but is considerably lower than the past effect derived from models10. If borne out, our results suggest that the stimulatory effect of CO2 on carbon storage could slow considerably this century. Our research provides an empirical estimate of the biomass sensitivity to eCO2 that may help to constrain climate projections.",,,,"1758-6798",,"10.1038/s41558-019-0545-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507548","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Nitrogen and phosphorus constrain the CO2 fertilization of global plant biomass",,"Journal Article||Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-09-29T08:14:24Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,"60460485",,,,,"Nat.

An assessment of the extent to which soils perform a specific function is not only important to appropriately value their current capacity, but also to make well-informed decisions about how and where to change soil management to align the delivered soil functions with societal demands. To obtain an overview of the capacity of soils to perform different functions, accurate and easy-to-use models are necessary. A problem with most currently-available models is that data requirements often exceed data availability, while generally a high level of expert knowledge is necessary to apply these models. Therefore, we developed a qualitative model to assess how agricultural soils function with respect to climate regulation. The model is driven by inputs about agricultural management practices, soil properties and environmental conditions. To reduce data requirements on stakeholders, the 17 input variables are classified into either (1) three classes: low, medium and high or (2) the presence or absence of a management practice. These inputs are combined using a decision tree with internal integration rules to obtain an estimate of the magnitude of N2O emissions and carbon sequestration. These two variables are subsequently combined into an estimate of the capacity of a soil to perform the climate regulation function. The model was tested using data from long-term field experiments across Europe. This showed that the model is generally able to adequately assess this soil function across a range of environments under different management practices. In a next step, this model will be combined with models to assess other soil functions (soil biodiversity, primary productivity, nutrient cycling and water regulation and purification). This will allow the assessment of trade-offs between these soil functions for agricultural land across Europe.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000366480",,"2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2019.00131","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/366480","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","soil functions||climate regulation||carbon sequestration||N2O emissions||agroecosystems||qualitative decision modeling","Assessing the Climate Regulation Potential of Agricultural Soils Using a Decision Support Tool Adapted to Stakeholders' Needs and Possibilities",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-09-26T02:22:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85073015082",,"000485255200001","Front.

Even though it is well known that microbial processes in agricultural and natural soils are the major N2O source, the contribution of specific soil processes is still uncertain. The relative abundance of N2O isotopocules (14N14N16N, 14N15N16O, 15N14N16O, and 14N14N18O) carries process-specific information and thus can be used to trace production and consumption pathways. While isotope ratio mass spectroscopy (IRMS) was traditionally used for high-precision measurement of the isotopic composition of N2O, quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS) has been put forward as a complementary technique with the potential for on-site analysis. In recent years, pre-concentration combined with QCLAS has been presented as a technique to resolve subtle changes in ambient N2O isotopic composition.  From the end of May until the beginning of August 2016, we investigated N2O emissions from an intensively managed grassland at the study site Fendt in southern Germany. In total, 612 measurements of ambient N2O were taken by combining pre-concentration with QCLAS analyses, yielding δ15Nα, δ15Nβ, δ18O, and N2O concentration with a temporal resolution of approximately 1 h and precisions of 0.46 ‰, 0.36 ‰, 0.59 ‰, and 1.24 ppb, respectively. Soil δ15N-NO−3 values and concentrations of NO−3 and NH+4 were measured to further constrain possible N2O-emitting source processes. Furthermore, the concentration footprint area of measured N2O was determined with a Lagrangian particle dispersion model (FLEXPART-COSMO) using local wind and turbulence observations. These simulations indicated that night-time concentration observations were largely sensitive to local fluxes. While bacterial denitrification and nitrifier denitrification were identified as the primary N2O-emitting processes, N2O reduction to N2 largely dictated the isotopic composition of measured N2O. Fungal denitrification and nitrification-derived N2O accounted for 34 %–42 % of total N2O emissions and had a clear effect on the measured isotopic source signatures. This study presents the suitability of on-site N2O isotopocule analysis for disentangling source and sink processes in situ and found that at the Fendt site bacterial denitrification or nitrifier denitrification is the major source for N2O, while N2O reduction acted as a major sink for soil-produced N2O.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000363631",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-16-3247-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/363631","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Attribution of N2O sources in a grassland soil with laser spectroscopy based isotopocule analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-09-12T03:34:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85071538949",,"000483092900003",,"16","Biogeosciences","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Turnover can be quantified using mean residence time (MRT), however, to date there is little information on MRT of P in soil P pools. We introduce an approach to quantify MRT of P in sequentially-extracted inorganic soil P pools using data from isotope exchange kinetic experiments. Our analyses of 53 soil samples from the literature showed that MRT of labile P (resin- and bicarbonate extractable P) was on the order of minutes to hours for most soils, MRT in NaOH-extractable P was in the range of days to months, and MRT in HCl-extractable P was on the order of years to millennia. Multiple regression models were able to capture 54–63 % of the variability in MRT among samples, and showed that land use was the most important predictor of MRT of P in labile and NaOH pools. MRT of P in HCl-P was strongly dependent on pH, as high pH soils tended to have longer MRTs. This was interpreted to be related to the composition of HCl-P. Under high pH, HCl-P contains mostly apatite, with a low solubility, whereas under low pH conditions, HCl-P may contain more exchangeable P forms. The estimates of MRT of P in inorganic pools improve our interpretation of soil P dynamics at the laboratory-, field- and ecosystem scale, and will also be useful to constrain P dynamics in global land surface models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000390960",,"1810-6277||1810-6285",,"10.5194/bg-2019-192","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/390960","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Estimates of mean residence times of phosphorus in commonly-considered inorganic soil phosphorus pools",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,,"2020-01-16T08:48:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biogeosci. discuss.",,"Biogeosciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Immunization programs employing commercially available vaccines are used to prevent disease. Sows are vaccinated during every gestation period and piglets take up antibodies from the colostrum. Antibodies against the major clostridial toxin beta-toxin (CPB) are considered essential for protective immunity. Because the pathogen can persist for several years on farms, continuous vaccination is essential to protect pig herds from the re-occurrence of NE.  Results In two field trials using commercially available vaccines we monitored neutralizing anti-CPB antibodies in pigs after vaccination. The first trial compared antibody titers in primiparous (gilts) and multiparous sows and their piglets after vaccination. A proportion of gilts and their piglets’ showed no or low antibody titers. All multiparous sows developed significantly higher serum and colostrum antibody titers after a booster vaccination shortly before their next farrowing. These colostral antibody titer highly correlated with the serum antibody titer of their piglets after consumption of colostrum. In a second field trial, we adapted the vaccination schemes using 3 instead of 2 initial vaccinations before the first farrowing of gilts. This significantly increased serum and colostrum antibody titers in gilts and serum antibody titers in piglets.  Conclusion We demonstrate that despite following recommended vaccination protocols, a proportion of gilts might not sufficiently seroconvert to provide efficient passive immunity to their offsprings. A simple adaptation of the vaccination scheme can however improve passive protection of piglets from NE.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000361013",,,,"10.1186/s40813-019-0127-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/361013","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Clostridium perfringens type C||Beta-toxin||Neutralizing antibodies||Necrotizing enteritis||Porcine||Vaccination","Vaccination against Clostridium perfringens type C enteritis in pigs: a field study using an adapted vaccination scheme",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-08-28T08:08:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85070986379",,"000481407000001",,"1","Porcine Health Management","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Making practical use of such above-belowground biotic interactions offers important opportunities for enhancing the sustainability of agriculture, as it could favor crop growth, nutrient supply, and defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the operation of above- and belowground organisms at different spatial and temporal scales provides important challenges for application in agriculture. Aboveground organisms, such as herbivores and pollinators, operate at spatial scales that exceed individual fields and are highly variable in abundance within growing seasons. In contrast, pathogenic, symbiotic, and decomposer soil biota operate at more localized spatial scales from individual plants to patches of square meters, however, they generate legacy effects on plant performance that may last from single to multiple years. The challenge is to promote pollinators and suppress pests at the landscape and field scale, while creating positive legacy effects of local plant-soil interactions for next generations of plants. Here, we explore the possibilities to improve utilization of above-belowground interactions in agro-ecosystems by considering spatio-temporal scales at which aboveground and belowground organisms operate. We identified that successful integration of above-belowground biotic interactions initially requires developing crop rotations and intercropping systems that create positive local soil legacy effects for neighboring as well subsequent crops. These configurations may then be used as building blocks to design landscapes that accommodate beneficial aboveground communities with respect to their required resources. For successful adoption of above-belowground interactions in agriculture there is a need for context-specific solutions, as well as sound socio-economic embedding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000361033",,"2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2019.00300","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/361033","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","above-belowground biotic interactions||sustainable agriculture||spatio-temporal scales||agroecology||steering communities","Applying the Aboveground-Belowground Interaction Concept in Agriculture: Spatio-Temporal Scales Matter",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-08-28T08:12:12Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000480784300001","Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Similar mechanisms may mediate the sharing of information (e.g., about herbivory or other environmental stressors) among ramets via molecular or biochemical signals. The storage of such information in belowground structures could facilitate the transmission of appropriate phenotypic responses across growing seasons in perennial species. However, few previous studies have explored the potential transfer of ecologically relevant information within such networks. This study addresses the effects of foliar herbivory and belowground overwintering on the growth and flowering, physical defenses, and herbivore resistance in the clonally spreading species Solanum carolinense L. (Solanaceae). We used rhizomes from inbred and outbred plants that were repeatedly exposed to feeding damage by Manduca sexta L. (Sphingidae) caterpillars and rhizomes from undamaged control plants. These rhizomes were either planted immediately or exposed to overwintering conditions and allowed to produce new ramets (rhizomatous offshoots). We then assessed offshoot emergence, flowering, physical defense traits, and herbivore performance. Relative to controls, offshoots of herbivore-damaged plants exhibited greater spine and trichome densities, and reduced performance of M. sexta larvae. However, they also emerged and flowered significantly later, and produced fewer flowers than offshoots of undamaged plants. Inbreeding also negatively affected offshoot emergence, flowering, trichome production, and herbivore resistance. These effects of parental herbivory were more pronounced in outbred offshoots, indicating that inbreeding may compromise the trans-seasonal induction of plant defenses. Finally, exposure to overwintering conditions increased trichome production and reduced caterpillar performance on offshoots. Together, these results show that induced defenses can be transmitted through rhizomes and affect offshoot growth, flowering, defensive traits, and herbivore resistance. They also document fitness-related costs associated with defense induction in offshoots and suggest that the transfer of defenses across seasons can be compromised by inbreeding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000355052",,"0269-7653||1573-8477",,"10.1007/s10682-019-09997-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/355052","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Clonal plants||Herbivory||Inducible defenses||Inbreeding||Manduca sexta||Solanum carolinense","Herbivory and inbreeding affect growth, reproduction, and resistance in the rhizomatous offshoots of Solanum carolinense (Solanaceae)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-07-25T04:18:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85068175171",,"000475796800003","Evol Ecol","4","Evolutionary Ecology","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We examine whether fine‐scale plant–plant interactions scale up to shape broad‐scale species’ distributions, using Azorella selago, a widespread cushion plant that facilitates other species, and the rest of the vascular flora of sub‐Antarctic Marion Island as a model system. We compared the upper elevational distributional limit of each species when growing on vs. away from A. selago to test how the interaction with this cushion plant species affects species’ ranges. Three out of 19 vascular plant species occurred at higher altitudes in the presence of A. selago than in the absence of A. selago: Acaena magellanica (+26 m higher), Colobanthus kerguelensis (+37 m higher), and Lycopodium saururus (+19 m higher). Therefore, A. selago's fine‐scale impacts scaled up to shape the distribution of a subset of the vascular flora of Marion Island. Plant–plant interactions thus have the potential to expand species upper distributional limits by increasing the niche space that a species can occupy, although the influence of these interactions may be strongly species‐specific.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000364087",,"2150-8925",,"10.1002/ecs2.2820","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/364087","en","Ecological Society of America","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","abiotic severity||facilitation||plant interactions||range expansion||realized niche","Positive plant–plant interactions expand the upper distributional limits of some vascular plant species",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-09-15T02:32:06Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85071841977",,"000483832300006",,"8","Ecosphere","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Current LULC scenarios are based on relatively simple assumptions and highly uncertain estimates of population changes through time. Archaeological and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions have the potential to refine these assumptions and estimates. The Past Global Changes (PAGES) LandCover6k initiative is working towards improved reconstructions of LULC globally. In this paper, we document the types of archaeological data that are being collated and how they will be used to improve LULC reconstructions. Given the large methodological uncertainties involved, we propose methods to evaluate the revised scenarios by using independent pollen-based reconstructions of land cover and of climate. A further test involves carbon-cycle simulations to determine whether the LULC reconstructions are consistent with constraints provided by ice-core records of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution and modern-day LULC. Finally, we outline a protocol for using the improved LULC reconstructions in palaeoclimate simulations within the framework of the Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project in order to quantify the magnitude of anthropogenic impacts on climate through time and ultimately to improve the realism of Holocene climate simulations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507550",,"1991-962X||1991-9611",,"10.5194/gmd-2019-125","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507550","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Development and testing of scenarios for implementing Holocene LULC in Earth System Model Experiments",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,,"2021-09-29T08:18:23Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,"60993389",,,,,"Geosci. model dev. discuss.",,"Geoscientific Model Development Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This new “atypical porcine pestivirus” (APPV) was later associated with congenital tremor (CT) in newborn piglets. The virus appears to be distributed worldwide, but the limited knowledge of virus diversity and the use of various diagnostic tests prevent direct comparisons. Therefore, we developed an APPV-specific real-time RT-PCR assay in the 5′UTR of the viral genome to investigate both retro- and prospectively the strains present in Switzerland and their prevalence in domestic pigs. Overall, 1080 sera obtained between 1986 and 2018 were analyzed, revealing a virus prevalence of approximately 13% in pigs for slaughter, whereas it was less than 1% in breeding pigs. In the prospective study, APPV was also detected in piglets displaying CT. None of the samples could detect the Linda virus, which is another new pestivirus recently reported in Austria. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed a broad diversity of APP viruses in Switzerland that are considerably distinct from sequences reported from other isolates in Europe and overseas. This study indicates that APPV has already been widely circulating in Switzerland for many years, mainly in young animals, with 1986 being the earliest report of APPV worldwide.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000359544",,"1999-4915",,"10.3390/v11070653","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/359544","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Atypical porcine pestivirus||APPV||Prevalence||Epidemiology||Switzerland||Real-time RT-PCR||Phylogenetic analysis||Congenital tremor","Long-Term Circulation of Atypical Porcine Pestivirus (APPV) within Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-08-21T02:53:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000478667800095",,"7","Viruses","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Agronomic conservation strategies such as increasing plant diversity at field scale and minimizing soil disturbances such as tillage aim at fostering the presence of beneficial microbial communities to support intrinsic agroecosystem functions and reduce the reliance on agrochemicals and mechanical soil management. However, it remains poorly understood how these positive contributions are modulated by the pedological context. Moreover, only few studies have assessed the management-dependent responses of microbial communities in real-life farming systems. Here, in close association with the farmers and under realistic field conditions, we explored the response of bacterial and fungal community structure to conventional and conservation (using agroecological principles) management regimes across two pedological sites (loamy sand and sandy loam) in Belgium. Microbial diversity was assessed using a DNA metabarcoding approach of ribosomal markers with the Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology. Our results show that different management approaches select for distinct soil microbial communities and that these management-related effects were modulated by the pedological context. Therefore, designing new agricultural systems to foster the presence of beneficial organisms and reduce the level of pathogenic organisms should account for variability in the underlying pedological context.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000354779",,"2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2019.00261","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/354779","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sustainable agriculture||Soil microbial diversity||Bacteria||Fungi||Metabarcoding||16S rRNA genes||Internal transcribed spacers||Soil texture","The Pedological Context Modulates the Response of Soil Microbial Communities to Agroecological Management",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-07-24T02:20:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000475398900001","Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This article quantifies the impacts of soil characteristics on maize response to fertilizer in Zambia using a nationally representative sample of 1453 fields, combining economic, farm management and soil analysis data. Depending on soil regimes, average maize yield response estimates range from insignificant (0) to 7 maize kg per fertilizer kg. For the majority of farmers, the estimated average value cost ratio is between 1 and 2, meaning fertilizer use would be fiscally rational, barring uncertainty and transfer costs. Since transfer costs exist and outcomes are uncertain, however, many farmers may sensibly pause before deciding whether to adopt fertilizer. This suggests shifting the emphasis of chronically low fertilizer use in Africa away from explanations of “market failure” toward greater emphasis on improving fertilizer efficacy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000354207",,"0306-9192||1873-5657",,"10.1016/j.foodpol.2019.05.004","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/354207","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sub-Saharan Africa||Zambia||Agricultural productivity||Crop response||Fertilizer profitability||Soil quality","Understanding fertilizer adoption and effectiveness on maize in Zambia",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-07-20T02:53:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85066118281",,"000477787700013","Food policy",,"Food Policy","86","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether binary and 3-way combinations of such phenol sources affect ruminal fermentation less, similar or more intensively than separate applications.  Methods The extracts used were from Acacia mearnsii bark (acacia), Vitis vinifera (grape) seed, Camellia sinensis leaves (green tea), Uncaria gambir leaves (gambier), Vaccinium macrocarpon berries (cranberry), Fagopyrum esculentum seed (buckwheat), and Ginkgo biloba leaves (ginkgo). All extracts were tested using the Hohenheim gas test. This was done alone at 5% of dry matter (DM). Acacia was also combined with all other single extracts at 5% of DM each, and with two other phenol sources (all possible combinations) at 2.5%+2.5% of DM.  Results Methane formation was reduced by 7% to 9% by acacia, grape seed and green tea and, in addition, by most extract combinations with acacia. Grape seed and green tea alone and in combination with acacia also reduced methane proportion of total gas to the same degree. The extracts of buckwheat and gingko were poor in phenols and promoted ruminal fermentation. All treatments except green tea alone lowered ammonia concentration by up to 23%, and the binary combinations were more effective as acacia alone. With three extracts, linear effects were found with total gas and methane formation, while with ammonia and other traits linear effects were rare.  Conclusion The study identified methane and ammonia mitigating potential of various phenolic plant extracts and showed a number of additive and some non-linear effects of combinations of extracts. Further studies, especially in live animals, should concentrate on combinations of extracts from grape seed, green tea leaves Land acacia bark and determine the ideal dosages of such combinations for the purpose of methane mitigation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000351261",,"1011-2367||1976-5517",,"10.5713/ajas.18.0665","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/351261","en","AAAP","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Methane||Plant Extract||Acacia mearnsii||Grape Seed||Green Tea||Uncaria gambir","Phenolic plant extracts are additive in their effects against in vitro ruminal methane and ammonia formation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-07-04T02:18:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Suitability of phytogenic compounds in the diet of ruminants to improve animal and ecological health","149976","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,,,,,"000472147700007","Asian-Australas J Anim Sci","7","Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences","32","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Many biodiverse ecosystems are being lost at far higher rates than they are being protected or ecologically restored. At the same time, natural climate solutions offer opportunities to restore biodiversity while mitigating climate change. The Bonn Challenge is a U.N. programme to restore biodiversity and mitigate climate change through restoration of the world's degraded landscapes. It provides an unprecedented chance for ecological restoration to become a linchpin tool for addressing many environmental issues. Unfortunately, the Forest and Landscape Restoration programme that underpins the Bonn Challenge, as its name suggests, remains focused on trees and forests, despite rising evidence that many non‐forest ecosystems also offer strong restoration potential for biodiversity and climate mitigation. We see a need for restoration to step back to be more inclusive of different ecosystem types and to step up to provide integrated scientific knowledge to inform large‐scale restoration. Stepping back and up will require assessments of where to restore what species, with recognition that in many landscapes multiple habitat types should be restored. In the process, trade‐offs in the delivery of different ecosystem services (e.g. carbon, biodiversity, water, albedo, livestock forage) should be clearly addressed. We recommend that biodiversity safeguards be included in policy and implemented in practice, to avoid undermining the biophysical relationships that provide ecosystem resilience to climate change. For ecological restoration to contribute to international policy goals will require integrated large‐scale science that works across biome boundaries.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000353932",,"1061-2971||1526-100X",,"10.1111/rec.12989","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/353932","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Anthropocene||Biodiversity||Carbon storage||Ecological restoration||Ecosystem service||Multifunctional landscapes||Restoration ecology||Sustainability||Stakeholders","Step back from the forest and step up to the Bonn Challenge: how a broad ecological perspective can promote successful landscape restoration",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-07-19T02:38:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85068765295",,"000474808600002","Restor.

Considering the distribution of beech forests on soils encompassing a broad range of nutrient availability, we hypothesized that this tree species exhibits high phenotypic plasticity allowing it to alter mass, and nutrient allocation in response to local nutrient availability. To test this, we grew two groups of 12–15 year old beech saplings originating from sites with high and low soil P availability for 2 years in mineral soil from their own site and in soil from the other site. After two growing seasons, P concentrations in leaves and stem, as well as mass allocation to leaves and fine roots were affected by both soil and plant origin. By contrast, relative P allocation to leaves and fine roots, as well as P concentrations in fine roots, were determined almost entirely by the experimental soil. Independent of the P nutritional status defined as average concentration of P in the whole plant, which still clearly reflected the soil conditions at the site of plant origin, relative P allocation to leaves was a particularly good indicator of P availability in the experimental soil. Furthermore, a high plasticity of this plant trait was indicated by a large difference between plants growing in the two experimental soils. This suggests a strong ability of beech to alter resource allocation in response to specific soil conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000349174",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2019.00744","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/349174","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Acclimation||Beech||Fagus sylvatica||Forest health||Phenotypic plasticity||Phosphorus allocation||Phosphorus nutritional status||Soil phosphorus availability","Phosphorus Allocation to Leaves of Beech Saplings Reacts to Soil Phosphorus Availability",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-06-22T04:08:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85068459373",,"000471129200001","Front.

Breeding for ALS resistance is difficult due to the extensive virulence diversity of P. griseola and the recurrent appearance of new virulent races. Five major loci, Phg-1 to Phg-5, conferring ALS resistance have been named, and markers tightly linked to these loci have been reported. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have also been described, but the validation of some QTLs is still pending. The Phg-1, Phg-4, and Phg-5 loci are from common bean cultivars of the Andean gene pool, whereas Phg-2 and Phg-3 are from beans of the Mesoamerican gene pool. The reference genome of common bean and high-throughput sequencing technologies are enabling the development of molecular markers closely linked to the Phg loci, more accurate mapping of the resistance loci, and the comparison of their genomic positions. The objective of this report is to provide a comprehensive review of ALS resistance in common bean. Furthermore, we are reporting three case studies of ALS resistance breeding in Latin America and Africa. This review will serve as a reference for future resistance mapping studies and as a guide for the selection of resistance loci in breeding programs aiming to develop common bean cultivars with durable ALS resistance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000353106",,"0011-183X",,"10.2135/cropsci2018.09.0596","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/353106","en","Crop Science Society of America","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A Review of Angular Leaf Spot Resistance in Common Bean",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-07-14T02:13:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85067875655",,"000473171700003","Crop sci.","4","Crop Science","59","::ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Following exit from diapause, the embryo rapidly elongates and subsequently implants. In diapausing carnivores and marsupials, resumption of embryonic growth is regulated by ovarian steroid hormones. In the roe deer, the role of steroid hormones is not known to date. In the present study, progesterone (P4), estradiol-17β (E2) and total estrogens (Etot) were determined in blood plasma and endometrium of roe deer shot in the course of regular huntings between September and December. Steroid hormone concentrations were correlated to the corresponding size of the embryo derived from ex vivo uterine flushing and to the date of sampling. The mean plasma concentrations of P4 (5.4 ± 0.2 ng/ml, mean ± SE, N = 87), E2 (24.3 ± 2.6 pg/ml, N = 86) and Etot (21.7 ± 2.6 pg/ml, N = 78) remained constant over the sampling period and were not correlated to embryonic size. Likewise, endometrial concentrations of P4 (66.1 ± 6.5 ng/ml), E2 (284.0 ± 24.43 pg/ml) and, Etot (440.9 ± 24.43 pg/ml) showed no changes over time. Therefore, it was concluded that ovarian steroid hormones do not play a determining role in resumption of embryonic growth following the period of diapause in the roe deer.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000354200",,"1642-431X",,"10.1016/j.repbio.2019.04.003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/354200","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Progesterone||Estradiol-17β||Estrogens||Endometrium||Embryo elongation","Do ovarian steroid hormones control the resumption of embryonic growth following the period of diapause in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-07-20T02:52:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Embryonic Diapause in roe deer: a model for deciphering the control of developmental velocity","159734","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85066089699",,"000499924600007","Reprod Biol","2","Reproductive Biology","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In addition, the influence of housing system, floor type and air temperature on NH3 and CH4 emissions is statistically analysed using the wide range of data provided by various studies. A number of overviews of NH3 and CH4 emission data differentiated according to dairy housing system and season exhibit wide ranges of emission data both between and within individual studies. Although differences in both farm conditions (e.g. herd size, breed, animal productivity, area ratios, ventilation, feeding strategy, management) and measurement concept (e.g. analytics, methods, measurement duration, single farm vs. several farms) make data comparison difficult, clear effects on NH3 and CH4 emissions can be demonstrated. The NH3 emissions of tied housing are lower than those of loose housing systems with cubicles (p = 0.001). Furthermore, within the ‘loose housing system with cubicles’ category, air temperature influences both NH3 (p < 0.001) and CH4 (p < 0.001) emissions. As the air temperature rises, so do the emissions. This also leads to a close positive correlation between NH3 and CH4 emissions (r = 0.80). There are no differences for either NH3 or CH4 emissions (p = 0.76 and p = 0.49, respectively) between the ‘perforated’ and ‘solid’ floor types in loose housing systems with cubicles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000337184",,"1537-5129||1537-5110",,"10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2019.03.012","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/337184","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Tied housing||Loose housing||Solid floor||Perforated floor||Influencing factors","Effects of housing system, floor type and temperature on ammonia and methane emissions from dairy farming: A meta-analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-04-10T07:03:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85063984516",,"000470050700002",,,"Biosystems Engineering","182","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In cranberries, phytoplasma infection causes false blossom disease, which is transmitted by leafhoppers. We hypothesized that changes in plant chemistry induced by phytoplasma infection might affect the performance and feeding behavior not only of vectors but also of other phytophagous insects. To test this, we measured growth, survival, and the number of leaves damaged by larvae of three common non-vector herbivores: spotted fireworm (Choristoneura parallela Robinson), Sparganothis fruitworm (Sparganothis sulfureana Clemens), and gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) on phytoplasma-infected and uninfected cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.). We also assessed the effects of phytoplasma infection on nutrients and phytochemistry related to defenses. In general, larvae of all three herbivore species grew 2–3 times bigger, and damaged 1.5–3.5 times more leaves, while feeding on infected vs. uninfected plants. Survival of Sparganothis fruitworm larvae was also ~1.5 times higher on infected plants, while spotted fireworm and gypsy moth larval survival was not affected. In a long-term (5-week) assay, gypsy moth larval survival and mass were enhanced when feeding on phytoplasma-infected leaves. Levels of important plant nutrients (e.g., N, P, K, Ca, S, Mn, Fe, B, Al, and Na) were higher in infected plants, while levels of defensive proanthocyanidins were reduced by 20–40% compared to uninfected plants. In contrast, levels of Mg were lower in infected plants, while concentrations of Cu, Zn, and defensive flavonols were not affected. Taken together, these findings suggest that phytoplasma infection enhances plant nutritional quality, while reducing plant defenses in cranberries. These effects, in turn, may explain the observed enhancement of non-vector herbivore performance, as well as the higher number of damaged leaves, on infected plants. Improved understanding of the ecology of pathogen-plant-herbivore interactions could aid efforts to enhance plant resistance and suppress disease transmission in agricultural settings.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000346143",,"2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2019.00181","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/346143","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Vaccinium macrocarpon||spotted fireworm||Sparganothis fruitworm||gypsy moth||host manipulation||nutrients||flavonoids","Phytoplasma Infection of Cranberries Benefits Non-vector Phytophagous Insects",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-06-07T03:02:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000468790700001","Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Because a linear reference genome represents only a small fraction of all the DNA sequence variation within a species, reference allele bias may occur at highly polymorphic or divergent regions of the genome. Graph-based methods facilitate the comparison of sequencing reads to a variation-aware genome graph, which incorporates a collection of non-redundant DNA sequences that segregate within a species. We compared the accuracy and sensitivity of graph-based sequence variant genotyping using the Graphtyper software to two widely-used methods, i.e., GATK and SAMtools, which rely on linear reference genomes using whole-genome sequencing data from 49 Original Braunvieh cattle. Results  We discovered 21,140,196, 20,262,913, and 20,668,459 polymorphic sites using GATK, Graphtyper, and SAMtools, respectively. Comparisons between sequence variant genotypes and microarray-derived genotypes showed that Graphtyper outperformed both GATK and SAMtools in terms of genotype concordance, non-reference sensitivity, and non-reference discrepancy. The sequence variant genotypes that were obtained using Graphtyper had the smallest number of Mendelian inconsistencies between sequence-derived single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels in nine sire-son pairs. Genotype phasing and imputation using the Beagle software improved the quality of the sequence variant genotypes for all the tools evaluated, particularly for animals that were sequenced at low coverage. Following imputation, the concordance between sequence- and microarray-derived genotypes was almost identical for the three methods evaluated, i.e., 99.32, 99.46, and 99.24% for GATK, Graphtyper, and SAMtools, respectively. Variant filtration based on commonly used criteria improved genotype concordance slightly but it also decreased sensitivity. Graphtyper required considerably more computing resources than SAMtools but less than GATK. Conclusions  Sequence variant genotyping using Graphtyper is accurate, sensitive and computationally feasible in cattle.

In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, integrated robotic cable-driven sensing system developed at University of Nebraska for field phenotyping research. It is constructed to collect data from a 0.4ha field. The system has a sensor payload of 30kg and offers the flexibility to integrate user defined sensing modules. Currently it integrates a four-band multispectral camera, a thermal infrared camera, a 3D scanning LiDAR, and a portable visible near-infrared spectrometer for plant measurements. Software is designed and developed for instrument control, task planning, and motion control, which enables precise and flexible phenotypic data collection at the plot level. The system also includes a variable-rate subsurface drip irrigation to control water application rates, and an automated weather station to log environmental variables. The system has been in operation for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. We demonstrate that the system is reliable and robust, and that fully automated data collection is feasible. Sensor and image data are of high quality in comparison to the ground truth measurements, and capture various aspects of plant traits such as height, ground cover and spectral reflectance. We present two novel datasets enabled by the system, including a plot-level thermal infrared image time-series during a day, and the signal of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence from canopy reflectance. It is anticipated that the availability of this automated phenotyping system will benefit research in field phenotyping, remote sensing, agronomy, and related disciplines.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000332520",,"0168-1699||1872-7107","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/332766||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/332520","10.1016/j.compag.2019.03.009","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/333363","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Image analysis||Multispectral imagery||Thermal infrared imagery||LiDAR||Reflectance spectra","NU-Spidercam: A large-scale, cable-driven, integrated sensing and robotic system for advanced phenotyping, remote sensing, and agronomic research",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-03-20T09:40:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85062832872",,"000467513000009","Comput. electron. agric.",,"Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","160","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Models can test how legumes can be used to meet environmental and production goals, but many models used to simulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from grasslands have either a poor representation of grass-legume mixtures and BNF, or poor validation of these features. Our objective is to examine how such systems are currently represented in two process-based biogeochemical models, APSIM and DayCent, when compared against an experimental dataset with different grass-legume mixtures at three nitrogen (N) fertiliser rates. Here, we propose a novel approach for coupling DayCent, a single species model to APSIM, a multi-species model, to increase the capability of DayCent when representing a range of grass-legume fractions. While dependent on specific assumptions, both models can capture the key aspects of the grass-legume growth, including biomass production and BNF and to correctly simulate the interactions between changing legume and grass fractions, particularly mixtures with a high clover fraction. Our work suggests that single species models should not be used for grass-legume mixtures beyond about 30% legume content, unless using a similar approach to that adopted here.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000338804",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/311671||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338804","10.1016/j.eja.2019.03.008","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338804","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nitrogen uptake||Species composition||Model validation||Overyielding","Modelling biological N fixation and grass-legume dynamics with process-based biogeochemical models of varying complexity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-12-18T13:08:46Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85063964203",,"000467509300007",,,"European Journal of Agronomy","106","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The study aimed to examine the dynamics of changes in mineral composition and deposition rates in the empty body (EB) from birth to 140 kg BW depending on dietary protein supply. In the experiment, 66 entire male, 58 castrated and 66 female Swiss Large White pigs were used to determine body composition at birth, 10, 20 kg and at 20 kg intervals from 40 to 140 kg BW. From 20 kg BW, they had either ad libitum access to a control grower and finisher diet or a grower and finisher diet containing 80% CP, lysine, methione+cystine, threonine and tryptophan of the control diet. Each EB fraction (carcass, organs and empty intestines, blood and bile) was weighed and analyzed for water, ash, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, potassium, sodium, copper, iron, manganese and zinc contents. Allometric relationships between the amount of each mineral in the EB and the EB weight (EBW) were fitted. The R2 of the allometric equations was above 0.92, except for copper and manganese (below 0.33), revealing the EBW as an excellent explanatory variable of the analyzed amounts. The copper and manganese composition in the EB were extremely low and variable which explain the low R2. Except for zinc, all mineral relative deposition rates decreased with increasing EBW. The amount of ash, calcium and phosphorus in the EB was not affected by the diet, but when expressed relative to body protein these minerals were increased when pigs were fed the low protein diet. This suggests an independent protein deposition and bone mineralization when animals are fed diets limiting in protein content. The diet also affected the amount of potassium in the EB which was greater when the low protein diet was fed. The gender only affected the amounts of potassium and sodium in the EB which were greater in entire males. Entire males had also greater amounts of water in the EB, which may explain the observed effect of gender on these two electrolytes.

This study presents findings of a survey that assessed public acceptance within Msunduzi, Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa towards the use of nitrified urine fertilizer. Results indicate that in general attitudes were much more positive towards the use of nitrified urine fertilizer than raw urine as a soil amendment. Residents living within rural zones of the municipality (78.5%), as opposed to urban (65.7%) and peri-urban (65.2%), and younger individuals within the sampled population were found to be the most receptive to the use of nitrified urine fertilizer.

For this reason, the European cooperation in science and technology (COST) Action ES1309 OPTIMISE has compiled three papers on instrument characterization, measurement setups and protocols, and retrieval methods (current paper). This study is divided in two sections; first, we evaluated the uncertainties in SIF retrieval methods (e.g., Fraunhofer line depth (FLD) approaches and spectral fitting method (SFM)) for a combination of off-the-shelf commercial spectrometers. Secondly, we evaluated how an erroneous implementation of the retrieval methods increases the uncertainty in the estimated SIF values. Results show that the SFM approach applied to high-resolution spectra provided the most reliable SIF retrieval with a relative error (RE) ≤6% and <5% for F687 and F760, respectively. Furthermore, although the SFM was the least affected by an inaccurate definition of the absorption spectral window (RE = 5%) and/or interpolation strategy (RE = 15–30%), we observed a sensitivity of the SIF retrieval for the simulated training data underlying the SFM model implementation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000340342",,"2072-4292","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340342||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/341310","10.3390/rs11080962","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/341533","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence||Ground spectrometers||Retrieval methods","Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence III: Benchmarking retrieval methods and sensor characteristics for proximal sensing",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-05-02T10:01:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85065018300",,"000467646800072","Remote Sens.","8","Remote Sensing","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The European COST Action ES1309 “Innovative optical tools for proximal sensing of ecophysiological processes” (OPTIMISE, ES1309; https://optimise.dcs.aber.ac.uk/) has produced three manuscripts addressing the main current challenges in this field. This article provides a framework to model the impact of different instrument noise and bias on the retrieval of SIF; and to assess uncertainty requirements for the calibration and characterization of state-of-the-art SIF-oriented spectroradiometers. We developed a sensor simulator capable of reproducing biases and noises usually found in field spectroradiometers. First the sensor simulator was calibrated and characterized using synthetic datasets of known uncertainties defined from laboratory measurements and literature. Secondly, we used the sensor simulator and the characterized sensor models to simulate the acquisition of atmospheric and vegetation radiances from a synthetic dataset. Each of the sensor models predicted biases with propagated uncertainties that modified the simulated measurements as a function of different factors. Finally, the impact of each sensor model on SIF retrieval was analyzed. Results show that SIF retrieval can be significantly affected in situations where reflectance factors are barely modified. SIF errors were found to correlate with drivers of instrumental-induced biases which are as also drivers of plant physiology. This jeopardizes not only the retrieval of SIF, but also the understanding of its relationship with vegetation function, the study of diel and seasonal cycles and the validation of remote sensing SIF products. Further work is needed to determine the optimal requirements in terms of sensor design, characterization and signal correction for SIF retrieval by proximal sensing. In addition, evaluation/validation methods to characterize and correct instrumental responses should be developed and used to test sensors performance in operational conditions","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000340340",,"2072-4292","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340340||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/342540","10.3390/rs11080960","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/344466","en","MDPI AG","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence||spectroradiometer||sensor model||uncertainty||error","Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence I: Instrumental considerations for proximal spectroradiometers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-05-02T09:57:37Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85065013742",,"000467646800070","Remote Sens.","8","Remote Sensing","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

With the increasing availability of high-resolution spectroradiometers, it has become feasible to measure fine spectral features, such as those needed to estimate sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F), which is a signal related to the photosynthetic process of plants. The measurement of F requires highly accurate and precise radiance measurements in combination with very sophisticated measurement protocols. Additionally, because F has a highly dynamic nature (compared with other vegetation information derived from spectral data) and low signal intensity, several environmental, physiological, and experimental aspects have to be considered during signal acquisition and are key for its reliable interpretation. The European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action ES1309 OPTIMISE has produced three articles addressing the main challenges in the field of F measurements. In this paper, which is the second of three, we review approaches that are available to measure F from the leaf to the canopy scale using ground-based and airborne platforms. We put specific emphasis on instrumental aspects, measurement setups, protocols, quality checks, and data processing strategies. Furthermore, we review existing techniques that account for atmospheric influences on F retrieval, address spatial scaling effects, and assess quality checks and the metadata and ancillary data required to reliably interpret retrieved F signals.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000340341",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs11080927","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340341","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sun-induced fluorescence||Spectroradiometer||Spectrometer||Vegetation||Radiance||Reflectance||Remote sensing||FLEX","Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence II: Review of Passive Measurement Setups, Protocols, and Their Application at the Leaf to Canopy Level",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-05-02T09:58:30Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000467646800037","Remote Sens.","8","Remote Sensing","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Two young Nordic Red bulls delivered sperm with low progressive motility (i.e., asthenospermia) during a semen collection period of more than four months. The bulls were related through a common ancestor on both their paternal and maternal ancestry. Thus, a recessive mode of inheritance of asthenospermia was suspected.  Results Both bulls were genotyped at 54,001 SNPs using the Illumina BovineSNP50 Bead chip. A scan for autozygosity revealed that they were identical by descent for a 2.98 Mb segment located on bovine chromosome 25. This haplotype was not found in the homozygous state in 8557 fertile bulls although five homozygous haplotype carriers were expected (P = 0.018). Whole genome-sequencing uncovered that both asthenospermic bulls were homozygous for a mutation that disrupts a canonical 5′ splice donor site of CCDC189 encoding the coiled-coil domain containing protein 189. Transcription analysis showed that the derived allele activates a cryptic splice site resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of translation. The mutated CCDC189 protein is truncated by more than 40%, thus lacking the flagellar C1a complex subunit C1a-32 that is supposed to modulate the physiological movement of the sperm flagella. The mutant allele occurs at a frequency of 2.5% in Nordic Red cattle.  Conclusions Our study in cattle uncovered that CCDC189 is required for physiological movement of sperm flagella thus enabling active progression of spermatozoa and fertilization. A direct gene test may be implemented to monitor the asthenospermia-associated allele and prevent the birth of homozygous bulls that are infertile. Our results have been integrated in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA) database (https://omia.org/OMIA002167/9913/).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000337665",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-019-5628-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/337665","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Male infertility||Sterility||Immotile sperm||Cattle||CCDC189","A splice donor variant in CCDC189 is associated with asthenospermia in Nordic Red dairy cattle",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-04-11T15:28:41Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064220235",,"000464835700007","BMC Genomics","1","BMC Genomics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We evaluated (1) the extent of indirect selection of root traits during the last century of wheat breeding and (2) how it affected the variety performance under well-watered conditions compared to gradually developing drought stress. Fourteen bread wheat genotypes covering 100 years of Swiss wheat breeding were grown in 1.6 m tall columns in the greenhouse under well-watered and drought conditions. Root parameters, such as rooting depth and root biomass and above ground parameters were determined at flowering and maturity. Rooting depth showed a negative trend in response to year of release under well-watered conditions but not under early water stress. Modern varieties responded with enhanced root allocation to deeper soil layers. Consequently, rooting depth was positively correlated with plant height at well-watered conditions but not under early water stress. Considerable genetic variation for rooting depth among modern varieties indicates that the trait is selectable without strong alteration of plant height. We conclude that modern varieties adjusted rooting depth to water demand.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000338534",,"0014-2336||1573-5060",,"10.1007/s10681-019-2404-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338534","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Breeding||Drought||Rooting depth||Semi-dwarf||Wheat","Modern wheat semi-dwarfs root deep on demand: response of rooting depth to drought in a set of Swiss era wheats covering 100 years of breeding",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-04-18T00:48:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Agricultural management and below ground carbon inputs - Sustaining soil quality","143060","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 68: Gesuch",,,,"85064054100",,"000463829100001","Euphytica (Wagening.)","4","Euphytica","215","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In spite of this, caterpillars with highly diverse life histories appear to lack resident microbiota. Gut physiology, endogenous digestive enzymes, and limited social interactions may contribute to this pattern, but the consequences of shifts in social activity and diet on caterpillar microbiota are largely unknown. Phengaris alcon caterpillars undergo particularly dramatic social and dietary shifts when they parasitize Myrmica ant colonies, rapidly transitioning from solitary herbivory to ant tending (i.e., receiving protein‐rich regurgitations through trophallaxis). This unique life history provides a model for studying interactions between social living, diet, and caterpillar microbiota. Here, we characterized and compared bacterial communities within P. alcon caterpillars before and after their association with ants, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR. After being adopted by ants, bacterial communities within P. alcon caterpillars shifted substantially, with a significant increase in alpha diversity and greater consistency in bacterial community composition in terms of beta dissimilarity. We also characterized the bacterial communities within their host ants (Myrmica schencki), food plant (Gentiana cruciata), and soil from ant nest chambers. These data indicated that the aforementioned patterns were influenced by bacteria derived from caterpillars’ surrounding environments, rather than through transfers from ants. Thus, while bacterial communities are substantially reorganized over the life cycle of P. alcon caterpillars, it appears that they do not rely on transfers of bacteria from host ants to complete their development.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000340605",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.5010","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340605","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","16S amplicon sequencing||butterflies||Lepidoptera||Lycaenidae||myrmecophily||Spiroplasma","Bacterial communities within Phengaris (Maculinea) alcon caterpillars are shifted following transition from solitary living to social parasitism of Myrmica ant colonies",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-05-04T01:08:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064824814",,,"Ecol Evol","8","Ecology and Evolution","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Its yield, quality and persistency can significantly be reduced by bacterial wilt, a serious disease caused by Xanthomonas translucens pv. graminis. Although a major QTL for bacterial wilt resistance has previously been reported, detailed knowledge on underlying genes and DNA markers to allow for efficient resistance breeding strategies is currently not available. We used pooled DNA sequencing to characterize a major QTL for bacterial wilt resistance of Italian ryegrass and to develop inexpensive sequence-based markers to efficiently target resistance alleles for marker-assisted recurrent selection. From the mapping population segregating for the QTL, DNA of 44 of the most resistant and 44 of the most susceptible F1 individuals was pooled and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Allele frequencies of 18 × 106 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were determined in the resistant and susceptible pool. A total of 271 SNPs on 140 scaffold sequences of the reference parental genome showed significantly different allele frequencies in both pools. We converted 44 selected SNPs to KASP™ markers, genetically mapped these proximal to the major QTL and thus validated their association with bacterial wilt resistance. This study highlights the power of pooled DNA sequencing to efficiently target binary traits in biparental mapping populations. It delivers genome sequence data, SNP markers and potential candidate genes which will allow to implement marker-assisted strategies to fix bacterial wilt resistance in outcrossing breeding populations of Italian ryegrass.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000308014",,"0040-5752||1432-2242",,"10.1007/s00122-018-3250-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/308014","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Pooled DNA sequencing to identify SNPs associated with a major QTL for bacterial wilt resistance in Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-12-03T07:34:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85057600387",,"000463674000008","Theor Appl Genet","4","Theoretical and Applied Genetics","132","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Since decades, their importance for the agriculture of temperate regions led to the development of new varieties through traditional breeding programs. However, newer crop improvement methods such as genomic selection could benefit from a high-quality reference genome assembly. In the past, attempts at producing genomic resources have struggled due to the complexity of the genome and the outcrossing nature of the species. We sequenced an individual of the L. multiflorum (Italian ryegrass) cv. Rabiosa, producing a highly-contiguous and complete assembly. Due to the high heterozygosity of the genotype, the resulting assembly was as large as the diploid genome, thus presenting the sequence of both alleles in separate collinear scaffolds. The generation of large-scale scaffolding datasets (i.e. chromosome conformation capture data and optical maps) allowed to phase sequences, reaching chromosome-level contiguity. The comparison of the two allelic sequences for a region showed an extensive amount of intergenic sequence variation, confirming that ryegrass genomes are highly dynamic. The high-quality genome assembly of the cv. Rabiosa is the first phased diploid assembly of a plant genome and provides a high-quality reference for expediting ryegrass breeding and studying the genome biology of outcrossing species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000355612",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/355612","en",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"A ~phased diploid genome assembly of Italian ryegrass",,"Other Conference Item","Open access","GRC2019 Gatersleben Research Conference - Applied Bioinformatics for Crops, 18-20 March, 2019, Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK), Gatersleben.

On the one hand, studies of plant–plant interactions rarely consider how plants interact with other trophic levels such as pollinators. On the other, studies of plant–animal interactions rarely deal with interactions within trophic levels such as plant–plant competition and facilitation. Thus, to what degree plant interactions affect biodiversity and ecological networks across trophic levels is poorly understood. We manipulated plant communities driven by foundation species facilitation and sampled plant–pollinator networks at fine spatial scale in a field experiment in Sierra Nevada, Spain. We found that plant–plant facilitation shaped pollinator diversity and structured pollination networks. Nonadditive effects of plant interactions on pollinator diversity and interaction diversity were synergistic in one foundation species networks while they were additive in another foundation species. Nonadditive effects of plant interactions were due to rewiring of pollination interactions. In addition, plant facilitation had negative effects on the structure of pollination networks likely due to increase in plant competition for pollination. Our results empirically demonstrate how different network types are coupled, revealing pervasive consequences of interaction chains in diverse communities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000315764",,"0012-9658||1939-9170",,"10.1002/ecy.2619","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/315764","en","Wiley","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Ecological networks||Biodiversity||plant interaction||Pollinator","Plant interactions shape pollination networks via nonadditive effects",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-01-15T09:12:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85061225332",,"000460163500012","Ecol.","3","Ecology","100","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Investigating these variations is important for making predictions regarding the dynamics of plant communities and carbon pools under global change. We conducted this study across 433 shrubland sites in northern China. We fitted structural equation models (SEMs) to analyze the variation in the species‐richness–biomass relationships of shrubs and herbs along a wetness gradient and general liner models (GLMs) to analyze how shrub or herb biomass affected the species‐richness–biomass relationship of the other life form. We found that the positive species‐richness–biomass relationships for both shrubs and herbs became weaker or even negative with higher water availability, likely indicating stronger interspecific competition within life forms under more benign conditions. After accounting for variation in environmental contexts using residual regression, we found that the benign effect of greater facilitation by a larger shrub biomass reduced the positive species‐richness–biomass relationships of herbs, causing them to become nonsignificant. Different levels of herb biomass, however, did not change the species‐richness–biomass relationship of shrubs, possibly because greater herb biomass did not alter the stress level for shrubs. We conclude that biodiversity in the studied plant communities is particularly important for plant biomass production under arid conditions and that it might be possible to use shrubs as nurse plants to facilitate understory herb establishment in ecological restoration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000330240",,"0012-9658||1939-9170",,"10.1002/ecy.2624","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/330240","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationship||biomass||competition||facilitation||shrub density||shrublands||water availability","Increasing water availability and facilitation weaken biodiversity–biomass relationships in shrublands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-03-09T03:41:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85062282752",,,"Ecol.","3","Ecology","100","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, responses of ^13C fractionations to diel variation in starch metabolism in the leaf are not fully understood. Here we measured δ^13C of organic matter (δ^13COM), concentrations and δ^13C of potential respiratory substrates, δ^13C of dark-respired CO_2 (δ^13CR), and gas exchange in leaves of starch-deficient plastidial phosphoglucomutase (pgm) mutants and wild-type plants of four species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, Nicotiana sylvestris, and Pisum sativum). The strongest δ^13C response to the pgm-induced starch deficiency was observed in N. sylvestris, with more negative δ^13COM, δ^13CR, and δ^13C values for assimilates (i.e. sugars and starch) and organic acids (i.e. malate and citrate) in pgm mutants than in wild-type plants during a diel cycle. The genotype differences in δ^13C values could be largely explained by differences in leaf gas exchange. In contrast, the PGM-knockout effect on post-photosynthetic ^13C fractionations via the plastidic fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase reaction or during respiration was small. Taken together, our results show that the δ^13C variations in starch-deficient mutants are primarily explained by photosynthetic ^13C fractionations and that the combination of knockout mutants and isotope analyses allows additional insights into plant metabolism.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000338761",,"1460-2431||0022-0957",,"10.1093/jxb/erz045","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338761","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Assimilates||Carbon allocation||Carbon storage||Ecophysiology||Isotope effect||Metabolic fluxes||Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs)||Plant respiration||Starch-deficient mutant (SDM)||Starchless mutant","Influence of starch deficiency on photosynthetic and   post-photosynthetic carbon isotope fractionations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-04-19T01:39:12Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Carbon isotope fractionation during respiration: Mechanisms and environmental drivers||Carbon isotope fractionation during leaf and root respiration as a function of nitrogen nutrition","132768||153545","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projekte MINT",,,,"85063963474",,"000464943900012","J.

By resilience, we mean the ability of a food system to withstand stress and shocks, recover, and adapt to change. In this study, we examined the resilience of food systems, firstly, by compiling the risks perceived by different food system actors in the Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia, and the northwestern Mount Kenya Region, Kenya—two regions that are important to their respective national food supply. Secondly, we evaluated whether and under what circumstances these perceptions translate into adaptive or preventive strategies that benefit food system resilience. Among all actors, the most frequently perceived risks relate to production levels. Further, the many (sometimes contradictory) perceptions of risk and uncertainty among different actor groups do not necessarily translate into adaptation strategies. Reasons for this include structural factors as well as the “risk perception paradox”, particularly regarding preventive strategies. However, we also observed many implicit strategies illustrating how different actors develop responses within their possibilities. However, most such strategies were insufficient to mitigate, much less to adapt to, the perceived risks. To build resilience, existing innovative policies need to be enforced in both countries. These include disaster risk reduction programs and programs to reduce the vulnerability of marginalized groups who are crucial to food systems, such as smallholder farmers, pastoralists, and food workers.",,,,"1436-3798||1436-378X",,"10.1007/s10113-018-1448-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507619","en","Springer",,,"Food systems||Resilience||Risk perceptions||Strategies||Bolivia||Kenya","Actor-specific risk perceptions and strategies for resilience building in different food systems in Kenya and Bolivia",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-09-29T11:17:15Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Reg Environ Change","3","Regional Environmental Change","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In order to develop efficient breeding strategies to improve drought tolerance, accurate methods to identify when a plant reduces growth as a consequence of water deficit have yet to be established. In perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), an important forage grass of the Poaceae family, leaf elongation is a key factor determining plant growth and hence forage yield. Although leaf elongation has been shown to be temperature-dependent under non-stress conditions, the impact of water limitation on leaf elongation in perennial ryegrass is poorly understood. We describe a method for quantifying tolerance to water deficit based on leaf elongation in relation to temperature and soil moisture in perennial ryegrass. With decreasing soil moisture, three growth response phases were identified: first, a “normal” phase where growth is mainly determined by temperature, second a “slow” phase where leaf elongation decreases proportionally to soil water potential and third an “arrest” phase where leaf growth terminates. A custom R function was able to quantify the points which demarcate these phases and can be used to describe the response of plants to water deficit. Applied to different perennial ryegrass genotypes, this function revealed significant genotypic variation in the response of leaf growth to temperature and soil moisture. Dynamic phenotyping of leaf elongation can be used as a tool to accurately quantify tolerance to water deficit in perennial ryegrass and to improve this trait by breeding. Moreover, the tools presented here are applicable to study the plant response to other stresses in species with linear, graminoid leaf morphology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000336584",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2019.00344","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/336584","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","drought tolerance||leaf elongation rate (LER)||monocots||leaf growth||perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)||phenotyping||tri-phase function||water deficit","Phenotyping a Dynamic Trait: Leaf Growth of Perennial Ryegrass Under Water Limiting Conditions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-04-06T01:20:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064212706",,"000462470900001","Front.

Due to temporal dynamics in climate and vegetation activity, there are significant regional variations in carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between the biosphere and atmosphere in forests that are affecting the global C cycle. Current forest CO2 flux dynamics are controlled by instantaneous climate, soil, and vegetation conditions, which carry legacy effects from disturbances and extreme climate events. Our level of understanding from the legacies of these processes on net CO2 fluxes is still limited due to their complexities and their long-term effects. Here, we combined remote sensing, climate, and eddy-covariance flux data to study net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) at 185 forest sites globally. Instead of commonly used non-dynamic statistical methods, we employed a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), called Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) that captures information from the vegetation and climate’s temporal dynamics. The resulting data-driven model integrates interannual and seasonal variations of climate and vegetation by using Landsat and climate data at each site. The presented LSTM algorithm was able to effectively describe the overall seasonal variability (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE = 0.66) and across-site (NSE = 0.42) variations in NEE, while it had less success in predicting specific seasonal and interannual anomalies (NSE = 0.07). This analysis demonstrated that an LSTM approach with embedded climate and vegetation memory effects outperformed a non-dynamic statistical model (i.e. Random Forest) for estimating NEE. Additionally, it is shown that the vegetation mean seasonal cycle embeds most of the information content to realistically explain the spatial and seasonal variations in NEE. These findings show the relevance of capturing memory effects from both climate and vegetation in quantifying spatio-temporal variations in forest NEE.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000325091",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0211510","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/325091","en","Public Library of Science","CC0 1.0 Universal","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/",,"Memory effects of climate and vegetation affecting net ecosystem CO2 fluxes in global forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-02-14T03:49:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85061122422",,"000457874000068","PLoS ONE","2","PLoS ONE","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, there remains a dirth of datasets following plant growth under stress conditions along with methods for inferring them using only remotely sensed data, especially under a combination of multiple stress factors such as drought, weeds and nutrient deficiency. Such stress factors and their combinations are commonly encountered during crop production and being able to accurately detect and treat such stress conditions in an automated and timely manner can provide a major boost to farm yields with minimal resource input.  Results We present a generic framework for remote plant stress phenotyping that consists of a dataset with spatio-temporal-spectral data following sugarbeet crop growth under optimal, drought, low and surplus nitrogen fertilization, and weed stress conditions, along with a machine learning based methodology for systematically inferring these stress conditions from the remotely measured data. The dataset contains biweekly color images, infra-red stereo image pairs and hyperspectral camera images along with applied treatment parameters and environmental factors like temperature and humidity, collected over two months. We present a plant agnostic methodology for deriving plant trait indicators such as canopy cover, height, hyperspectral reflectance and vegetation indices along with a spectral 3D reconstruction of the plants from the raw data to serve as a benchmark. Additionally, we provide fresh and dry weight measurements for both the above (canopy) and below (beet) ground biomass at the end of the growing period to serve as indicators of expected yield. We further describe a data driven, machine learning based method to infer water, Nitrogen and weed stress using the derived plant trait indicators. We use the plant trait indicators to evaluate 8 different classification approaches from which the best classifier achieved a mean cross validation accuracy of ≈ 93, 76 and 83% for drought, nitrogen and weed stress severity classification respectively. We also show that our multi-modal approach significantly improves classifier performance over using any single modality.  Conclusion The presented framework and dataset can serve as a valuable reference for creating and comparing processing pipelines which extract plant trait indicators and infer prevalent stress factors from remote sensing data under a variety of environments and cropping conditions. These techniques can then be deployed on farm machinery or robots enabling automated, precise and timely corrective interventions for maximising yield.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000325081",,"1746-4811",,"10.1186/s13007-019-0398-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/325081","en","Biomed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Phenotyping||Plant-stress||Nitrogen||Weed||Water||Dataset||Multispectral||3D","A spatio temporal spectral framework for plant stress phenotyping",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-02-14T03:47:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Aerial Data Collection and Analysis, and Automated Ground Intervention for Precision Farming","644227||644227","10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100007352","SBFI||SBFI","H2020||H2020",,,,"85061161252",,"000458543400001","Plant methods","1","Plant Methods","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02130 - Dep.

To this end, we codesigned and conducted a food system mapping process in 2 regions, one in Kenya and the other in Bolivia, that stretches frommountains to lowlands and involves sites of interconnected food system strategies related to these habitats. We adapted an existing method of mapping local food webs to an approach that subdivides food systems into 4 subsystems: operational, political, information and services, and natural resources. Through the mapping process, a group of local and external researchers and practitioners identified the most important food value chains in the study areas. They also identified the value chains' reach, as well as related actors; flows ofknowledge, information, and finance; and the natural resources the food systems depend on. A power/interest matrix complemented the mapping results with information about different actors' roles in the food systems; this can help to identify the best target groups and entry points for efforts to improve the sustainability of food systems in the diverse habitats forming part of these food systems. Mapping and a brief analysis of actors and interests are first steps toward assessing the sustainability of a food system. The participatory nature of our approach enhanced coordination between projects of research and practice and helped to increase the relevance and applicability of the mapping results and related activities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507620",,"0276-4741||1994-7151",,"10.1659/mrd-journal-d-18-00024.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507620","en","International Mountain Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Mapping Food Systems: A Participatory Research Tool Tested in Kenya and Bolivia",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-09-29T11:20:05Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mt. res. dev.","1","Mountain Research and Development","39","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, beans are frequently attacked by pests and diseases. One of the most devastating fungal bean diseases is angular leaf spot (ALS), responsible for yield losses of up to 80%. Although pathotype-specificity of ALS resistance has been reported in common bean, little is known about the efficiency of resistance loci against different pathotypes. Here we conducted GWAS for ALS resistance in a large diversity panel of common bean. Surprisingly, only two of the five previously described resistance loci were found to be significantly associated with ALS resistance when tested with pathotypes from Colombia and Uganda in the field and greenhouse. The resistance locus on chromosome 4 was effective against one particular pathotype, while the resistance locus on chromosome 8 was effective in all trials. The latter locus was further dissected to characterize the haplotype-specific effect on ALS resistance: Of the eleven haplotypes at this locus, one haplotype was conferring broad-spectrum resistance and six haplotypes were showing pathotype-specific effects. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to describe ALS resistance in such a diverse panel of common bean, tested with an extensive diversity of pathogen isolates on two continents. Our research also highlights the importance of understanding ALS pathotype-specificity to enable durable resistance management strategies for common bean. Molecular markers co-segregating with resistance loci or haplotypes will facilitate breeding for pathotype-specific ALS resistance.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/314928","en",,,,,"Pathotype-Specificity of Angular Leaf Spot in Common Bean - Genome Wide Association Studies and Implications for Resistance Breeding in Latin America and Africa",,"Conference Poster","Metadata only",,,,,"2019-01-10T13:52:37Z",,,,"yes","Plant and Animal Genome XXVII Conference (PAG XXVII 2019)","January 12-16, 2019","San Diego, CA, USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Since decades, their importance for the agriculture of temperate regions led to the development of new varieties through traditional breeding programs. However, newer crop improvement methods such as genomic selection could benefit from a high quality reference genome assembly. In the past, attempts in delivering such a dataset have struggled due to the complexity of the genome and the high heterozygosity of individual genotypes. We sequenced an individual of the L. multiflorum (Italian ryegrass) cv. Rabiosa, producing a highly contiguous (N50 of 3 Mb) and complete assembly (97% of the BUSCO gene models). Due to the high heterozygosity of the line, the assembly (4.5 Gb) resulted to be as large as the diploid genome, and presented the sequence of both alleles in separate scaffolds. About ~70,000 gene models were identified, and the repeat content approached 80%. The comparison of a representative allelic region showed an extensive amount of intergenic sequence variation, supporting the high dynamicity of grass genomes. Compared to the available Lolium genome assemblies, the Rabiosa assembly improves contiguity by >40-fold, contains both haplotypes of the diploid parent, and assigns most of the sequence to chromosomes. The availability of a complete and highly-contiguous genome assembly of Italian ryegrass paves the road to the exploitation of the forage crops genetic resources by means of modern genomic platforms.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000355608",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/355608","en",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Characterization of a Lolium multiflorum diploid assembly",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,,"2019-07-29T11:43:00Z",,,,"yes","Plant and Animal Genome XXVII Conference (PAG XXVII 2019)","January 12-16, 2019","San Diego, CA, USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://plan.core-apps.com/pag_2019/abstract/05b01602-1d8a-40e8-a7b2-55a0d39f62f3",,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite recent advances in our understanding of the physiological mechanisms leading to death, we still lack robust indicators of mortality risk that could be applied at the individual tree scale. Here, we build on a previous contribution exploring the differences in growth level between trees that died and survived a given mortality event to assess whether changes in temporal autocorrelation, variance, and synchrony in time-series of annual radial growth data can be used as early warning signals of mortality risk. Taking advantage of a unique global ring-width database of 3065 dead trees and 4389 living trees growing together at 198 sites (belonging to 36 gymnosperm and angiosperm species), we analyzed temporal changes in autocorrelation, variance, and synchrony before tree death (diachronic analysis), and also compared these metrics between trees that died and trees that survived a given mortality event (synchronic analysis). Changes in autocorrelation were a poor indicator of mortality risk. However, we found a gradual increase in inter-annual growth variability and a decrease in growth synchrony in the last ∼20 years before mortality of gymnosperms, irrespective of the cause of mortality. These changes could be associated with drought-induced alterations in carbon economy and allocation patterns. In angiosperms, we did not find any consistent changes in any metric. Such lack of any signal might be explained by the relatively high capacity of angiosperms to recover after a stress-induced growth decline. Our analysis provides a robust method for estimating early-warning signals of tree mortality based on annual growth data. In addition to the frequently reported decrease in growth rates, an increase in inter-annual growth variability and a decrease in growth synchrony may be powerful predictors of gymnosperm mortality risk, but not necessarily so for angiosperms.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000315307",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2018.01964","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/315307","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","tree mortality||Ring-width||Forest||Growth||Resilience indicators||drought||biotic agents||variance","Early-Warning Signals of Individual Tree Mortality Based on Annual Radial Growth",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-01-13T08:35:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Predicting growth-dependent tree mortality: a key challenge for population ecology","140968","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,,,"85062726358",,"000455109300001","Front.

Yet, the extent of intraspecific variation in defense investment along elevation gradients, and its effects on both herbivore preference and performance, remain relatively unexplored. Using populations of Arabidopsis halleri (Brassicaceae) occurring at different elevations in the Alps, we tested for associations between elevation, herbivore damage in the field, and constitutive chemical defense traits (glucosinolates) assayed under common-garden conditions. Additionally, we examined the feeding preferences and performance of a specialist herbivore, the butterfly Pieris brassicae, on plants from different elevations in the Alps. Although we found no effect of elevation on the overall levels of constitutive glucosinolates in leaves, relative amounts of indole glucosinolates increased significantly with elevation and were negatively correlated with herbivore damage in the field. In oviposition preference assays, P. brassicae females laid fewer eggs on plants from high-elevation populations, although larval performance was similar on populations from different elevations. Taken together, these results support the prediction that species distributed along elevation gradients exhibit genetic variation in chemical defenses, which can have consequences for interactions with herbivores in the field.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000314722",,"1422-0067",,"10.3390/ijms20010174","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/314722","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Elevation gradient||Herbivore preference||GLUCOSINOLATES (BIOCHEMISTRY)||Oviposition preference||Defense||Arabidopsis halleri||Pieris brassicae","Divergence in Glucosinolate Profiles between High- and Low-Elevation Populations of <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> Correspond to Variation in Field Herbivory and Herbivore Behavioral Preferences",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-01-10T08:02:11Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"52449931",,"85059689782",,"000459747700174","Int. j. mol. sci.","1","International Journal of Molecular Sciences","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Decomposition is constrained by the presence of biological agents such as microorganisms and the underlying environmental conditions such as water availability. A metabarcoding approach of ribosomal markers was chosen to study the succession of bacterial and fungal decomposers on root litter. Litterbags containing pine roots were buried in a pine forest for two years and sequentially sampled. Decomposition and the associated communities were surveyed under ambient dry and long-term irrigation conditions. Early decomposition stages were characterized by the presence of fast-cycling microorganisms such as Bacteroidetes and Helotiales, which were then replaced by more specialized bacteria and litter-associated or parasitic groups such as Acidobacteria, white rots, and Pleosporales. This succession was likely driven by a decrease of easily degradable carbohydrates and a relative increase in persistent compounds such as lignin. We hypothesize that functional redundancy among the resident microbial taxa caused similar root decomposition rates in control and irrigated forest soils. These findings have important implications for drought-prone Alpine forests as frequent drought events reduce litter fall, but not litter decomposition, potentially resulting in lower carbon stocks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000361643",,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-019-0436-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/361643","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Microbial succession on decomposing root litter in a drought-prone Scots pine forest",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-08-30T16:43:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85066880897",,"000482118300017","ISME J","9","The ISME Journal","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In rice systems, there is a need to improve alternative water management practices, which are designed to save water and reduce methane emissions but may increase N2O and decrease nitrogen use efficiency. In a field experiment with three water management treatments, we measured N2O isotope ratios of emitted and pore air N2O (δ15N, δ18O and site preference, SP) over the course of 6 weeks in the early rice growing season. Isotope ratio measurements were coupled with simultaneous measurements of pore water NO−3, NH+4, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), water-filled pore space (WFPS) and soil redox potential (Eh) at three soil depths. We then used the relationship between SP × δ18O-N2O and SP × δ15N-N2O in simple two end-member mixing models to evaluate the contribution of nitrification, denitrification and fungal denitrification to total N2O emissions and to estimate N2O reduction rates. N2O emissions were higher in a dry-seeded + alternate wetting and drying (DS-AWD) treatment relative to water-seeded + alternate wetting and drying (WS-AWD) and water-seeded + conventional flooding (WS-FLD) treatments. In the DS-AWD treatment the highest emissions were associated with a high contribution from denitrification and a decrease in N2O reduction, while in the WS treatments, the highest emissions occurred when contributions from denitrification/nitrifier denitrification and nitrification/fungal denitrification were more equal. Modeled denitrification rates appeared to be tightly linked to nitrification and NO−3 availability in all treatments; thus, water management affected the rate of denitrification and N2O reduction by controlling the substrate availability for each process (NO−3 and N2O), likely through changes in mineralization and nitrification rates. Our model estimates of mean N2O reduction rates match well those observed in 15N fertilizer labeling studies in rice systems and show promise for the use of dual isotope ratio mixing models to estimate N2 losses.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000322763",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-16-383-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322763","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Early season N2O emissions under variable water management in rice systems: source-partitioning emissions using isotope ratios along a depth profile",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-02-03T04:32:47Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060615752",,"000456710800005",,"2","Biogeosciences","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) isoforms including receptors play important roles during embryonic development. In this thesis, the dynamics of FGF and VEGFA modulation during estrous cycle and early pregnancy in heifers were assessed. Alpine pasture is rich in diverse grass and herb species containing different concentrations of polyphenols. Polyphenols are secondary plant compounds that have the ability to influence cellular metabolism and gene expression e.g. by acting as antioxidants. Scarce information exists with regard to specific mechanisms by which polyphenols and their metabolites may act on the early developing embryo in bovine. Therefore, the nutritional impact of lowland versus alpine grazing systems on reproductive tract redox status and amino acid (AA) profiles at Day 4 of pregnancy was assessed. A number of different techniques was applied including quantitative polymerase chain reaction for the analysis of gene expression and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry for the quantification of AA. The results show that embryo elongation coincided with endometrial FGF2 protein increase in heifers, as we observed that the endometrial protein abundance of FGF2 increased (P = 0.021) from Day 12 to Day 15 irrespective of the pregnancy status. The endometrial protein abundance of FGF1 decreased (P < 0.001) from Days 12 to 15 and thereafter remained stable until Day 18. Transcripts for FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) (P = 0.003) and FGFR3 (P < 0.001) were more abundant in Day 18 than Day 15 conceptuses. We speculate that during preimplantation, a timely reduction of intercaruncular endometrial VEGFA in favour of caruncular expression may facilitate a gradient towards implantation sites, as the pregnancy status altered endometrial transcript abundance of VEGFA-121 (P = 0.045) and VEGFA-189 (P = 0.009) at Day 15. The endometrium displayed lower VEGFA mRNA transcripts and protein abundance (P < 0.001) at Day 15 in pregnant than in cyclic heifers. The higher expression of VEGFA in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) than in in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) (P < 0.05) pregnancies may predispose for later placentation abnormalities frequently observed following SCNT. Antioxidant gene expression in the oviduct ((catalase (CAT), glutathione synthetase (GSS), glutathione s-transferase alpha 2 (GSTa2), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PGHS2)) and the endometrium (CAT, glutathione-disulfide reductase (GSR), GSS) differed when comparing lowland to alpine grazing systems (P < 0.05). The CAT activity was lower in endometrium of heifers grazing on lowland than alpine pasture (P = 0.001). Additionally, the grazing systems affected the concentrations of amino acids in reproductive fluids. Of 32 AA analysed, seven and 17 AA were differentially abundant in oviduct and uterine fluids, respectively (P < 0.05). Taken together, successful early pregnancy establishment necessitates a spatiotemporal physiological FGF2 protein increase and a reduction in VEGFA protein in the intercaruncular in favour of caruncular endometrium. Grazing systems differently affected the reproductive milieu regarding the redox status and the AA profiles. Possible and underlying mechanisms of nutritional impact of grazing systems on early pregnancy establishment in cattle require further investigations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000397239",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/397239","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Antioxidant||Bovine||Conceptus||Endometrium||Fertility||Polyphenols||Antioxidantien||Rind||Embryo||Endometrium||Fruchtbarkeit||Polyphenole","Early Pregnancy Establishment in Cattle: Assessing the Contribution of Local Molecular Factors and Investigating the Nutritional Impact of Different Grazing Systems",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,,"2020-02-05T15:18:10Z","2021-02-06",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"26505",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the main experiment, 82 grassland plots of 20 x 20 m were established from a pool of 60 species belonging to four functional groups (grasses, legumes, tall and small herbs). In May 2002, varying numbers of plant species from this species pool were sown into the plots to create different plant diversity levels (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60 species) and a functional group gradient (including 1, 2, 3 and 4 functional groups). In 2006, five different management intensities were introduced on subplot level. The management intensities varied in fertilization levels and/or cutting frequencies (Weigelt et al. 2009). In 2007, various forage quality variables (metabolizable energy content, milk production potential, crude protein content, utilizable crude protein content, organic matter content, neutral detergent fiber content) of aboveground biomass yield were measured or estimated for all management intensities.","text/csv","10.3929/ethz-b-000374100",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/374100","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Jena experiment","Data: Forage quality and biomass yield of the Management Experiment set up within the Jena Experiment",,"Dataset","Open access",,,,"2007","2019-10-31T08:09:42Z","2019-12-20","indefinite","292278994-08-17T07:12:55Z","yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02120 - Dep.

The important forest pest Lymantria dispar (gypsy moth) has three recognised subspecies: the European, Asian, and Japanese gypsy moth. Unlike the other two subspecies, the European subspecies is characterised by a loss of female flight ability, which might impose a selective pressure on larvae to actively engage in host-plant selection. We therefore explored the interactions of early-instar larvae from laboratory colonies of each subspecies with four potential hosts of differing quality: oak, beech, maple, and pine—measuring larval survival and performance, feeding preferences, responses to host-derived odour cues, and the propensity to disperse from hosts via ballooning. Compared to larvae from the Asian and Japanese subspecies, larvae from the (American-originated) European gypsy moth colony exhibited (i) significantly lower survival on the poorest quality host (pine), (ii) an ability to discriminate among hosts via olfactory cues; and (iii) higher propensity to disperse from sub-optimal hosts. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that larvae from flightless female European Gypsy moth subspecies play a more active role in host-plant selection.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000351253",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-019-45201-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/351253","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Divergent behavioural responses of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) caterpillars from three different subspecies to potential host trees",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-07-04T02:17:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85067622259",,"000472137700049","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using an approach that combines evidence from stable isotope analysis and DNA metabarcoding, we assessed the diet and trophic position of Anthene usamba butterflies, for which there are no known direct observations of larval feeding. An earlier study that analyzed adults rather than caterpillars of A. usamba inferred that this butterfly was aphytophagous, but we found that the larval guts of A. usamba and two known herbivorous lycaenid species contain chloroplast 16S sequences. Moreover, chloroplast barcoding revealed high sequence similarity between chloroplasts found in A. usamba guts and the chloroplasts of the Vachellia drepanolobium trees on which the caterpillars live. Stable isotope analysis provided further evidence that A. usamba caterpillars feed on V. drepanolobium, and the possibilities of strict herbivory versus limited omnivory in this species are discussed. These results highlight the importance of combining multiple approaches and considering ontogeny when using stable isotopes to infer trophic ecology where direct observations are difficult or impossible.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000366472",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0219070","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/366472","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Combining stable isotope analysis with DNA metabarcoding improves inferences of trophic ecology",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-09-26T02:20:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000484974100014","PLoS ONE","7","PLoS ONE","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The quantification of N2O emissions is challenging due to the strong spatial and temporal variabilities of the emission sources and so N2O emission estimates are very uncertain. This study presents N2O emission measurements from two grazing systems in western Switzerland over the grazing season of 2016. The 12 dairy cows of each herd were kept in an intensive rotational grazing management. The diet for the two herds of cows consisted of different protein-to-energy ratios (system G: grass only diet; system M: grass with additional maize silage) resulting in different nitrogen (N) excretion rates. The N in the excretion was estimated by calculating the animal nitrogen budget taking into account the measurements of feed intake, milk yield, and body weight of the cow herds. Directly after the rotational grazing phases, background and urine patches were identified based on soil electric conductivity measurements while fresh dung patches were identified visually. The magnitude and temporal pattern of these different emission sources were measured with a fast-box (FB) chamber and the field-scale fluxes were quantified using two eddy covariance (EC) systems. The FB measurements were finally upscaled to the field level and compared to the EC measurements for quality control by using EC footprint estimates of a backward Lagrangian stochastic dispersion model. The comparison between the two grazing systems was performed during emission periods that were not influenced by fertilizer applications. This allowed the calculation of the excreta-related N2O emissions per cow and grazing hour and resulted in considerably higher emissions for system G compared to system M. Relating the found emissions to the excreta N resulted in excreta-related emission factors (EFs) of 0.74±0.26 % for system M and 0.83±0.29 % for system G. These EF values were thus significantly smaller compared to the default EF of 2 % provided by the IPCC guidelines for cattle excreta deposited on pasture. The measurements showed that urine patch emission dominated the field-scale fluxes (57 %), followed by significant background emissions (38 %), and only a small contribution of dung patch emission (5 %). The resulting source-specific EFs exhibited a clear difference between urine (1.12±0.43 %) and dung (0.16±0.06 %), supporting a disaggregation of the grazing-related EFs by excreta type in emission inventories. The study also highlights the advantage of a N-optimized diet, which resulted in reduced N2O emissions from animal excreta.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000341305",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-16-1685-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/341305","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Grazing-related nitrous oxide emissions: From patch scale to field scale",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-05-09T00:51:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064957464",,"000465964800001",,"8","Biogeosciences","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Metarhizium brunneum Petch (Hypocreales) has potential to control Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Chrysomelidae), which is a major pest of maize in North America and has recently invaded Europe. The inundative application of an entomopathogenic fungal strain in biological control results in high densities of fungal propagules in the soil which can potentially affect soil microbial communities and their multiple functions in soil. The objective of the present study was to assess potential effects of M. brunneum on soil fungal and prokaryotic communities in a pot experiment over a time course of 4 months using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of ribosomal markers. The application of M. brunneum formulated as fungus colonised barley kernels (FCBK) led to a significant increase of the applied strain in soil, as assessed by cultivation-dependent (plating on selective medium followed by genotyping of Metarhizium isolates) and cultivation-independent (HTS of ribosomal markers) approaches. Data revealed that soil fungal and prokaryotic community structures did not change after the application of M. brunneum. Temporal changes of the fungal and prokaryotic communities were observed and the prokaryotic communities showed minor changes to barley kernels (BK), the matrix of the formulation. Results of this study are in accordance with other investigations lacking any evidence for adverse effects on microbial communities caused by applied entomopathogenic fungi.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000338806",,,,"10.1080/09583157.2019.1566953","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338806","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Inoculation||Western corn rootworm||non-target effects||inundative application||pot experiment","Response of soil microbial communities to the application of a formulated Metarhizium brunneum biocontrol strain",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-04-19T01:44:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060016303",,"000463790000003",,"6","Biocontrol Science and Technology","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Adequate resistance in current pea varieties against various root pathogens is largely lacking. The control of these pathogens is challenging, as they occur as pathogen complexes in the field, themselves embeded in entangled interactions in the rhizosphere. Plants have the ability to actively shape their rootassociated microbiome and genetic variation for rhizosphere related traits exists that can potentially be harnessed in resistance breeding. Results from a controlled pot-based resistance screening of 312 pea cultivars, advanced breeding lines and gene bank accessions on naturally infested soil will be presented. Based on different disease assessments, significant differences in resistance level between pea lines were identified. Validation of a subset of most contrasting lines in the field confirmed significant differences for diseases susceptibility. ITS amplicon sequencing of the fungal rhizosphere community showed a root community of evenly abundant fungal taxonomic units not dominated by a few taxa. This finding points at complex interactions within the fungal community. Along the microbiome sequencing approach, quantitative real-time PCR assays targeting the most important pathogen species are being implemented for the analysis of pot and field rhizosphere samples. Finally, first results of a genome-wide association study on resistance to root rot will be presented.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/354681","en","ICLGG",,,"plant breeding, fungal root diseases, genetic variations","Genome-wide association study for resistance of pea against a complex of root rot pathogens",,"Other Conference Item","Metadata only","ICLGG 2019 - Abstract Book",,,,"2019-07-23T12:31:06Z",,,,"yes","9th International Conference on Legume Genetics and Genomics (ICLGG 2019)","May 13-17, 2019","Dijon, France",,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://orgprints.org/35472/",,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Promoting plant diversity is increasingly suggested as a mitigation strategy. However, our mechanistic understanding of how plant diversity affects the diversity of heterotrophic consumer communities remains limited. Here, we disentangle the relative importance of key components of plant diversity as drivers of herbivore, predator, and parasitoid species richness in experimental forests and grasslands. We find that plant species richness effects on consumer species richness are consistently positive and mediated by elevated structural and functional diversity of the plant communities. The importance of these diversity components differs across trophic levels and ecosystems, cautioning against ignoring the fundamental ecological complexity of biodiversity effects. Importantly, plant diversity effects on higher trophic-level species richness are in many cases mediated by modifications of consumer abundances. In light of recently reported drastic declines in insect abundances, our study identifies important pathways connecting plant diversity and consumer diversity across ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000337131",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-019-09448-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/337131","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Multiple plant diversity components drive consumer communities across ecosystems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-04-09T17:53:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85063726928",,"000462722700007","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Amongst other factors, soil aeration is known to influence root growth and microbial activity and thus inputs and decomposition of soil organic carbon. However, the influence of soil aeration on soil organic carbon content has been explored only little, especially at the farm level. Here, we investigated relationships between gas transport properties and organic carbon content in the topsoil and subsoil of 30 fields of individual farms, covering a wide range of textural composition. The fields were managed either conventionally, organically, or according to no-till practice. Despite considerable overlap between the management systems, we found that tillage increased soil gas transport capability in the topsoil, while organic farming resulted in higher soil organic carbon content. Remarkably, higher gas transport capability was associated with higher soil organic carbon content, both in the topsoil and subsoil (0.53 < R2 < 0.71). Exogenous organic carbon inputs in the form of crop residues and organic amendments, in contrast, were not related to soil organic carbon content. Based on this, we conjecture that higher gas transport capability resulted in improved conditions for root growth, which eventually led to increased input of soil organic carbon. Our findings show the importance of soil aeration for carbon storage in soil and highlight the need to consider aeration in the evaluation of carbon sequestration strategies in cropping systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000334548",,"2199-3971||2199-398X",,"10.5194/soil-5-91-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/334548","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"On-farm study reveals positive relationship between gas transport capacity and organic carbon content in arable soil",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-03-29T04:07:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85063190940",,"000461627100001",,"1","Soil","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We measured CH4 emission in three captive Indian crested porcupines (Hystrix indica; 16.1 ± 2.7 kg) fed a diet of pelleted lucerne, and measured feed intake, digestibility, and digesta mean retention time (MRT) of a solute and three particle markers (<2, 10 and 20 mm). Marker excretion patterns suggested secondary peaks indicative of caecotrophy, with MRTs of 26.4 h for the solute and 31.5, 26.8 and 26.2 h for the three particle markers, respectively. At a dry matter intake of 58 ±10 g/kg body mass0.75/day, porcupines digested 49 and 35% organic matter and neutral detergent fibre, respectively, which is in the lower range of that expected for horses on a similar diet. The respiratory quotient (CO2/O2) was 0.91, the resting metabolic rate 274 kJ/kg body mass0.75/day, and CH4 emissions averaged at 8.16 l/day and 17.9 l/kg dry matter intake. Accordingly, CH4 yield was so high that it resembled that of a hypothetical ruminant of this body mass. The results are in accord with general understanding of hystricomorph rodent digestive physiology, and support recent findings that CH4 production may be more prominent in rodents than previously thought.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000334314",,"1230-1388",,"10.22358/jafs/102741/2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/334314","en","Omnitech Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Hystricomorpha||Rodentia||mean retention time||digestibility||basal metabolic rate||colonic separation mechanism","Digestive physiology, resting metabolism and methane production of captive Indian crested porcupine (Hystrix indica)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-03-28T07:44:13Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000462470400008","J.

This study aimed to re-evaluate the dynamics of changes in the composition and deposition rate of fat, protein and amino acids (AA) in the EB from birth to 140 kg BW depending on the dietary CP and AA supply in a current pig genotype. In the experiment 66 entire male, 58 castrated and 66 female Swiss Large White pigs were used. From 20 kg BW onwards, they had either ad libitum access to a control (C) diet or a diet (LP) compared to diet C only 80% of CP, lysine, methione+cystine, threonine and tryptophan. The EB composition was determined at birth on eight boars and eight females, at 10 and 20 kg BW on two boars, two castrates and two females, and at 20 kg intervals from 40 to 140 kg BW, on four pigs per gender and dietary treatment. Each EB fraction was weighed and analysed for protein, fat and AA profile. The AA-to-lysine ratio was calculated and the different chemical component contents were fitted to allometric regressions. Overall, C-boars had the greatest EB protein and AA content and deposition rates, and lowest fat content and deposition rates. At the beginning of the grower period, LP-castrates and females displayed the lowest protein and AA and the highest fat deposition rates. However, compared with their counterparts in the C-group, in LP-castrates and females protein and AA deposition rates were greater above 64 and 40 kg EB weight, respectively, whereas fat deposition rates was lower above 80 kg EB weight. Thus, there seems a great potential to optimise protein and AA efficiency especially in the finisher period in castrates and females. Important individual variations were found in the essential AA-to-lysine ratio of the EB. Phenylalanine and threonine-to-lysine ratios decreased with increasing EB weight. Valine- and threonine-to-lysine ratios in C-castrates and C-females were 5% and 4% greater than recently reported by the National Research Council (NRC) whereas cysteine-, methionine- and tyrosine-to-lysine ratios were lower by 34%, 25% and 10%, respectively. The clear differences found between the EB AA-to-lysine ratios in the present study and the NRC might partly be explained by the genotype and the temporal changes in the relative weight of each EB fraction or changes in the AA profile. Nevertheless, these findings on changes in the essential AA profile of tissue protein warrant further studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000314037",,"1751-7311||1751-732X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268440||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/311679","10.1017/S1751731118000770","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/314037","en","Cambridge University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","amino acid profile||allometric equations||fat and protein relative deposition||amino acid relative deposition||dietary protein deficiency","Dietary CP and amino acid restriction has a different impact on the dynamics of protein, amino acid and fat deposition in entire male, castrated and female pigs",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-06-08T06:57:59Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85047271518",,"000454297400009",,"1","Animal","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, incomplete genome annotation and assignments of genes to functional annotation databases can lead to a substantial loss of information in downstream data analysis. To overcome this, we developed Mammalian Annotation Database tool (MAdb, https://madb.ethz.ch) to conveniently provide homologous gene information for selected mammalian species. The assignment between species is performed in three steps: (i) matching official gene symbols, (ii) using ortholog information contained in Ensembl Compara and (iii) pairwise BLAST comparisons of all transcripts. In addition, we developed a new tool (AnnOverlappeR) for the reliable assignment of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and Ensembl gene IDs. The gene lists translated to gene IDs of well-annotated species such as a human can be used for improved functional annotation with relevant tools based on Gene Ontology and molecular pathway information. We tested the MAdb on a published RNA-seq data set for the pig and showed clearly improved overrepresentation analysis results based on the assigned human homologous gene identifiers.

On the other hand, a decrease in foliar P concentrations and a corresponding increase in the nitrogen (N) to P ratio during the last decades all over Europe raised questions about a possible reduction in forest health and productivity due to P limitation. These changes in leaf nutrient status have been attributed to continuing high N deposition and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Both accelerated tree growth due to high N and carbon (C) input and adverse effects of elevated N on fine root biomass, mycorrhization, and litter mineralization appear to have created a higher need for other nutrients that cannot be met by the supply from the soil. Surprisingly little is known about internal P allocation of beech and its capacity to deal with changing soil P availability in the short-term. Considering the distribution of beech forests on soils encompassing a broad range of nutrient availability, and thus proven ability to adapt to different soil conditions in the long-term, we hypothesized that this tree species exhibits a high phenotypic plasticity allowing it to alter multiple traits in response to local nutrient availability leading to adaptive acclimation and resulting in a phenotype tailored for local soil conditions. This PhD-thesis aimed to investigate acclimation of beech from high to low and from low to high soil P availability in terms of plant internal P cycling and plant-soil interactions in the rhizosphere. For this purpose, we grew two groups of 12–15-year-old beech saplings originating from sites with high and low soil P availability in mineral soil (Bh/Bv horizon) from their own site and soil from the other site in rhizoboxes for two years in the greenhouse. We assumed that our saplings were adapted to their soil of origin and that their P nutritional status thus reflected the nutrient availability in the soil of origin.  First, we assessed the plasticity of mass and P allocation in the beech saplings aiming to identify the traits most responsive to current soil conditions. After two growing seasons, P concentrations in leaves and stem, as well as mass allocation to leaves and fine roots were affected by both soil and plant origin. By contrast, P allocation to leaves and fine roots, as well as P concentrations in fine roots, were determined almost entirely by the experimental soil. Independent of the P nutritional status defined as average concentration of P in the whole plant, which still clearly reflected the soil conditions at the site of plant origin, P allocation to leaves was a particularly good indicator of P availability in the experimental soil. Furthermore, the high plasticity of this plant trait was indicated by a large difference between plants growing in the two experimental soils. This suggests a strong ability of beech to alter resource allocation in response to specific soil conditions. Second, we investigated the plasticity of root traits and rhizosphere properties of young beech trees from populations, that are adapted to either high or low nutrient supply, when growing in soils differing in their fertility. Fine root traits related to growth (biomass, length), architecture (branching) and morphology (diameter) responded strongly to the properties of the soil. This response was modified by an effect of provenance, that was consistent with an influence of the plant status in those nutrients, which were not in sufficient supply in the soil. However, an additional genotypic difference in the sensitivity of the beech saplings to different soil nutrient supply could not be excluded. Fine root parameters normalized for length, mass, or volume (root tip density and frequency, specific root length and area, root tissue density) did not differ among the treatments. Differences in mycorrhizal colonization and rhizosphere parameters related to phosphorus mobilization potential (pH, an abundance of organic acid anions, phosphatase activity) were small and mainly determined by the soil. Provenance had only a minor modifying effect, possibly due to differences in the ability to transfer carbon compounds from the shoot to the root and the fungal partner. Our results indicate the high plasticity of young beech trees to adapt root growth, architecture, and morphology to different soil nutrient supply, thereby also taking into account internal nutrient reserves.  Third, amplicon sequencing was used to assess to which degree beech saplings with a different P nutritional status can shape their rhizosphere microbial community along the root axis. After the first growing season, we determined the community composition and relative abundance of bacteria and fungi in bulk soil and different zones of the rhizosphere of freshly grown roots defined by root segments potentially differing in their functionality (root tip, elongation zone, side root, old roots). We found that soil was the main factor determining microbial diversity and composition irrespective of plant origin and zone. Overall, OTU (operational taxonomic unit; an operational term for groups of closely related biota) numbers of bacteria and fungi, correlating well with soil microbial biomass, were higher in the soil with high P availability than in the soil with low P availability. Based on the relative abundance of OTUs, the bacterial and fungal communities in the different rhizosphere zones grouped distinctly indicating a succession from bulk soil to older roots via root tip, elongation zone, and side root zone demonstrating the often-postulated gradual development of rhizosphere microbial communities along the root axis. There was a significant effect of plant nutritional status on bacterial community diversity (beta diversity) differentiating elongation zone and on fungal community in the elongation and root tip zones. Furthermore, local average microbial species diversity (alpha diversity quantified with Shannon index) in the bulk soil and active rhizosphere zones (root tip, elongation zone) was higher in treatments with beech saplings acclimating to altered soil P availability than in treatments with plants adapted to the respective conditions. The only indication of a plant effect potentially offering an advantage concerning P nutrition, was a higher relative abundance of the bacterial order Solibacterales, potentially important for the mobilization of inorganically bound P, in some zones in treatments with beech saplings exhibiting a low P nutritional status. We conclude that overall, the P nutritional status of beech saplings had only a small influence on the soil microbial community in the rhizosphere. However, the related plant effects were strongest in the rhizosphere of the elongation zone, i.e., the potentially most active root segment in terms of root exudation. This Ph.D. thesis demonstrated that beech saplings are capable of fast acclimation to changes in soil P availability involving alterations of internal P allocation patterns, root architecture, and interactions with local ectomycorrhizal fungi and bacteria in the rhizosphere. Comparing the results for treatments representing plants adapted to low or high soil P availability and for treatments representing plants with a given P nutritional status acclimating to altered soil P availability suggests that alterations of the same sets of multiple traits are involved in both long-term adaptation and short-term acclimation to given soil conditions. Together, the traits define respective growth strategies of adapted plants, i.e., a conservative strategy in soils with low P availability prioritizing nutrient storage and internal recycling and thus limiting losses, and a strategy prioritizing fast growth in soils with high P availability leading to high P acquisition rates but also high losses. These strategies can be considered analogous to and being part of “recycling” and “acquiring” strategies on the ecosystem level. However, our results also indicate that during the first phases of acclimation to lower soil P availability, beech saplings with a high P nutritional status use their reserves to grow as much as possible.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000420232",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/420232","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","acclimation||Fagus sylvatica||forest health||phosphorus allocation||phosphorus nutritional status||soil phosphorus availability||rhizosphere microbial community||root traits||root zones||root exudation||phenotypic plasticity||beech","Plasticity of beech saplings (Fagus sylvatica L.)

These highly weathered soils usually contain a low concentration of plant available phosphorus (P), due to the strong P sorption onto the soil solid phase and/or the small total P content, which often limits plant growth. More than half grass-alone pastures in South America are degraded due to over-grazing and low plant available nitrogen (N) and P in the soil. Fodder legumes integrated into grass-alone pastures can improve soil fertility and present a major contribution to alleviate pasture degradation. However, P availability affects the carbon (C) cycle by influencing its capture by plants and the N input in soil by limiting the symbiotic N2 fixation by legumes. The overall goal of this study was to achieve a quantitative understanding of the coupling of the C, N and P cycle in tropical pasture using a legume, Canavalia brasiliensis (canavalia). The objectives of this thesis were (i) to design, develop and optimize a tri-isotope (13-C, 15-N, 33-P) plant labelling method in sand and assess the effect of the labelling homogeneity on BG input quantification, (ii) to quantify BG-C, N and P input, including roots and rhizodeposition, into a Ferralsol in response to N and P fertilization, and (iii) to examine their incorporation in different soil pools over time.  The 13-CO2 single-pulse labelling combined with the simultaneous 15-N and 33-P cotton-wick stem feeding could effectively label canavalia roots and facilitate the tracking of rhizodeposited C, N and P input from root systems. The tri-isotope pulse-labelling method did not provide a homogeneous root labelling, thus invalidating the assumptions on the quantification of rhizodeposition proposed by Janzen and Bruinsma (1989). The difference of measured 13-C:15-N and C:N ratios in percolates showed that the tracers did not reflect the elemental stoichiometry of the water-soluble rhizodeposits. Furthermore, soluble root exudates were always less enriched with isotopes than roots. This suggests an underestimation of the amount of rhizodeposition released during 2 weeks after labelling when using the equation of Janzen and Bruinsama (1989), as it assumes the rhizodeposits have the same isotopic enrichment as the roots. When growing in a Ferralsol, the amount of BG input by canavalia determined at 4 weeks after labelling was dominated by the root biomass. Root biomass was closely related to the fertilzer supply of the soil. The proportion of water-soluble vs. insoluble rhizodeposition and their respective isotopic composition affected the quantification of rhizodeposited C, N and P. Nitrogen and P fertilization increased the BG proportion of rhizodeposited C, N and P by canavalia. In addition, roots and rhizodeposition showed similar C:N ratio, whereas C:P ratio in rhizodeposition were always higher than in roots, which ultimately influenced their incorporation in soil. The incubation of pots over 8 weeks containing the entire labelled root system revealed that N and P fertilizer application promoted the root decomposition, reflecting the better quality of the root residues for microbial degradation. The presence of canavalia BG inputs enhanced the mineralization of the initial soil organic matter (SOM) compared to unplanted pots indicating a positive priming effect. Phosphorus addition increased the proportion of P derived from root degradation products in both microbial and soil available P pools The multi-isotope approach allowed investigating the coupling of the C, N and P cycle in tropical soils. The great respiration rate and priming effect observed during the incubation with P fertilization revealed that SOM was rapidly mineralized because of the incorporation of fresh root residues. The quality (i.e. C:N:P ratio) of BG input controlled their incorporation into the soil pools and directly affected the C storage during the short-term of the experiment period. The results obtained allow to better understand the C:N:P stoichiometry of legume BG inputs, which is a crucial factor to combat pasture degradation efficiently and to improve the fertility of pasture and cropping systems.","application/pdf",,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/371881","en","ETH Zurich",,,,"Phosphorus availability and its interaction with plant belowground carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus input into a Ferralsol",,"Doctoral Thesis","Closed access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences",,,"2019-10-21T09:50:31Z","9999-12-31",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"26103",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Eight inexperienced and eight experienced Aosta Red Pied cows were compared (primiparous:multiparous = 1:1). Measurements were performed when cows grazed sites at 600, 1800 and 2100 m a.s.l. The statistical model included experience, parity and site as fixed effects. The longest ingestion time was recorded for primiparous inexperienced cows at 1800 m a.s.l. Milk yield remained unaffected by experience, but the main milking time was shorter in inexperienced cows in the lowlands. Milk of inexperienced cows had a higher urea content than experienced cows. Somatic cell score remained unaffected by experience, but inexperienced cows had more incidences of clinical mastitis on alpine pastures. Compared with experienced cows, proportions of the fatty acids ΣC16:1 and ΣC17:1 in milk fat of inexperienced cows were higher and proportions of C18:1 t9 and C18:1 t6–8 lower. Overall, alpine grazing had substantial effects on milk yield and composition coinciding with results from previous studies. There were interactions between experience and site in milking characteristics and milk composition, and for the latter also between experience and parity. In conclusion, experience had effects on several of the variables tested, effects which were sometimes exhibited already on lowland pasture. Still, the effects of experience were much lower than those of the transhumance system.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000339621",,"1594-4077||1828-051X",,"10.1080/1828051X.2018.1532326","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/339621","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Dairy cattle||Aosta Red Pied||grazing experience||feeding behaviour||fatty acid profile","Previous alpine grazing experience of cows has little medium-term effect on feeding behaviour, milk yield and composition in a traditional alpine system",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-04-26T05:35:26Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85059308522",,"000465375000001","Ital.J.Anim.Sci.","1","Italian Journal of Animal Science","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, we are still far from understanding ecological and evolutionary processes shaping the network-level organisation of plant diversity, and to what extent these processes are specific to certain spatial scales or environments.  Aims: Understanding the systemic mechanisms of plant–plant network assembly and their consequences for diversity patterns.  Methods: We review recent methods and results of plant–plant networks.  Results: We synthetize how plant–plant networks can help us to: (a) assess how competition and facilitation may balance each other through the network; (b) analyse the role of plant–plant interactions beyond pairwise competition in structuring plant communities, and (c) forecast the ecological implications of complex species dependencies. We discuss pros and cons, assumptions and limitations of different approaches used for inferring plant–plant networks.  Conclusions: We propose novel opportunities for advancing plant ecology by using ecological networks that encompass different ecological levels and spatio-temporal scales, and incorporate more biological information. Embracing networks of interactions among plants can shed new light on mechanisms driving evolution and ecosystem functioning, helping us to mitigate diversity loss.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000347429",,"1755-0874||1755-1668",,"10.1080/17550874.2019.1626509","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/347429","en","Taylor & Francis","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Biodiversity||Commensalism||Competition||Ecological Networks||Facilitation||interaction chains||Parasitism||Plant community","Perspectives for ecological networks in plant ecology",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-06-14T08:30:47Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The impact of land-use change and species invasion on biodiversity and ecological networks","180195||180195||180195||180195","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","Scientific Exchanges||Scientific Exchanges||Scientific Exchanges||Scientific Exchanges",,,,"85067571093",,"000472350000001","Plant ecol. divers.","2","Plant Ecology and Diversity","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of the n-3 and the n-6 fatty acid (FA) families, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3) and arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 n-6), are functional lipids in the phospholipids of cell membranes and precursors of eicosanoids, which are involved in various biological mechanisms and are present in all kinds of cells. Animal tissues can synthesise these FA from the essential FA, α-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3 n-3) and linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 n-6), but the conversion rate is low and both substrates compete for the same enzymes for the transformation into the longer PUFA. Therefore, the dietary supply of PUFA with 20-22 carbon atoms is recommended to efficiently increase the mentioned PUFA in animal tissues. Enhanced incorporation of n-3 FA, especially EPA and DHA, has been associated with improved immune-competence and lower inflammation status while increased n-6 FA consumption has been linked to pro-inflammatory activity. Consequently, nutritional imbalance of animal diets towards high n-6/n-3 FA ratio has been related to disadvantages in maintaining animal health and performance.  In ruminants, PUFA are biohydrogenated in the rumen by microbes, to a substantial extent, mainly to monounsaturated and saturated FA. Thus, naturally only small amounts of PUFA enter the small intestine to be absorbed and transported to tissues. The bioavailability of PUFA in ruminants is enhanced by their protection from ruminal biohydrogenation. For the doctoral project, products from a novel technology were used to overcome rumen biohydrogenation. In Angus heifers the potentially different incorporation patterns of the functional PUFA, EPA and DHA, were investigated in a number of muscles, adipose tissues and organs of different functions to gain deeper insights into the potential demand and supply of n-3 FA from the blood stream. Due to the competition of the FA over the same enzymes operating on elongation and desaturation of n-3 and n-6 FA in body cells, also n-6 FA, especially LA, were examined and served as control. Thirty-three Angus heifers (adult female cattle) were supplemented with rumen-protected fish oil (FO) characterised by EPA and DHA or sunflower oil (SO) characterised by LA. This ensured increase in bioavailability of either n-3 or n-6 FA by reducing ruminal biohydrogenation. The diets of the heifers contained 60 g of the respective oils/kg dry matter. The FA profiles of the following bovine tissues were investigated: longissimus thoracis (LT), biceps femoris (BF) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR), the pericardial, intermuscular, perirenal and subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) as well as heart, kidney, liver, lung and spleen. The examination of these 12 tissues was intended to reveal differences in the partitioning of n-3 and n-6 FA in tissues of cattle and to be associated with lipid metabolism. In addition, the effects of dietary supply of n-3 FA from FO on the assessments of meat quality were investigated. Two muscles and the perirenal AT of study animals were further subjected to sensory evaluation in the forms of beef steaks and beef patties by a trained sensory panel. In blood, proportions of PUFA were increased by the supplementation of rumen-protected oils rich in PUFA. The greatest incorporation of n-3 and n-6 FA was found in organs, in which about one third of the lipids consisted of PUFA. The largest increase of EPA proportion was found in the kidneys with FO replacing SO, the lowest in the lung while DHA was more increased in the liver than in kidney, lung and spleen. Cardiac lipids incorporated six times more EPA than DHA and were characterised by the highest proportions of ALA and LA of all organs. The PUFA proportions in the lipids of lung and spleen were exceptionally low compared to heart, liver and kidney. The PUFA proportions in the lipids of LT and BF were only half of those found in the ECR. For EPA and DHA but not for LA the diet effect was also more distinct in the ECR compared to LT and BF. The proportions of EPA and DHA in AT were very small in respect of PUFA proportions ranging between 2 and 4 % of total FA. Despite a generally low storage, n-3 FA proportions increased with FO compared to SO supplementation in all AT, but this to a different extent. Greatest proportions of n-3 and n-6 FA were found in pericardial AT. Concomitantly, the n-6/n-3 FA ratio was reduced with rumen-protected FO in all AT, except in the pericardial AT, which has specific metabolic functions and thus appears to be more resistant to supply with different FA in order to maintain its function. Thus, partitioning of PUFA indeed seems to be related to muscle activity and to metabolic function of muscles, AT and organs.    Animal performance was not affected by supplementation whereas the physico-chemical meat quality, assessed in two muscles, was slightly affected by diet. The oxidative shelf life of the perirenal fat declined with FO compared to SO. Despite the increased n-3 FA proportions of meat due to FO supplementation, the sensory panel identified only a slightly more intense fishy flavour in grilled steaks and beef patties from the FO compared to the SO group. In FO compared to SO patties, flavour intensity was more pronounced. The perception of off-flavours was negligible and differences between muscles were larger than those between diets. Therefore, supplementing ruminants with FO containing nutritionally beneficial n-3 FA resulted in few side effects on meat quality, restricted to quite faint off-flavours and a somewhat shorter fat shelf life.  In conclusion, the results from the doctoral project suggest that the response to FO in the distribution of dietary n-3 FA was tissue-specific while proportions of n-6 FA were quite inert with respect to the type of oil supplementation. It was shown that the effect of supplementation on the incorporation of n-3 FA was specifically pronounced in certain bovine tissues like the extensor muscle, liver and kidney. These findings contribute to an improved understanding of lipid metabolism in cattle.  Further attention may now be directed to the molecular and genetic level that could reveal potential epigenetic effects. Due to the shortage of marine sources, feeding FO to ruminants is not a sustainable way of increasing n-3 FA in animal tissues. Therefore, the utility of other sources of long-chain n-3 FA such as microalgae should be evaluated. Some studies already tried to unravel the complete process of ruminal biohydrogenation of microalgae-derived PUFA, which still seems to be challenging. Inconsistent results of in vitro and in vivo experiments on the degradation of marine algae in the rumen require further intensive research on this topic. Own results using three microalgae species contrasting in n-3 FA profile, one of these already placed on the industrial market, indicate that a certain, but different proportion of long-chain n-3 PUFA could escape ruminal biohydrogenation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000356516",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/356516","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Investigations on the Transfer from Diet and the Partitioning of Long-Chain n-3 Fatty Acids in Different Body Tissues of Ruminants",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::590 - Zoological sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,,"2019-08-04T14:24:35Z","2022-08-04",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25783",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In cattle, losses occur mainly during the preimplantation period and are hypothesized to be a result of an inadequate embryo maternal communication leading to failures in pregnancy recognition. Consequently, the regression of the corpus luteum (CL), which is the primary source for the pregnancy maintaining hormone progesterone (P4), is not inhibited. In cattle and swine, the regulation of the estrous cycle as the basis for reproduction and especially the initiation of luteolysis during the estrous cycle is not completely understood. In addition, the factors and mechanisms necessary for the inhibition of the latter during pregnancy as an essential part in the process of pregnancy recognition are not fully known to date. During the estrous cycle, estrogens trigger ovulation and P4 is produced by the CL during the subsequent luteal phase. If pregnancy does not establish, the luteal phase of the estrous cycle is terminated by luteolysis, which is triggered by pulses of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) resulting in the regression of the CL. Metabolites of the steroids P4 and estradiol-17β (E2) have for long been thought to serve only as excretory products. Nowadays, this assumption is outdated. It is hypothesized that steroid metabolites take part in regulating the estrous cycle and are potentially involved in the initiation of luteolysis. Therefore, we determined ten different P4 metabolites and estrogen conjugates during the estrous cycle of cattle and swine. We found that the profiles of P4 metabolites correlated well with P4 except for the period around luteolysis. During luteolysis, P4 levels dropped more rapidly leading to an increased P4 metabolite to P4 ratio thereafter. Estrogen conjugate levels in serum were found to be rather constant during the estrous cycle, whereas conjugated E2 levels in the endometrium were high at ovulation, decreased thereafter and began to transiently increase again beginning at day 12 post ovulation. The observed increase is probably due to an endometrial estradiol synthesis in swine and might be involved in the initiation of luteolysis. In case of pregnancy in cattle and swine, luteolysis must be inhibited to maintain P4 secretion by the CL. Since prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is thought to play a luteoprotective role, it is suggested that a reorientation of PGF2α towards PGE2 production within the reproductive tract is a prerequisite for a successful establishment of pregnancy in ruminants and in swine. A previous study in cattle however revealed that intrauterine prostacyclin (PGI2) and PGF2α highly exceed intrauterine PGE2. Consequently, we hypothesized that in addition to PGE2, other prostaglandins might contribute to a successful establishment of pregnancy. Within the framework of this thesis, we aimed at determining the prostaglandin secretome of the bovine embryo during different stages of the preimplantation period from blastocyst hatching until embryo elongation. For this purpose, we developed a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based approach for the quantification of 30 different prostaglandins and metabolites and measured prostaglandins in embryo culture supernatants. We found that bovine embryos predominantly secrete PGE2 and Δ12-PGD2 until day 12 post insemination. iv Thereafter, prostaglandins of the F-series (6keto-PGF1α, > PGF2α > PGE2) are the most abundant prostaglandins produced by the embryo. These findings suggest that the prostaglandin secretion of the bovine embryo changes dynamically with the advancing development. Thus, a complex mixture of prostaglandins influences endometrial secretion generating an optimal uterine environment for the developing embryo. The quantification of novel players during the estrous cycle and early pregnancy found the basis for a better understanding of the transition from cyclicity to pregnancy in livestock. Yet, their specific role in fine-tuning the endometrial function during the estrous cycle and the preimplantation period needs to be unraveled in follow-up studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000351551",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/351551","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Endocrine and local cellular signaling of hormones involved in the regulation of the transition from cyclicity to pregnancy in livestock",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::590 - Zoological sciences",,,"2019-07-05T12:19:29Z","2022-07-05",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25819",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This phenomenon decouples fertilisation from subsequent embryo implantation by a period of four months. After diapause, the embryo rapidly elongates and implants in the endometrium. In mammals, the pre-implantation uterine microenvironment supports embryo development, and contains species-specific factors that regulate embryonic diapause. To date, the key factors required for maintenance of diapause and resumption of embryo development in the roe deer are largely unknown. We aimed at identifying these factors, and at characterising the uterine microenvironment that supports decelerated embryo development. We hypothesised a regulation of the cell proliferation via uterine micro environmental cues. Identification of these factors would provide novel therapeutic targets for cell proliferation control. Samples, including endometrium, embryos, uterine flushing and blood plasma, were collected during regular huntings (n = 360 roe deer). A set of six early blastocysts was additionally obtained by in vivo uterine flushings. Endometrial luminal epithelial cells were extracted from the endometrium by laser-capture micro-dissection and together with the embryos subjected to a time-course transcriptome analysis. The uterine fluid proteins, amino acids and acylcarnitines were analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The embryonic transcriptome analysis showed dynamic changes during embryo development, while changes of the luminal epithelium transcriptome occurred almost exclusively at elongation. The differentially expressed transcripts of the embryo suggest a tight regulation of cell-cycle control, proliferation and differentiation. These changes are, in parts, under control of let-7 and MYC. The uterine microenvironment displayed a high presence of proteins involved in cellular detoxification during diapause. At elongation, the uterine proteins were indicative of cell proliferation support. The amino acids arginine and ornithine are putrescine/polyamine precursors and were increased in the uterine microenvironment prior to the resumption of embryo development. In line with the rise in arginine and ornithine, a reduced embryonic micro environmental abundance of the putrescine metabolising proteins ALDH9A1 and SMS was found prior to resumption of embryo development. This suggest an important role of the uterine polyamines in the regulation of diapause. An increased embryonic de novo serine synthesis may be crucial for embryonic cell cycle progression. By transcriptome, amino acid and acylcarnitine data integration, an increase in the embryonic glycolysis pathway was found, starting at pre-elongation. In sum, we propose that the uterine microenvironment, via polyamines, plays a role in resumption of embryo development as shown by an increased embryonic glycolysis pathway and the MYC-driven proliferation machinery. The validation of the cell proliferation and differentiation regulatory factors may allow a translational approach to human medicine and may provide starting points for novel tissue regeneration and cancer treatment strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000386709",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/386709","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Diapause in the European roe deer: Identification of key factors involved in the regulation of embryonic developmental pace and resumption of embryo development.",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences",,,"2019-12-19T14:59:22Z","2022-12-20",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"26286",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is known that maternal recognition of pregnancy and successful implantation are driven by mutual interactions between the elongated conceptus and the maternal endometrium. While most of the genes involved in regulation of embryo development are located on autosomal chromosomes, gene expression on sex chromosomes is modulating development through sex-specific transcription. To gain more insights into the dynamic transcriptome of preimplantation embryos at the onset of elongation and into X-linked gene expression, RNA-seq analyses were performed for single female and male porcine embryos collected on Days 8, 10, and 12 of pregnancy.  Results A high number of genes were differentially expressed across the developmental stages (2174 and 3275 for Days 8 vs 10, and 10 vs 12, respectively). The majority of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in embryo elongation, development, and embryo-maternal interaction. Interestingly, a number of DEGs was found with respect to embryo sex (137, 37, and 56 on Days 8, 10 and 12, respectively). At Day 8, most of these DEGs were X-linked (96). Strikingly, the number of DEGs encoded on the X chromosome dramatically decreased from Day 10 to Day 12.  Conclusions The obtained results deepen the understanding about temporary transcriptomic changes in porcine embryos during the phase of conceptus elongation, meanwhile reveal dynamic compensation of X chromosome in the female and distinct transcriptional differences between female and male embryos.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000363609",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-019-6044-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/363609","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Pig||Embryo||X-linked gene||Transcriptomics||Preimplantation||RNA-Seq","Differential transcriptome dynamics during the onset of conceptus elongation and between female and male porcine embryos",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-09-11T15:06:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000483340600002","BMC Genomics","1","BMC Genomics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

An enriched stable isotope source tracing approach is a central tool to further determine the potential of this biofortification measure. Here, we assessed the use of the widely available quadrupole single-collector ICPMS (Q-ICPMS, analytical error = 1% relative standard deviation) and the less accessible but more precise multicollector ICPMS as reference instrument (MC-ICPMS, analytical error = 0.01% relative standard deviation) to measure enriched Zn stable isotope ratios in soil–fertilizer–plant systems. The isotope label was either applied to the fertilizer (direct method) or to the soil available Zn pool that was determined by isotope ratios measurements of the shoots that grew on labeled soils without fertilizer addition (indirect method). The latter approach is used to trace Zn that was added to soils with complex insoluble organic fertilizers that are difficult to label homogeneously. To reduce isobaric interferences during Zn isotope measurements, ion exchange chromatography was used to separate the Zn from the sample matrix. The 67Zn:66Zn isotope ratios altered from 0.148 at natural abundance to 1.561 in the fertilizer of the direct method and 0.218 to 0.305 in soil available Zn of the indirect method. Analysis of the difference (Bland–Altman) between the two analytical instruments revealed that the variation between 67Zn:66Zn isotope ratios measured with Q-ICPMS and MC-ICPMS were on average 0.08% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.68%]. The fractions of Zn derived from the fertilizer in the plant were on average 0.16% higher (CI = 0.49%) when analyzed with Q- compared to MC-ICPMS. The sample matrix had a larger impact on isotope measurements than the choice of analytical instrument, as non-purified samples resulted on average 5.79% (CI = 9.47%) higher isotope ratios than purified samples. Furthermore, the gain in analytical precision using MC-ICPMS instead of Q-ICPMS was small compared to the experimental precision. Thus, Zn isotope measurements of purified samples measured with Q-ICPMS is a valid method to trace Zn sources in soil–fertilizer–plant systems. For the indirect source tracing approach, we outlined strategies to sufficiently enrich the soil with Zn isotopes without significantly altering the soil available Zn pool.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000385367",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2019.01382","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/385367","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Zinc||Stable isotopes||Isotope dilution||Labelling||Soil||Organic fertilizer||Source tracing||Ryegrass","The Use of Q-ICPMS to Apply Enriched Zinc Stable Isotope Source Tracing for Organic Fertilizers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-12-13T10:14:41Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85075902397",,"000502972700001","Front.

ALS resistance is reportedly pathotype-specific, but little is known about the efficacy of resistance loci against different pathotypes. Here, we report on ALS resistance evaluations of 316 bean lines under greenhouse and field conditions at multiple sites in Colombia and Uganda. Surprisingly, genome-wide association studies revealed only two of the five previously described resistance loci to be significantly associated with ALS resistance. Phg-2 on chromosome eight was crucial for ALS resistance in all trials, while the resistance locus Phg-4 on chromosome 4 was effective against one particular pathotype. Further dissection of Phg-2 uncovered an unprecedented diversity of functional haplotypes for a resistance locus in common bean. DNA sequence-based clustering identified eleven haplotype groups at Phg-2. One haplotype group conferred broad-spectrum ALS resistance, six showed pathotype-specific effects, and the remaining seven did not exhibit clear resistance patterns. Our research highlights the importance of ALS pathotype-specificity for durable resistance management strategies in common bean. Molecular markers co-segregating with resistance loci and haplotypes will increase breeding efficiency for ALS resistance and allow to react faster to future changes in pathogen pressure and composition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000366463",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2019.01126","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/366463","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","food security||plant breeding||plant pathology||genome-wide association studies (GWAS)||pathotype-specificity||common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)||angular leaf spot (ALS)||Pseudocercospora griseola","Haplotypes at the Phg-2 Locus Are Determining Pathotype-Specificity of Angular Leaf Spot Resistance in Common Bean",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2019-09-26T02:19:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85072895469",,"000485143300001","Front.
