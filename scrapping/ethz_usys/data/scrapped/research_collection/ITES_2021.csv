We fitted generalized linear and mixed models to accommodate variation among biogeographic realms and performed analyses separately for bats and non-volants. Richness on islands ranged from one to 234 species, with up to 177 single island endemics. Diversity patterns were most consistently influenced by the islands' physical characteristics. Area positively affected mammal diversity, in particular the number of non-volant endemics. Island isolation, both current and past, was associated with lower richness but greater endemism. Flight capacity modified the relative importance of past versus current isolation, with bats responding more strongly to current and non-volant mammals to past isolation. Biodiversity relationships with environmental factors were idiosyncratic, with a tendency for greater effects sizes with endemism than richness. The historical climatic change was positively associated with endemism. In line with theory, we found that area and isolation were among the strongest drivers of mammalian biodiversity.

Our analysis uses three main tools. First, we examine the graphical behavior of theoretical relationships between curvature and the steepness index (which depends on drainage area and slope). These relationships plot as straight lines for the case of steady-state landscapes that follow the LEM. These lines have slopes and intercepts that provide estimates of landscape characteristic scales. Such lines can be viewed as counterparts of slope-area relationships, which follow power laws in detachment-limited landscapes but not in landscapes with diffusion. We illustrate the response of these curvature-steepness index lines to changes in the values of parameters. Second, we define a Peclet number that quantifies the competition between incision and diffusion, while taking the incision threshold into account. We examine how this Peclet number captures the influence of the incision threshold on the degree of landscape dissection. Third, we characterize the influence of the incision threshold using a ratio between it and the steepness index. This ratio is a dimensionless number in the case of the LEM that we use and reflects the fraction by which the incision rate is reduced due to the incision threshold; in this way, it quantifies the relative influence of the incision threshold across a landscape. These three tools can be used together to graphically illustrate how topography and process competition respond to incision thresholds.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000521384",,"2196-632X||2196-6311",,"10.5194/esurf-9-1545-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/521384","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Graphically interpreting how incision thresholds influence topographic and scaling properties of modeled landscapes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-12-19T03:57:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85121675524",,"000730116800001","Earth Surf.

However, our mechanistic understanding of soil organic carbon (SOC) (de-)stabilization mechanisms and the persistence of SOC stored in terraced soils is far from complete. Here we explored the factors controlling SOC stability and the temperature sensitivity (Q10) of abandoned prehistoric agricultural terrace soils in NE England using soil fractionation and temperature-sensitive incubation combined with terrace soil burial-age measurements. Results showed that although buried terrace soils contained 1.7 times more unprotected SOC (i.e., coarse particulate organic carbon) than non-terraced soils at comparable soil depths, a significantly lower potential soil respiration was observed relative to a control (non-terraced) profile. This suggests that the burial of former topsoil due to terracing provided a mechanism for stabilizing SOC. Furthermore, we observed a shift in SOC fraction composition from particulate organic C towards mineral-protected C with increasing burial age. This clear shift to more processed recalcitrant SOC with soil burial age also contributes to SOC stability in terraced soils. Temperature sensitivity incubations revealed that the dominant controls on Q10 depend on the terrace soil burial age. At relatively younger ages of soil burial, the reduction in substrate availability due to SOC mineral protection with aging attenuates the intrinsic Q10 of SOC decomposition. However, as terrace soil becomes older, SOC stocks in deep buried horizons are characterized by a higher temperature sensitivity, potentially resulting from the poor SOC quality (i.e., soil C:N ratio). In conclusion, terracing in our study site has stabilized SOC as a result of soil burial during terrace construction. The depth–age patterns of Q10 and SOC fraction composition of terraced soils observed in our study site differ from those seen in non-terraced soils, and this has implications when assessing the effects of climate warming and terrace abandonment on the terrestrial C cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000520858",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-18-6301-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/520858","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Soil organic carbon stabilization mechanisms and temperature sensitivity in old terraced soils",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-12-16T04:04:51Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85120982834",,"000728548000001",,"23","Biogeosciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They enable the rearing of 20% of the Ethiopian cattle population, 5% of the Kenyan fish production, and support drinking water, sediment retention and soil fertility for millions of people dependent on subsistence agriculture and pastoralism. Most importantly, ecosystems provide a home and identity to the diverse people who live in the dynamic and at-times challenging conditions of this area. • The basin’s social-ecological system is constantly changing due to regional demand for water, energy and food. The demand for hydropower and irrigated agriculture, in particular, drives many of the large-scale development interventions in both the Ethiopian and the Kenyan portion of the basin, which in turn impact rural livelihoods especially for indigenous peoples in the Lower Omo Valley. • In recent decades, two main trends have occurred in ecosystem services across the basin: first, since the 1980s, 5.5% of the highlands experienced a net loss of closed-canopy forests and all the services they provide, probably due to agricultural expansion. At the same time, 12% of the lower-lying areas experienced an increase in open woodlands due to changing climate. When coupled with an overall reduction in desert areas, this may lead to potentially positive outcomes for carbon sequestration. Second, since construction of the Gibe III dam, typical seasonal hydrological oscillations – e.g., water-level patterns in the Omo River and Lake Turkana – have been reduced, which has resulted in a reduction in temporarily flooded areas normally used for recession agriculture, grazing and potentially fish stocks in Lake Turkana. • The continuous changes in the basin require adaptation measures that are as diverse as the basin’s ecosystems and the people who depend on them. Ecosystems, livelihoods and well-being in the OTB are intertwined with river flow dynamics. Environmental flow releases from dams may be able to partially restore ecosystem services, but their planning needs to take into account the strong trade-offs between flood risks and benefits.",,,"978-1-003-16933-8||978-0-367-77004-4",,,"10.4324/9781003169338-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526496","en","Routledge",,,,"Ecosystem services in changing social-ecological systems",,"Book Chapter","Metadata only","The Omo-Turkana Basin: Cooperation for Sustainable Water Management",,"2022-01-18T10:06:33Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Ground deformation and changes in seismicity, geochemistry, petrology, and gravimetry are used to assess volcanic activity before eruptions. Studies on Mt. Etna (Italy) have demonstrated that vegetation can be affected by pre-eruptive activity before the onset of eruptions. During two consecutive years before Mt. Etna's 2002/2003 flank eruption, enhanced vegetation index (NDVI) values were detected along a distinct line which later developed into an eruptive fissure. However, the mechanisms by which volcanic activity can lead to changes in pre-eruption tree growth processes are still not well understood. We analysed delta C-13, delta O-18 and C-14 in the rings of the survived trees growing near to the line where the pre-eruptive increase in NDVI was observed in order to evaluate whether the uptake of water vapour or fossil volcanic CO2 could have contributed to the enhanced NDVI. We found a dramatic decrease in delta O-18 in tree rings formed before 2002/2003 in trees close to the eruption fissure, suggesting uptake of volcanic water by trees during pre-eruptive magma degassing. Moist conditions caused by outgassing of ascending magma may also have led to an observed reduction in tree-ring delta C-13 following the eruption. Furthermore, only ambiguous evidence for tree uptake of degassed CO2 was found. Our results suggest that additional soil water condensed from degassed water vapour may have promoted photosynthesis, explaining local increases in NDVI before the 2002/2003 Mt. Etna flank eruption. Tree-ring oxygen stable isotopes might be used as indicators of past volcanic eruptions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505025",,"1936-0592||1936-0584",,"10.1002/eco.2340","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505025","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Etna||radiocarbon||stable isotopes||tree physiology||tree rings||volcanic eruption","Tree-ring stable isotopes and radiocarbon reveal pre- and post-eruption effects of volcanic processes on trees on Mt.

In particular, high spatial and temporal resolution rainfall data are essential as precipitation is the driving force of soil erosion. In this study, we evaluated to what extent high temporal resolution data from the TAHMO network (with poor spatial and long-term coverage) can be combined with low temporal resolution data (with a high spatial density covering long periods of time) to improve rainfall erosivity assessments. To this end, 5 minute rainfall data from TAHMO stations in the Lake Kivu region, representing ca. 37 observation-years, were analyzed. The analysis of the TAHMO data showed that rainfall erosivity was mainly controlled by rainfall amount and elevation and that this relation was different for the dry and wet season. By combining high and low temporal resolution databases and a set of spatial covariates, an environmental regression approach (GAM) was used to assess the spatiotemporal patterns of rainfall erosivity for the whole region. A validation procedure showed relatively good predictions for most months (R-2 between 0.50 and 0.80), while the model was less performant for the wettest (April) and two driest months (July and August) (R-2 between 0.24 and 0.38). The predicted annual erosivity was highly variable with a range between 2000 and 9000 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) yr(-1) and showed a pronounced east-west gradient which is strongly influenced by local topography. This study showed that the combination of high and low temporal resolution rainfall data and spatial prediction models can be used to improve the assessments of monthly and annual rainfall erosivity patterns that are grounded in locally calibrated and validated data.",,,,"0309-1333||1477-0296",,"10.1177/03091333211001793","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495179","en","SAGE Publications",,,"Rainfall||erosivity||Lake Kivu||NLS||GAM","Spatial and seasonal patterns of rainfall erosivity in the Lake Kivu region: Insights from a meteorological observatory network",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-07-15T10:52:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85102772112",,"000630564300001","Prog. phys. geogr.","6","Progress in Physical Geography","45","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Comprehensively measuring terrestrial biodiversity usually requires costly methods that can rarely be deployed at large spatial scales over multiple time periods, limiting conservation efficiency. Here we investigated the capacity of environmental DNA (eDNA) from stream water samples to survey terrestrial mammal diversity at multiple spatial scales within a large catchment. We compared biodiversity information recovered using an eDNA metabarcoding approach with data from a dense camera trap survey, as well as the sampling costs of both methods. Via the sampling of large volumes of water from the two largest streams that drained the study area, eDNA metabarcoding provided information on the presence and detection probabilities of 35 mammal taxa, 25% more than camera traps and for half the cost. While eDNA metabarcoding had limited capacity to detect felid species and provide individual-level demographic information, it is a cost-efficient method for large-scale monitoring of terrestrial mammals that can offer sufficient information to solve many conservation problems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000491296",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-021-90598-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491296","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"eDNA sampled from stream networks correlates with camera trap detection rates of terrestrial mammals",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-06-25T03:09:30Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85108171936",,"000664656200001","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Most traditional census methods are demanding or destructive. Nondisturbing and nonlethal approaches based on video and environmental DNA are alternatives to underwater visual census or fishing. However, their ability to detect multiple biodiversity factors beyond traditional taxonomic diversity is still unknown. For bony fishes and elasmobranchs, we compared the performance of eDNA metabarcoding and long-term remote video to assess species' phylogenetic and functional diversity. We used 10 eDNA samples from 30 L of water each and 25 hr of underwater videos over 4 days on Malpelo Island (pacific coast of Colombia), a remote marine protected area. Metabarcoding of eDNA detected 66% more molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) than species on video. We found 66 and 43 functional entities with a single eDNA marker and videos, respectively, and higher functional richness for eDNA than videos. Despite gaps in genetic reference databases, eDNA also detected a higher fish phylogenetic diversity than videos; accumulation curves showed how 1 eDNA transect detected as much phylogenetic diversity as 25 hr of video. Environmental DNA metabarcoding can be used to affordably, efficiently, and accurately census biodiversity factors in marine systems. Although taxonomic assignments are still limited by species coverage in genetic reference databases, use of MOTUs highlights the potential of eDNA metabarcoding once reference databases have expanded.",,,,"0888-8892||1523-1739",,"10.1111/cobi.13802","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/506513","en","Wiley",,,"accumulation curves||biodiversity||eDNA metabarcoding||functional traits||Malpelo||marine protected area||tropical reefs||video","Use of environmental DNA in assessment of fish functional and phylogenetic diversity",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-09-23T02:51:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85114455426",,"000696234600001","Conserv.

Here, we couple an advanced hydromechanical landslide model with a soil depth regeneration model and quantify landslide legacy effects by placing landslide dynamics in a perspective of landscape soil depth evolution. Results show increased landslide susceptibility near recently failed regions due to alteration of hydrological processes in a thinner soil mantle that imposes constraints on released soil volumes. Landslide recurrence in failed regions levels off when soil depths are gradually restored to steady state pre-failure values. Cumulative effects of past landslides divert future landslide activity from steep hillslopes to alluvial channels and valley margins thus affecting sediment dynamics and yields.

Yet, a framework to assess the three pillars of CSF, in terms of mitigation and adaptation to climate change and ecosystem service (ES) provision based on national forest inventory (NFI) data is currently lacking. In this study, we present an assessment framework of CSF based on forest indicators derived from NFI. To quantify the three pillars of CSF we defined 1) mitigation based on the forest carbon stock, 2) adaptation using biodiversity and susceptibility to disturbances caused by storm and bark beetles and 3) ES provision with timber production and protection against avalanches and rockfall. We demonstrate the application of this framework using Swiss NFI data and projections of future forest development under four different management scenarios. Our results show that, in general, the carbon stock is increasing at the national scale when current management practices are maintained. Increases are especially pronounced in the Jura and Southern Alps regions. Trade-offs occur between enhancing mitigation and adaption, and the sustainable provision of ES such as timber production. Scenarios with increased harvesting intensities lead to a higher timber supply in the short-term, while decreasing the carbon stock, biodiversity-related old-growth indicators and the protective function of forests. The indicator framework presented in this study provides a first methodological approach that can support policy making to balance the different forest services in the context of CSF.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000588198",,"1470-160X||1872-7034",,"10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108459","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588198","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Mitigation||Adaptation||Ecosystem services||Decision framework||Forest management||Climate change","Presenting a climate-smart forestry evaluation framework based on national forest inventories",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-12-19T14:28:16Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecological Indicators","133","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

At present, research in this field is often divided, focusing either on pores where pore networks are investigated in undisturbed soil or on solids where isolated soil aggregates are commonly studied. The choice of approach depends on the needs and traditions in different disciplines of soil science. While there is much debate regarding how well these viewpoints relate to each other, there have been only marginal research efforts undertaken to compare them quantitatively. In this study, we presented and evaluated methods to identify 3-D subunits in X-ray images of eight undisturbed soil samples that we interpreted as macroaggregates, and compared these to to results from drop-shatter tests. Here, we exploited the cohesive forces of water that induces shrinkage cracks under drying. Despite promising trends, comparisons between image and drop-shatter test derived aggregate properties remained inconclusive. Nevertheless, our results encourage further investigations on larger sample sets and different observation scales. The here presented and discussed aggregate delineation methods illustrate an approach to harmonize soil structure characterization in terms of both pore-networks and soil aggregation.

Functional traits influence the ecophysiological performance of tree species, yet the relationship between traits and emergent long-term growth patterns is poorly understood. Here, we present a novel 3D forest stand model in which growth patterns of individual trees and forest stands are emergent properties of leaf traits. Individual trees are simulated as 3D functional-structural tree models (FSTMs), considering branches up to the second order and leaf dynamics at a resolution of one cubic meter. Each species is characterized by a set of leaf traits that corresponds to a specific position on the leaf economics spectrum and determines light-driven carbon assimilation, respiration and mortality rates. Applying principles of the pipe model theory, these leaf scale processes are coupled with within-tree carbon allocation, i.e., 3D tree growth emerges from low-level processes. By integrating these FSTMs into a dynamic forest stand model, we go beyond modern stand models to integrate structurally detailed internal physiological processes with interspecific competition and interactions with the environment in diverse tree communities. For model calibration and validation, we simultaneously compared a large number of emergent patterns at both the tree and forest levels in a pattern-oriented modelling framework. At the tree level, the specific leaf area and correlated leaf traits determined the maximum height and age of trees, as well as their size-dependent growth rate and shade tolerance. Trait variations along the leaf economics spectrum led to a continuous transition from fast-growing, short-lived and shade-intolerant to slow-growing, long-lived and shade-tolerant trees. These emerging patterns resemble well-known functional tree types, indicating a fundamental impact of leaf traits on long-term growth patterns. At the forest level, a large number of patterns taken from lowland Neotropical forests were reproduced, indicating that our forest model simulates structurally realistic forests over long time spans. Our ecophysiological approach improves the understanding of how leaf level processes scale up to the tree and the stand level, and facilitates the development of next-generation forest models for species-rich forests in which tree performance emerges directly from functional traits.",,,,"0304-3800||1872-7026||0167-8892",,"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2021.109735","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/506690","en","Elsevier",,,"Functional-structural tree model||Individual-based model||Leaf economics spectrum||Tropical forest||Pipe model theory||3D forest stand model","Modelling the long-term dynamics of tropical forests: From leaf traits to whole-tree growth patterns",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-09-24T04:38:02Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85114994290",,"000704984800012","Ecol.

Trees react to these changes by adjusting stomatal conductance to maximize the trade-off between carbon gains and water losses. A better understanding of the consequences of these drought-induced physiological adjustments for tree growth could help inferring future productivity potentials of boreal forests. Here, we used samples from a forest inventory network in Canada where a decline in growth rates of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) occurred in 1988–1992, an exceptionally dry period, to verify if this growth decline resulted from physiological adjustments of trees to drought. We measured carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in growth rings of 95 spruces and 49 pines spanning 1985–1993. We used 13C discrimination (Δ13C) and 18O enrichment (Δ18O) as proxies for intrinsic water use efficiency and stomatal conductance, respectively. We studied how inter-annual variability in isotopic signals was linked to climate moisture index, vapor pressure deficit and annual snowfall amount. We found significantly lower Δ13C values over 1988–1990, and significantly higher Δ18O values in 1988–1989 and 1991 compared to the 1985–1993 averages. We also observed that a low climatic water balance and a high vapor pressure deficit were linked with low Δ13C and high Δ18O in the two study species, in parallel with low growth rates. The latter effect persisted into the year following drought for black spruce, but not for jack pine. These findings highlight that small differences in physiological parameters between species could translate into large differences in post-drought recovery. The stronger and longer lasting impact on black spruce compared to jack pine suggests a less efficient carbon use and a lower acclimation potential to future warmer and drier climate conditions.",,,,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148514","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493944","en","Elsevier",,,"Boreal forest||Dendrochronology||Picea mariana||Pinus banksiana||Tree-ring isotopes||Drought stress","Contrasting life-history traits of black spruce and jack pine influence their physiological response to drought and growth recovery in northeastern boreal Canada",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-07-12T05:16:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85109199957",,"000691673500013","Sci.

To address this matter, we assessed the influence of soil geochemistry on bulk SOM composition along a soil chronosequence in California, USA, spanning 3 million years. This was done by combining data on soil mineralogy and texture from previous studies with additional measurements on total carbon (C), stable isotope values (δ13C and δ15N), and spectral information derived from diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). To assess qualitative shifts in bulk SOM, we analysed the peak areas of simple plant-derived (S-POM), complex plant-derived (C-POM), and predominantly microbial-derived organic matter (OM; MOM) and their changes in abundance across soils with several millennia to millions of years of weathering and soil development. We observed that SOM became increasingly stabilized and microbial-derived (lower C : N ratio, increasing δ13C and δ15N) as soil weathering progressed. Peak areas of S-POM (i.e. aliphatic root exudates) did not change over time, while peak areas of C-POM (lignin) and MOM (components of microbial cell walls (amides, quinones, and ketones)) increased over time and depth and were closely related to clay content and pedogenic iron oxides. Hence, our study suggests that with progressing soil development, SOM composition co-varied with changes in the mineral matrix. Our study indicates that structurally more complex OM compounds (C-POM, MOM) play an increasingly important role in soil carbon stabilization mechanisms as the mineral soil matrix becomes increasingly weathered.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526240",,"1810-6277||1810-6285",,"10.5194/bg-2021-295","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526240","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","SOM composition||DRIFTS||13C||15N||SOM stabilization||Soil chronosequence||Organo-mineral association","Soil geochemistry as a driver of soil organic matter composition: insights from a soil chronosequence",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2022-01-17T12:52:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biogeosci. discuss.",,"Biogeosciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These limitations have, for example, restricted comprehensive assessment of multiple dimensions of wetting and drying related to climate change and hampered understanding of why widespread changes in precipitation extremes are uncorrelated with changes in streamflow extremes. Here, we address this knowledge gap and underlying data gap by developing a new data synthesis product and using that product to detect trends in the frequencies and magnitudes of a comprehensive set of hydroclimatic and hydrologic extremes. CHOSEN (Comprehensive Hydrologic Observatory Sensor Network) is a database of streamflow, soil moisture, and other hydroclimatic and hydrologic variables from 30 study areas across the United States. An accompanying data pipeline provides a reproducible, semi-automated approach for assimilating data from multiple sources, performing quality assurance and control, gap-filling and writing to a standard format. Based on the analysis of extreme events in the CHOSEN dataset, we detected hotspots, characterized by unusually large proportions of monitored variables exhibiting trends, in the Pacific Northwest, New England, Florida and Alaska. Extreme streamflow wetting and drying trends exhibited regional coherence. Drying trends in the Pacific Northwest and Southeast were often associated with trends in soil moisture and precipitation (Pacific Northwest) and evapotranspiration-related variables (Southeast). In contrast, wetting trends in the upper Midwest and the Rocky Mountains showed few univariate associations with other hydroclimatic extremes, but their latitudes and elevations suggested the importance of changing snowmelt characteristics. On the whole, observed trends are incompatible with a 'drying-in-dry, wetting-in-wet' paradigm for climate-induced hydrologic changes over land. Our analysis underscores the need for more extensive, longer-term observational data for soil moisture, snow and evapotranspiration.",,,,"0885-6087||1099-1085",,"10.1002/hyp.14429","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518595","en","Wiley",,,"climate change||comparative hydrology||comprehensive hydrologic dataset||hydrologic extremes||intensively monitored catchments||trends of extreme events","CHOSEN: A synthesis of hydrometeorological data from intensively monitored catchments and comparative analysis of hydrologic extremes",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-12-04T04:52:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85120033127",,"000723020900008","Hydrol.

The availability of labile organic compounds (i.e. exudates) and water is the main prerequisite for such microbial activity and enzyme production, thus shaping the rhizosphere. Root morphology (i.e., root hairs) and exudate composition define the spatial distribution of properties and functions in the rhizosphere. However, the role of root architecture and exudate composition in this spatial self-organization of the rhizosphere remains unknown.  We coupled three in situ imaging approaches: 14C imaging to localize exudates, soil zymography to analyze enzyme activity distribution, and neutron radiography for water fluxes to trace the spatial structure of the rhizosphere of three maize genotypes (wild-type, mutant with defective root-hair prolongation rth3, and mutant with reduced benzoxazinoid content in root exudates bx1). The co-localization of these three soil images revealed the pivotal role of both optimal water content (neutron radiography) and root exudation (14C imaging) for β-glucosidase production by the rhizosphere microbiome and its hydrolytic activity (zymography). Root hairs increased the exudate release and enlarged the spatial extent of increased β-glucosidase activity around the root axis by 35%, leading to a two-fold faster decomposition of 14C exudates compared to the mutant with defective root hairs. In contrast, benzoxazinoids suppressed β-glucosidase activity by 30%, reflecting decreased microbial activity, whereas their absence broadened the rhizosphere. Overall, root hairs in wild-type maize increased microbial activity (i.e. β-glucosidase production), whereas the benzoxazinoids in root exudates suppressed microorganisms.",,,,"0038-0717||1879-3428",,"10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108426","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507034","en","Elsevier",,,"Enzyme activity||Primary metabolites||Secondary metabolites||Soil imaging methods||Spatial rhizosphere functioning","Maize genotype-specific exudation strategies: An adaptive mechanism to increase microbial activity in the rhizosphere",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-09-26T02:54:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85115239229",,"000700588700007","Soil biol. biochem.",,"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","162","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Based on a literature review, stakeholder workshops, targeted interviews and considering our own positionality, we identified underlying narratives related to (a) economic transformation and modernization, (b) indigenous rights and (c) nature conservation, which were all connected through water, energy, food and ecosystems within a (d) landscape nexus. Yet, we also identified a (e) living museum narrative suggesting that international advocacy for indigenous rights and nature conservation is a means through which Western societies want to preserve African societies in an ""undeveloped"" state. National governments use this narrative to silence external critique, while the tourism industry promotes it to advertise visits to pastoralist tribes. This narrative reveals powerful, yet largely ignored hindrances for collaborative projects resulting from cultural and historical biases in Euro-African collaborations. Based on our analysis, we argue that international research projects in sustainability sciences need to increase the transparency of open and hidden narratives that influence research directions and power relationships between scientific partners, also those using mostly technically-driven approaches.

The physical mechanisms by which these substances interact with the soil matrix and alter the spatial configuration of the liquid phase and the related hydraulic properties remain unclear. Here, we propose a theory to explain how polymer solutions form one-dimensional filaments and two-dimensional interconnected structures spanning across multiple pores. Unlike water, primarily shaped by surface tension, these polymeric structures remain connected during drying due to their high viscosity. The integrity of one-dimensional structures is explained by the interplay of viscosity and surface tension forces (elegantly characterized by the Ohnesorge number), while the formation of two-dimensional structures requires consideration of the interaction of the polymer solution with the solid surfaces and external drivers (e.g., drying rate). During drying, the viscosity of the liquid phase increases and at a critical point, when the friction between polymers and solid surfaces overcomes the water absorption of the polymers, the concentration of the polymer solution at the gas-liquid interface increases asymptotically. At this critical point, polymers are deposited as two-dimensional surfaces, such as hollow cylinders or interconnected surfaces. A model is introduced to predict the formation of such structures. Viscosity of the soil solution, specific soil surface, and drying rate are the key parameters determining the transition from one-to two-dimensional structures. Model results are in good agreement with observed structures formed in porous media during drying.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000514728",,"0043-1397||1944-7973",,"10.1029/2021WR030052","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/514728","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Physics of Viscous Bridges in Soil Biological Hotspots",,"Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-11-11T08:10:50Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"102105559","85119847176",,"000723106900023","Water Resour.

With eDNA, we detected not only aquatic organisms, including fishes, amphibians, and reptiles, but also a large diversity of terrestrial, arboreal, and flying vertebrates, including mammals and birds, living in the estuary surroundings. Further, the eDNA signal remained relatively localized along the watercourse. A transect from the deep outer section of the estuary, across the river mouth toward the inner section of the river, showed marked taxonomic turnover from typical marine to freshwater fishes, while eDNA of terrestrial and arboreal species was mainly found in the inner section of the estuary. Our results indicate that eDNA enables the detection of a large diversity of vertebrates and could become an important tool for biodiversity monitoring in estuaries, where water integrates information across the ecosystem.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a promising tool to face this challenge through the filtering, amplification, and sequencing of DNA traces from water samples. However, because eDNA concentration is low in marine environments, the reliability of eDNA to detect species diversity can be limited. Using an eDNA metabarcoding approach to identify fish Molecular Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) with a single 12S marker, we aimed to assess how the number of sampling replicates and filtered water volume affect biodiversity estimates. We used a paired sampling design of 30 L per replicate on 68 reef transects from 8 sites in 3 tropical regions. We quantified local and regional sampling variability by comparing MOTU richness, compositional turnover, and compositional nestedness. We found strong turnover of MOTUs between replicated pairs of samples undertaken in the same location, time, and conditions. Paired samples contained non-overlapping assemblages rather than subsets of one another. As a result, non-saturated localized diversity accumulation curves suggest that even 6 replicates (180 L) in the same location can underestimate local diversity (for an area <1 km). However, sampling regional diversity using ~25 replicates in variable locations (often covering 10 s of km) often saturated biodiversity accumulation curves. Our results demonstrate variability of diversity estimates possibly arising from heterogeneous distribution of eDNA in seawater, highly skewed frequencies of eDNA traces per MOTU, in addition to variability in eDNA processing. This high compositional variability has consequences for using eDNA to monitor temporal and spatial biodiversity changes in local assemblages. Avoiding false-negative detections in future biomonitoring efforts requires increasing replicates or sampled water volume to better inform management of marine biodiversity using eDNA.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515041",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.8150","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515041","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","biomonitoring||coral reef diversity||environmental DNA||MOTU||sampling variability||tropical marine ecosystems","How many replicates to accurately estimate fish biodiversity using environmental DNA on coral reefs?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-11-13T08:10:30Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Relative importance of ecological and evolutionary determinants of coral reef fish biodiversity","164294","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85116440996",,"000703915900001","Ecol Evol","21","Ecology and Evolution","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While at a local scale these impacts induce biodiversity loss and shifts in community structure, previous biogeographical analyses recorded consistent taxonomic structure of fish communities across global coral reefs. This suggests that regional communities represent a random subset of the global species and traits pool, whatever their species richness. Using distributional data on 3586 fish species and latest advances in species distribution models, we show marked gradients in the prevalence of size classes and diet categories across the biodiversity gradient. This divergence in trait structure is best explained by reef isolation during past unfavourable climatic conditions, with large and piscivore fishes better represented in isolated areas.

Ecosystem functions depend on environmental conditions and the traits of species that comprise the ecological communities4. However, the axes of variation of ecosystem functions are largely unknown, which limits our understanding of how ecosystems respond as a whole to anthropogenic drivers, climate and environmental variability4,5. Here we derive a set of ecosystem functions6 from a dataset of surface gas exchange measurements across major terrestrial biomes. We find that most of the variability within ecosystem functions (71.8%) is captured by three key axes. The first axis reflects maximum ecosystem productivity and is mostly explained by vegetation structure. The second axis reflects ecosystem water-use strategies and is jointly explained by variation in vegetation height and climate. The third axis, which represents ecosystem carbon-use efficiency, features a gradient related to aridity, and is explained primarily by variation in vegetation structure. We show that two state-of-the-art land surface models reproduce the first and most important axis of ecosystem functions. However, the models tend to simulate more strongly correlated functions than those observed, which limits their ability to accurately predict the full range of responses to environmental changes in carbon, water and energy cycling in terrestrial ecosystems7,8.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507398",,"0028-0836||1476-4687",,"10.1038/s41586-021-03939-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507398","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biogeography||Ecosystem ecology","The three major axes of terrestrial ecosystem function",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-09-28T10:08:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,"ICOS-CH: Integrated Carbon Observation System in Switzerland||ICOS-CH Phase 2","148992||173691","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,"85115297278",,"000698366900004",,"7881","Nature","598","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we used a global reconstruction of tropical reef habitat dynamics during the Cenozoic and phylogenetic diversification models to test the influence of (i) major geological events, (ii) reef habitat fragmentation and (iii) reef area on the diversification of 9 major clades of tropical reef fish (Acanthuridae, Balistoidea, Carangoidea, Chaetodontidae, Haemulinae, Holocentridae, Labridae, Pomacentridae and Sparidae). The diversification models revealed a weak association between paleo-habitat changes and diversification dynamics. Specifically, the fragmentation of tropical reef habitats over the Cenozoic was found to be a driver of tropical reef fish diversification for 2 clades. However, overall, our approach did not allow the identification of striking associations between diversification dynamics and paleo-habitat fragmentation in contrast with theoretical model’s predictions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000512850",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-021-00049-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/512850","en","Macmillan Publishers","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Influence of historical changes in tropical reef habitat on the diversification of coral reef fishes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-10-30T02:49:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85117714049",,"000709427000024","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This contrasts with paleoecological evidence reporting its former presence at low elevations under meso-Mediterranean conditions. In this study, we evaluated the growth performance of silver fir at low elevation (20–60 m a.s.l.) under meso-Mediterranean climatic conditions in Tuscany (central Italy). We conducted a dendroecological analysis on Abies alba trees along a geomorphological gradient (from depression to upper slope conditions). Climate-growth relationships were assessed by means of correlations, response functions, pointer years, and superposed epoch analysis. Silver fir was found to grow and regenerate well in these stands mixed with evergreen (e.g., Quercus ilex L.) and thermophilous deciduous Mediterranean tree species (e.g., Q. cerris L.). Summer drought was the most growth-influencing factor, with immediate (i.e., current season) negative impacts on tree-ring widths (TRW). No significant impacts were observed in the four years following extreme summer droughts, but the TRW series (which started between the 1930s and 1950s) showed a growth decline since the mid-1990s that is likely drought-related. Our results show that, provided there is a sufficiently large soil water holding capacity, silver fir provenances exist which are able to withstand Mediterranean summer droughts, can naturally and regularly regenerate in these systems, and may even dominate over typical meso-Mediterranean species. As long as annual precipitation is not too low (i.e., >850 mm) and summer drought conditions not too extreme (i.e., less than three months), silver fir has thus the potential to thrive under warm Mediterranean conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000499559",,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119537","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499559","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Silver fir||Adaptive forest management||Drought||Tree rings||Global change","Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) is able to thrive and prosper under meso-Mediterranean conditions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-08-05T03:15:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85111047466",,"000685974500002","For.

Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has gained momentum globally and guidance is needed to identify those species, sites and planting methods that increase restoration success. Incorporating native Non-Timber Forest Product (NTFP) species in FLR approaches provides an opportunity to simultaneously deliver ecological and economic benefits. The Brazil nut tree is one of the most valuable Amazonian NTFP species and could fulfil a cornerstone role in Amazon FLR. However, the factors defining establishment success within Brazil nut restoration activities remain unknown.  2. Here, we evaluate the effect of management practices, restoration site (pastures, agroforestry, secondary forest and canopy gaps in old growth forest) and environmental conditions on the establishment success (tree growth, survival and fruit production) of Brazil nut restoration projects implemented by smallholders in the Peruvian Amazon. We performed a field study at 25 restoration sites of 1–38 years in age, where we conducted measurements on 481 trees and interviewed 21 smallholders. We used mixed effect models to identify drivers of performance.  3. Twenty years after planting, diameter growth in secondary forests was 38%, 34%, and 24% higher than in canopy gaps, pastures, and agroforestry sites, respectively. Survival rate was similar for trees planted in pastures and secondary forests, but 15–20% higher there than trees planted in agroforestry sites, and 7–12% higher than in canopy gaps. Fruit production was 262% higher for reproductive trees in secondary forest sites compared to pastures, but production probability did not differ between restoration sites. These results show that secondary forests are the most suitable sites for planting Brazil nut trees.  4. In addition to restoration site effects, we also found significant effects of management practices. Survival rate increased with application of fire for clearing and weeding and economic investments and decreased with potentially inefficient herbivore protection. Fruit production was lower for trees planted further away from smallholders’ homes. These results show that smallholders’ management has a substantial effect on establishment success.  5. Our findings suggest a significant importance of post-planting maintenance of trees to increase success of FLR projects. Further, our study shows that evaluation of past restoration activities can guide future forest restoration in tropical landscapes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000500801",,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119575","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500801","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Brazil nut||Forest and landscape restoration||Forest management||Non-timber forest product||Smallholders||Bertholletia excelsa","Establishment success of Brazil nut trees in smallholder Amazon forest restoration depends on site conditions and management",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-08-13T04:10:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85111942222",,"000685977000003","For.

Explanations for this variation across different regions, the “pantropical diversity disparity” (PDD), remain contentious, due to difficulty teasing apart the effects of contemporary climate and paleoenvironmental history. Here, we assess the ubiquity of the PDD in over 150,000 species of terrestrial plants and vertebrates and investigate the relationship between the present-day climate and patterns of species richness. We then investigate the consequences of paleoenvironmental dynamics on the emergence of biodiversity gradients using a spatially explicit model of diversification coupled with paleoenvironmental and plate tectonic reconstructions. Contemporary climate is insufficient in explaining the PDD; instead, a simple model of diversification and temperature niche evolution coupled with paleoaridity constraints is successful in reproducing the variation in species richness and phylogenetic diversity seen repeatedly among plant and animal taxa, suggesting a prevalent role of paleoenvironmental dynamics in combination with niche conservatism. The model indicates that high biodiversity in Neotropical and Indomalayan moist forests is driven by complex macroevolutionary dynamics associated with mountain uplift. In contrast, lower diversity in Afrotropical forests is associated with lower speciation rates and higher extinction rates driven by sustained aridification over the Cenozoic. Our analyses provide a mechanistic understanding of the emergence of uneven diversity in tropical moist forests across 110 Ma of Earth’s history, highlighting the importance of deep-time paleoenvironmental legacies in determining biodiversity patterns.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000510166",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2026347118","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510166","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","plate tectonics||paleoclimate||gen3sis||mechanistic modeling||pantropical diversity disparity","Earth history events shaped the evolution of uneven biodiversity across tropical moist forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-10-16T02:52:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85116392717",,"000710707500003","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","40","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","118","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For tropical Africa, these factors and their interactions remain largely unknown. Here, using samples collected along topographic and geochemical gradients in the East African Rift Valley, we study how soil chemistry and fertility drive soil respiration of soils developed from different parent materials even after many millennia of weathering. To address the drivers of soil respiration, we incubated soils from three regions with contrasting geochemistry (mafic, felsic and mixed sediment) sampled along slope gradients. For three soil depths, we measured the potential maximum heterotrophic respiration under stable environmental conditions and the radiocarbon content (Delta C-14) of the bulk soil and respired CO2. Our study shows that soil fertility conditions are the main determinant of C stability in tropical forest soils. We found that soil microorganisms were able to mineralize soil C from a variety of sources and with variable C quality under laboratory conditions representative of tropical topsoil. However, in the presence of organic carbon sources of poor quality or the presence of strong mineral-related C stabilization, microorganisms tend to discriminate against these energy sources in favour of more accessible forms of soil organic matter, resulting in a slower rate of C cycling. Furthermore, despite similarities in climate and vegetation, soil respiration showed distinct patterns with soil depth and parent material geochemistry. The topographic origin of our samples was not a main determinant of the observed respiration rates and Delta C-14. In situ, however, soil hydrological conditions likely influence soil C stability by inhibiting decomposition in valley subsoils. Our results demonstrate that, even in deeply weathered tropical soils, parent material has a long-lasting effect on soil chemistry that can influence and control microbial activity, the size of subsoil C stocks and the turnover of C in soil. Soil parent material and its control on soil chemistry need to be taken into account to understand and predict C stabilization and rates of C cycling in tropical forest soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000509881",,"2199-3971||2199-398X",,"10.5194/soil-7-639-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/509881","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Heterotrophic soil respiration and carbon cycling in geochemically distinct African tropical forest soils",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-10-15T02:56:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85116390054",,"000703887100001",,"2","Soil","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Maize (Zea mays) wild-type and its hair-defective mutant (Mut; roothairless 3) were grown in two contrasting soil textures (sand and loam). We used a root pressure chamber to measure the relation between transpiration rate (E) and leaf xylem water potential (ψleaf_x) during soil drying. Our hypotheses were: (1) RHs extend root–soil contact and reduce the ψleaf_x decline at high E in dry soils; (2) the impact of RHs is more pronounced in sand; and (3) Muts partly compensate for lacking RHs by producing longer and/or thicker roots. The ψleaf_x(E) relation was linear in wet conditions and became nonlinear as the soils dried. This nonlinearity occurred more abruptly and at less negative matric potentials in sand (ca. −10 kPa) than in loam (ca. −100 kPa). At more negative soil matric potentials, soil hydraulic conductance became smaller than root hydraulic conductance in both soils. Both genotypes exhibited 1.7 times longer roots in loam, but 1.6 times thicker roots in sand. No differences were observed in the ψleaf_x(E) relation and active root length between the two genotypes. In maize, RHs had a minor contribution to soil–plant hydraulics in both soils and their putative role in water uptake was smaller than that reported for barley (Hordeum vulgare). These results suggest that the role of RHs cannot be easily generalized across species and soil textures affect the response of root hydraulics to soil drying.",,,,"0032-0889||1532-2548",,"10.1093/plphys/kiab271","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510873","en","American Society of Plant Biologists",,,,"Soil textures rather than root hairs dominate water uptake and soil-plant hydraulics under drought",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-10-21T03:28:32Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85115232227",,"000710977100035","Plant physiol.","2","Plant Physiology","187","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it remains difficult to predict potential C storage under a given soil or management practice. To study C storage dynamics due to long-term (1952-2009) phosphorus (P) fertilizer and irrigation treatments in New Zealand grasslands, we measured radiocarbon (C-14) in archived soil along with observed changes in C stocks to constrain a compartmental soil model. Productivity increases from P application and irrigation in these trials resulted in very similar C accumulation rates between 1959 and 2009. The increment C-14 changes over the same time period were similar in plots that were both irrigated and fertilized, and only differed in a non-irrigated fertilized plot. Model results indicated that decomposition rates of fast cycling C (0.1 to 0.2 year(-1)) increased to nearly offset increases in inputs. With increasing P fertilization, decomposition rates also increased in the slow pool (0.005 to 0.008 year(-1)). Our findings show sustained, significant (i.e. greater than 4 per mille) increases in C stocks regardless of treatment or inputs. As the majority of fresh inputs remain in the soil for less than 10 years, these long term increases reflect dynamics of the slow pool. Additionally, frequent irrigation was associated with reduced stocks and increased decomposition of fresh plant material. Rates of C gain and decay highlight trade-offs between productivity, nutrient availability, and soil C sequestration as a climate change mitigation strategy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504181",,"0168-2563||1573-515X",,"10.1007/s10533-021-00838-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504181","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Radiocarbon||Soil carbon||Soil modeling||Carbon sequestration||Transit time||SoilR","Soil organic matter turnover rates increase to match increased inputs in grazed grasslands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-09-06T02:45:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85113595550",,"000690331000001","Biogeochemistry (Dordrecht)","1","Biogeochemistry","156","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Research on urban biodiversity is rapidly increasing, yet it is still hampered by the partial spatial coverage of cities and because of existing taxonomic biases. Predictive models have proved to be a key tool to solve this shortfall. However, predictive models have rarely been used in urban ecosystems due to either the lack of sufficient species records or high-quality predictors (e.g. meaningful ecological maps). Here, we assemble a large cross-taxa inventory of 1446 species from 12 taxonomic groups, including several understudied invertebrate groups, sampled in 251 sites in Zürich, Switzerland. We investigate the species diversity distributions and the structure of species assemblages along artificial urban ecological gradients by applying predictive models. We find that the general species diversity distribution law, where assemblages are dominated by a few very abundant and frequent species, applied consistently across all taxonomic groups (3% of the species accounting for approximately 50% of abundance). Furthermore, only species of intermediate abundance and frequency are spatially structured along urban intensity gradients, with rare species numbers keeping constant even in the most urbanised parts of the city. In addition, we show that green areas with low mowing regimes are associated with higher species diversity in the majority of taxonomic groups. Hence, this suggests management relaxation as a low-cost solution to promote species richness. Our study demonstrates the potential of predictive modelling for addressing ecological questions in urban environments and to inform management and planning.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000498285",,"0169-2046||1872-6062","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/498285||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500969","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104137","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/509895","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biotic homogenization||Predictive modelling||Urban ecology||Urban biodiversity||Management||Urban green","Applying predictive models to study the ecological properties of urban ecosystems: A case study in Zürich, Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-07-29T03:31:32Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85110446186",,"000681117300003","Landsc. urban plan.",,"Landscape and Urban Planning","214","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Decision support systems provide detailed information on optimal timing and necessity of crop protection interventions, but are often based on phenology models that are time-, cost-, and labor-intensive in development. Here, we aim to develop a data-driven approach for pest damage forecasting, relying on big data and deep learning algorithms. We present a framework for the development of deep neural networks for pest and pathogen damage classification and show their potential for predicting the phenology of damages. As a case study, we investigate the phenology of the pear leaf blister moth (Leucoptera malifoliella, Costa). We employ a set of 52,322 pictures taken during a period of 19 weeks and establish deep neural networks to categorize the images into six main damage classes. Classification tools achieved good performance scores overall, with differences between the classes indicating that the performance of deep neural networks depends on the similarity to other damages and the number of training images. The reconstructed damage phenology of the pear leaf blister moth matches mine counts in the field. We further develop statistical models to reconstruct the phenology of damages with meteorological data and find good agreement with degree-day models. Hence, our study indicates a yet underexploited potential for data-driven approaches to enhance the versatility and cost efficiency of plant pest and disease forecasting.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000514111",,"2150-8925",,"10.1002/ecs2.3791","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/514111","en","Ecological Society of America","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Decision support system||Deep neural network||Image classification||Insect pest||Phenological modeling","Applying deep neural networks to predict incidence and phenology of plant pests and diseases",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-11-07T05:02:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85118302327",,"000711630100016",,"10","Ecosphere","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, whether these drivers also explain the distribution and traits of a functional subgroup involving cleaner fishes remain unclear. Here we examine the variation in traits of cleaner fishes and test whether historical, environmental, ecological and geographical drivers are correlated with cleaner species richness and abundance at global reefs.  Location Tropical and subtropical reefs.  Taxon Actinopterygii.  Methods We tested whether species traits and trait space vary between facultative (i.e. species that clean only during the juvenile stages or sporadically) and dedicated (i.e. species that clean during their whole lives) cleaner types. We compiled data from local checklists (relative richness) and belt transects (standardized richness and abundance). We built four models to test whether past and current isolation (i.e. distance from Quaternary refugia and biodiversity centres), sea temperature, primary productivity, local species pool and abundance of potential clients influenced the relative richness and abundance of cleaners.  Results Facultative cleaners had high trait variability that contributed disproportionally to the trait space, whereas dedicated cleaners exhibited low trait variability. Cleaner species richness was higher in the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean provinces, but the relative richness and standardized abundance of cleaners were higher in the Atlantic (i.e. North Eastern and Southwestern) and Eastern Pacific. Isolation influenced the relative richness of facultative cleaners, whereas the distance to Quaternary refugia, sea temperature and isolation influenced the relative richness of dedicated cleaners. Local species richness and standardized abundance of cleaner fish exhibited a strong relationship with regional diversity. The standardized abundance of both facultative and dedicated cleaners was influenced by the abundance of potential clients and the local species pool.  Main conclusions The small trait space occupied by cleaner fishes may reflect their restricted origin among lineages of reef fishes. Differences in the relative richness and standardized abundance of cleaner fishes across marine realms suggest a strong influence on biogeographical history. Our results also indicate that cleaner fishes originated mostly in peripheral areas in high latitudes due to the absence of dedicated cleaners. Our results imply that cleaner fishes do not follow the pattern of main centres of origin described for reef fishes due to opportunistic cleaning behaviour that originated with higher frequency at locations with low species richness.",,,,"0305-0270||1365-2699",,"10.1111/jbi.14214","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500946","en","Wiley",,,"dedicated cleaners||diversity gradient||facultative cleaners||marine mutualism||marine realms||relative species richness||standardize abundance||trait species","Patterns of taxonomic and functional diversity in the global cleaner reef fish fauna",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-08-14T02:42:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85111911003",,"000682021900001","J. biogeogr.","10","Journal of Biogeography","48","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In tree-ring research, microdensitometric techniques are widely used, but their ability to determine the correct central tendency has been questioned. Though rarely used, it may be possible to use bulk wood density as a tool to check the accuracy of and even correct microdensitometric measurements. Since measuring bulk wood density in parallel with X-ray densitometry is quickly and easily done, we suspect that its omission is largely due to a lack of awareness of the procedure and/or its importance. In this study, we describe a simple protocol for measuring bulk wood density tailored for tree-ring researchers and demonstrate a few possible applications. To implement real-world examples of the applications, we used a sample of existing X-ray and Blue Intensity (BI) measurements from 127 living and dead Pinus sylvestris trees from northern Sweden to produce new measurements of bulk wood density.  We can confirm that the central tendency in this sample material is offset using X-ray densitometry and that the diagnosis and correction of X-ray density is easily done using bulk wood density in linear transfer functions. However, this approach was not suitable for our BI measurements due to heavy discoloration. Nevertheless, we were able to use bulk wood density to diagnose and improve the use of deltaBI (latewood BI – earlywood BI) with regard to its overall trends and multi-centennial variability in a dendroclimatological application. Moreover, we experimented with percent of latewood width, scaled with bulk wood density, as a time- and cost-effective proxy for annual ring density. Although our reconstruction only explains about half of the variation in ring density, it is most likely superior to using fixed literature values of density in allometric equations aimed at biomass estimations.  With this study, we hope to raise new awareness regarding the versatility and importance of bulk wood density for dendrochronology by demonstrating its simplicity, relevance, and applicability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505968",,,,"10.1016/j.dendro.2021.125880","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505968","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Gravimetric-volumetric wood density||Dendroclimatology||Biomass||blue intensity||X-ray density","The utility of bulk wood density for tree-ring research",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-09-19T02:58:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85114813110",,"000702860900008",,,"Dendrochronologia","69","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We investigated whether leaf discoloration is synchronized within and across tree species and under which climatic conditions premature leaf discoloration (i.e. exceptionally early dates of leaf discoloration within the lower 5 % percentile) occurs. We analyzed 16’865 observations of leaf discoloration from nine deciduous tree species (beech, silver birch, horse chestnut, larch, large-leaved linden, rowan, small-leaved lime, sweet chestnut, sycamore) from a phenological network in Switzerland. Records of leaf discoloration were included from 222 stations that were located between 200 and 1933 m and covered the period 1971–2018. Leaf discoloration of most species has been significantly delayed by 1.5 to 3.3 days per decade from 1996 to 2018. We detected a synchronous temporal pattern of leaf discoloration both within and across species. For most species, premature leaf discoloration occurred in years with very warm and dry spring-summer conditions or with very cool fall temperatures. Premature leaf discoloration was observed in 10-40 % of all stations during these years, whereas the long-term mean was 4-6 %. Growing degree days in May and June were significantly higher and the climatic water balance in June was significantly lower in years with premature leaf discoloration compared to years with regular leaf discoloration, especially for drought sensitive species such as beech. Similarly, minimum temperatures in September were consistently lower in years with premature leaf discoloration. Our study provides the first systematic and long-term assessment under which climatic conditions premature leaf discoloration occurs. We expect that the future increase in the frequency and severity of droughts in Europe will likely increase the risk of premature leaf discoloration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000489135",,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108492","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/489135","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Phenology||Premature leaf coloration||Temperature||Growing degree days||Water balance||Mixed-effects models","Premature leaf discoloration of European deciduous trees is caused by drought and heat in late spring and cold spells in early fall",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-06-10T14:34:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85107656071",,"000682515100016","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","307","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Several studies researched the ecological consequences of direct climate change effects on bioclimatic conditions during the growing period of trees. However, the complementary and indirect effects through phenological shifts on these conditions have been insufficiently investigated. We analysed 49088 leaf unfolding and leaf colouring dates of six major European tree species from Switzerland, observed between 200 and 1900 m a.s.l. during 1961–2018. We estimated phenological trends, the resulting changes in bioclimatic conditions during the growing period, and the relative contributions of phenological shifts towards these changes. Our results show that climate change advanced leaf unfolding by up to –3.0 days/decade since 1985. Leaf colouring was mainly delayed at low elevations and was advanced or delayed at high elevations with species-specific rates between –3.1 and +4.0 days/decade. While the length of the growing period and growing degree-days increased for most species after 1985, precipitation during the growing period predominantly decreased by up to –43.6 mm/decade. Furthermore, drought intensity during the growing period (based on the number of days with negative water balance) increased significantly for most species, reaching +6.7 days/decade at low elevations. Phenological shifts amplified the trends towards drier conditions by up to +81% at low elevations for beech, rowan, and sycamore, but weakened them by up to –84% at high elevations for beech, rowan, sycamore, and larch. These findings indicate widely increased drought stress, especially at lower elevations. Further, we conclude that future forest net ecosystem productivity in Central Europe will depend strongly on elevation and species composition, despite a general lengthening of the growing period for trees.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488417",,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108485","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488417","en","Elsevier BV","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Tree||Leaf phenology||Growing period||Climate change||Trend||Drought stress","Phenological shifts induced by climate change amplify drought for broad-leaved trees at low elevations in Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-06-06T15:14:35Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Assessing climate impacts on tree phenology and growth rates: combining phenological observations with tree-ring data","179144","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85110290172",,"000682515100008","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","307","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Madagascar, as a hotspot for biodiversity, has a network of 114 terrestrial protected areas covering the main forest types occurring on the island. Deforestation continues unabated despite the network covering 11% of the island. Here we present a case study approach reporting on four PAs from the humid forests, dry western forests, and southwestern dry and spiny forests and thickets. To describe deforestation in and around the case sites, we have considered a time window of 30 years for analysis, focusing on six years with reliable data: 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015 (the year of latest PA network update), and 2017. We have considered forest versus other land covers within the PAs in ""buffers"" at a distance of 500 m, 2.5 km, 5 km, and 10 km from the border of the PA. These buffers were set from the border towards the center of the PA (inside the PAs) and from the border outside the PAs. The smallest PAs, Kasijy (IUCN IV), and Behara Tranomaro (no IUCN category), showed the least forest loss. Tsaratanana (IUCN I) had the highest deforestation rates within the last two years of analysis, with deforestation concentrated in the core area. Ranobe PK-32 (no IUCN category), originally with the largest forest extent, has lost most of its forest cover and showed the highest annual deforestation rate (3.5%) between 2015 and 2017.

While tree regeneration is a highly stochastic process, tree regeneration studies often cover narrow environmental gradients only, focusing on specific forest types or species in distinct regions. Thus, the larger-scale effects of temperature, water availability, and stand structure on tree regeneration are poorly understood. We investigated these effects in respect of tree recruitment (in-growth) along wide environmental gradients using forest inventory data from Flanders (Belgium), northwestern Germany, and Switzerland covering more than 40 tree species. We employed generalized linear mixed models to capture the abundance of tree recruitment in response to basal area, stem density, shade casting ability of a forest stand as well as site-specific degree-day sum (temperature), water balance, and plant-available water holding capacity. We grouped tree species to facilitate comparisons between species with different levels of tolerance to shade and drought. Basal area and shade casting ability of the overstory had generally a negative impact on tree recruitment, but the effects differed between levels of shade tolerance of tree recruitment in all study regions. Recruitment rates of very shade-tolerant species were positively affected by shade casting ability. Stem density and summer warmth (degree-day sum) had similar effects on all tree species and successional strategies. Water-related variables revealed a high degree of uncertainty and did not allow for general conclusions. All variables had similar effects independent of the varying diameter thresholds for tree recruitment in the different data sets. Synthesis: Shade tolerance and stand structure are the main drivers of tree recruitment along wide environmental gradients in temperate forests. Higher temperature generally increases tree recruitment rates, but the role of water relations and drought tolerance remains uncertain for tree recruitment on cross-regional scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000501761",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.7984","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/501761","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","drought tolerance||forest ecosystems||forest reserves||national forest inventories||plant population and community dynamics||shade tolerance||tree recruitment||tree regeneration","Tree recruitment is determined by stand structure and shade tolerance with uncertain role of climate and water relations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-08-23T05:42:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Tackling the most elusive process in forest dynamics: tree regeneration","ETH-35 18-1","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,"85113156433",,"000686418300001","Ecol Evol","17","Ecology and Evolution","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This approach is the key to analyzing the ecological resilience to drought, stress-induced mortality, and economic efficiency of managed mixed forest stands in Central Europe. The results show that specific geographic conditions and forest composition define the optimal stand density of drought-resilient forests.  Context Reducing stand density has been recognized as a valid strategy to increase forest resilience to drought. Moreover, to develop adaptive management strategies (AMS) under climate change, it is crucial to consider not only drought resilience but also the economic efficiency of alternative AMS proposed to alleviate drought effects.  Aims To analyze how decreased inter-tree competition among overstorey trees affects stand vulnerability to drought and its expected yield.  Methods We integrated experimental thinning data and historical responses to drought years in a climate-sensitive forest gap model, ForClim. We tested a business as usual (BAU) and three alternative AMS (“do-nothing,” low- and high-intensity overstorey removal) in mixed stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies), silver fir (Abies alba), and European beech (Fagus sylvatica) along an elevational gradient of 520–1020 m a.s.l. in Central Europe.  Results High-intensity overstorey removal in mixed stands of all three species considerably increased forest volume growth resilience to drought and decreased stress-induced mortality by two-thirds vis à vis a “do-nothing” strategy. In sites including only conifer species, forest resilience was equally improved by high- and low-intensity overstorey removal compared to that in the BAU strategy. Regarding the timber economy, high-intensity overstorey removal resulted in a higher economic revenue of mixed stands (~ 22% higher net present value than other strategies) on the high-elevation sites (> 1000 m a.s.l.).  Conclusion Modifying forest density and structure by overstorey removal is principally suitable to increase forest resilience to drought and improve its economic efficiency. The magnitude of the effect however depends on the geographical setting and forest composition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000500777",,"1286-4560||1297-966X",,"10.1007/s13595-021-01085-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500777","en","INRA","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Adaptation to climate change||Net present value||Density reduction||Overstorey trees||Altitudinal gradient","Magnitude and timing of density reduction are key for the resilience to severe drought in conifer-broadleaf mixed forests in Central Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-08-13T04:00:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85112490028",,"000681744000001","Ann. for. sci.","3","Annals of Forest Science","78","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Reconstructing the timing of surface uplift for each of the different Andean regions is of crucial importance for our understanding of continental-scale moisture transport and atmospheric circulation, the origin and evolution of the Amazon River and Rainforest, and ultimately, the origin and evolution of species on the world most biodiverse continent. Here, I present (1) a compilation of estimates of paleoelevation for 36 geomorphological domains of the Andes from the literature, and (2) a paleoelevation reconstruction of the Andes since 80 Ma. In the northern Andes, uplift started in the Late Cretaceous (~70 Ma) in the Western and Central Cordilleras of Ecuador, while the northwestern corner of the continent was still covered by shallow seas. Mountain building migrated progressively northwards, with the Perija Range and Santander Massif uplifting since the Oligocene and the Eastern Cordillera, Garzon Massif and Mérida Andes since the Miocene. In the central Andes, uplift migrated from west to east, whereby the main phase of uplift in the Western Cordillera took place during the Late Cretaceous-Paleocene, in the western Puna plateau during the Paleocene, in the eastern Puna plateau during the early-mid Miocene, and in the Altiplano and Eastern Cordillera during the mid-late Miocene. In the southern Patagonian Andes, significant elevation was already in place at 80 Ma and in western Patagonia, modern elevations were reached in the early Eocene. A second pulse of uplift and eastward migration of the orogenic front occurred during the early-mid Miocene. The reconstruction developed here is made available as a series of raster files, so that it can be used as input for a variety of studies in the solid Earth, climate, and biological sciences, thereby being a stepping stone on the path towards a better understanding of the coevolution of the solid Earth, landscapes, climate, and life in South America.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484833",,"0012-8252||1872-6828",,"10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103640","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484833","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Andes||Paleoaltimetry||Paleoelevation||Reconstruction||Mountain building","Andean mountain building since the Late Cretaceous: A paleoelevation reconstruction",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2021-05-19T08:19:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85111020110",,"000703125600001","Earth-sci. rev.",,"Earth-Science Reviews","220","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Thus, it is useful to predict their seasonal timing and reveal their main drivers. The typical timing of low flows varies between regions, yet systematic overviews across Europe and the United States are rare. Here, we identify regional patterns of the seasonal timing of annual minimum flows, and the consistency of that timing, across 1860 European and US catchments. Catchments where low flows typically occur during late summer or winter tend to have more consistent low-flow timings. We compare the timing of annual low flows with that of potential climatic drivers. Low flows in 89% of the European and 86% of the US catchments exhibit a statistically significant (p < 0.05) overlap in timing with at least one potential climatic driver. In most catchments, low flows tend to occur during the warm season, reflecting a period of high potential evapotranspiration exceeding precipitation. In the higher elevation European Alps, Scandinavia, the Rocky Mountains, and the Upper Midwest and Plains states, low flows mostly occur during winter as a result of freezing temperatures which inhibit snowmelt. Binomial statistics also enabled us to statistically exclude individual climatic drivers for certain regions. The regional patterns of timings and drivers of low flows across Europe and the contiguous US can inform low-flow management, provide context for the evolution of low flows under climate change, and point to processes that require attention in future low-flow research.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507985",,"0043-1397||1944-7973",,"10.1029/2019WR026928","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507985","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","low flow||seasonality||climate||drought||precipitation||evapotranspiration","Seasonality and Drivers of Low Flows Across Europe and the United States",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-10-02T02:42:44Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85115666226",,"000703704400049","Water Resour.

This nexus of population growth and ecological impact will continue to exacerbate landscape degradation in the coming decades. To quantify the effects of land-use intensity on soil nutrient stocks and the functional composition of young regrowth forest in the Congo Basin, we used fallows of different ages that had been subjected to a varying number of clearing cycles. We show that repeated clearing substantially affected soil cation stocks, reducing total K, Mg and Ca in the upper 20 cm of soil by roughly 20% per clearing cycle. Additionally, we show that plant-available nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate) and phosphorus decline in the topsoil with increasing land-use intensity. Furthermore, the tree functional composition of young fallows changed after repeated clearing cycles: we observed a decrease in abundance of pioneer species and an increase in nitrogen fixing species early in succession. Variation in soil total nutrient stocks was decoupled from changes in vegetation, and soil plant-available nutrients only marginally explained tree functional composition changes. We conclude that land-use intensity substantially affects both soil total and plant-available nutrients in a shifting cultivation system, as well as the functional composition of the regenerating vegetation. However, compositional changes of the tree community are only partly driven by land-use intensity effects on soil plant-available nutrients.",,,,"1432-9840||1435-0629","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468473||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526248","10.1007/s10021-020-00593-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539038","en","Springer",,,"Secondary forests||Forest recovery||Congo basin||Slash-and-burn||Shifting agriculture||Swidden agriculture||Tropical forest","Soil Nutrient Depletion and Tree Functional Composition Shift Following Repeated Clearing in Secondary Forests of the Congo Basin",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-02-09T07:57:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85099906938",,"000612608500008",,"6","Ecosystems","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These sediments may deposit inside the pore-space and alter its geometry. In turn, the changing pore structure modifies the preferential flow paths, resulting in a strong coupling between structural modifications and transport characteristics. Here, we compare two different models that lead to channel obstruction as a result of subsequent deposition. The first model randomly obstructs pore-throats across the porous medium, while the second model always blocks the pore-throat with the highest flow rate. By subsequently closing pores, we find that the breakdown of the permeability follows a power-law scaling, whose exponent depends on the obstruction model. The pressure jumps that occur during the obstruction process follow a universal power-law distribution with the same scaling exponent as the avalanche size distribution of invasion percolation. The fact that this exponent is also independent of the model suggests that the clogging processes and invasion percolation may belong to the same universality class.",,,,"1070-6631||1089-7666||0031-9171",,"10.1063/5.0064967","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510196","en","American Institute of Physics",,,,"The critical behavior of the clogging process in a porous medium",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-10-17T02:58:55Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85116398568",,"000717562400003","Phys Fluids","9","Physics of Fluids","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Effective strategies to adapt forests to such droughts require comprehensive information on the effects and importance of the factors influencing forest resistance and resilience. We used a unique combination of inventory and dendrochronological data from a long-term (>30 years) silvicultural experiment in mixed silver fir and Norway spruce mountain forests along a temperature and precipitation gradient in southwestern Germany. We aimed at examining the mechanisms and forest stand characteristics underpinning the resistance and resilience to past mild and severe droughts. We found that (i) fir benefited from mild droughts and showed higher resistance (i.e., lower growth loss during drought) and resilience (i.e., faster return to pre-drought growth levels) than spruce to all droughts; (ii) species identity determined mild drought responses while species interactions and management-related factors strongly influenced the responses to severe droughts; (iii) intraspecific and interspecific interactions had contrasting effects on the two species, with spruce being less resistant to severe droughts when exposed to interaction with fir and beech; (iv) higher values of residual stand basal area following thinning were associated with lower resistance and resilience to severe droughts; and (v) larger trees were resilient to mild drought events but highly vulnerable to severe droughts. Our study provides an analytical approach for examining the effects of different factors on individual tree- and stand-level drought response. The forests investigated here were to a certain extent resilient to mild droughts, and even benefited from such conditions, but were strongly affected by severe droughts. Lastly, negative effects of severe droughts can be reduced through modifying species composition, tree size distribution and stand density in mixed silver fir-Norway spruce forests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493346",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15737","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493346","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Abies alba||adaptation strategies||climate change||forest management||inventory data||Picea abies||species interaction||tree rings","Growth resistance and resilience of mixed silver fir and Norway spruce forests in central Europe: Contrasting responses to mild and severe droughts",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-07-07T03:01:35Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85108797243",,"000665180200001","Glob.

However, the consequences of land conversion on biogeochemical cycles are still largely unknown as they are not studied in a landscape context that defines the geomorphic, geochemical, and pedological framework in which biological processes take place. Thus, the response of tropical soils to disturbance by erosion and land conversion is one of the great uncertainties in assessing the carrying capacity of tropical landscapes to grow food for future generations and in predicting greenhouse gas fluxes from soils to the atmosphere and, hence, future earth system dynamics.  Here we describe version 1.0 of an open-access database created as part of the project “Tropical soil organic carbon dynamics along erosional disturbance gradients in relation to variability in soil geochemistry and land use” (TropSOC). TropSOC v1.0 (Doetterl et al., 2021, https://doi.org/10.5880/fidgeo.2021.009) contains spatially and temporally explicit data on soil, vegetation, environmental properties, and land management collected from 136 pristine tropical forest and cropland plots between 2017 and 2020 as part of monitoring and sampling campaigns in the eastern Congo Basin and the East African Rift Valley system. The results of several laboratory experiments focusing on soil microbial activity, C cycling, and C stabilization in soils complement the dataset to deliver one of the first landscape-scale datasets to study the linkages and feedbacks between geology, geomorphology, and pedogenesis as controls on biogeochemical cycles in a variety of natural and managed systems in the African Tropics.  The hierarchical and interdisciplinary structure of the TropSOC database allows linking of a wide range of parameters and observations on soil and vegetation dynamics along with other supporting information that may also be measured at one or more levels of the hierarchy. TropSOC's data mark a significant contribution to improve our understanding of the fate of biogeochemical cycles in dynamic and diverse tropical African (agro-)ecosystems.

These observations raise concerns about forest ecosystem services and post-drought growth recovery given the projected increase in drought frequency and extremes. For quantifying the impact of extreme droughts on tree radial growth, we used a network of tree-ring width data of 1689 trees from 100 sites representing most of the distribution of two drought tolerant, deciduous oak species (Quercus petraea and Quercus robur). We first examined which climatic factors and seasons control growth of the two species and if there is any latitudinal, longitudinal or elevational trend. We then quantified the relative departure from pre-drought growth during droughts, and how fast trees were able to recover the pre-drought growth level. Our results showed that growth was more related to precipitation and climatic water balance (precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration) than to temperature. However, we did not detect any clear latitudinal, longitudinal or elevational trends except a decreasing influence of summer water balance on growth of Q. petraea with latitude. Neither species was able to maintain the pre-drought growth level during droughts. However, both species showed rapid recovery or even growth compensation after summer droughts but displayed slow recovery in response to spring droughts where none of the two species was able to fully recover the pre-drought growth-level over the three post-drought years. Collectively, our results indicate that oaks which are considered resilient to extreme droughts have also shown vulnerability when droughts occurred in spring especially at sites where long-term growth is not significantly correlated with climatic factors. This improved understanding of the role of drought seasonality and climate sensitivity of sites is key to better predict trajectories of post-drought growth recovery in response to the drier climate projected for Europe.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000481161",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147222","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/481161","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Warming||Drought||Legacy effects||Acclimation||Tree rings","Climate sensitivity and drought seasonality determine post-drought growth recovery of Quercus petraea and Quercus robur in Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-04-28T19:43:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85105689898",,"000657590200006","Sci.

Therefore, we studied the spatial patterns of living and dead small trees in two subalpine Norway spruce forest reserves in Switzerland (Scatlè and Bödmerenwald) using three types of analyses. First, we investigated the distances of small trees to the nearest large neighboring tree and, by using maximum distances as indicator, inferred the size of forest gaps, detecting mainly forest gaps of small size, although with two exceptions that were driven by large-scale disturbances. Second, we accounted for spatial inhomogeneity in the pattern of small and large trees (i.e., variations in local tree densities) by including environmental covariates in point pattern models. Latitude (within the forest reserve), elevation and aspect contributed significantly to explaining the density of living and dead small trees, and partly of living and dead large trees. Yet, the influence of these environmental covariates varied between the two reserves due to their different topography and peculiar site conditions. Third, we analyzed neighborhood interactions between small and large trees based on the vicinity and size of trees. In both forest reserves, small living trees were randomly dispersed around large dead trees over a broad range of distances and, at certain distances in one reserve, even dispersed away from them. Small living trees further showed clustering around large living trees at short distances and dispersion at large distances. Small dead trees featured mainly a random pattern, although with a tendency to cluster around large neighbors at short distances, irrespective whether these were living or dead. Yet, the weakening of clustering with increasing distances indicates that the influence of large trees on small trees varies with spatial scale and thus that these neighborhood interactions are scale-dependent. Overall, our study contributes to a better understanding of the spatial ecology of mortality in small trees and ultimately of tree regeneration processes and stand dynamics in mountain forests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000483971",,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119315","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/483971","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Picea abies||Tree mortality||Tree regeneration||Mountain forest||Nearest neighbor distance||Canopy gap size||Inhomogeneous marked point pattern analysis||Spatial inhomogeneity||Ripley’s inhomogeneous bivariate function||Neighborhood interaction","Spatial patterns of living and dead small trees in subalpine Norway spruce forest reserves in Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-05-12T14:44:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Advanced Tree MOrtality MOdeling (ATMO^2)","163250||163250","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85105581672",,"000657598600001","For.

However, the relative simplicity of such models, in terms of parameterisation, use and interpretation, could make them valuable tools for studying and managing such forests. In particular, the effects of climate change on the stand-level growth of forests with negative exponential shaped size distributions has received very little attention compared with even-aged forests. The first objective of this study was to validate 3-PG, a stand-level process-based model, for five types of uneven-aged forests in Switzerland; (1) Fagus sylvatica dominated, (2) Picea abies dominated, (3) mixtures of Picea abies and Abies alba, (4) mixtures of Picea abies, Abies alba and Fagus sylvatica, and (5) mixtures of Larix decidua, Pinus cembra and P. abies. The second objective was to use 3-PG to examine how climate change has influenced the growth of these forests since the 1930s.  3-PG predictions of biomass, biomass partitioning in above- and belowground components, and light absorption were validated using inventory data from 23 plots, which had been monitored for an average of 81 years (15 to 112 years). For all species and size classes (2–3 per species), 3-PG produced accurate predictions of root biomass, stem biomass and outputs derived from it such as mean diameter, basal area and height, which were all highly correlated with the observed values (R2 > 0.86). The slope of predicted versus observed values was often not significantly different to 1 (averaged 1.13) and the bias averaged −1.2%.  3-PG simulations to examine the effects of climate change without the confounding effects of stand structure and management, showed that the growth of the five forests types has, on average, increased by 17% since the 1930s. The growth was mainly influenced by temperature, while in the case of A. alba, growth was largely influenced by vapour pressure deficit. The accelerated growth rates imply that thinning intensities also need to increase to prevent high stand densities from inhibiting regeneration in these uneven-aged forests. This study shows that 3-PG can be used to predict the growth dynamics of uneven-aged mixed-species forests, and to our knowledge, this is the first time a stand-level process-based forest growth model has been used and validated for such forests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000588201",,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119271","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588201",,"Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate Change||Mixed species forest||Continuous cover||Maestra model||Plenter forest","Effects of climate on the growth of Swiss uneven-aged forests: Combining >100 years of observations with the 3-PG model",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-12-19T14:34:40Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For.

While leaf, growth, and storage traits are known to be key components of shade tolerance, their interplay during regeneration development and their influence on juveniles' survival time remains unclear. We assessed the ontogenetic effects of these three traits on the survival time of beech (Fagus sylvatica), and Norway and sycamore maples (Acer pseudoplatanus, Acer platanoides) in a primeval beech forest. Biomass allocation, age, and content of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) were measured in the stems and roots of 289 seedlings and saplings in high- and low-vitality classes. Saplings experienced a trade-off between absolute growth rate (AGR) and storage (NSC) as the leaf area ratio (LAR) decreases with biomass development. High LAR but low AGR and low NSC corresponded to beech with a marked ability to persist in deep shade while awaiting canopy release. In turn, a comparably small LAR in combination with a high AGR and higher storage (NSC), as observed in Norway maple and sycamore maple, reduced sapling survival time, thus offering an explanation for beech dominance and maple disappearance in the undergrowth of old-growth beech forests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494395",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.7800","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494395","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Acer||AGR||dominance||Fagus||functional trait||LAR||NSC||regeneration||shade tolerance","Grow slowly, persist, dominate—Explaining beech dominance in a primeval forest",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-07-14T02:22:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85109386645",,"000670446700001","Ecol Evol","15","Ecology and Evolution","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Single species forest systems often suffer from low resistance and resilience to perturbations. Consequently, fostering tree species diversity is discussed as an important management approach to address the impacts of changing climate and disturbance regimes. Yet, the effect of the spatial grain of tree species mixtures remains unknown. 2. We asked whether increasing tree species diversity between stands (beta diversity) has the same effect as increasing tree species diversity within stands (alpha diversity) at similar overall levels of richness (gamma diversity). We conducted a multi-model simulation experiment under climate change, applying two forest landscape models (iLand and LandClim) across two contrasting landscapes of Central Europe. We analysed the effect of different levels and configurations of diversity on the disturbance impact and the temporal stability of biomass stocks and forest structure. 3. In general, increasing levels of diversity decreased disturbance impacts. Positive diversity effects increased with increasing severity of climate change. Beta diversity buffered disturbance impacts on landscape-level biomass stocks more strongly than alpha diversity. The effects of the spatial configuration on forest structure were more variable. Diversity effects on temporal stability were less pronounced compared to disturbance impacts, and mixture within and between stands had comparable effects on temporal stability. 4. Diversity effects were context-dependent, with patterns varying between landscapes and indicators. Furthermore, we found a strong species identity effect, with increasing diversity being particularly beneficial in conifer-dominated systems of the European Alps. The two models agreed on the effects of different levels and configurations of tree species diversity, underlining the robustness of our findings. 5. Synthesis and application. Enhancing tree species diversity can buffer forest ecosystems against increasing levels of perturbation. Mixing tree species between stands is at least as effective as mixing tree species within stands. Given the managerial advantages of between-stand mixtures (e.g. reduced need to control competition to maintain diversity, higher timber quality, lower logistic effort), we conclude that forest management should consider enhancing diversity at multiple spatial scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494863",,"0021-8901||1365-2664",,"10.1111/1365-2664.13912","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494863","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","beta diversity||biodiversity||climate change||disturbances||forest||forest management||resilience||species diversity","Mixing tree species at different spatial scales: The effect of alpha, beta and gamma diversity on disturbance impacts under climate change",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-07-15T10:27:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85107050099",,"000657293800001","J.

This Review discusses the general characteristics and changes in water vapour residence time, indicating 3-6% K-1 projected increases with warming.||Atmospheric water vapour residence time (WVRT) is an essential indicator of how atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics mediate hydrological cycle responses to climate change. WVRT is also important in estimating moisture sources and sinks, linking evaporation and precipitation across spatial scales. In this Review, we outline how WVRT is shaped by the interaction between evaporation and precipitation, and, thus, reflects anthropogenic changes in the hydrological cycle. Estimates of WVRT differ owing to contrasting definitions, but these differences can be reconciled by framing WVRT as a probability density function with a mean of 8-10 days and a median of 4-5 days. WVRT varies spatially and temporally in response to regional, seasonal and synoptic-scale differences in evaporation, precipitation, long-range moisture transport and atmospheric mixing. Theory predicts, and observations confirm, that in most (but not all) regions, anthropogenic warming is increasing atmospheric humidity faster than it is speeding up rates of evaporation and precipitation. Warming is, thus, projected to increase global WVRT by 3-6% K-1, lengthening the distance travelled between evaporation sources and precipitation sinks. Future efforts should focus on data integration, joint measurement initiatives and intercomparisons, and dynamic simulations to provide a formal resolution of WVRT from both Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives.",,,,"2662-138X",,"10.1038/s43017-021-00181-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499938","en","Nature",,,,"The residence time of water vapour in the atmosphere",,"Review Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-08-07T03:42:50Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85110677694",,"000674394600001","Nat Rev Earth Environ",,"Nature Reviews Earth & Environment","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, evidence on the macronutrient regulation of soil GHG fluxes from central African tropical forests is still lacking, limiting our understanding of how these biomes could respond to potential future increases in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition. The aim of this study was to disentangle the regulation effect of soil nutrients on soil GHG fluxes from a Ugandan tropical forest reserve in the context of increasing N and P deposition. Therefore, a large-scale nutrient manipulation experiment (NME), based on 40m x 40m plots with different nutrient addition treatments (N, P, N + P, and control), was established in the Budongo Central Forest Reserve. Soil carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured monthly, using permanently installed static chambers, for 14 months. Total soil CO2 fluxes were partitioned into autotrophic and heterotrophic components through a root trenching treatment. In addition, soil temperature, soil water content, and nitrates were measured in parallel to GHG fluxes. N addition (N and N + P) resulted in significantly higher N2O fluxes in the transitory phase (0-28 d after fertilization; p < 0.01) because N fertilization likely increased soil N beyond the microbial immobilization and plant nutritional demands, leaving the excess to be nitrified or denitrified. Prolonged N fertilization, however, did not elicit a significant response in background (measured more than 28 d after fertilization) N2O fluxes. P fertilization marginally and significantly increased transitory (p = 0.05) and background (p = 0.01) CH4 consumption, probably because it enhanced methanotrophic activity. The addition of N and P (N + P) resulted in larger CO2 fluxes in the transitory phase (p = 0.01), suggesting a possible co-limitation of both N and P on soil respiration. Heterotrophic (microbial) CO2 effluxes were significantly higher than the autotrophic (root) CO2 effluxes (p < 0.01) across all treatment plots, with microbes contributing about two-thirds of the total soil CO2 effluxes. However, neither heterotrophic nor autotrophic respiration significantly differed between treatments.

Past demography processes due to post-glacial recolonization and adaptation to local environmental conditions are among the main contributors to genetic differentiation processes among provenances. Assessing the intra-specific variability of tree growth responses to such changes is crucial to explore a species' potential to cope with climate warming. We combined growth-related traits derived from tree-ring width series with neutral genetic information of 18 European provenances of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) growing in two common garden experiments in Switzerland.  Analyses based on neutral single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) revealed that the studied provenances grouped into three longitudinal clusters. These three genetic clusters showed differences in growth traits (height and DBH), with the provenances from the eastern cluster exhibiting the highest growth. The Pyrenees cluster showed significantly lower recovery and resilience to the extreme drought of 2003 as well as lower values of growth autocorrelation. QST-FST and correlation analyses with climate of provenance origin suggest that the differences among provenances found in some traits result from natural selection.  Our study suggests that the last post-glacial re-colonization and natural selection are the major drivers explaining the intra-specific variability in growth of silver fir across Europe. These findings highlight the importance of combining dendroecology and genetic analyses on fitness-related traits to assess the potential of a species to cope with global environmental change and provide insights to support assisted gene flow to ensure the persistence of the species in European forests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000475554",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146393","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/475554","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Abies alba||Common garden experiment||Dendrochronology||Neutral genetics||Local adaptation||Tree rings","Post-glacial re-colonization and natural selection have shaped growth responses of silver fir across Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-03-21T20:00:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85102828212",,"000655687200009","Sci.

To maintain the ecosystem functions of carbon sequestration and timber supply in tropical production forests over a long term, forest management must be sustainable under changing climate conditions. Individual-based forest models are useful tools to enhance our understanding about the long-term effects of harvest and climate change on forest dynamics because they link empirical field data with simulations of ecological processes.  The objective of this study is to analyze the combined effects of selective logging and climate change on biomass stocks and timber harvest in a tropical forest in French Guiana. By applying a forest model, we simulated natural forest dynamics under the baseline scenario of current climate conditions and compared the results with scenarios of selective logging under climate change. The analyses revealed how substantially forest dynamics are altered under different scenarios of climate change. (1) Repeated logging within recovery times decreased biomass and timber harvest, irrespective of the intensity of climate change. (2) With moderate climate change as envisaged by the 5th IPCC Assessment Report (representative concentration pathway 2.6), the average biomass remained the same as in the baseline scenario (−1%), but with intensive climate change (RCP 8.5), the average biomass decreased by 12%. (3) The combination of selective logging and climate change increased the likelihood of changes in forest dynamics, driven mainly by rising temperatures. Under RCP 8.5, the average timber harvest was almost halved, regardless of the logging cycle applied.  An application-oriented use of forest models will help to identify opportunities to reduce the effects of unwanted ecosystem changes in a changing environment. To ensure that ecosystem functions in production forests are maintained under climate change conditions, appropriate management strategies will help to maintain biomass and harvest in production forests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000481342",,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119166","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/481342","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Aboveground biomass||Timber harvest||Climate change mitigation||Forest degradation||Individual-based forest modeling||Forest management||Tropical forestry||French Guiana||Paracou","Climate change alters the ability of neotropical forests to provide timber and sequester carbon",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-04-29T11:19:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85104466535",,"000647648400002","For.

However, there is limited knowledge on soil redistribution dynamics following land conversion into arable land in tropical Africa that is partly caused by infrastructure limitations for long-term landscape-scale monitoring. In this study, fallout radionuclides 239+240Pu are used to assess soil redistribution along topographic gradients at two cropland sites and at three nearby pristine forest sites located in the DR Congo, Uganda and Rwanda. In the study area, a 239+240Pu baseline inventory is found that is higher than typically expected for tropical regions (mean forest inventory 41Bqm-2). Pristine forests show no indication of soil redistribution based on 239+240Pu along topographical gradients. In contrast, soil erosion and sedimentation on cropland reached up to 37cm (81Mgha-1yr-1) and 40cm (87Mgha-1yr-1) within the last 55 years, respectively. Cropland sites show high intra-slope variability with locations showing severe soil erosion located in direct proximity to sedimentation sites.

Here, we show that temperature sensitivity of soil respiration is primarily controlled by interacting soil properties and only secondarily by vegetation traits and plant growth conditions. Temperature was not identified as a primary driver for the response of soil respiration to warming. In contrast, the nonlinearity and large spatial variability of identified controls stress the importance of the interplay among soil, vegetation and climate parameters in controlling warming responses. Global models might predict current soil respiration but not future rates because they neglect the controls exerted by soil development. To accurately predict the response of soil respiration to warming at the global scale, more observational studies across pedogenetically diverse soils are needed rather than focusing on the isolated effect of warming alone.",,,,"1758-6798",,"10.1038/s41558-021-01068-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491763","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,"Biogeochemistry||Ecological modelling||Environmental chemistry||Statistics","Global patterns of geo-ecological controls on the response of soil respiration to warming",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-06-28T10:19:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85107277813",,"000657627300007","Nat.

How a river’s gradient changes as it descends along its course—its longitudinal profile concavity—varies greatly from one basin to the next, reflecting the interplay between uplift and erosional processes. A recent global analysis has suggested that climatic aridity should be a first-order control on river profile concavity, but the importance of climate relative to other factors has not been tested at global scale. Here, we show, using recent global datasets of climate, river profiles and tectonic activity, that tectonics is much more strongly expressed than climate in global patterns of river profile concavity. River profiles tend to be more strongly concave in tectonically active regions along plate boundaries, reflecting tectonically induced spatial variations in uplift rates. Rank correlations between river profile concavity and four global tectonic proxies (basin-averaged channel gradients, distance to plate boundaries and two measures of seismic activity) are much stronger than those between river concavity and three climate metrics (precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and aridity). We explain the association between tectonic activity and increased river profile concavity through a simple conceptual model of long-term uplift and river incision. These results show that tectonics, and not climate, exerts dominant control on the shape of river longitudinal profiles globally.",,,,"1752-0908||1752-0894",,"10.1038/s41561-021-00720-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495014","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Global dominance of tectonics over climate in shaping river longitudinal profiles",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-07-15T10:40:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85104239888",,"000639647800001","Nat.

Apart from ecological and structural factors, associated values and provided ecosystem services are an important part of forest definitions. Typically, forest types are differentiated based on climatic regions and on degrees of human modification. A better understanding of how to distinguish different forests on the basis of the values they provide is needed to advance global policies put forward by organisations such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), or the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These policies so far approach all forests in a similar manner, regardless of their condition. Without this distinction, benefits stemming from forest intactness and their contribution to global environmental challenges remain unaccounted for. Forest definitions provide the basis for policies and monitoring systems driving or enabling deforestation, degradation, reforestation, and restoration. Here, we provide a systematic approach to disentangle and synthesise different value classifications of forests. As part of a collaboration between ETH Zurich, the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD), the University of Liège and Biotope, Forest Stewardship Council International (FSC) commissioned a systematic map that aims to clarify how definitions of forests of high value are understood and described. Focusing on forests of high value, the systematic map will address three research questions: (1) How are various terms linked to forests of high value defined in the literature?; (2) Do definitions vary between different actors?; and (3) How common are the various definitions? Bibliographic databases and organisational websites will be searched, and internet search engines used to find relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature. The searches will be conducted in English, French and Spanish. Data extraction and coding will be performed at the same time when full texts are considered for inclusion. Definitions will be extracted as well as their respective sources and other study information. We will produce a catalogue of definitions for different terms associated with forests of high value, a narrative synthesis describing the evidence base, and visualisations illustrating the relationships between definitions and terms for forests of high value and their frequencies in the literature.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000497749",,"1999-4907",,"10.3390/f12070876","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/497749","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Intact forest landscapes||High conservation value||Forest biodiversity hotspot||Primary forest||Old-growth forest||Indigenous people||Definition||Meaning","Definitions of and Perspectives on Forests of High Value: A Systematic Map Protocol",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-07-27T02:51:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85109826504",,"000676347600001",,"7","Forests","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Their trade-offs determine whether they should be produced simultaneously or whether it is preferable to assign separate areas to different ecosystem services. We use simulation and optimization to analyse the correlations, trade-offs and production levels of several ecosystem services in single- and multi-objective forestry over 100 years in a boreal forest landscape. The case study area covers 3600 ha of boreal forest, consisting of 3365 stands. The ecosystem services and their indicators (in parentheses) considered are carbon sequestration (forestry carbon balance), biodiversity (amount of deadwood and broadleaf volume), economic profitability of forestry (net present value of timber production) and timber supply to forest industry (volume of harvested timber). The treatment alternatives simulated for each of the stands include both even-aged rotation forestry (thinning from above with clear cut) and continuous cover forestry regimes (thinning from above with no clear cut). First, we develop 200 Pareto optimal plans by maximizing multi-attribute utility functions using random weights for the ecosystem service indicators. Second, we compare the average level of ecosystem services in single- and multi-objective forestry. Based on our findings, forestry carbon balance and the amount of deadwood correlate positively with each other, and both of them correlate negatively with harvested timber volume and economic profitability of forestry. Despite this, the simultaneous maximization of multiple objectives increased the overall production levels of several ecosystem services, which suggests that the management of boreal forests should be multi-objective to sustain the simultaneous provision of timber and other ecosystem services.",,,,"0015-752X||1464-3626",,"10.1093/forestry/cpaa041","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/455941","en","Oxford University Press",,,,"Multi-objective forestry increases the production of ecosystem services",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-12-11T09:38:35Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"000680830000005","Forestry","3","Forestry","94","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Agricultural intensification, urbanization and future development of hydropower dams will likely lead to a degradation of surface water quality, but there have been few formal assessments of where, how and why these changes impact specific water quality parameters based on in situ data spanning a large region. We sampled a large suite of biogeochemical water quality parameters at 14 locations in four field campaigns in central and southern Zambia in 2018 and 2019 to characterize seasonal changes in water quality in response to large hydropower dams and human landscape transformations. We find that the major rivers (Zambezi and Kafue) are very clean with extremely low concentrations of solutes, but suffer from thermal changes, hypoxia and loss of suspended sediment below dams. Smaller tributaries with a relatively large anthropogenic landcover footprint in their catchments show signs of pollution in the form of higher concentrations of nutrients and dissolved ions. We find significant relationships between crop and urban land cover metrics and selected water quality metrics (i.e. conductivity, phosphorus and nitrogen) across our data set. These results reflect a very high-quality waterscape exhibiting some hotspots of degradation associated with specific human activities. We anticipate that as agricultural intensification, urbanization and future hydropower development continue to accelerate in the basin, the number and extent of these hotspots of water quality degradation will grow in response. There is an opportunity for governments, managers and industry to mitigate water quality degradation via investment in sustainable infrastructure and practice, such as wastewater treatment, environmental dam operations, or riparian protection zones.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492107",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/d1em00006c","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492107","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Anthropogenic influences on Zambian water quality: hydropower and land-use change",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-06-29T12:48:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,"85111138375",,"000654957800001","Environ Sci Process Impacts","7","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, the factors which control SOC content across scales remain unclear. Earlier studies demonstrated that soil texture and geochemistry strongly affect SOC content. However, those findings primarily rely on data from temperate regions where soil mineralogy, weathering status and climatic conditions generally differ from tropical and subtropical regions. We investigated soil properties and climate variables influencing SOC concentrations across sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 1601 samples were analyzed, collected from two depths (0-20 and 20-50gcm) from 17 countries as part of the Africa Soil Information Service project (AfSIS). The data set spans arid to humid climates and includes soils with a wide range of pH values, weathering status, soil texture, exchangeable cations, extractable metals and land cover types. The most important SOC predictors were identified by linear mixed-effects models, regression trees and random forest models. Our results indicate that geochemical properties, mainly oxalate-extractable metals (Al and Fe) and exchangeable Ca, are equally important compared to climatic variables (mean annual temperature and aridity index). Together, they explain approximately two-thirds of SOC variation across sub-Saharan Africa. Oxalate-extractable metals were most important in wet regions with acidic and highly weathered soils, whereas exchangeable Ca was more important in alkaline and less weathered soils in drier regions. In contrast, land cover and soil texture were not significant SOC predictors on this large scale. Our findings indicate that key factors controlling SOC across sub-Saharan Africa are broadly similar to those in temperate regions, despite differences in soil development history.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493465",,"2199-3971||2199-398X",,"10.5194/soil-7-305-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493465","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Continental-scale controls on soil organic carbon across sub-Saharan Africa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-07-08T03:05:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85108942857",,"000669513300001",,"1","Soil","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Karst) regeneration is a decisive factor for the gap-filling process, especially when the silvicultural goal is to provide continuous protection against natural hazards such as snow avalanches or rockfall. For the planning of management interventions, robust predictions on height growth of regeneration at the scale of forest gaps are thus needed. However, there is a lack of such data for trees of intermediate sizes, and existing studies fail to cover large environmental gradients. The goal of our study is to identify the key factors that influence height growth of Norway spruce regeneration in small gaps of spruce-dominated forests in the Swiss Alps. Furthermore, we assess whether there are site-specific differences of height growth or whether it follows a similar pattern along a large gradient of temperature (i.e., along elevation) and of water and nutrient availability (i.e., among different phytosociological site types) within the upper montane and subalpine vegetation belts. On 124 plots, >2′000 observations of annual height increments of Norway spruce regeneration (10 cm tree height to 12 cm stem diameter) in gaps were collected. Using linear mixed effects models and cross-validation for model selection, we identified the best variable combinations to predict annual height growth. Consistently across the entire gradient, the most important factors were 1) the positive effect of tree size, 2) the negative effect of competition by the surrounding stand, and 3) local topography. We found site-specific differences in height growth patterns such as gap size and therefore direct radiation being the most important competition measure in subalpine sites, as opposed to diffuse radiation in high montane sites. However, the pooled model for the entire environmental gradient allowed for predictions of regeneration height growth with similar explanatory power as the more specific models while containing comparable effect sizes. Furthermore, competition can be equally well expressed by metrics based on basal area measurements as by metrics derived from hemispherical photography. Based on these relatively simple models, accurate and robust predictions of the development of Norway spruce regeneration in gaps of managed mountain forests are possible.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000475538",,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119076","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/475538","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Mountain forest ecology||European Alps||Norway spruce||Forest regeneration||Regeneration height","Abiotic and biotic determinants of height growth of Picea abies regeneration in small forest gaps in the Swiss Alps",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-03-20T16:31:04Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85102622901",,"000637620800001","For.

Therefore, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the local impacts over large areas (i.e., regions to countries), which is particularly problematic for forest management. We provide a comprehensive, high‐resolution assessment of the climate change sensitivity of managed Swiss forests (ca. 10’000 km2), which cover a wide range of environmental conditions. We used a dynamic vegetation model to project the development of typical forest stands derived from a stratification of the 3rd National Forest Inventory until the end of the 22nd century. Two types of simulations were conducted: one limited to using the extant local species, the other enabling immigration of potentially more climate‐adapted species. Moreover, to assess the robustness of our projections, we quantified and decomposed the uncertainty in model projections resulting from the following sources: (i) climate change scenarios, (ii) local site conditions and (iii) the dynamic vegetation model itself (i.e., represented by a set of model versions), an aspect hitherto rarely taken into account. The simulations showed substantial changes in basal area and species composition, with dissimilar sensitivity to climate change across and within elevation zones. Higher‐elevation stands generally profited from increased temperature, but soil conditions strongly modulated this response. Low‐elevation stands were increasingly subject to drought, with strong negative impacts on forest growth. Furthermore, current stand structure had a strong effect on the simulated response. The admixture of drought‐tolerant species was found advisable across all elevations to mitigate future adverse climate‐induced effects. The largest uncertainty in model projections was associated with climate change scenarios. Uncertainty induced by the model version was generally largest where overall simulated climate change impacts were small, thus corroborating the utility of the model for making projections into the future. Yet, the large influence of both site conditions and the model version on some of the projections indicates that uncertainty sources other than climate change scenarios need to be considered in climate change impact assessments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000475715",,"1051-0761||1939-5582",,"10.1002/eap.2313","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/475715","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Adaption||Dynamic vegetation model||ForClim||Forest gap model||Forest model||Management||Mountain forest||Species composition||Switzerland||Tipping point||Uncertainty","Stand‐scale climate change impacts on forests over large areas: transient responses and projection uncertainties",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-03-22T12:13:04Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Predicting growth-dependent tree mortality: a key challenge for population ecology","140968","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,,"85100975365",,"000647223300001","Ecol.

These can sometimes be mitigated through ecosystem services provided by different functions supported by biodiversity. However, biodiversity in cities is affected by numerous factors, namely habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, as well as pollution, altered climate, and new biotic challenges. To better understand the link between biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, we need to improve our mechanistic knowledge of these relationships. Trait-based ecology is a promising approach for unravelling the causes and consequences of biodiversity filtering on ecosystem processes and underlying services, but large gaps remain unexplored.  Here, we present a series of research directions that are aimed at extending the current knowledge of the relationship between trait-based biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services in cities. These directions are based on: (1) improving urban habitat mapping; (2) considering often neglected urban habitats and ecological niches; (3) integrating multiple urban gradients; (4) using trait-based approaches to improve our mechanistic understanding of the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services; and (5) extending the involvement of citizens.  Pursuing these research directions may support the sustainable management of urban ecosystems and the long-term provision of ecosystem services, ultimately enhancing the well-being of urban populations.",,,,"1439-1791||1618-0089",,"10.1016/j.baae.2021.02.014","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477227","en","Elsevier",,,"Citizen science||Habitat mapping||Multiple environmental gradients||Neglected habitats and niches||Species traits||Urban ecology","Research agenda on biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services in European cities",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-04-01T04:16:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85100671255",,"000651370700012","Basic Appl.

Consequently, development of simple, rapid, and inexpensive methods to support the studies on carbon dynamics in soil is of interest. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has emerged as a rapid and cost-effective method for measurements of soil properties. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a predictive model for δ13C values using NIRS in various soil profiles across Chile. Eleven sites were selected in the range of 30° to 50° S. These sites represent different soil moisture and soil temperature regimes, clay mineralogies, parent materials, and climates; in addition, they have prairie vegetation and contain C3-type vegetation. Air-dried soil samples were scanned in the NIR range at a resolution of 4 cm−1. The carbon isotopic composition, expressed as δ13C relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite standard, was analysed using an elemental analyser–isotope ratio mass spectrometer system. A prediction model for δ13C values based on NIRS data was developed through a partial least-squares regression (PLS) model using ten latent variables. A second model was generated using a random forest (RF) approach. The model performances were acceptable. The RF model provided the best results. The values of the root mean square error of prediction for the validation runs for δ13C obtained using the PLS and RF models were 1.38‰, and 1.15‰, respectively. These model performances indicate that NIRS can be used to predict δ13C for the selected dataset. The results of this study support the use of NIRS as a predictive method in soil analyses and as a nondestructive waste-free method for studies on carbon dynamics in soil.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000481989",,,,"10.1016/j.geodrs.2021.e00397","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/481989","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Near-infrared spectroscopy||Isotope ratio mass spectrometer||Carbon isotope abundance||δ13C||Andisols||Alfisols||Inceptisols||Mollisols||Carbon dynamics||Partial least-squares regression||Random forest","Near-infrared spectroscopy: Alternative method for assessment of stable carbon isotopes in various soil profiles in Chile",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-05-03T02:45:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85104632618",,"000654040700008",,,"Geoderma Regional","25","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we tested whether and to what extent water stressed shallow-rooted neighboring plants bene fit from water redistributed by deep-rooted poplar plants. Methods We conducted trace experiments with deuter ated water (2 H2O) in greenhouse soil column experi ments. We measured hydraulic lift (HL) by poplars grown at two levels of soil drying and estimated the amount of hydraulically lifted water. In a parallel exper iment we grew poplars and barley (Hordeum vulgare) in two columns connected via a small cross-rooting segment. Results Soil moisture measurements and stable isotope signatures of soil and xylem water proved the occur rence of HL in poplar. Additionally, stable isotopes proved the transport of water from deep roots of poplars to shallow roots of barley. Conclusions In conclusion, the experiments showed that poplars are capable to redistribute water during drought spells and that this water can facilitate plant growth of shallow-rooted crops. This result implies evidence for an enhanced soil water supply of plants in agroforest systems under drought conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000527179",,"0032-079X||1573-5036",,"10.1007/s11104-021-04894-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/527179","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Hydraulic redistribution by hybrid poplars (Populus nigra x Populus maximowiczii) in a greenhouse soil column experiment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-01-20T09:38:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Plant Soil","1-2","Plant and Soil","463","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Several models of pollinator-mediated floral evolution have been proposed; floral divergence may (i) be directly involved in driving speciation or may occur after speciation driven by (ii) drift or local adaptation in allopatry or (iii) negative interactions between species in sympatry. Here, we generate predictions for patterns of trait divergence and community assembly expected under these three models, and test these predictions in Hakea (Proteaceae), a diverse genus in the Southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot. We quantified functional richness for two key floral traits (pistil length and flower color), as well as phylogenetic distances between species, across ecological communities, and compared these to patterns generated from null models of community assembly. We also estimated the statistical relationship between rates of trait evolution and lineage diversification across the phylogeny. Patterns of community assembly suggest that flower color, but not floral phenology or morphology, or phylogenetic relatedness, is more divergent in communities than expected. Rates of lineage diversification and flower color evolution were negatively correlated across the phylogeny and rates of flower colour evolution were positively related to branching times. These results support a role for diversity-dependent species interactions driving floral divergence during the Hakea radiation, contributing to the development of the extraordinary species richness of southwest Australia.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000489297",,"2056-3744",,"10.1002/evl3.225","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/489297","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Competition||floral traits||macroevolution||pollination ecology||Proteaceae||reproductive interference","Ecological interactions shape the evolution of flower color in communities across a temperate biodiversity hotspot",,"Other Journal Item","Open access",,,"2021-06-14T02:17:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85107394283",,"000644861700001",,"3","Evolution Letters","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Several governments and organizations worldwide rose to the challenge of halting degradation and restoring landscapes. Commitments are ambitious, thus a synthesis of current experiences with and strategies for implementation is important to inform future actions. To guide successful implementation, the Global Partnership on FLR put forward six principles, namely, the conservation and enhancement of ecosystems at landscape scales, the restoration of multiple functions, the engagement of multiple stakeholders, with allowances for context dependency and adaptive management. Non-governmental organizations, acting globally, regionally and (or) at national and local scales, play a fundamental role in supporting governments fulfill their commitments. Therefore, we gathered the perceptions of actors within non-governmental organizations engaged in FLR across countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America about what FLR is and their perceived challenges and strategies for implementation. We employed the six principles of FLR to organize and evaluate the responses. Results show that the principles of landscape scale, ecosystem conservation and enhancement, and multi stakeholder engagement are all considered by interviewees as core components of an FLR program. Yet several restoration projects shared by interviewees still required further evidence of a landscape vision, and the integration of actors beyond local communities and the environmental government sectors. Context dependency was evident in the clear incorporation of local natural resource governance norms, such as tribal and community management in project structure, yet few projects appeared to be designed by local actors. The principle of “adaptive management” was mostly missing from the responses, perhaps because most projects had not had sufficient time to learn from intervention outcomes. Key financial challenges for FLR implementation were the short duration and availability of funding, high-up front costs and few short-term returns. To overcome these challenges, promising strategies relate to the development of tangible economic returns for local actors engaged in productive restorative actions that are planned alongside conservation and ecological restoration actions in the landscape. The challenges of negotiating actions with a multitude of actors and the lack of supportive policies highlighted in the interviews require organizations to focus efforts on leveraging the enactment and enforcement of legislations that look beyond jurisdictional boundaries and support landscape management with clear, long term incentive mechanisms and cross-sectoral collaboration. In addition, implementation can be further supported with the scientifically robust sharing of results on how different FLR projects move forward in meeting the social and environmental objectives of a successful, integrative restoration of degraded landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier",,,,"0301-4797||1095-8630",,"10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112251","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474254","en","Elsevier",,,"FLR||Governance||Finance||Challenges||Strategies","Perceptions from non-governmental actors on forest and landscape restoration, challenges and strategies for successful implementation across Asia, Africa and Latin America",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-03-13T04:35:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85101880331",,"000634985500001","J. environ. manag.",,"Journal of Environmental Management","286","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The stability of these communities depends on interactions linking herbivores and host plants. How interaction network structure begets robustness, and thus stability, in different ecosystems and how network structure and robustness are altered along land-use intensity gradients are unclear. We analyzed plant-herbivore networks based on literature-derived interactions and long-term sampling from 289 grasslands and forests in three regions of Germany. Network size and nestedness were the most important determinants of network robustness in both ecosystems. Along land-use intensity gradients, networks in moderately grazed grasslands were more robust than in those managed by frequent mowing or fertilization. In forests, changes of network robustness along land-use intensity gradients relied on changes in plant species richness. Our results expand our knowledge of the stability of plant-herbivore networks and indicate options for management aimed at stabilizing herbivore communities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484349",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.abf3985","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484349","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Changes in plant-herbivore network structure and robustness along land-use intensity gradients in grasslands and forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-05-17T10:10:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85105912293",,"000652258100020","Sci Adv","20","Science Advances","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

If such a relationship existed, species demography could be modeled only by measuring functional traits, transforming our ability to predict states and dynamics of species-rich communities with process-based community models. Here, we introduce a new method that links empirical functional traits with the demographic parameters of a process-based model by calibrating a transfer function through inverse modeling. As a case study, we parameterize a modified Lotka-Volterra model of a high-diversity mountain grassland with static plant community and functional trait data only.

Protecting and sustainably managing these African forests requires an increased understanding of their compositional heterogeneity, the environmental drivers of forest composition and their vulnerability to ongoing changes. Here, using a very large dataset of 6 million trees in more than 180,000 field plots, we jointly model the distribution in abundance of the most dominant tree taxa in central Africa, and produce continuous maps of the floristic and functional composition of central African forests. Our results show that the uncertainty in taxon-specific distributions averages out at the community level, and reveal highly deterministic assemblages. We uncover contrasting floristic and functional compositions across climates, soil types and anthropogenic gradients, with functional convergence among types of forest that are floristically dissimilar. Combining these spatial predictions with scenarios of climatic and anthropogenic global change suggests a high vulnerability of the northern and southern forest margins, the Atlantic forests and most forests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where both climate and anthropogenic threats are expected to increase sharply by 2085. These results constitute key quantitative benchmarks for scientists and policymakers to shape transnational conservation and management strategies that aim to provide a sustainable future for central African forests.",,,,"0028-0836||1476-4687",,"10.1038/s41586-021-03483-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484259","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Unveiling African rainforest composition and vulnerability to global change",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-05-17T02:44:32Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85105180569",,"000642083200004",,"7857","Nature","593","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

National and municipal sources of tree inventory remain limited due to a lack of detailed, consistent and frequent inventory assessments. Despite advancements in research on the automation of urban tree mapping using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) or high-resolution satellite imagery, in practice most municipalities still perform labor-intensive field surveys to collect and update tree inventories. We present a robust, affordable and rapid method for creating tree inventories in any urban region where sufficient street-level imagery is readily available. Our approach is novel in that we use a Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) to detect and locate separate tree instances from street-level imagery, thereby successfully creating shape masks around unique fuzzy urban objects like trees. The novelty of this method is enhanced by using monocular depth estimation and triangulation to estimate precise tree location, relying only on photographs and images taken from the street. Experiments across four cities show that our method is transferable to different image sources (Google Street View, Mapillary) and urban ecosystems. We successfully detect 70% of all public and private trees recorded in a ground-truth campaign across Metro Vancouver. The accuracy of geolocation is also promising. We automatically locate public and private trees with a mean error in the absolute position ranging from 4 to 6 m, which is comparable to ground-truth measurements in conventional manual urban tree inventory campaigns.",,,,"0924-2716",,"10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2021.01.016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/475614","en","Elsevier",,,"Deep learning||Instance segmentation||Monocular depth estimation||Street-level images||Urban forest management","Mapping trees along urban street networks with deep learning and street-level imagery",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-03-22T07:51:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85102643453",,"000644695700011","ISPRS j. photogramm. remote sens.",,"ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","175","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, they often fail in meeting their expectations, especially in the tropics. One core reason for their failure is human pressure. Protected area transgression has tremendous impacts on biodiversity, but also on persecuted rule-breakers whose necessities are often ignored. Despite the increasing enforcement of strict protection rules, non-compliance is a phenomenon experienced in protected areas around the world. To improve biodiversity and social outcomes of any conservation intervention, we need to understand what drives transgressive behavior but also the gazettement of protected areas. By using a role-playing game with Indigenous people in the Colombian Amazon we were able to openly discuss transgression. In the game, park managers designed protected areas primarily for biodiversity conservation but also for restoration. Communication among stakeholders and a resource-abundant landscape were key to increase compliance without exerting enforcement while the violations history of the protected area as well as the abundance of resources within its boundaries encouraged transgression. To achieve voluntary compliance, we recommend to acknowledge transgression’s multidimensionality and integrate it into conservation planning.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000481228",,"0006-3207||1873-2917",,"10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109121","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/481228","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Amazon||Compliance||Conservation||Gazetting||Indigenous people||Role-playing games","Drivers of transgression: What pushes people to enter protected areas",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-04-29T07:27:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85104784290",,"000663302500003","Biol Conserv",,"Biological Conservation","257","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We describe the development that different forest modelling communities have followed to underpin the leverage that simulation models offer for advancing our understanding of forest ecosystems. Using three widely applied but contrasting approaches – species distribution models, individual‐based forest models, and dynamic global vegetation models – as examples, we show how scientific and technical advances have led models to transgress their initial objectives and limitations. We provide an overview of recent model applications on current important ecological topics and pinpoint ten key questions that could, and should, be tackled with forest models in the next decade. Synthesis. This overview shows that forest models, due to their complementarity and mutual enrichment, represent an invaluable toolkit to address a wide range of fundamental and applied ecological questions, hence fostering a deeper understanding of forest dynamics in the context of global change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478952",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.7391","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478952","en","John Wiley & Sons","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Tackling unresolved questions in forest ecology: The past and future role of simulation models",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2021-04-15T17:09:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85103403717",,"000634871900001","Ecol Evol","9","Ecology and Evolution","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the consequences of land conversion on biogeochemical cycles are still largely unknown as they are not studied in a landscape context that defines the geomorphic, geochemical, and pedological framework in which biological processes take place. Thus, the response of tropical soils to disturbance by erosion and land conversion is one of the great uncertainties in assessing the carrying capacity of tropical landscapes to grow food for future generations and in predicting greenhouse gas fluxes from soils to the atmosphere and, hence, future earth system dynamics.  Here we describe version 1.0 of an open-access database created as part of the project “Tropical soil organic carbon dynamics along erosional disturbance gradients in relation to variability in soil geochemistry and land use” (TropSOC). TropSOC v1.0 (Doetterl et al., 2021, https://doi.org/10.5880/fidgeo.2021.009) contains spatially and temporally explicit data on soil, vegetation, environmental properties, and land management collected from 136 pristine tropical forest and cropland plots between 2017 and 2020 as part of monitoring and sampling campaigns in the eastern Congo Basin and the East African Rift Valley system. The results of several laboratory experiments focusing on soil microbial activity, C cycling, and C stabilization in soils complement the dataset to deliver one of the first landscape-scale datasets to study the linkages and feedbacks between geology, geomorphology, and pedogenesis as controls on biogeochemical cycles in a variety of natural and managed systems in the African Tropics.  The hierarchical and interdisciplinary structure of the TropSOC database allows linking of a wide range of parameters and observations on soil and vegetation dynamics along with other supporting information that may also be measured at one or more levels of the hierarchy. TropSOC's data mark a significant contribution to improve our understanding of the fate of biogeochemical cycles in dynamic and diverse tropical African (agro-)ecosystems.

Thus, we urgently need to improve our understanding of stomatal response to water deficits in soil and atmosphere. Here, we investigated the role of soil-plant hydraulic conductance (Ksp) on transpiration (E) and stomata regulation. We used a root pressure chamber to measure the relation between E, leaf xylem water potential (ψleaf-x) and soil water potential (ψsoil) in tomato. Additional measurements of ψleaf-x were performed with unpressurized plants. A soil-plant hydraulic model was used to simulate E(ψleaf-x) for decreasing ψsoil. In wet soils, E(ψleaf-x) had a constant slope while in dry soils the slope decreased, with ψleaf-x rapidly and nonlinearly decreasing for moderate increases in E. The ψleaf-x measured in pressurized and unpressurized plants matched well, which indicates that the shoot hydraulic conductance did not decrease during soil drying and that the decrease in Ksp is caused by a decrease in soil-root conductance. The decrease of E matched well the onset of hydraulic nonlinearity. Our findings demonstrate that stomatal closure prevents the drop in ψleaf-x caused by a decrease in Ksp and elucidate a strong correlation between stomatal regulation and belowground hydraulic limitation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000527182",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-4192","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/527182","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Declining soil-root hydraulic conductance drives stomatal closure of tomato under drought ",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2022-01-20T09:42:33Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19-30, 2021","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, evidence on nutrient limitations of soil GHG fluxes from African tropical forest ecosystems is still rare. Therefore, an ecosystem-scale nutrient manipulation experiment (NME) consisting of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), N + P, and control treatments was set up in a tropical forest in northwestern Uganda. Soil carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were measured monthly using static vented chambers for 14 months. A root trenching treatment was also done in all the experimental plots in order to disentangle the contribution of root and microbial respiration to total soil CO2 effluxes. In parallel to soil GHG flux measurements, soil temperature, soil moisture, and mineral N were determined. Lifting the N limitation on the soil nitrifiers and denitrifiers through N fertilization significantly increased N2O fluxes in N, and N + P addition plots in the transitory phase (0-28 days after N fertilization, p < 0.01). However, sustained N fertilization did not significantly affect background (measured more than 28 days after fertilization) N2O fluxes. Alleviation of the P limitation on soil methanotrophs through P fertilization marginally and significantly increased CH4 consumption in the transitory (p = 0.052) and background (p = 0.010) phases, respectively. Simultaneous addition of N and P (N + P) significantly affected transitory soil CO2 effluxes (p = 0.010), suggesting a possible co-limitation of N and P on soil respiration. Microbial CO2 effluxes were significantly larger than root CO2 effluxes (p < 0.001) across all treatment plots so was the contribution of microbial respiration to the total soil CO2 effluxes (about 70 %, p < 0.001). Despite the fact that soil respiration was affected through N + P fertilization, neither heterotrophic nor autotrophic respiration significantly differed in either the N + P or the other treatments. Overall, the study findings suggest that the contribution of tropical forests to the global soil GHG budget could be altered by changes in N and P availability in these biomes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526235",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-1415","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526235","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Soil greenhouse gas fluxes||Nutrient manipulation experiment||Soil nutrient limitation||Ugandan tropical pristine forest","Evaluating the role soil nutrients play in regulating soil greenhouse gas fluxes from the pristine tropical forests: evidence from a nutrient manipulation experiment in Uganda",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2022-01-17T12:47:22Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19-30, 2021","Online",,,,,,,"106005958",,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As such, tropical SOC stabilization mechanisms likely differ from those in temperate soils due to contrasting soil development. To better understand these mechanisms, we investigated SOC dynamics at three soil depths under pristine tropical african mountain forest along a geochemical gradient from mafic to felsic and a topographic gradient covering plateau, slope and valley positions. We conducted a series of soil C fractionation experiments in combination with an analysis of the geochemical composition of soil and a sequential extraction of pedogenic oxides. Overall, we found that reactive secondary mineral phases drive SOC properties together with aggregation. These key mineral stabilization mechanisms for SOC were strongly related to soil geochemistry and independent of topography in the absence of detectable erosion processes. We also detected fossil organic carbon (FOC) at several sites, constituting up to 52.0 ± 13.2 % of total SOC stock in the C depleted subsoil. FOC decreased strongly towards more shallow soil depths, indicating decomposability of FOC by microbial communities under topsoil conditions. Regression analysis showed that variables affiliated with soil weathering, parent material geochemistry and soil fertility, together with soil depth, explained up to 75 % of the variability of SOC stocks and Δ14C. Furthermore, the same variables explained 44 % of the variability in the relative abundance of C associated with microaggregates versus free silt and clay associated C fractions. We conclude that despite long-lasting weathering, geochemical properties of soil parent material leave a footprint in tropical soils that affects SOC stocks and links two of the most important mineral related C stabilization mechanisms. While the identified stabilization mechanisms and controls are similar to less weathered soils in other climate zones, their relative importance is markedly different in the investigated tropical soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526236",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-7323","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526236","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Organic carbon stabilization controlled by geochemistry in tropical rainforest soils",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2022-01-17T12:48:23Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19-30, 2021","Online",,,,,,,"106005845",,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Join me at my Soil System Sciences - OECS award lecture where I will highlight how Global Change affects soils across ecosystems and what this means for future plant-soil interactions and biogeochemical cycles in a warming, crowded world out of balance.Global Change from the Arctic to the Tropics has accelerated drastically in recent decades, subsequently effecting ecosystems everywhere. Soils and biogeochemical cycling within are no exception. For example, how carbon and nutrients are stabilized in and released from soil is highly affected by changing land use and climate. Despite these changes, soil in earth system models is not represented mechanistically, but rather given a mostly budgetary ""black box"" function. No methodological framework is available that accounts for the combined effects of climate, geochemistry and disturbance on soil dynamics at larger scales. In addition, most of our process understanding of biogeochemical cycling in soils is derived from data-rich temperate regions. This data has limited applicability in low latitudinal (tropics) or high latitudinal (boreal/subpolar) climate zones, where soils have different properties and drastically different developmental histories.In my talk I will illustrate with a few examples how the gaps in our understanding of soil processes across climate zones and dismissing lateral soil fluxes leads to large uncertainties in predicting future trajectories of the global carbon cycle. I will highlight how the interactions of weathering and disturbance can influence and dominate biogeochemical cycles and microbial processes in soils. I will also discuss some directions where geochemical proxies that are available at the global scale can be useful to model the spatial and temporal patterns of soil carbon storage and turnover.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526237",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-720","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526237","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Soils in a changing world",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2022-01-17T12:49:55Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19-30, 2021","Online",,,,,,,"95011639",,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, most locally accurate forest models are tied to the stand scale and cannot readily be applied across large areas. Empirical data for model initialisation are often not available at large spatial scales. National Forest Inventories (NFIs) provide spatially representative tree and stand samples, but their samples are typically small, that is, only a few trees are measured per plot, and they are truncated, that is, not each tree has the same probability of being observed. To overcome these issues, we develop and apply a methodology to derive stand descriptions from small sample data, taking the Swiss NFI as a case study. We extended the traditional Weibull function to (multi‐)truncated unimodal and bimodal forms that are suitable for the representation of samples from survey designs with multiple callipering thresholds. Subsequently, we applied these functions in an extended parameter prediction method to derive stand diameter distributions from representative samples. Additionally, we predicted species compositions using a multinomial logistic regression model and assigned them to the diameter distributions of the stands. The diameter distribution of 9.1% of the Swiss NFI samples was better described by a bimodal than a unimodal Weibull function. The uni‐ and bimodal diameter model in combination with the model to determine species composition can be used to predict stand descriptions from single small samples or entire forest types in the target area. Thereby, the bimodal form is suitable for capturing stand structures with distinct under‐ and overstorey. In Switzerland, the diameter distributions of stands are typically positively skewed. Our method can be applied to any large‐scale dataset (e.g. NFI) and allows to generate initial conditions in terms of spatially representative stands. These, in turn, are suitable for forest stand simulators, which allows for developing adaptive forest management strategies at large scales, by simulating realistic and site‐specific stand development while still reflecting detailed management measures. Furthermore, stand descriptions can be used to assess tree species diversity, regeneration and harvest potentials.",,,,"2041-210X||2041-2096",,"10.1111/2041-210x.13566","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478953","en","Wiley",,,"Forest model initialisation||Forest stand description||National forest inventories||Small forest samples||Trees species composition||Truncated and mixed diameter distributions||Weibull probability density function","From small forest samples to generalised uni‐ and bimodal stand descriptions",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-04-15T17:13:47Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85101036439",,"000616766900001","Methods Ecol.

Investigations of geomorphological processes in the steep torrent channels followed in the 1980s, along with detailed observations of biogeochemical and ecohydrological processes in individual forest stands. More recently, research in the Alptal has addressed the impacts of climate change on water supply and runoff generation. In this article, we describe, for the first time, the evolution of catchment research at Alptal, and present new analyses of long‐term trends and short‐term hydrologic behaviour. Hydrometeorological time series from the past 50 years show substantial interannual variability, but only minimal long‐term trends, except for the ~2°C increase in mean annual air temperature over the 50‐year period, and a corresponding shift towards earlier snowmelt. Similar to previous studies in larger Alpine catchments, the decadal variations in mean annual runoff in Alptal's small research catchments reflect the long‐term variability in annual precipitation. In the Alptal valley, the most evident hydrological trends were observed in late spring and are related to the substantial change in the duration of the snow cover. Streamflow and water quality are highly variable within and between hydrological events, suggesting rapid shifts in flow pathways and mixing, as well as changing connectivity of runoff‐generating areas.

Building resilience in the forestry sector has thus become of major importance in many countries, including Canada. While British Columbia (BC) generates the highest revenue from the forestry sector in Canada, the planning and management of forests in this province face several limitations that hinder the application of resilience thinking in a fully integrated way that accounts not only for ecosystem processes but also the close interconnection between forests and people. Community forestry in BC provides experience gained over 20 years that can form the basis for a more holistic, long-term approach to enhance the resilience of forested landscapes. Based on interviews with managers of 5 case study community forests (CFs), and a survey of all CFs in BC over three consecutive years, we present pilot practices to manage forests for resilience at the stand- and landscape-levels. Findings show that these practices mainly focus on (1) age and species diversification, (2) introduction of more drought-tolerant species, (3) systematic long-term monitoring of productivity and forest health, (4) wildfire risk management, and (5) introduction of enhanced silviculture such as thinning, rehabilitation and fertilization. Between 2016 and 2018, 38 CFs in BC invested more than CAD 4.5 million in enhanced silvicultural practices using their own funds. The area-based tenure of CFs motivated not only long-term planning and investment, but also shifted the mindset among residents towards a more multi-functional and dynamic view of the forest. Building adaptive capacity and social license, CFs foster a future where forest health and community well-being are compatible. These lessons can be scaled to BC and other forested landscapes in Canada and around the world. Scaling mechanisms include: (1) facilitating knowledge exchange; (2) increasing multi-stakeholder collaboration; (3) replication and mainstreaming of effective practices; (4) rethinking the forest tenure system; and (5) systematic research and monitoring to learn from pilot studies that could inform strategic interventions with landscape-scale impact.

Climate change impacts forest functioning and dynamics, and large uncertainties remain regarding the interactions between species composition, demographic processes and environmental drivers. There are few robust tools available to link these processes, which precludes accurate projections and recommendations for long‐term forest management. Forest gap models present a balance between complexity and generality and are widely used in predictive forest ecology. However, their relevance to tackle questions about the links between species composition, climate and forest functioning is unclear. In this regard, demonstrating the ability of gap models to predict the growth of forest stands at the annual parameterization scale resolution—representing a sensitive and integrated signal of tree functioning and mortality risk—appears as a fundamental step.  2. In this study, we aimed at assessing the ability of a gap model to accurately predict forest growth in the short term and potential community composition in the long term, across a wide range of species and environmental conditions. To do so, we present the gap model ForCEEPS, calibrated using an original parameterization procedure for the main tree species in France. 3. ForCEEPS was shown to satisfactorily predict forest annual growth (averaged over a few years) at the plot level from mountain to Mediterranean climates, regardless of the species. Such an accuracy was not gained at the cost of losing precision for long‐term predictions, as the model showed a strong ability to predict potential community compositions. The mechanistic relevance of ForCEEPS parameterization was explored by showing the congruence between the values of key model parameter and species functional traits. 4. We further showed that accounting for the spatial configuration of crowns within forest stands, the effects of climatic constraints and the variability of shade tolerances in the species community are all crucial to better predict short‐term productivity with gap models. 5. Synthesis. The dual ability of predicting short‐term functioning and long‐term community composition, as well as the balance between generality and realism (i.e. predicting accuracy) of the new generation of gap models may open great perspectives for the exploration of the biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships, species coexistence mechanisms and the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems.",,,,"0269-8463||1365-2435",,"10.1111/1365-2435.13760","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478131","en","British Ecological Society",,,"climate||community composition||ecosystem functioning||forests||process‐based modelling||productivity||traits","Beyond forest succession: A gap model to study ecosystem functioning and tree community composition under climate change",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-04-11T02:57:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85100477292",,"000614763400001","Funct.

We tested five forest models according to a harmonized protocol against data from nine forest compartments in the Snĕžnik region, in Slovenia. The suite of models included stand- and landscape-scale, empirical- and process-based models used across Europe. The test dataset originated from inventory data covering 50 years (tree measurements 1963, 1983 and 2013) and included annual harvesting records at tree level. Uncertainties in data and forest conditions were considered by defining 12 scenarios varying initial regeneration, browsing pressure and harvest modalities. We evaluated the models` ability to initialize forest conditions accurately, whether management interventions could be implemented based on harvest records, and how well basal area and diameter structure could be predicted. Simulation results for basal area development showed good to satisfactory performance for all models, at which SAMSARA2, SIBYLA and PICUS showed the best agreement. Comparison of simulated and observed diameter distributions showed good performance of ForClim, PICUS, SAMSARA2 and SIBYLA. Model output variability was between 6% and 24%, indicating the relevance to consider uncertainties that can be attributed to specific sources. There was no clear hierarchy between more empirical or more process-based models regarding accuracy of stand development projections. The cohort-based landscape model LandClim showed the lowest stand-level accuracy and scenario sensitivity, but results nevertheless qualified it for complementary application at landscape scale. Within individual-based models, spatially explicit models seemed to be more suitable for heterogeneous mixed mountain forests. The findings demonstrated the usefulness of inventory datasets for model testing and intercomparison.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474253",,"0304-3800||1872-7026||0167-8892",,"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2021.109493","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474253","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Model intercomparison||Tree growth||Tree mortality||Forest management||Ungulate browsing||Forest inventory data","Evaluating five forest models using multi-decadal inventory data from mountain forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-03-13T04:35:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85101882880",,,"Ecol.

Water balance differences between forested and non-forested landscapes are often attributed to characteristics related to trees’ ability to take up and transpire water, as well as their ability to intercept precipitation. However, another potentially important characteristic of forests that has been largely overlooked in hydrologic studies is the retention and accumulation of debris, litter and deadwood on the forest floor. Here we leverage ongoing measurements at the new hillslope laboratory “Waldlabor” in Zurich, Switzerland, where water retention in forest litter, deadwood and the top soil layer has been investigated using frequent field campaigns and innovative new sensing techniques.  Several approaches were used to determine the maximum storage capacity as well as the storage dynamics of different types and layers of litter. In-lab saturation experiments revealed the maximum storage capacity of various litter types (i.e., leaf and needle litter). Those values were also supported with field pre- and post- rainfall sampling campaigns to determine in-situ litter storage dynamics, as well as to understand the interplay between litter interception and soil-water recharge. Importantly, recharge was often substantially smaller at plots with litter, compared to those without litter. The storage and water retention capacity of deadwood samples was measured in the field by logging the diurnal differences in deadwood weight over a six month period. Dew and fog deposition during the night led to larger water availability for evaporation during the day. We measured increased humidity at sensors in the forest at 1 and 3m heights respectively, compared to the humidity outside the forest. Daily weight measurements over eight weeks of 40 deadwood pieces at our forest site revealed differences in the storage capacity depended on the degree of decomposition. Additionally, we found that water stored in forest floor spruce cones (daily measurements of 20 pieces) actively contributed to evaporation fluxes.  The combination of continuous sensor measurements (soil moisture, deadwood water content), field measurements (litter and deadwood grab samples) as well as laboratory work (saturation experiments) revealed the water storage and retention capacity of litter and deadwood in a typical temperate mixed forest and their contribution to evaporation. These measurements are one component of the new ETH Zürich “Waldlabor” research infrastructure, which also includes measurements of precipitation, xylem water, soil water, groundwater, and discharge amounts, isotope ratios, and other chemical characteristics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526141",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-15217","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526141","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Litter and deadwood water retention processes in a temperate mixed forest",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2022-01-17T09:52:22Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19-30, 2021","Online",,,,,,,"89939141",,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We find thresholds to the global temperature–ecosystem respiration relationship at high and low air temperatures and mid soil temperatures, which represent transitions in the temperature dependence and sensitivity of ecosystem respiration. Annual ecosystem respiration rates show a markedly reduced temperature dependence and sensitivity compared to half-hourly rates, and a single mid-temperature threshold for both air and soil temperature.

A significant part of those estimates depends on long-lived wood products in the construction sector replacing concrete, steel, and other non-renewable goods. Often the climate change mitigation benefits of this substitution are presented and quantified in the form of displacement factors. A displacement factor is numerically quantified as the reduction in emissions achieved per unit of wood used, representing the efficiency of biomass in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. The substitution benefit for a given wood use scenario is then represented as the estimated change in emissions from baseline in a study’s modelling framework. The purpose of this review is to identify and assess the central economic and technical assumptions underlying forest carbon accounting and life cycle assessments that use displacement factors or similar simple methods. Main text  Four assumptions in the way displacement factors are employed are analyzed: (1) changes in harvest or production rates will lead to a corresponding change in consumption of wood products, (2) wood building products are substitutable for concrete and steel, (3) the same mix of products could be produced from increased harvest rates, and (4) there are no market responses to increased wood use. Conclusions  After outlining these assumptions, we conclude suggesting that many studies assessing forest management or products for climate change mitigation depend on a suite of assumptions that the literature either does not support or only partially supports. Therefore, we encourage the research community to develop a more sophisticated model of the building sectors and their products. In the meantime, recognizing these assumptions has allowed us to identify some structural, production, and policy-based changes to the construction industry that could help realize the climate change mitigation potential of wood products.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000477587",,"1750-0680",,"10.1186/s13021-021-00171-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477587","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Wood product carbon substitution benefits: a critical review of assumptions",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2021-04-06T15:05:41Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85103904122",,"000635155700001","Carbon Balance Manage","1","Carbon Balance and Management","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Where groundwater levels lie below nearby streams, streamwater can infiltrate through the streambed, reducing streamflow and recharging the aquifer3. These ‘losing’ streams have important implications for water availability, riparian ecosystems and environmental flows4–10, but the prevalence of losing streams remains poorly constrained by continent-wide in situ observations. Here we analyse water levels in 4.2 million wells across the contiguous USA and show that nearly two-thirds (64 per cent) of them lie below nearby stream surfaces, implying that these streamwaters will seep into the subsurface if it is sufficiently permeable. A lack of adequate permeability data prevents us from quantifying the magnitudes of these subsurface flows, but our analysis nonetheless demonstrates widespread potential for streamwater losses into underlying aquifers. These potentially losing rivers are more common in drier climates, flatter landscapes and regions with extensive groundwater pumping. Our results thus imply that climatic factors, geological conditions and historic groundwater pumping jointly contribute to the widespread risk of streams losing flow into surrounding aquifers instead of gaining flow from them. Recent modelling studies10 have suggested that losing streams could become common in future decades, but our direct observations show that many rivers across the USA are already potentially losing flow, highlighting the importance of coordinating groundwater and surface water policy.",,,,"0028-0836||1476-4687",,"10.1038/s41586-021-03311-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/476197","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Widespread potential loss of streamflow into underlying aquifers across the USA",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-03-25T04:32:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85102683873",,"000630143700021",,"7850","Nature","591","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Realizing if the issue is one of information, beliefs, values or means opens the door for more constructive dialogue. Decision-makers diverge in their responses to the urgent need for action on climate and biodiversity. Action gaps are fueled by the apparent inability of decision-makers to respond efficiently to the mounting threats described by scientists—and increasingly recognized by society. Surprisingly, with the growing evidence and the accumulation of firsthand experiences of the impacts of environment crises, the gap is not only a problem of conflicting values or beliefs but also a problem of inefficient strategies. Bridging the gap and tackling the growing polarization within society calls for decision-makers to engage with the full complexity of the issues the world is facing. We propose a framework characterizing five archetypes of decision-makers to help us out of the current impasse by better understanding the behavior of others. Dealing with the complexity of environmental threats requires decision-makers to question their understanding of who wins and who loses, and how others make decisions. This requires that decision-makers acknowledge complexity, embrace uncertainty, and avoid falling back on simplistic cognitive models. Understanding the complexity of the issue and how people make decisions is key to having a fighting chance of solving the climate crisis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478116",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su13063578","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478116","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","environmental change||decision-making||environmental awareness||environmental concern||action gap||mental model||theory of mind","Choices We Make in Times of Crisis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-04-11T02:55:44Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85103590297",,"000645754700001",,"6","Sustainability","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Forest canopies play a crucial role in structuring communities of vascular epiphytes by providing substrate for colonization, by locally varying microclimate, and by causing epiphyte mortality due to branch or tree fall. However, as field studies in the three‐dimensional habitat of epiphytes are generally challenging, our understanding of how forest structure and dynamics influence the structure and dynamics of epiphyte communities is scarce. 2. Mechanistic models can improve our understanding of epiphyte community dynamics. We present such a model that couples dispersal, growth, and mortality of individual epiphytes with substrate dynamics, obtained from a three‐dimensional functional–structural forest model, allowing the study of forest–epiphyte interactions. After validating the epiphyte model with independent field data, we performed several theoretical simulation experiments to assess how (a) differences in natural forest dynamics, (b) selective logging, and (c) forest fragmentation could influence the long‐term dynamics of epiphyte communities. 3. The proportion of arboreal substrate occupied by epiphytes (i.e., saturation level) was tightly linked with forest dynamics and increased with decreasing forest turnover rates. While species richness was, in general, negatively correlated with forest turnover rates, low species numbers in forests with very‐low‐turnover rates were due to competitive exclusion when epiphyte communities became saturated. Logging had a negative impact on epiphyte communities, potentially leading to a near‐complete extirpation of epiphytes when the simulated target diameters fell below a threshold. Fragment size had no effect on epiphyte abundance and saturation level but correlated positively with species numbers. 4. Synthesis: The presented model is a first step toward studying the dynamic forest–epiphyte interactions in an agent‐based modeling framework. Our study suggests forest dynamics as key factor in controlling epiphyte communities. Thus, both natural and human‐induced changes in forest dynamics, for example, increased mortality rates or the loss of large trees, pose challenges for epiphyte conservation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000476654",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.7255","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/476654","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","canopy dynamics||community assembly||demography||epiphyte assemblages||epiphyte interactions||forest||individual‐based model||long‐term dynamics||vascular epiphytes","Agent-based modeling of the effects of forest dynamics, selective logging, and fragment size on epiphyte communities",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-03-27T03:56:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85101797734",,"000622944400001","Ecol Evol","6","Ecology and Evolution","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We provide evidence for how Brazil nut genetic resources are negatively affected by forest degradation and discuss the consequences of this for reproductive success. To avoid negative effects of genetic erosion and inbreeding, we discuss the need to cease large‐scale forest conversion and to promote landscape connectivity. This could support gene flow, maintain genetic diversity across individuals reproducing in clustered patterns and contribute to securing the long‐termed reproductive viability and resilience of this high socio‐economically and ecologically valuable species.  Summary -     Ecosystem degradation in the Amazon drives this biodiverse rainforest toward an ecological tipping point. Sustainable management and restoration of degraded rainforest therein are central to counteract this crisis. One hyperdominant, keystone species of high ecological and socio‐economic value, the Brazil nut tree, offers additional benefits as a major carbon sink and a nutritional source of the most prominent globally traded non‐timber forest product.  -     Despite Brazil nut trees being protected by conservation regulation, forest degradation threatens sufficient gene‐flow among Brazil nut tree populations. This has impacts on the reproductive success, genetic diversity, and consequently on the resilience of this species to environmental change.  -     We used 13 microsatellite loci to explore the consequences of forest degradation on the reduction in genetic diversity of Brazil nut populations. We examined the clustering of genetically related individuals as fine‐scale genetic structure (FSGS) and the variation in genetic diversity and inbreeding across adult trees and seedlings along a categorized forest‐degradation gradient ranging from conserved to degraded areas. In addition, we applied direct and indirect approaches to estimate contemporary pollen‐mediated gene flow.  -     We found significant levels of FSGS, comparable to other similar tropical tree species. Brazil nut seedlings had consistently lower genetic diversity and higher inbreeding than adults, significantly associated with the degree of forest degradation of their origin. We observed limited pollen dispersal, differential patterns in pollen heterogeneity, and disproportionate paternal‐assignment rates from few individuals shaping the effective population size in our dataset. We discuss how this evidence for reproduction vulnerability may affect the genetic resources and undermine the resilience of this ecological and socio‐economic system in Peru.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450986",,"2572-2611",,"10.1002/ppp3.10166","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450986","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Brazil nut||fine-scale genetic structure||genetic diversity||habitat degradation||inbreeding||non-timber forest product||pollen gene flow||sustainable forest management","Genetic threats to the Forest Giants of the Amazon: Habitat degradation effects on the socio‐economically important Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-12T10:45:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85106180149",,"000683464100010",,"2","Plants, People, Planet","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, nocturnal taxa have so far been understudied, constraining our understanding of the role of UGAs on maintaining ecological connectivity and enhancing overall biodiversity. We present a well-replicated multi-city study on the factors driving bat and nocturnal insect biodiversity in three European cities. To achieve this, we sampled bats with ultrasound recorders and flying insects with light traps during the summer of 2018. Results showed a greater abundance and diversity of bats and nocturnal insects in the city of Zurich, followed by Antwerp and Paris. We identified artificial lighting in the UGA to lower bat diversity by probably filtering out light-sensitive species. We also found a negative correlation between both bat activity and diversity and insect abundance, suggesting a top-down control. An in-depth analysis of the Zurich data revealed divergent responses of the nocturnal fauna to landscape variables, while pointing out a bottom-up control of insect diversity on bats. Thus, to effectively preserve biodiversity in urban environments, UGAs management decisions should take into account the combined ecological needs of bats and nocturnal insects and consider the specific spatial topology of UGAs in each city.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000470681",,"1439-1791||1618-0089",,"10.1016/j.baae.2021.01.006","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/470681","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Urbanisation||Urban biodiversity||Nocturnal fauna||Flying arthropods||Chiroptera||Antwerp||Paris||Zurich","Response of bats and nocturnal insects to urban green areas in Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-02-21T13:09:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85100686075",,"000620976100006","Basic Appl.

Despite the implications of SAC for data dependencies, its impact on the performance of species distribution models (SDMs) remains controversial, with reports of both strong and negligible impacts on inference. Yet, no study has comprehensively assessed the prevalence and the strength of SAC in the residuals of SDMs over entire geographic areas. Here, we used a large‐scale spatial inventory in the western Swiss Alps to provide a thorough assessment of the importance of SAC for (1) 850 species belonging to nine taxonomic groups, (2) six predictors commonly used for modeling species distributions, and (3) residuals obtained from SDMs fitted with two algorithms with the six predictors included as covariates. We used various statistical tools to evaluate (1) the global level of SAC, (2) the spatial pattern and spatial extent of SAC, and (3) whether local clusters of SAC can be detected. We further investigated the effect of the sampling design on SAC levels. Overall, while environmental predictors expectedly displayed high SAC levels, SAC in biodiversity data was rather low overall and vanished rapidly at a distance of ~5–10 km. We found low evidence for the existence of local clusters of SAC. Most importantly, model residuals were not spatially autocorrelated, suggesting that inferences derived from SDMs are unlikely to be affected by SAC. Further, our results suggest that the influence of SAC can be reduced by a careful sampling design. Overall, our results suggest that SAC is not a major concern for rugged mountain landscapes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000477990",,"2150-8925",,"10.1002/ecs2.3403","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477990","en","Ecological Society of America","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","correlograms||Mantel||Moran||mountains||spatial autocorrelation||species distribution models||western Swiss Alps","Low spatial autocorrelation in mountain biodiversity data and model residuals",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-04-08T18:51:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85103379131",,"000636318200031",,"3","Ecosphere","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The role of short‐term groundwater fluctuations is not always clear in these ecosystems, as it is assumed that phreatophytic vegetation close to rivers is adapted to such conditions. Here we provide data evidence of riparian plant response to short‐term groundwater table fluctuations in a braided gravel‐bed river (Maggia). We used indirect physiological variables for photosynthesis and transpiration – stomatal conductance gs and daily variation in stem diameter ΔDd – which we measured at six mature riparian trees of the Salicaceae family at two sites with different mean depths to groundwater during two growing seasons. The data demonstrate that (a) short‐term variation of the groundwater table affects riparian vegetation – at the site with deeper groundwater, the water table depth was the best predictor of gs variability, while at the site with shallower groundwater, temperature and vapor pressure deficit were the best predictors of ΔDd variability; (b) instantaneous stomatal conductance is related to vapor pressure deficit (V PD), but conditioned by groundwater levels, with higher stomatal conductance for the same radiative input and V PD when the water table was higher for all trees; (c) local micro‐climate measured at tree locations had a stronger predictive power for gs than valley scale climate, suggesting local climate controls on vegetated stands on gravel bars.

For tropical Africa, these factors and their interactions remain largely unknown. Here, using samples collected along strong topographic and geochemical gradients in the East African Rift Valley, we study how soil chemistry and soil fertility, derived from the geochemical composition of soil parent material, can drive soil respiration even after many millennia of weathering and soil development.  To address the drivers of soil respiration, we incubated soils from three regions with contrasting geochemistry (mafic, felsic, and mixed sedimentary) sampled along slope gradients. For three soil depths, we measured the potential maximum heterotrophic respiration under stable environmental conditions as well as the radiocarbon content (Δ14C) of the bulk soil and respired CO2. We found that soil microbial communities were able to mineralize C from fossil as well as other poor quality C sources under laboratory conditions representative of tropical topsoils. Furthermore, despite similarities in terms of climate, vegetation, and the size of soil C stocks, soil respiration showed distinct patterns with soil depth and parent material geochemistry. The topographic origin of our samples was not a main determinant of the observed respiration rates and Δ14C. In situ, however, soil hydrological conditions likely influence soil C stability by inhibiting decomposition in valley subsoils. Our study shows that soil fertility conditions are the main determinant of C stability in tropical forest soils. Further, in the presence of organic carbon sources of poor quality or the presence of strong mineral related C stabilization, microorganisms tend to discriminate against these sources in favor of more accessible forms of soil organic matter as energy sources, resulting in a slower rate of C cycling.  Our results demonstrate that even in deeply weathered tropical soils, parent material has a long-lasting effect on soil chemistry that can influence and control microbial activity, the size of subsoil C stocks, and the turnover of C in soil. Soil parent material and its lasting control on soil chemistry need to be taken into account to understand and predict C stabilization and rates of C cycling in tropical forest soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000468170",,,,"10.5194/soil-2020-96","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468170","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Controls on heterotrophic soil respiration and carbon cycling in geochemically distinct African tropical forest soils",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2021-02-06T16:36:50Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Soil Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Thus, we urgently need to improve our understanding of stomatal response to water deficits in soil and atmosphere. Here, we investigated the role of soil–plant hydraulic conductance (Ksp) on transpiration (E) and stomatal regulation. We used a root pressure chamber to measure the relation between E, leaf xylem water potential (ψleaf-x) and soil water potential (ψsoil) in tomato. Additional measurements of ψleaf-x were performed with unpressurized plants. A soil–plant hydraulic model was used to simulate E(ψleaf-x) for decreasing ψsoil. In wet soils, E(ψleaf-x) had a constant slope, while in dry soils, the slope decreased, with ψleaf-x rapidly and nonlinearly decreasing for moderate increases in E. The ψleaf-x measured in pressurized and unpressurized plants matched well, which indicates that the shoot hydraulic conductance did not decrease during soil drying and that the decrease in Ksp is caused by a decrease in soil–root conductance. The decrease of E matched well the onset of hydraulic nonlinearity. Our findings demonstrate that stomatal closure prevents the drop in ψleaf-x caused by a decrease in Ksp and elucidate a strong correlation between stomatal regulation and belowground hydraulic limitation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000527180",,"0140-7791||1365-3040",,"10.1111/pce.13939","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/527180","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","belowground hydraulic||hydraulic conductivity||leaf water potential||soil drying||Solanum lycopersicum L.||transpiration||water stress","Stomatal closure of tomato under drought is driven by an increase in soil–root hydraulic resistance",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-01-20T09:40:32Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Plant cell environ.","2","Plant, Cell & Environment","44","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Empirical observations can provide an improved understanding of the drivers of species population dynamics, yet long-term datasets are scarce in natural forests. This study used inventory data of the Swiss forest reserve network to assess tree population dynamics over the past 60 years. Tree status, species and dbh were repeatedly measured between 1956 and 2018 in 211 permanent plots of 34 forest reserves that covered a wide environmental gradient. Differences in species richness and tree density were compared between the first and last inventory. Furthermore, we used generalized linear mixed effect models to estimate the processes of ingrowth and tree mortality of seven abundant species (Abies alba, Acer pseudoplatanus, Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris and Quercus spp.) separately as a function of stand structural attributes and climate. We found a general decline in the density of the dominant species, with a low recruitment of light-demanding species and an increase in species richness, particularly in the colline vegetation zone. Both species-specific ingrowth and tree mortality were influenced by stand density and climate variables. Tree mortality increased with live tree density and increasing temperature. Ingrowth increased with tree density and decreased with higher temperature. Therefore, forest structural properties and climate have a strong influence on species population dynamics, and both are essential for predicting ingrowth and tree mortality in forest ecosystems.",,,,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118666","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/449385","en","Elsevier",,,"Forest dynamics||Forest reserves||Species dynamics||Ingrowth||Tree mortality||Climate change","Long-term tree species population dynamics in Swiss forest reserves influenced by forest structure and climate",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-11-03T03:59:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85094318476",,"000607186200011","For.

European beech, presently dominating from the colline to the subalpine vegetation belt, is already present in upper montane subalpine forests and has a high potential to further advance to higher elevations in European mountain forests, where the temperature is predicted to further increase in the near future. Although essential for adaptive silviculture, it remains unknown whether the upward shift of beech could be assisted when it is mixed with Norway spruce or silver fir compared with mono-specific stands, as the species interactions under such conditions are hardly known. In this study, we posed the general hypotheses that the growth depending on age of European beech in mountain forests was similar in mono-specific and mixed-species stands and remained stable over time and space in the last two centuries. The scrutiny of these hypotheses was based on increment coring of 1240 dominant beech trees in 45 plots in mono-specific stands of beech and in 46 mixed mountain forests. We found that (i) on average, mean tree diameter increased linearly with age. The age trend was linear in both forest types, but the slope of the age-growth relationship was higher in mono-specific than in mixed mountain forests. (ii) Beech growth in mono-specific stands was stronger reduced with increasing elevation than that in mixed-species stands. (iii) Beech growth in mono-specific stands was on average higher than beech growth in mixed stands. However, at elevations > 1200 m, growth of beech in mixed stands was higher than that in mono-specific stands. Differences in the growth patterns among elevation zones are less pronounced now than in the past, in both mono-specific and mixed stands. As the higher and longer persisting growth rates extend the flexibility of suitable ages or size for tree harvest and removal, the longer-lasting growth may be of special relevance for multi-aged silviculture concepts. On top of their function for structure and habitat improvement, the remaining old trees may grow more in mass and value than assumed so far.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000445397",,"1612-4677||1612-4669",,"10.1007/s10342-020-01319-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/445397","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Age-dependent tree growth||Inter-specific facilitation||Intra-specific competition||Climate change||Growth trends||Growth acceleration","European beech stem diameter grows better in mixed than in mono-specific stands at the edge of its distribution in mountain forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-10T02:46:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85091498928",,"000572715000001","Eur J Forest Res","1","European Journal of Forest Research","140","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The study of network structures along geographic and ecological gradients, however, remains marginal because documenting species interactions at multiple sites is a methodological challenge. Here, we aimed to study the structural variation in plant–herbivore interaction networks along elevational gradients using molecular metabarcoding.  Location European Alps.  Taxon Plant and Orthopteran herbivores.  Methods We used a standardized DNA metabarcoding method applied to Orthopteran faeces to document the structure of 48 networks of species interactions across six elevational gradients. We examined how structural properties of plant–Orthoptera networks reflecting specialization and robustness vary with elevation. We compared observed variation to null models to account for differences in network size.  Results We found an increase in the levels of generality and nestedness with decreasing temperature, and the correlation was stronger than in null models. These relationships corresponded to greater robustness and reduced the importance of specific keystone species in alpine habitats compared to lowland grasslands.  Main conclusions In cold environments, plant–herbivore networks are wired in a way that may reinforce the resilience of the system to species extinction.

In recent years there has been an upsurge of studies on ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF), or the ability of ecosystems to simultaneously provide multiple functions and/or services. The concept of EMF itself, the analytical approaches used to calculate it, and its implications depending on the spatial scale and field of study have been discussed in detail. However, to date there has been little dialogue concerning the basis of EMF studies: what should or should not be considered appropriate measures for ecosystem functions. 2. To begin this discussion, we performed an in‐depth review of EMF studies across four major terrestrial ecosystems (agroecosystems, drylands, forests and grasslands) by analysing 82 studies, which together have assessed 775 ecosystem functions from a variety of field and greenhouse experiments across the globe. 3. The number of ecosystem functions analysed varied from two to 82 per study and we found large differences in the distribution of functions across ecosystem types and ecosystem service categories. Furthermore, there was little explanation of why certain variables were included in the EMF calculation or how they relate to ecosystem functioning. 4. Synthesis.

This observed flow “localization”, quantified by the spatial distribution of kinetic energy, can then be explained in terms of the strong interplay between the disordered geometry of the pore space and the nonlinear rheology of the fluid.

As a result, many Brazil nut trees grow within a mosaic of young secondary forest, primary forest remnants and agricultural fields. Little is known about the reproductive ecology and fruit production of Brazil nut in such degraded landscapes. Previous studies on Brazil nut productivity did not explicitly address forest degradation as a factor. In this study, we analyzed the extent to which Brazil nut fruit production is affected by the level of forest degradation. We collected 3 years of fruit production data of 126 Brazil nut trees occurring in degraded forest (the above-mentioned mosaics) and closed canopy (i.e., undegraded) forest in and around the Tambopata National Reserve in Madre de Dios, Peru. We analyzed the effect of forest degradation at two different levels: at the site type (i.e., degraded vs. undegraded forest) and the individual tree level (quantified as stand basal area and stem density around the individual Brazil nut trees). Stand basal area around the individual Brazil nut trees significantly positively influenced tree fruit production in all 3 years and stem density in year 2 and 3, with strongest effects in the 3rd year, and weakest effect in the 1st year, coinciding with an El Nino year. Trees in undegraded forest produced more fruits in the 2nd and 3rd year than trees in degraded forest (29.4% and 35.8% more, respectively), but not in the 1st year in which trees in undegraded forest produced 31.7% less fruits than trees in degraded forest. These within year effects were not significant, although the effects significantly differed between years. Our results show that forest degradation can affect Brazil nut fruit production, and suggest that the strength (and possibly the sign) of this effect might be different in (extreme) El Nino years. This illustrates the potential importance of restoring degraded forest to enhance resilience and protect the livelihoods of people depending on the Brazil nut trade.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000470648",,"2624-893X",,"10.3389/ffgc.2020.525533","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/470648","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bertholletia excelsa||Madre de Dios||non-timber forest products||Peru||Tambopata National Reserve","Forest Degradation and Inter-annual Tree Level Brazil Nut Production in the Peruvian Amazon",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-02-20T04:35:55Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85106184038",,"000614403000001",,,"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite decades of research in chemical ecology, we still lack an understanding of the organization of plant chemical diversity across species and ecosystems. To address this challenge, we hypothesized that molecular diversity is not only related to species diversity, but also constrained by trophic, climatic, and topographical factors. We screened the metabolome of 416 vascular plant species encompassing the entire alpine elevation range and four alpine bioclimatic regions in order to characterize their phytochemical diversity. We show that by coupling phylogenetic information, topographic, edaphic, and climatic variables, we predict phytochemical diversity, and its inherent composition, of plant communities throughout landscape. Spatial mapping of phytochemical diversity further revealed that plant assemblages found in low to midelevation habitats, with more alkaline soils, possessed greater phytochemical diversity, whereas alpine habitats possessed higher phytochemical endemism. Altogether, we present a general tool that can be used for predicting hotspots of phytochemical diversity in the landscape, independently of plant species taxonomic identity. Such an approach offers promising perspectives in both drug discovery programs and conservation efforts worldwide.

Along with climate, understanding the impact of the legacies of past forest management is key to better explain current responses of different tree species to climate change. We studied tree mortality events that peaked in 2012 affecting one native (silver fir; growing within its natural distribution range) and two introduced (black pine and Scots; growing outside their natural distribution range) conifer species from the Romanian Carpathians. The three conifers were compared in terms of mortality events, growth trends, growth resilience to severe drought events, climate-growth relationships, and regeneration patterns. The mortality rates of the three species were found to be associated with severe drought events. Nevertheless, the native silver fir seems to undergo a self-thinning process, while the future of the remaining living black pine and Scots pine trees is uncertain as they register significant negative growth trends. Overall, the native silver fir showed a higher resilience to severe drought events than the two introduced pine species. Furthermore, and unlike the native silver fir, black pine and Scots pine species do not successfully regenerate. A high diversity of native broadleaf species sprouts and develops instead under them suggesting that we might be witnessing a process of ecological succession, with broadleaves recovering their habitats. As native species seem to perform better in terms of resilience and regeneration than introduced species, the overall effect of the black pine and Scots pine mortality might be compensated.

Especially, for the African continent, spatially explicit information on soils and their ability to sustain these services is still scarce. To address data gaps, infrared spectroscopy has gained great success as a cost-effective solution to quantify soil properties in recent decades. Here, we present a mid-infrared soil spectral library (SSL) for central Africa (CSSL) that can predict key soil properties allowing for future soil estimates with a minimal need for expensive and time-consuming wet chemistry. Currently, our CSSL contains over 1,800 soils from ten distinct geo-climatic regions throughout the Congo Basin and wider African Great Lakes region. We selected six hold-out core regions from our SSL, augmented them with the continental AfSIS SSL, which does not cover central African soils. We present three levels of geographical extrapolation, deploying Memory-based learning (MBL) to accurately predict carbon (TC) and nitrogen (TN) contents in the selected regions. The Root Mean Square Error of the predictions (RMSEpred) values were between 0.38–0.86 % and 0.04–0.17 % for TC and TN, respectively, when using the AfSIS SSL only to predict the six regions. Prediction accuracy could be improved for four out of six regions when adding central African soils to the AfSIS SSL. This reduction of extrapolation resulted in RMSEpred ranges of 0.41–0.89 % for TC and 0.03–0.12 % for TN. In general, MBL leveraged spectral similarity and thereby predicted the soils in each of the six regions accurately; the effect of avoiding geographical extrapolation and forcing regional samples in the local neighborhood (MBL-spiking) was small. We conclude that our CSSL adds valuable soil diversity that can improve predictions for the regions compared to using the continental scale AfSIS SSL alone; thus, analyses of other soils in central Africa will be able to profit from a more diverse spectral feature space. Given these promising results, the library comprises an important tool to facilitate economical soil analyses and predict soil properties in an understudied yet critical region of Africa. Our SSL is openly available for application and for enlargement with more spectral and reference data to further improve soil diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000461947",,,,"10.5194/soil-2020-99","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461947","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Filling a key gap: a soil infrared library for central Africa",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2021-01-13T08:56:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Soil Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As such, tropical SOC stabilization mechanisms likely differ from those in temperate soils due to contrasting soil development. To better understand these mechanisms, we investigated SOC dynamics at three soil depths under pristine tropical african mountain forest along a geochemical gradient from mafic to felsic and a topographic gradient covering plateau, slope and valley positions. To do so we conducted a series of soil C fractionation experiments in combination with an analysis of the geochemical composition of soil and a sequential extraction of pedogenic oxides. Relationships between our target and predicting variables were investigated using a combination of regression analyses and dimension reduction. Here, we show that reactive secondary mineral phases drive SOC properties and stabilization mechanisms together with, and sometimes more strongly than, other mechanisms such as aggregation or C stabilization by clay content. Key mineral stabilization mechanisms for SOC were strongly related to soil geochemistry, differing across the study regions. These findings were independent of topography in the absence of detectable erosion processes. Instead, fluvial dynamics and changed hydrological conditions had a secondary control on SOC dynamics in valley positions, leading to higher SOC stocks there than at the non-valley positions. We also detected fossil organic carbon (FOC) at several sites, constituting up to 52.0 ± 13.2 % of total SOC stock in the C depleted subsoil. Interestingly, total SOC stocks for these soils did not exceed those of sites without FOC. Additionally, FOC decreased strongly towards more shallow soil depths, indicating decomposability of FOC by microbial communities under more fertile conditions. Regression analysis showed that variables affiliated with soil weathering, parent material geochemistry and soil fertility, together with soil depth, explained up to 75 % of the variability of SOC stocks and Δ14C. Furthermore the same variables explain 44 % of the variability in the relative abundance of C associated with microaggregates versus free silt and clay associated C fractions However, geochemical variables gained or retained importance for explaining SOC target variables when controlling for soil depth. We conclude that despite long-lasting weathering, geochemical properties of soil parent material leave a footprint in tropical soils that affects SOC stocks and mineral related C stabilization mechanisms. While identified stabilization mechanisms and controls are similar to less weathered soils in other climate zones, their relative importance is markedly different in the investigated tropical soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000461936",,,,"10.5194/soil-2020-92","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461936","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The role of geochemistry in organic carbon stabilization in tropical rainforest soils",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2021-01-13T08:49:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Soil Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of temperature extremes on various phenological events of grapevine varieties in Southwest Switzerland (Leytron, Canton of Valais). We aimed to capture the occurrence of extreme events in specific years in various grapevine varieties and at different phenological phases to rank the varieties based on their sensitivity to temperature extremes and thus quantify their robustness. Phenological observations (1978–2018) of six Vitis vinifera varieties (Arvine, Chardonnay, Chasselas, Gamay, Pinot noir and Syrah) were subjected to event coincidence analysis. Extreme events were defined as values in the uppermost or lowermost percentiles of the timing of the phenophases and daily temperatures within a 30-day window before the phenophase event occurred. Significantly more extreme temperature and phenological events occurred in Leytron between 2003 and 2017 than in the earlier years, with the years 2007, 2011, 2014 and 2017 being remarkable in terms of the number of extreme coincidence events. Moreover, bud development and flowering experienced significantly more extreme coincidence events than other phenophases; however, the occurrence rate of extreme coincidence events was independent of the phenophase. Based on the total number of extreme events, the varieties did not differ in their responses to temperature extremes. Therefore, event coincidence analysis is an appropriate tool to quantify the occurrence of extreme events. The occurrence of extreme temperature events clearly affected the advancement of the timings of phenological events in various grapevines. However, there were no varietal differences in terms of response to extreme temperatures; thus, additional research is warranted to outline the best adaptation measures. © 2021 International Viticulture and Enology Society",,,,,,"10.20870/oeno-one.2021.55.1.3187","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477486","en","Institut des Sciences de la Vigne et du Vin",,,"Phenological sensitivity||Temperature stress||Occurrence||Switzerland||Coincidence","Coincidence of temperature extremes and phenological events of grapevines",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-04-06T08:02:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85104529913",,"000637838400019",,"1","OENO One","55","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, studies on the soil environmental controls of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from African tropical forest ecosystems are still rare. The aim of this study was to disentangle the regulation effect of soil nutrients on soil GHG fluxes in a tropical forest in northwestern Uganda. Therefore, a large-scale nutrient manipulation experiment (NME) based on 40 m × 40 m plots with different nutrient addition treatments (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), N + P, and control) was established. Soil CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes were measured monthly using permanently installed static chambers for 14 months. Total soil CO2 fluxes were partitioned into autotrophic and heterotrophic components through a root trenching treatment. In addition, soil temperature, soil water content, and mineral N were measured in parallel to GHG fluxes. N addition (N, N + P) resulted in significantly higher N2O fluxes in the transitory phase (0–28 days after fertilization, p < 0.01), because N fertilization likely increased soil N beyond the microbial immobilization and plant nutritional demands leaving the excess to be nitrified or denitrified. Prolonged N fertilization however, did not elicit a significant response in background (measured more than 28 days after fertilization) N2O fluxes. P fertilization marginally and significantly increased transitory (p = 0.052) and background (p = 0.010) CH4 consumption, probably because it enhanced methanotrophic activity. Addition of N and P together (N + P) resulted in larger CO2 fluxes in the transitory phase (p = 0.010), suggesting a possible co-limitation of N and P on soil respiration. Heterotrophic (microbial) CO2 effluxes were significantly higher than the autotrophic (root) CO2 effluxes (p < 0.001) across all treatment plots with microbes contributing about three times more to the total soil CO2 effluxes compared to roots (p < 0.001). However, neither heterotrophic nor autotrophic respiration significantly differed between treatments. The results from this study suggest that the feedback of tropical forests to the global soil GHG budget could be disproportionately altered by changes in N and P availability in these biomes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000461942",,,,"10.5194/soil-2020-94","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461942","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Nutrient limitations regulate soil greenhouse gas fluxes from tropical forests: evidence from an ecosystem-scale nutrient manipulation experiment in Uganda",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2021-01-13T08:51:32Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Soil Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Many different types of nanomaterials are employed for a wide variety of different applications. Silver nanoparticles (nano-Ag) have been investigated for their antibacterial, antifungal, and osteoinductive properties to be used in catheters, wound healing, dental applications, and bone healing. Polymeric nanoparticles such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) are mainly studied for their ability to deliver cancer drugs as the body metabolizes them into simple compounds. The advantages of NBMs compared to conventional pharmaceuticals lie in the improved interactions with biological systems, improved biocompatibility and reduced adverse effects. As the application of NBMs is very similar to pharmaceuticals, their environmental release patterns are likely similar as well. Different pharmaceuticals have been detected in surface waters all over the world. Consequently, there exists a need to identify possible exposure routes of NBMs into the environment. Not many applications using NBMs are on the market yet meaning that information on possible consumption, material flows, and also concentrations in the environment is lacking. It is expected that their use will grow significantly in the near future. Their increasing development and use raises questions about potential adverse effects on the environment after excretion and release.  An environmental risk assessment compares the exposure of a nanomaterial with its toxicity. In the hazard assessment the adverse effects by NBMs are characterized and quantified. This assessment is based on the evaluation of published ecotoxicological tests. The data evaluation is preferably made using species sensitivity distribution (SSD) methods to calculate the predicted no observed effect concentration (PNEC). If only one data point is available, a PNEC can be calculated based on the most sensitive endpoint. While a handful of hazard assessments using the pSSD method have been conducted for engineered nanomaterials, no PNEC is available for polymeric and inorganic nanomaterials used in drug delivery.  The other part of an environmental risk assessment requires knowledge regarding the exposure of NBMs. Most NBMs are not yet available on the market and in addition methods for detecting and quantifying nanomaterials in natural system is still scarce. Thus, prospective exposure modelling is the method of choice to get information on their future environmental exposure and to obtain predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). Several environmental exposure models for nanomaterials have been developed during the last decade. Probabilistic material flow analysis (PMFA) models are able to provide mass flows of nanomaterials into the environment through detailed analysis of the whole system. Data uncertainty of input values and transfer coefficients are included by defining these parameters as probabilistic distributions. An important input to MFA models for NBMs is the fraction of the NBM excreted after their application to humans. Using the flows of a NBM into an environmental compartment and dividing it by the compartment's volume, an average country- or continent-wide PEC value is derived. However, as the application of many NBMs is only carried out at specific locations (hospitals), average predicted environmental concentrations do not accurately represent their release to the environment. In a first step, this thesis aimed at developing a hazard assessment for polymeric and inorganic nanomaterials which are used in drug delivery. Five polymeric materials (chitosan, polylactic acid (PLA), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), and PLGA) and one inorganic material (hydroxyapatite (HAP)) were chosen for the hazard assessment. The goal of the second part of the thesis was to calculate the flows of NBMs throughout the lifecycle and in the environment. In order to do this, first properties influencing a materials' excretion were identified. In a second step, a PMFA model was developed for nano-Ag and PLGA, and three case-study materials (Fe3O4PEG-PLGA, MgHA-collagen and PLLA-Ag) for Europe. In a final step, the thesis aimed at evaluating local releases to surface water of PLGA in Switzerland.   For the hazard assessment, published ecotoxicological data was searched for the five polymeric and inorganic materials to evaluate the environmental hazards for freshwater and soil using a meta-analysis. For PLA, PHA and PLGA, no published data on ecotoxicity was found and therefore no hazard assessment could be conducted. In freshwater, chitosan was found to have the lowest PNEC with 5 µg/l, followed by nano-chitosan, HAP and PAN. In soils, HAP was found to have the lowest PNEC with 0.3 mg/kg, followed by PAN and chitosan. Compared with other common pollutants, even the most sensitive of the selected nanobiomaterials, chitosan, is less toxic than engineered nanomaterials such as nano-ZnO and nano-Ag, some common antibiotics, heavy metals or organic pollutants such as triclosan. Given the current knowledge, the nanobiomaterials covered in this work therefore pose only little or no environmental hazard. Published pharmacokinetic data from in-vivo animal experiments was collected to predict the excretion of NBMs after administration. The data was compiled in a database, including information on the material characteristics. No correlation between the excretion (in % of injected dose) and the material type, the dose, the zeta potential or the size of the particles was found. However, the excretion is dependent on the type of administration with orally administered NBMs being excreted to a larger extent than intravenously administered ones. A statistically significant difference was found for IV vs. oral and oral vs. inhalation. Generic probability distributions of excretion for oral and IV-administration are provided to enable excretion modelling of NBMs without data for a specific NBM. The flows of nano-Ag and PLGA applications which are already in use or likely to reach the market soon were modelled assuming full-market penetration in Europe. This way, the prospective flows of these NBMs and their environmental concentrations could be estimated. The potential flows of three application-specific composite materials were also examined for one precise application each: Fe3O4PEG-PLGA used in drug delivery, MgHA-collagen used for bone tissue engineering, and PLLA-Ag applied in wound healing. The excretion of NBMs administered to the body were estimated using the excretion profiles estimated previously. Mean annual consumption in Europe, considering all realistic and probable applications of the respective NBMs, was estimated to be 5,650 kg of nano-Ag and 48,000 kg of PLGA, 4,000 kg of Fe3O4PEG-PLGA, 58 kg of MgHA-collagen, and 24,300 kg of PLLA-Ag. The probabilistic material flow model quantified the flows of these NBMs from production, through use, waste treatment and in the environment. The highest possible worst-case predicted environmental concentration (wc-PEC) were found to occur in sewage sludge, with 0.2 µg/kg of nano-Ag, 400 µg/kg of PLGA, 33 µg/kg of Fe3O4PEG-PLGA, 0.007 µg/kg of MgHA-collagen, and 2.9 µg/kg of PLLA-Ag. PLGA exhibited the highest concentration in all environmental compartments except natural and urban soil, where nano-Ag showed the highest concentration. The results showed that the distribution of NBMs into different environmental and technical compartments is strongly dependent on their type of application.  In a final step, the releases and concentrations of PLGA were regionalized for Switzerland by using population data as well as the type, size and location of hospitals as proxies. The total mean consumption of PGLA in Switzerland using an explorative full-market penetration scenario was calculated to be 770 kg/year. 105 hospitals were considered which were connected to the wastewater treatment plant and then the receiving water body (river segment or lake) using GIS modeling. The water body dataset contained 20,167 river segments and 210 polygons for lakes. Using the discharge of the river, we were able to calculate the predicted environmental concentrations in different river segments. While we calculated high PLGA releases of 2.24 kg/year and 2.03 kg/year in large cities such as Geneva or Zurich, the resulting local environmental concentrations there at 220 pg/l and 660 pg/l, respectively, were low due to the high discharge (330 m3/s and 97 m3/s) of the rivers. High PLGA concentrations (up to 7,900 pg/l) on the other hand were calculated around smaller cities with local hospitals but also smaller receiving rivers (between 0.7 m3/s and 1.9 m3/s). Therefore, we conclude that population density does not accurately predict local concentration hotspots of NBM, such as PLGA that are administered in a hospital context.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493810",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493810","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Modelling Environmental Exposure and Hazard of Nanobiomaterials",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2021-07-09T13:14:06Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27524",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Six species (19.4%) were found to be threatened (4 Vulnerable, 2 Endangered) and one species was categorized as Data Deficient. The primary threat to tenrecs is habitat loss, mostly as a result of slash-and-burn agriculture, but some species are also threatened by hunting and incidental capture in fishing traps. In the longer term, climate change is expected to alter tenrec habitats and ranges. However, the lack of data for most tenrecs on population size, ecology and distribution, together with frequent changes in taxonomy (with many cryptic species being discovered based on genetic analyses) and the poorly understood impact of bushmeat hunting on spiny species (Tenrecinae), hinders conservation planning. Priority conservation actions are presented for Madagascar's tenrecs for the first time since 1990 and focus on conserving forest habitat (especially through improved management of protected areas) and filling essential knowledge gaps. Tenrec research, monitoring and conservation should be integrated into broader sustainable development objectives and programmes targeting higher profile species, such as lemurs, if we are to see an improvement in the conservation status of tenrecs in the near future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000445760",,"0030-6053",,"10.1017/s0030605318001205","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/445760","en","University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Afrotheria||Conservation||IUCN Red List of Threatened Species||Madagascar||Microgale||Oryzorictes||Tenrecidae||Threats","Review of the status and conservation of tenrecs (Mammalia: Afrotheria: Tenrecidae)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-13T12:57:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85065106064",,"000607226800003",,"1","Oryx","55","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We sampled an equal number of living and dead saplings of four coniferous tree species (Pinus cembra, Larix decidua, Picea abies, Abies alba) in nine forests along an elevational gradient of the Swiss Alps. Based on tree-ring widths reconstructed from stem disks at multiple tree heights, we calculated radial growth rates. We observed a divergent pattern in radial growth of living and dead saplings, with reduced growth of dead saplings starting several years prior to death. By matching living and dead saplings of similar ages, we tested whether mortality probabilities of saplings were influenced by light availability, recent growth rates and diameter. Mortality of coniferous saplings in mountain forests was mainly influenced by light availability, with changing effects along the elevational gradient. Recent radial growth rate and tree size were only weakly associated with sapling mortality.

Hydrological flow and biogeochemical processes are intricately coupled, yet their respective sciences have progressed without much integration. Reaction kinetic theories that prescribe rate dependence on environmental variables (e.g., temperature and water content) have advanced substantially, mostly in well-mixed reactors, columns, and warming experiments without considering the characteristics of hydrological flow at the catchment scale. These theories have shown significant divergence from observations in natural systems. On the other hand, hydrological theories, including transit time theory, have progressed substantially yet have not been incorporated into understanding reactions at the catchment scale. Here we advocate for the development of integrated hydro-biogeochemical theories across gradients of climate, vegetation, and geology conditions. The lack of such theories presents barriers for understanding mechanisms and forecasting the future of the Critical Zone under human- and climate-induced perturbations. Although integration has started and co-located measurements are well under way, tremendous challenges remain. In particular, even in this era of ""big data,"" we are still limited by data and will need to (1) intensify measurements beyond river channels and characterize the vertical connectivity and broadly the shallow and deep subsurface; (2) expand to older water dating beyond the time scales reflected in stable water isotopes; (3) combine the use of reactive solutes, nonreactive tracers, and isotopes; and (4) augment measurements in environments that are undergoing rapid changes. To develop integrated theories, it is essential to (1) engage models at all stages to develop model-informed data collection strategies and to maximize data usage; (2) adopt a ""simple but not simplistic,"" or fit-for-purpose approach to include essential processes in process-based models; (3) blend the use of process-based and data-driven models in the framework of ""theory-guided data science."" Within the framework of hypothesis testing, model-data fusion can advance integrated theories that mechanistically link catchments' internal structures and external drivers to their functioning. It can not only advance the field of hydro-biogeochemistry, but also enable hind- and fore-casting and serve the society at large. Broadly, future education will need to cultivate thinkers at the intersections of traditional disciplines with hollistic approaches for understanding interacting processes in complex earth systems.

A series of case studies highlight issues and lessons, including:  Data often inform protected area creation but are rarely used in monitoring established protected areas. Companies have a key role in making data more accessible for decision-making. Simple, replicable schemes can fill taxonomic and geographic data gaps. Efforts to monitor coral reefs demonstrate what is possible when conservation scientists and practitioners collaborate. Threat monitoring tools should be applied in community-based natural resource management schemes, as well as protected areas. The UN Sustainable Development Goals and environment agreements stimulate the development of national capacity for data collection and use.  Solutions to help information users across Africa and Madagascar access high quality data in the right format at the right time include: scaling up efforts for using standard indicators and common tools; building capacity in key institutions; using partnerships and credible science-policy interfaces.

For example, increasing biomass productivity in tropical forests suggests a potential sink for C. However, its storage and stability are driven by factors acting from small to large scale. For tropical Africa, these factors are not well known and documented.  Predicting tropical soil C dynamics ultimately depends on our understanding and the ability to determine the primary environmental controls on soil organic carbon content and respiration.  Here, using samples collected along strong geochemical gradients in the East African Rift Valley, we demonstrate how soil chemistry and soil fertility, derived from the geochemical composition of soil parent material, can drive soil respiration even in deeply weathered soils.   To address the drivers of soil respiration, we incubated soils from three regions with contrasting geochemistry (mafic, felsic, and mixed sedimentary). For three soil depths, we measured the potential maximum heterotrophic respiration as well as the radiocarbon isotopic signature (Δ14C) of the bulk soil and respired CO2 under stable environmental conditions.   We found that soil microbial communities were able to mineralize C from fossil as well as other poor quality C sources under laboratory conditions representative of tropical topsoils. Despite similarities in terms of climate, vegetation, and the size of soil C stocks, soil respiration showed distinct patterns with soil depth and parent material geochemistry. Our study shows that soil fertility conditions are the main determinant of C stability in tropical forest soils. Further, in the presence of organic carbon sources of poor quality or the presence of strong mineral-related C stabilization, microorganisms tend to discriminate against these sources in favor of more accessible forms of soil organic matter as energy sources, resulting in a slower rate of C cycling.   Our results demonstrate that even in deeply weathered tropical soils, parent material has a long-lasting effect on soil chemistry that can influence and control microbial activity, the size of subsoil C stocks, and the turnover of C in soil. Soil parent material and its lasting control on soil chemistry need to be taken into account to understand and predict C stabilization and rates of C cycling in tropical forest soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526233",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-14344","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526233","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Carbon release from tropical forest soils informed by soil chemistry, fertility, and carbon quality derived from geochemistry of the parent material",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2022-01-17T12:41:01Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19-30, 2021","Online",,,,,,,"106005926",,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While woodland expansion is expected to deliver different ecosystem services, including enhanced biodiversity and carbon sequestration, it can also lead to the ecosystem disservice of emerging disease risk from ticks. Notably, Lyme disease, caused by the bacterial complex Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.). has been reported to have increased in the past decades in Europe and in Scotland. It has repeatedly been demonstrated that woodlands harbour more ticks and higher Lyme disease hazard than open land, but there is a gap in research on the effect of different landscape management choices i.e. the type and age of woodlands as well as deer management regimes on tick populations and Lyme disease risk. • In this thesis, I adopt an interdisciplinary approach across ecology and the social sciences to understand the effect of woodland expansion on tick populations and Lyme disease risk in Wester Ross in the Scottish Highlands, an area undergoing rapid woodland expansion. Although Wester Ross is scarcely populated, a large portion of the local population work and/or recreate outdoors and it is a popular area with tourists. Through four studies, I 1) reveal the prevalence of different non-viral pathogens in ticks in Wester Ross, and compare this prevalence with other areas in the UK and The Netherlands 2) shed light on the effect of woodland type and age and deer management regimes on tick populations and Lyme disease hazard 3) quantify ticks on deer to understand the role of deer in the tick cycle and their potential role in the B. burgdorferi transmission cycle and 4) provide insights on local people’s exposure, knowledge and perception on ticks and Lyme disease. • For the execution of the studies, we carried out fieldwork in Wester Ross in the Scottish Highlands to quantify tick, deer and rodent populations in five different land cover types: open heather moorland, young Scots pine woodlands, mature Scots pine woodlands, mature birch woodlands and mature Sitka spruce plantations. We also quantified ticks of all life stages on entire deer carcasses and ear and inguinal samples. Finally, we carried out interviews with local recreationists and local outdoor professionals on their exposure to, knowledge of and perceptions on ticks. Molecular analysis of a subset of the ticks was undertaken for the detection of eight pathogen groups, namely Anaplasma phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), Babesia from clade X, Rickettsia helvetica, Spiroplasma ixodetis, Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Borrelia miyamotoi and Babesia microti. Molecular analysis of all the ticks was carried out to detect B. burgdorferi s.l. and genospecies. • Results showed that 1) ticks harbour different pathogens of zoonotic importance, namely A. phagocytophilum (4.7% prevalence), B. burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) (2.2%), Babesia from clade X (0.2%), R. helvetica (0.04%), and S. ixodetis (0.4%) and the latter was discovered for the first time in Great Britain 2) tick densities are higher in mature natural woodlands (pine and birch) than unwooded land, but tick densities and Lyme disease hazard can be mitigated through deer management (fencing and/or culling) 3) deer carry ticks of all life stages year-round and 4) local people are highly aware of ticks and associated risks as well as the environmental factors that influence ticks, but do not always use protective measures before going outdoors. Their opinions on tick mitigation measures are influenced by the general land use debate in Scotland on woodland expansion and deer management. • The findings are detailed and discussed in four main chapters. Together, they aim to contribute to our understanding of the effect of woodland expansion on Lyme disease risk from both an ecological and a social perspective and thus helps to understand present and future risks from ticks and what mitigation measures can be adopted against these risks, while considering local perceptions on ticks and Lyme disease risk.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523235",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523235","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","ticks||disease ecology||Lyme disease||reforestation||Scotland","The effect of woodland expansion on tick populations and Lyme disease risk",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::590 - Zoological sciences","2022-01-05T10:05:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27991",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As such, tropical SOC stabilization mechanisms likely differ from those in temperate soils due to contrasting soil development. To better understand these mechanisms, we investigated SOC dynamics at three soil depths under pristine tropical African mountain forest along a geochemical gradient from mafic to felsic and a topographic gradient covering plateau, slope and valley positions. To do so, we conducted a series of soil C fractionation experiments in combination with an analysis of the geochemical composition of soil and a sequential extraction of pedogenic oxides. Relationships between our target and predicting variables were investigated using a combination of regression analyses and dimension reduction. Here, we show that reactive secondary mineral phases drive SOC properties and stabilization mechanisms together with, and sometimes more strongly than, other mechanisms such as aggregation or C stabilization by clay content. Key mineral stabilization mechanisms for SOC were strongly related to soil geochemistry, differing across the study regions. These findings were independent of topography in the absence of detectable erosion processes. Instead, fluvial dynamics and changes in soil moisture conditions had a secondary control on SOC dynamics in valley positions, leading to higher SOC stocks there than at the non-valley positions. At several sites, we also detected fossil organic carbon (FOC), which is characterized by high C/N ratios and depletion of N. FOC constitutes up to 52.0 +/- 13.2 % of total SOC stock in the C-depleted subsoil. Interestingly, total SOC stocks for these soils did not exceed those of sites without FOC. Additionally, FOC decreased strongly towards more shallow soil depths, indicating decomposability of FOC by microbial communities under more fertile conditions. Regression models, considering depth intervals of 0-10, 30-10 and 60-70 cm, showed that variables affiliated with soil weathering, parent material geochemistry and soil fertility, together with soil depth, explained up to 75 % of the variability of SOC stocks and Delta C-14. Furthermore, the same variables explain 44 % of the variability in the relative abundance of C associated with microaggregates vs. free-silt- and-clay-associated C fractions. However, geochemical variables gained or retained importance for explaining SOC target variables when controlling for soil depth. We conclude that despite long-lasting weathering, geochemical properties of soil parent material leave a footprint in tropical soils that affects SOC stocks and mineral-related C stabilization mechanisms.

Empirical mortality algorithms (MAs) are often considered promising, but little is known about DVM robustness when employing MAs of various structures and origins for multiple species. We analysed empirical MAs for a suite of European tree species within a consistent DVM framework under present and future climates in two climatically different study areas in Switzerland and evaluated their performance using empirical data from old-growth forests across Europe. DVM projections under present climate showed substantial variations when using alternative empirical MAs for the same species. Under climate change, DVM projections showed partly contrasting mortality responses for the same species. These opposing patterns were associated with MA structures (i.e. explanatory variables) and occurred independent of species ecological characteristics. When comparing simulated forest structure with data from old-growth forests, we found frequent overestimations of basal area, which can lead to flawed projections of carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services. While using empirical MAs in DVMs may appear promising, our results emphasize the importance of selecting them cautiously. We therefore synthesize our insights into a guideline for the appropriate use of empirical MAs in DVM applications.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000510202",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-021-98880-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510202","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"An evaluation of multi-species empirical tree mortality algorithms for dynamic vegetation modelling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-10-17T02:59:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85116502747",,"000706380800067","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The opening of the Gibe III dam on the Omo River in Ethiopia in 2016 attracted international attention due to the importance of the free-flowing River for pastoralist communities in the Omo Delta. Sustainable river basin management requires spatially explicit, long-term information about human settlements to mitigate negative impacts on people’s livelihoods. Based on remote sensing time-series, and supplemented with ground-truthing, we mapped settlement-dynamics of the pastoralist Dasanech tribe. The inhabited area more than doubled from 1992 to 2009. From 2009 to 2019, settlements became more permanent and concentrated in the North of the Delta. Our results indicate that the Omo Delta has overall gained in importance as a livelihood area, but that the livelihoods of the traditionally nomadic people are shifting in the context of increasing investment in infrastructure. Management of future river flow at dams should consider the location and the trajectory of change in downstream settlements.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515494",,"1572-9915||0300-7839",,"10.1007/s10745-021-00257-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515494","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Lake Turkana||Indigenous peoples||Villagization||Sustainable development||Water-energy-food nexus||Remote sensing||Ground-truthing||Dasenech settlement dynamics||Gibe III Dam||Omo River||Ethiopia","Three decades of pastoralist settlement dynamics in the Ethiopian Omo Delta based on remote sensing data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-11-17T04:00:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85116411657",,"000705798000001","Hum.

The risk of acquiring a tick-borne infection varies across space and time, so knowledge of the occurrence and prevalence of pathogens in ticks can facilitate disease diagnosis in a specific area and the implementation of mitigation measures and awareness campaigns. Here we identify the occurrence and prevalence of several pathogens in Ixodes ricinus ticks in Wester Ross, Northwest Scotland, a region of high tourism and tick exposure, yet data-poor in terms of tick-borne pathogens.  Methods Questing I. ricinus nymphs (n = 2828) were collected from 26 sites in 2018 and 2019 and tested for the presence of tick-borne pathogens using PCR-based methods. Prevalence was compared with other regions of Scotland, England, Wales, and the Netherlands.  Results Anaplasma phagocytophilum (4.7% prevalence), Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) (2.2%), Babesia from clade X (0.2%), Rickettsia helvetica (0.04%), and Spiroplasma ixodetis (0.4%) were detected, but no Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Borrelia miyamotoi, or Babesia microti. Typing of A. phagocytophilum using a fragment of the GroEL gene identified the presence of both ecotype I and ecotype II. Genospecies identification of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. revealed B. afzelii (53% of infected nymphs), B. garinii (9%), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (7%), and B. valaisiana (31%). We found similar prevalence of A. phagocytophilum in Wester Ross as in the Netherlands, but higher than in other parts of Great Britain. We found lower B. burgdorferi s.l. prevalence than in England or the Netherlands, and similar to some other Scottish studies. We found higher prevalence of B. valaisiana and lower prevalence of B. garinii than in other Scottish studies. We found S. ixodetis at much lower prevalence than in the Netherlands, and R. helvetica at much lower prevalence than in England and the Netherlands.  Conclusions As far as we know, this is the first description of S. ixodetis in Great Britain. The results are relevant for disease surveillance and management for public and veterinary health. The findings can also aid in designing targeted public health campaigns and in raising awareness among outdoor recreationists and professionals.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504130",,"1756-3305",,"10.1186/s13071-021-04946-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504130","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Lyme borreliosis||Anaplasmosis||Hard tick-borne relapsing fever||Tick-borne diseases||One Health||Cross-sectional study","Occurrence of tick-borne pathogens in questing Ixodes ricinus ticks from Wester Ross, Northwest Scotland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-09-04T17:13:13Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85113480327",,"000690981200004","Parasit. vectors","1","Parasites & Vectors","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, mixing effects on drought responses vary substantially with site conditions and species identity. We combined annually resolved tree-ring data and repeated forest inventory data spanning the last 90 years to examine the effect of species-specific neighbourhood competition on the drought response (resistance, recovery and resilience) of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), silver fir (Abies alba) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) for six drought events that occurred since the 1970s at three sites in Switzerland. We found predominantly weak neighbourhood competition and tree species diversity effects, with significant interspecific influences only for resistance and recovery of beech. These minor neighbourhood effects were outweighed by tree age and size effects. Although age effects depended on species identity and components of resilience, tree size consistently negatively affected all species. Our results emphasize that diversity effects may vary for each given species combination which makes broader conclusions challenging. This is because species interact through their specific set of traits and interactions vary in space and time. Adaptive management strategies are likely to be more effective when they promote more drought-tolerant species and reductions in stand density. Despite the absence of an unequivocal advantage of tree diversity on drought resilience, striving towards species-rich forests nonetheless allows for a risk spreading among multiple species and the reinforced provision of numerous ecosystem services.",,,,"1432-9840||1435-0629",,"10.1007/s10021-020-00501-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/413227","en","Springer",,,"Abies alba||Fagus sylvatica||Picea abies||Species diversity||Neighbourhood competition||Mixed forest||Tree ring||Permanent plot","Tree Neighbourhood Diversity Has Negligible Effects on Drought Resilience of European Beech, Silver Fir and Norway Spruce",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-05-06T02:34:54Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85084062264",,"000527527500001",,"1","Ecosystems","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

There is a concern that these subspecies will pose a greater threat to the forests and urban environments of North America than the established gypsy moths (Lymantria dispardispar L.), due to their greater capacity for female flight. Asian gypsy moth populations vary in many key traits, including female flight capabilities. The potential impacts of female flight, in combination with the other key traits, on the ecology and spread of this insect are first discussed in this communication. This also provides the first review of most of the current literature on the variations in flight capability and flight distance of gypsy moth populations, as well as variation in other traits of concern and the potential methods of identification, with special attention paid to the Asian subspecies Lymantria dispar japonica Motschulsky and Lymantria dispar asiatica Vinkovskij. There are currently good tools for identifying the general origin of introduced gypsy moth populations, but these do not provide enough information to effectively manage introductions. Gypsy moth key traits differ among populations, even within each subspecies of the gypsy moth, so introduction of gypsy moths from other world areas into locations where the gypsy moth is already present could result in unwanted changes in gypsy moth biology. It also appears that the introduction of flight-capable females could enhance a population’s dispersal capability and require modifications to management protocols used for flightless females. Therefore, rapid tools to assess key traits in introduced populations are needed to adequately plan for, or deal with, new introductions into novel habitats","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000470571",,"1999-4907",,"10.3390/f12010103","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/470571","en","MDPI AG","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Asian gypsy moth||Lymantria dispar||invasive species||forest pests","Potential Differences and Methods of Determining Gypsy Moth Female Flight Capabilities: Implications for the Establishment and Spread in Novel Habitats",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-02-19T12:50:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","Forests","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In particular, for the African continent, spatially explicit information on soils and their ability to sustain these services is still scarce. To address data gaps, infrared spectroscopy has achieved great success as a cost-effective solution to quantify soil properties in recent decades. Here, we present a mid-infrared soil spectral library (SSL) for central Africa (CSSL) that can predict key soil properties, allowing for future soil estimates with a minimal need for expensive and time-consuming wet chemistry. Currently, our CSSL contains over 1800 soil samples from 10 distinct geoclimatic regions throughout the Congo Basin and along the Albertine Rift. For the analysis, we selected six regions from the CSSL, for which we built predictive models for total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) using an existing continental SSL (African Soil Information Service, AfSIS SSL; n=1902) that does not include central African soils. Using memory-based learning (MBL), we explored three different strategies at decreasing degrees of geographic extrapolation, using models built with (1) the AfSIS SSL only, (2) AfSIS SSL combined with the five remaining central African regions, and (3) a combination of AfSIS SSL, the remaining five regions, and selected samples from the target region (spiking). For this last strategy we introduce a method for spiking MBL models. We found that when using the AfSIS SSL only to predict the six central African regions, the root mean square error of the predictions (RMSEpred) was between 3.85–8.74 and 0.40–1.66 g kg−1 for TC and TN, respectively. The ratio of performance to the interquartile distance (RPIQpred) ranged between 0.96–3.95 for TC and 0.59–2.86 for TN. While the effect of the second strategy compared to the first strategy was mixed, the third strategy, spiking with samples from the target regions, could clearly reduce the RMSEpred to 3.19–7.32 g kg−1 for TC and 0.24–0.89 g kg−1 for TN. RPIQpred values were increased to ranges of 1.43–5.48 and 1.62–4.45 for TC and TN, respectively. In general, predicted TC and TN for soils of each of the six regions were accurate; the effect of spiking and avoiding geographical extrapolation was noticeably large. We conclude that our CSSL adds valuable soil diversity that can improve predictions for the Congo Basin region compared to using the continental AfSIS SSL alone; thus, analyses of other soils in central Africa will be able to profit from a more diverse spectral feature space. Given these promising results, the library comprises an important tool to facilitate economical soil analyses and predict soil properties in an understudied yet critical region of Africa. Our SSL is openly available for application and for enlargement with more spectral and reference data to further improve soil diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000514089",,"2199-3971||2199-398X",,"10.5194/soil-7-693-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/514089","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The central African soil spectral library: a new soil infrared repository and a geographical prediction analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-11-06T14:11:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85118232281",,"000711540900001",,"2","Soil","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) is arguably the most prominent NFTP from the Neo-tropics, as a globallytraded product from a hyperdominant carbon-rich tree and cornerstone species for rainforest conservation with potential for restoration. Hence, this species has the capacity to contribute to resilient stewardship of forest landscapes, while generating income and improving the livelihood of a vast number of people and local communities throughout the Amazon basin, as well as playing a role in climate change mitigation.  • Although it is a protected species, the habitat where Brazil nuts occur is being degraded due to logging of other tree species and land conversion from forest to unsustainable agricultural systems. In this thesis I adopt an interdisciplinary approach across ecosystem management and applied molecular ecology and genomics to 1) Explore the reproductive vulnerability of natural Brazil nut populations in a categorized forest-degradation gradient in the highly biodiverse region of Madre de Dios; 2) Increase our understanding of the role of forest genetic resources as a foundation for resilient oroduction and a vital source of material for forest enrichment and Brazil-nut based restoration; and 3) Provide evidence-based recommendations for management practices that have demonstrated positive effects on the sustainability of Brazil nut populations and its value for restoration. • For genetic analyses, I used a combination of traditional microsatellite SSR loci and developed ddRAD-generated SNPs novel to the species. I place the overall results in the context of patterns of fine-scale genetic structure (FSFS), comparisons genetic-diversity and pollen geneflow patterns, signs of inbreeding through genetic erosion, heterozygosity-fitness correlations related to survival, growth and fruit productivity, monitoring of the success of planting initiatives, and exploration of cost-efficient management practices from collaborative research components. • These findings are detailed and discussed in three main chapters, followed by an additional genome-size technical note and information from co-authored studies related to similar topics within sustainable forest management. Together, they aim to contribute to our holistic understanding of approaches required for resilient management of this vulnerable and socioecologically valuable Amazon rainforest species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000480320",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/480320","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 Generic","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/","Sustainable forest management||genetic diversity||Conservation genetics||Forest genetic resources||Restoration potential||Forest enrichment||Gene flow||Brazil nut||non-timber forest products (NTFP)||Amazon rainforest||Habitat degradation||Tree planting||Socio-ecological systems||Sustainability","Brazil nuts in the Peruvian Amazon: Linking genetic diversity and sustainable forest management of a socio-ecological system",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences","2021-04-23T12:40:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27298",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

One of the most widely used stand-level process-based models is the 3-PG model (Physiological Processes Predicting Growth), which is used for applications including estimating wood production, carbon budgets, water balance and susceptibility to climate change. Few 3-PG parameter sets are available for central European species and even fewer are appropriate for mixed-species forests. Here we estimated 3-PG parameters for twelve major central European tree species using 1418 long-term permanent forest monitoring plots from managed forests, 297 from un-managed forest reserves and 784 Swiss National Forest Inventory plots. A literature review of tree physiological characteristics, as well as regression analyses and Bayesian inference, were used to calculate the 3-PG parameters.  The Swiss-wide calibration, based on monospecific plots, showed a robust performance in predicting forest stocks such as stem, foliage and root biomass. The plots used to inform the Bayesian calibration resulted in posterior ranges of the calibrated parameters that were, on average, 69% of the prior range. The bias of stem, foliage and root biomass predictions was generally less than 20%, and less than 10% for several species. The parameter sets also provided reliable predictions of biomass and mean tree sizes in mixed-species forests. Given that the information sources used to develop the parameters included a wide range of climatic, edaphic and management conditions and long time spans (from 1930 to present), these species parameters for 3-PG are likely to be appropriate for most central European forests and conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000495137",,"1612-4677||1612-4669",,"10.1007/s10342-021-01370-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495137","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Forest simulator||Data assimilation||Bayesian calibration||Forest inventory||Mixed-species forests||Permanent growth experiments","Calibration of the process-based model 3-PG for major central European tree species",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-07-15T10:48:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85103052808",,"000630270100001","Eur J Forest Res","1","European Journal of Forest Research","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite decades of costly weed control, floating invasion severity is increasing. Floating plant coverage correlates with expanding urban land cover in catchments, implicating urban nutrient sources as plausible drivers. Floating vegetation invasions have undeniable societal costs, but also provide benefits. Water hyacinths efficiently absorb nutrients from eutrophic waters, mitigating nutrient pollution problems. When washed up on shores, plants may become compost, increasing soil fertility. The biomass is increasingly used as a renewable biofuel. We propose a more nuanced perspective on these invasions moving away from futile eradication attempts towards an ecosystem management strategy that minimizes negative impacts while integrating potential social and environmental benefits.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000431282",,"0044-7447||1654-7209","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/431282||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454445","10.1007/s13280-020-01360-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454477","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biological invasions||Dams||Google earth engine||Land cover change||Urbanization||Water-energy-food nexus","Living with floating vegetation invasions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-08-13T04:00:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,"85088659386",,"000553643100001","Ambio",,"Ambio","50","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Understanding how the amount and spatial distribution of dead wood in the landscape affects saproxylic communities is therefore important for maintaining high forest biodiversity.  Objectives We investigated effects of the amount and isolation of dead wood on the alpha and beta diversity of four saproxylic species groups, with a focus on how the spatial scale influences results.  Methods We inventoried saproxylic beetles, wood-inhabiting fungi, and epixylic bryophytes and lichens on 62 plots in the Sihlwald forest reserve in Switzerland. We used GLMs to relate plot-level species richness to dead wood amount and isolation on spatial scales of 20–200 m radius. Further, we used GDMs to determine how dead wood amount and isolation affected beta diversity.  Results A larger amount of dead wood increased beetle richness on all spatial scales, while isolation had no effect. For fungi, bryophytes and lichens this was only true on small spatial scales. On larger scales of our study, dead wood amount had no effect, while greater isolation decreased species richness. Further, we found no strong consistent patterns explaining beta diversity.  Conclusions Our multi-taxon study shows that habitat amount and isolation can strongly differ in the spatial scale on which they influence local species richness. To generally support the species richness of different saproxylic groups, dead wood must primarily be available in large amounts but should also be evenly distributed because negative effects of isolation already showed at scales under 100 m.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000446013",,"0921-2973||1572-9761",,"10.1007/s10980-020-01115-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446013","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biodiversity conservation||Connectivity||Forest management||Habitat amount hypothesis||Scale dependence","Saproxylic species are linked to the amount and isolation of dead wood across spatial scales in a beech forest",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-15T02:40:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85091903336",,"000574808800001","Landsc. ecol.","1","Landscape Ecology","36","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous studies in its native and introduced range have highlighted the high spatial variability of rabbit abundance at local and landscape scales, depending on many factors such as the existence of different habitats. Modeling of the species can be useful to better understand spatial patterns and to prioritize actions, especially in those regions in which rabbits have become invasive. Here, we investigate the distribution of the European rabbit in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain), where the species was introduced during the 15th century and has subsequently changed vegetation composition. Added to the direct effects of rabbits on vegetation, climate change could also have implications for rabbit populations, especially in the alpine ecosystem. To evaluate that, we estimated rabbit abundance in 216 plots randomly distributed on Tenerife island (61 in the alpine ecosystem), modeled the potential current spatial abundance of the species and considered how it might vary under different climate change scenarios. We associated rabbit abundance to a wide selection of abiotic, biotic, and human variables expected to influence rabbit abundance on the island. We found a positive correlation between rabbit abundance and temperature and a negative correlation in the case of precipitation. Hence, according to the models' projections, climate change is expected to enhance rabbit populations in the future. Current higher densities were related to land disturbance and open areas, and a remarkable increase is expected to occur in the alpine ecosystem. Overall, we consider that this study provides valuable information for land managers in the Canary archipelago as it reveals how global warming could indirectly exacerbate the conservation problems of the endemic flora in oceanic islands. © 2020 The Ecological Society of America.",,,,"1051-0761||1939-5582",,"10.1002/eap.2206","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/441995","en","Wiley",,,"Climate change||Conservation||European rabbit||Invasive herbivores||Oceanic islands||Species abundance modeling","Forecast increase in invasive rabbit spread into ecosystems of an oceanic island (Tenerife) under climate change",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-09-23T02:41:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85090438330",,"000567439200001","Ecol.

Examining the capacity of eDNA to provide accurate biodiversity measures in species‐rich ecosystems such as coral reefs is a prerequisite for their application in long‐term monitoring. Here, we surveyed two Colombian tropical marine reefs, the island of Providencia and Gayraca Bay near Santa Marta, using eDNA and underwater visual census (UVC) methods. We collected a large quantity of surface water (30 L per filter) above the reefs and applied a metabarcoding protocol using three different primer sets targeting the 12S mitochondrial DNA, which are specific to the vertebrates Actinopterygii and Elasmobranchii. By assigning eDNA sequences to species using a public reference database, we detected the presence of 107 and 85 fish species, 106 and 92 genera, and 73 and 57 families in Providencia and Gayraca Bay, respectively. Of the species identified using eDNA, 32.7% (Providencia) and 18.8% (Gayraca) were also found in the UVCs. We further found congruence in genus and species richness and abundance between eDNA and UVC approaches in Providencia but not in Gayraca Bay. Mismatches between eDNA and UVC had a phylogenetic and ecological signal, with eDNA detecting a broader phylogenetic diversity and more effectively detecting smaller species, pelagic species and those in deeper habitats. Altogether, eDNA can be used for fast and broad biodiversity surveys and is applicable to species‐rich ecosystems in the tropics, but improved coverage of the reference database is required before this new method could serve as an effective complement to traditional census methods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000466697",,"2637-4943",,"10.1002/edn3.140","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/466697","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Comparing environmental DNA metabarcoding and underwater visual census to monitor tropical reef fishes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-29T12:33:33Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Relative importance of ecological and evolutionary determinants of coral reef fish biodiversity","164294","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85100674869",,,,"1","Environmental DNA","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These pioneers already acknowledged interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes, as well as the roles of continental movements, orogeny and climate variations in shaping biodiversity patterns. As science advanced, the complexity of ecological, evolutionary, geological and climatological processes became evident in an increasingly fragmented scientific landscape. Recent developments in computer modelling now enable the strengthening of interdisciplinary fields, opening unprecedented scientific pathways. In this thesis, a novel general engine for eco-evolutionary simulations (gen3sis) is presented. The engine consists of a spatially-explicit modelling framework that enables modular implementation of multiple macroecological and macroevolutionary processes interacting across representative spatio-temporally dynamic landscapes. Applications of gen3sis shed light into long-standing enigmas of global biodiversity patterns, such as: the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), the pantropical diversity gradient (PDG) and the life history of cold-adapted floras. Multiple reconstructed paleolandscapes and processes (e.g. environmental filtering, biotic interactions, energetic carrying capacities, dispersal, allopatric speciation, and the evolution of stress tolerance and competitive ability) were used to simulate emergent biodiversity patterns (e.g. ,  and  diversity, past and current species ranges, and phylogenies). Conclusions are based on comparisons of simulated patterns with literature reviews and empirical data (i.e. species ranges, phylogenies and fossils) of multiple faunas and floras. Bridging ecological and evolutionary mechanisms with paleo-environments shaped by plate-tectonic movements, mountain uplifts and deep-time climate changes using gen3sis is shown to be indispensable for reconstructing the formation of many global biodiversity patterns. Energetic carrying capacity was a significant process when concurrently simulating a realistic LDG, species range size frequencies, and phylogenetic tree balance of major tetrapod groups. Differences in paleo-environmental dynamics between continents (e.g. mountain and island formation and habitat fragmentation), combined with weak niche evolution, can explain the PDG by shaping spatial and temporal patterns of species origination and extinction. Simulations matched observed distribution and phylogenetic patterns of tropical plants and animals. Geological and climatological events, combined with species interactions and the evolution of competitive and temperature tolerance traits, provide a remarkable match with observed distributions, fossil records and the phylogenetic nestedness of cold-adapted plants. This thesis moves beyond correlational approaches and provides a novel framework for formalizing and exploring multiple hypotheses and reconstructions associated with the origin of biodiversity. Model comparison with empirical data serves hindcast, which might inform biodiversity trajectories. By advancing our numeric understanding of the physical and biological processes that shape biodiversity, new and interdisciplinary tools such as gen3sis support scientists to piece together key puzzles of the Earth’s astonishing biodiversity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000477193",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477193","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Biodiversity||Ecology and evolution||gen3sis||Mechanistic modeling||Process-based modelling||Climate change","On the Emergence of Biodiversity: Mechanistically Bridging Ecology, Evolution and Paleo-Environments",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2021-03-31T15:09:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27401",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The immense complexity of ecological, evolutionary, and spatial processes, however, has made this goal elusive to this day. Computer models serve progress in many scientific fields, but in the fields of macroecology and macroevolution, eco-evolutionary models are comparatively less developed. We present a general, spatially explicit, eco-evolutionary engine with a modular implementation that enables the modeling of multiple macroecological and macroevolutionary processes and feedbacks across representative spatiotemporally dynamic landscapes. Modeled processes can include species' abiotic tolerances, biotic interactions, dispersal, speciation, and evolution of ecological traits. Commonly observed biodiversity patterns, such as alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, species ranges, ecological traits, and phylogenies, emerge as simulations proceed. As an illustration, we examine alternative hypotheses expected to have shaped the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) during the Earth's Cenozoic era. Our exploratory simulations simultaneously produce multiple realistic biodiversity patterns, such as the LDG, current species richness, and range size frequencies, as well as phylogenetic metrics. The model engine is open source and available as an R package, enabling future exploration of various landscapes and biological processes, while outputs can be linked with a variety of empirical biodiversity patterns.

Spatial planning attempts to design and guide these transformations by bringing together economic, social and environmental aspects from a variety of spatial scales. This implies that the multi-level, multi-sectoral planning systems are characterized by multiple land-use plans and strategic plans, adopted by various authorities. In order to guide sustainable urban transformations, these plans’ visions, goals and projects should be externally consistent on both vertical (among plans from different administrative levels), and horizontal (among plans from various sectors) scales. Nevertheless, their envisioned developments are not always in line with each other, therefore, evaluations of how multi-level spatial planning succeeds in directing sustainable land-use changes should reflect the entire network of plans of an urban region. In Bucharest, the multi-level planning system, which has been in place for 20 years, has been criticized for being inconsistent and poorly coordinated across vertical and horizontal scales. Critics characterize it as a system with many contradictory planning strategies and instruments (from the national to the sub-local levels) and a rather unclear overall vision for urban development. Nonetheless, little is known about the actual contribution of spatial planning to urban transformations.  This doctoral thesis aims to reveal the influence of multi-level spatial planning on land change, using the Bucharest region as a case study. To do this, the thesis follows three main directions, focusing on (i) assessing the external consistency among Bucharest’s planning instruments, (ii) evaluating the influence of plans’ external consistency to plan implementation and (iii) identifying the potential of multi-level spatial plans to guide sustainable land-use changes and to meet future land-use demands. The first paper of this thesis (Chapter 3) develops for the first time, a framework for external consistency among spatial plans and tests it with planning instruments of the Bucharest region. The novel framework comprises four categories of external consistency, i.e., references from one plan to another, their identified issues, proposed general measures, and spatialized planning intentions. Once developed, the framework was tested using Social Network Analysis (SNA) on 10 spatial plans, characterizing planning levels from the metropolitan to the sub-local, and planning sectors from land use and transportation to environmental plans. Results indicate that external consistency among Bucharest’s planning instruments is high, especially regarding issues and general measures, but plans are rather poorly aligned for spatialized planning intentions on both vertical and horizontal scales. The analysis showed which plans are prestigious (i.e., the most referenced by others), which are central (i.e., the most connected with others) and which are peripheral to the networks (i.e., the most disconnected from others). The framework for external consistency in combination with the SNA, provided valuable insight into the networks created by plans, and enabled, for the first time, a comparison of the positions of plans within the overall networks with their actual positions in the administration.  The second paper of this thesis (Chapter 4) links the external consistency among plans with plan implementation using a novel plan-evaluation approach. This paper tests the hypothesis that a high degree of external consistency among plans supports plan implementation. To test this hypothesis, all spatially explicit projects outlined in seven spatial plans of the Bucharest region were selected, their recurrence in plans identified, and their implementation over the past 20 years assessed. Results indicate that more than 20% of the projects are shared among at least two of the seven plans. However, whereas projects shared between two plans are often implemented, those shared between more than two plans are often still under implementation, even after 20 years. Therefore, the findings confirmed the hypothesis that the recurrence of projects supports implementation. The results also show that reiteration of projects across plans over time, goes hand in hand with delays or even the absence of implementation. The evaluation approach developed in this paper could be a valuable tool for planning, particularly to better mobilize the institutional capacity of planning levels and sectors to commonly design future land uses. The third paper of this thesis (Chapter 5) analyzes the contribution of multi-level spatial planning to land-use changes and its potential to meet future land-use demands. For the purpose of this paper, an innovative procedure was developed whereby strategic planning intentions selected from four spatial plans and weighted based on expert opinion, were integrated into scenario-based land-change simulations. The procedure was tested at two planning levels, namely Bucharest (addressing the city scale) and the Bucharest-Ilfov Development Region (addressing the regional scale). Using the CLUMondo modeling framework, which integrates targeted land-use demands (i.e., living space, built-up areas, green spaces and agricultural areas) and the weighted planning intentions, land uses up to the year 2040 were simulated for both scales. Results indicate that all future land-use demands can be met for all scenarios and scales considered, but that planning will make little or no contribution to the distribution of future land uses. Moreover, simulations integrating planning intentions result in a higher loss of agricultural areas than simulations that do not take plans into consideration. These findings highlight the mismatch between land-use demands and planning intentions and could be the basis of designing and implementing new plans that are better aligned with the actual demands. Overall, the hypotheses tested and methods developed within this doctoral thesis, either taken individually or combined, help advancing land-change science, in particular by strengthening the link between multi-level planning systems and urban transformations. This thesis used plans and spatial data from the Bucharest region, however, all procedures developed here could be implemented in evaluations of urban regions worldwide.  The data collected in the context of this thesis and their application are unique and provide a solid basis not only for future research, but also to inform planners and decision-makers in the Bucharest region. The findings provide valuable guidelines for good practice, both in terms of designing and implementing the future generation of plans, and with respect to the future institutional arrangements that would better support the multi-level planning process.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000513177",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/513177","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","urban planning||planning evaluation||multi-level planning systems||land-use change||Scenario planning||land-change modeling","Multi-level spatial planning and its influence in shaping urban landscapes: Status and future scenarios for Bucharest",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::300 - Social sciences","2021-11-02T08:50:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27698",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it is still unclear which source of information – numerical models or in situ measurements – is of higher value for this purpose. In this study, soil moisture dynamics at 133 grassland sites in Switzerland were simulated for the period of 1981 to 2019, using a physically based 1D soil moisture transfer model. A common parameterization set was defined for all sites, except for site-specific soil hydrological properties, and the model performance was assessed at a subset of 14 sites where in situ soil moisture measurements were available on the same plot. A previously developed statistical framework was applied to fit an empirical landslide forecast model, and receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC) was used to assess the forecast goodness. To assess the sensitivity of the landslide forecasts, the statistical framework was applied to different model parameterizations, to various distances between simulation sites and landslides and to measured soil moisture from a subset of 35 sites for comparison with a measurement-based forecast model. We found that (i) simulated soil moisture is a skilful predictor for regional landslide activity, (ii) that it is sensitive to the formulation of the upper and lower boundary conditions, and (iii) that the information content is strongly distance dependent. Compared to a measurement-based landslide forecast model, the model-based forecast performs better as the homogenization of hydrological processes, and the site representation can lead to a better representation of triggering event conditions. However, it is limited in reproducing critical antecedent saturation conditions due to an inadequate representation of the long-term water storage.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504421",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-25-4585-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504421","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Simulated or measured soil moisture: which one is adding more value to regional landslide early warning?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-09-07T04:06:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85113827980",,"000691778600001","Hydrol.

Europe has a long history of land use and vast areas of forests have been transformed to agricultural lands over the last millennia. Today, forests and grasslands, two important and insect species rich ecosystems in temperate regions, are experiencing intensified land use and are embedded in landscapes increasingly shaped by humans. Insect herbivores, which depend on plants as food sources during at least part of their life cycles, account for a large share of insect communities. They contribute strongly to ecosystem functions such as in-vertebrate herbivory, which ensures the cycling of nutrients and energy within terrestrial ecosystems. Herbivore communities have repeatedly been shown to be among the functional groups most susceptible to land-use intensification. How different aspects of land use, such as land-use type at different spatial scales, affect herbivore communities, is still not well understood. Here, different functional approaches are used to investigate mechanisms underlying the assembly of herbivore communities in forests and grasslands that are differently exposed to land use. The first three chapters of this thesis were conducted in the Biodiversity Exploratories project, which comprises of 300 forest and grassland study plots located in three regions of Germany, covering land-use intensity gradients typical for the respective ecosystems. Chapter I investigates how land use at different spatial scales (local, landscape) affects the composition and diversity of insect herbivore communities in grasslands by using a trait-based approach. It shows that intensive local land use results in herbivore communities characterised by smaller species with longer wings, indicating the functional role of disturbance avoidance in shaping the trait composition of herbivore communities. At the same time, several traits that are related to microhabitat use were significantly related to land use at landscape scale, implying that land-scape-level species pools are crucial in determining local communities. Finally, while local trait diversity was not related to land-use intensity, among-site trait diversity (β-diversity) was significantly reduced by local land use. Thus, intensive local land use resulted in functional homog-nisation of insect herbivore communities, which might have profound consequences for ecosystem multifunctionality at the landscape scale. Chapter II examines plant–herbivore interaction networks to understand how the structure of these networks is related to their stability, i.e. robustness, and how they are shaped by land use. By merging data from plant and herbivore abundances with a literature-derived interaction data base, networks were constructed for 289 forest and grassland plots. Across ecosystems, network size and nestedness were positively associated with network robustness. In forests, network size was particularly important for robustness, but significantly reduced in unmanaged beech forests due to a lack of understory vegetation. In grasslands, moderate grazing was found to maximise network robustness. These new insights show ways to manage both forests and grasslands towards more stable plant–herbivore communities. In Chapter III, invertebrate herbivory was assessed for the most abundant plant species on 297 forest and grassland plots to understand how land use affects herbivory rates by altering plant and herbivore communities. Across both ecosystems, herbivory rates decreased along land-use intensity gradients. In forests, this was partly explained by a shift from broadleaf to conifer species in the tree layer, which was accompanied by a decrease of leaf palatability. In grasslands, the intensity of all three land-use components (mowing, grazing, fertilisation) was negatively associated with herbivory rates. In contrast to forests, changes in plant species com-position only weakly explained these changes, suggesting that the observed effects on herbivory rates were likely mediated by other plant and herbivore community characteristics. Reduced herbivory might imply a reduction in nutrient and energy cycling in these systems, which could have cascading effects on other trophic levels and thus contribute greatly to biodiversity loss. In Chapter IV, the success of different restoration measures to restore semi-natural grass-lands from previously intensively used grasslands in Switzerland was evaluated. Restoration measures differed in their invasiveness from mere removal of harvested biomass to removal of the topsoil layer and subsequent seeding of plant propagules. Twenty-two years after the establishment of the restoration measures, insect herbivore communities were found to resemble the target state in terms of composition and diversity, both taxonomically and functionally. However, restoration measures involving topsoil removal were found to be most effective, especially in re-establishing species characterised by traits known to be susceptible to intensive land use. Thus, measures involving topsoil removal are recommended to restore taxonomically and functionally divers semi-natural grasslands. This thesis provides novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the relationships be-tween land use, insect herbivore communities and herbivory and shows ways to reduce negative impacts of intensive land use. Based on robust observational data from grasslands and forests, crucial pathways via changes in plant communities and plant–herbivore interactions, as well as changes in herbivore traits and trait syndromes, could be identified.

A cornerstone of eDNA approach is the development of primer pairs that allow amplifying the DNA of specific taxonomic groups, which is then used to link the DNA sequence to taxonomic identification. Here, we propose a framework for comparing primer pairs regarding (a) their capacity to bind and amplify a broad coverage of species within the target clade using in silico PCR, (b) their capacity to not only discriminate between species but also genera or families, and (c) their in situ specificity and efficiency across a variety of environments. As a case study, we focus on two mitochondrial 12S primer pairs, MiFish-U and teleo, which were designed to amplify fishes. We found that the performance of in silico PCRs were high for both primer pairs, but teleo amplified more genera across Actinopterygii, Chondrichthyes, and Petromyzontomorphi than MiFish-U. In contrast, the discriminatory power for species, genera, and families were higher for MiFish-U than teleo, likely associated with the greater length of the amplified DNA fragments. The evaluation of their in situ efficiency showed a higher recovered species richness of teleo compared to MiFish-U in tropical and temperate freshwater environments, but that generally both teleo and MiFish-U primers pairs perform well to monitor fish species. Since more species were detected when used together, those primer pairs are best used in combination to increase the ability of species detection.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000518928",,"2637-4943",,"10.1002/edn3.232","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518928","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","biodiversity||biomonitoring||environmental DNA||fishes||in silico PCR||neural network","Comparing the performance of 12S mitochondrial primers for fish environmental DNA across ecosystems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-12-06T17:31:12Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Relative importance of ecological and evolutionary determinants of coral reef fish biodiversity","164294","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85109068679",,,,"6","Environmental DNA","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In grasslands, higher biodiversity in terms of plant diversity was shown to increase the diversity of higher trophic levels and provide benefits for farmers such as higher and more stable yields. However, we lack a systematic overview of costs for more diverse seed mixtures, which are an essential tool in maintaining and increasing plant diversity in grasslands. We here investigated the prices and characteristics of 262 commercially available seed mixtures from six German or Swiss online shops and quantified the relationships between seed mixture prices and plant diversity. The most frequent seed mixtures contained 1 to 10 species and were designed for rather intensive grassland management. On the contrary, a smaller set of seed mixtures with particularly high plant diversity (>30 species), usually of native ecotypes, were offered for restoration purposes. More diverse seed mixtures were also more expensive. For example, a seed mixture with 10 or 30 species was on average +63% or +387% more expensive, respectively, than a product containing only 1 species. The relationship between plant diversity and seed mixture prices per ha was related to other seed mixture characteristics, of which plant provenance (i.e., native ecotypes vs. cultivars) was particularly important for the price. Seed mixtures containing only native ecotypes had considerably higher prices per ha (≥ +75%) than those including cultivars. In conclusion, increasing biodiversity in grasslands can be costly. These costs need to be considered when making recommendations to farmers and other stakeholders. Measures to reduce such costs for maintaining and/or increasing plant diversity could promote establishment of grasslands with higher plant diversity, facilitate the restoration of semi-natural grasslands, and contribute to solving the biodiversity crisis in agroecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000499719",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ac1a9c","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499719","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Seed price||Biodiversity||Grassland restoration||Ecosystem service||Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research||Provenance","The costs of diversity: higher prices for more diverse grassland seed mixtures",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-08-05T12:16:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies","774124","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85116030437",,"000685928500001","Environ.

Here, we describe the development of a framework for modelling how these changes may transform forest site types. Site types capture information on site conditions like climate, topography and soil, all factors with strong influence on tree species occurrence.  Location Switzerland.  Methods We elicited expert knowledge and followed a participatory modelling approach for quantifying upward shifts of altitudinal vegetation belts and the changes in the zonal distribution of main tree species, as a basis for assessing transformation pathways of forest site types for three climate projections.  Results The model results show marked range shifts of altitudinal vegetation belts. The change in the vegetation belt and a rule base for forest site type transformations allow for assessing the location-specific and long-term transformation pathway from the current to a future forest site type.  Conclusions The resulting maps enable forest managers to take climate change into account when selecting tree species. The presented method complements statistical distribution models as it considers more site information, integrates expert knowledge and is based on a forest site type classification which is already widely used by forest practitioners.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519582",,"1402-2001||1654-109X",,"10.1111/avsc.12621","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519582","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Altitudinal vegetation belts||Climate change impacts||Forest site type classification||Forests||Participatory modelling||Range shift||Resilience||Switzerland","Participatory modelling of upward shifts of altitudinal vegetation belts for assessing site type transformation in Swiss forests due to climate change",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-12-08T13:54:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85121732361",,"000764249800010","Appl.

The response may depend on whether C is unprotected, isolated within aggregates, or protected from decomposition by mineral associations. Here, we present a global synthesis of the relative influence of environmental factors on soil organic C partitioning among pools, abundance in each pool (mg C g−1 soil), and persistence (as approximated by radiocarbon abundance) in relatively unprotected particulate and protected mineral-bound pools. We show that C within particulate and mineral-associated pools consistently differed from one another in degree of persistence and relationship to environmental factors. Soil depth was the best predictor of C abundance and persistence, though it accounted for more variance in persistence. Persistence of all C pools decreased with increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) throughout the soil profile, whereas persistence increased with increasing wetness index (MAP/PET) in subsurface soils (30–176 cm). The relationship of C abundance (mg C g−1 soil) to climate varied among pools and with depth. Mineral-associated C in surface soils (<30 cm) increased more strongly with increasing wetness index than the free particulate C, but both pools showed attenuated responses to the wetness index at depth. Overall, these relationships suggest a strong influence of climate on soil C properties, and a potential loss of soil C from protected pools in areas with decreasing wetness. Relative persistence and abundance of C pools varied significantly among land cover types and soil parent material lithologies. This variability in each pool's relationship to environmental factors suggests that not all soil organic C is equally vulnerable to global change. Therefore, projections of future soil organic C based on patterns and responses of bulk soil organic C may be misleading. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.16023","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/521964","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,,"climate change||persistence||radiocarbon||soil carbon||soil fractions||soil organic matter||terrestrial carbon cycle","Beyond bulk: Density fractions explain heterogeneity in global soil carbon abundance and persistence",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-12-22T12:53:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85121353213",,"000730665500001","Glob.

Despite widespread recognition of the urgent need to restore biodiversity and ecological functioning across many forest landscapes, there is an apparent mismatch between political commitments and direct actions on the ground. Global markets and consumption patterns remain prominent drivers of land degradation. Alternatively, market forces could be transformed to have net positive rather than negative influence on land use change, offering innovative pathways to incentivise and finance FLR. Understanding current market mechanisms that finance FLR is essential for establishing best practices and effective policy. We reviewed 40 eco-marketing initiatives to provide an overview of the types of organizations involved in funding of FLR, and how they finance and enable FLR interventions. We identified three groups of initiatives: for-profit business, certified social enterprise, and non-profit organization. In total, 36 out of the reviewed initiatives collaborated with enabler-organizations to implement FLR activities. All initiatives promoted active tree planting, primarily in regenerative agroforestry systems. Only six analyzed initiatives included natural regeneration as a type of FLR intervention. This suggests that eco-marketing initiatives primarily focus on funding tree planting initiatives, possibly because tree planting is the easiest message to communicate to consumers.
