The area of investigation in the Central Alps in Switzerland faced the second warmest summer since the beginning of measurements in 1864. As a consequence, agriculture suffered from considerable production losses. But how were forests affected by the hot summer? We analyzed stem growth data, measured by automated point dendrometers, from 50 trees across nine sites covering the four main Swiss tree species spruce (Picea abies), fir (Abies alba), beech (Fagus sylvatica) and oak (Quercus spp.) in the years 2014 (relatively wet and cool) and 2015 (hot and dry). Annual growth and environmental conditions were determined by, and related to, the growing period based on daily resolved growth data. Our multi-species approach revealed a wide range of responses. Radial growth of spruce was largely reduced during the hot summer 2015 for sites located below 1500 m a.s.l.. Growth of beech responded even positively at several sites on the Swiss Plateau. Fir and oak did not significantly deviate from their respective average growth rate. We conclude that one hot summer actually matters for stem growth, but its effect is not a priori negative. The timing of the heat wave is of highest importance. A relatively wet previous year, a wet spring and the relatively late occurrence of the heat wave in the wood growth period led to a less strong growth reduction than what could have been expected from agricultural plants. Endogenous effects like mast fruiting and legacy effects from past conditions are suggested to further play an important role for stem growth.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000387504",,"0013-9998",,"10.12854/erde-2019-420","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387504","en","Gesellschaft für Erdkunde zu Berlin","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","Climate change||Tree growth||Heat wave 2015||Swiss forests||Point dendrometer||Stem radius changes||Picea abies||Abies alba||Fagus sylvatica||Quercus spp","How did Swiss forest trees respond to the hot summer 2015?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-05T03:32:11Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"ICOS-CH: Integrated Carbon Observation System in Switzerland","148992","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,,,"85077634201","000503866300002","Erde","4","Die Erde","150","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we hypothesize that this is due to land surface models having difficulties in reproducing grassland phenology, in particular in response to the seasonal and interannual variability of precipitation. Using leaf area index (LAI), net primary productivity, and flux data at 55 sites spanning climate zones, the aim of this study is to evaluate a novel prognostic phenology model (Simple Biosphere Model, SiB4) while simultaneously illustrating grassland relationships across precipitation gradients. Evaluating from 2000 to 2014, SiB4 predicts daily LAI, carbon, and energy fluxes with root‐mean‐square errors < 15% and individual biases <10%; however, not including management likely reduces its performance. Grassland mean annual LAI increases linearly with mean annual precipitation, with both SiB4 and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) showing a 0.13 increase in LAI per 100‐mm increase in precipitation. Both gross primary production and ecosystem respiration increase with growing season length by ∼8.5 g C m−2 per day, with SiB4 and Fluxnet estimates within 18%. Despite differences in mean annual precipitation and growing season length, all grassland sites shift to seasonal carbon sinks one month prior to peak uptake. During a U.S. drought, MODIS and SiB4 had nearly identical LAI responses, and the LAI change due to drought was less than the LAI change across the precipitation gradient, indicating that grassland drought response is not as strong as the overlying climate response.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000383556",,"1942-2466",,"10.1029/2018ms001541","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/383556","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Grassland ecology||Terrestrial carbon cycle||Prognostic phenology||Land surface model","Representing grasslands using dynamic prognostic phenology based on biological growth stages: Part 2.

Using a process‐based model of diversification constrained by a dispersal parameter, we simulated the interplay between reef habitat dynamics during the past 140 million years and dispersal, shaping lineage diversification history and assemblage composition globally. The emerging patterns from the simulations were compared to current prevalence of species traits related to dispersal for 6315 tropical reef fish species. We found a significant spatial congruence between the prevalence of simulated low dispersal values and areas with a large proportion of species characterized by small adult body size, narrow home range mobility behaviour, pelagic larval duration shorter than 21 days and diurnal activity. Species characterized by such traits were found predominantly in the Indo‐Australian Archipelago and the Caribbean Sea. Furthermore, the frequency distribution of the dispersal parameter was found to match empirical distributions for body size, PLD and home range mobility behaviour. Also, the dispersal parameter in the simulations was associated to diversification rates and resulted in trait frequency matching empirical distributions. Overall, our findings suggest that past habitat dynamics, in conjunction with dispersal processes, influenced diversification in tropical reef fishes, which may explain the present‐day geography of species traits.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000369741",,"0906-7590||1600-0587",,"10.1111/ecog.04537","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/369741","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Biodiversity||Dispersal||Diversification||Mechanistic models||Reef fish||Traits","A process‐based model supports an association between dispersal and the prevalence of species traits in tropical reef fish assemblages",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-10-10T09:53:47Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85073969080","000487946300001",,"12","Ecography","42","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These network dynamics can dramatically alter the drainage density and thus the length of subsurface flow pathways to flowing streams. We mapped flowing stream networks in a small Swiss headwater catchment during different wetness conditions and estimated their effects on the distribution of travel times to the catchment outlet. For each point in the catchment, we determined the subsurface transport distance to the flowing stream based on the surface topography and determined the surface transport distance along the flowing stream to the outlet. We combined the distributions of these travel distances with assumed surface and subsurface flow velocities to estimate the distribution of travel times to the outlet. These calculations show that the extension and retraction of the stream network can substantially change the mean travel time and the shape of the travel time distribution. During wet conditions with a fully extended flowing stream network, the travel time distribution was strongly skewed to short travel times, but as the network retracted during dry conditions, the distribution of the travel times became more uniform. Stream network dynamics are widely ignored in catchment models, but our results show that they need to be taken into account when modeling solute transport and interpreting travel time distributions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000383639",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-23-4825-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/383639","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Expansion and contraction of the flowing stream network alter hillslope flowpath lengths and the shape of the travel time distribution",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-12-08T03:35:57Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85075787954","000499729200001","Hydrol.

Intact forests have important intrinsic and societal values, making their protection a high conservation priority. They are, however, vulnerable to being lost and degraded due to high opportunity costs and a lack of positive incentives to their preservation. Market-based mechanisms, such as voluntary certification, might provide a means to conserve intact forests while maintaining income through sustainable forest uses. Yet possibilities to ensure strict protection of large areas of intact forests through certification remain limited as long as premiums from certification are bound to the units of forest products that are sold. We explore challenges for incorporating intact forests into certification processes, and of maintaining intact forests within forest management units. To circumvent these challenges, it might be necessary to create a form of compensation payment scheme to overcome the foregone costs of intact forest preservation. Alternatively, certification systems might need to consider permitting some degree of regulated extraction in exchange for recognition and implementation of stringent forest preservation. This will require a re-evaluation of the way intactness is treated within current certification standards and the requirements for forestry within intact forests. Eventually, intact forest conservation and socially and economically viable forest management can only be reconciled on the landscape scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000395117",,"2624-893X",,"10.3389/ffgc.2019.00072","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/395117","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Land sharing land sparing||Protected areas||REDD+||Forest management||FSC||Sustainable intensification||Boreal forest||Tropical forest","The Dilemma of Maintaining Intact Forest Through Certification",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-28T18:17:33Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,,,,,,,,"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although various land use change options have been proposed, so far, there are no empirical data on their long-term ecosystem carbon pools effects. Our results demonstrate that pasture-to-OP conversion in savanna regions does not change ecosystem carbon storage, after 56 years in Colombia. Compared to rainforest conversion, this alternative land use change reduces net ecosystem carbon losses by 99.7 ± 9.6%. Soil organic carbon (SOC) decreased until 36 years after conversion, due to a fast decomposition of pasture-derived carbon, counterbalancing the carbon gains in OP biomass. The recovery of topsoil carbon content, suggests that SOC stocks might partly recover during a third plantation cycle. Hence, greater OP sustainability can be achieved if its expansion is oriented toward pasture land.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000382119",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.aaw4418","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/382119","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Carbon neutral expansion of oil palm plantations in the Neotropics",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-12-03T03:32:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85075582004","000499736100015","Sci Adv","11","Science Advances","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Still, few studies consider the interactions of transport and transformation together. Here, we consider how diurnal discharge fluctuations in an intermittent, headwater stream control reach-scale solute transport and transformation as measured with conservative and reactive tracers during a period of no precipitation. One common conceptual model is that extended contact times with hyporheic zones during low discharge conditions allows for increased transformation of reactive solutes. Instead, we found tracer timescales within the reach were related to discharge, described by a single discharge-variable StorAge Selection function. We found that Resazurin to Resorufin (Raz-to-Rru) transformation is static in time, and apparent differences in reactive tracer were due to interactions with different ages of storage, not with time-variable reactivity. Overall we found reactivity was highest in youngest storage locations, with minimal Raz-to-Rru conversion in waters older than about 20 h of storage in our study reach. Therefore, not all storage in the study reach has the same potential biogeochemical function and increasing residence time of solute storage does not necessarily increase reaction potential of that solute, contrary to prevailing expectations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000382124",,"2073-4441",,"10.3390/w11112208","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/382124","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","unsteady-state discharge||solute transport||intermittent stream||diurnal discharge fluctuations||reactive tracers||headwaters||river corridor||hyporheic||resazurin","Solute transport and transformation in an intermittent, headwater mountain stream with diurnal discharge fluctuations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-12-03T03:33:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85075566470","000502264500010",,"11","Water","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Explanations for the LDG are often categorized into three broad pathways in which the diversity gradient is created by (1) differential diversification rates, (2) differential carrying capacities (ecological limits), or (3) differential time to accumulate species across latitude. Support for these pathways has, however, been mostly verbally expressed. Here, we present a minimal model to clarify the essential assumptions of the three pathways and explore the sensitivity of diversity dynamics to these pathways. We find that an LDG arises most easily from a gradient in ecological limits compared with a gradient in the time for species accumulation or diversification rate in most modeled scenarios. Differential diversification rates create a stronger LDG than ecological limits only when speciation and dispersal rates are low, but then the predicted LDG seems weaker than the observed LDG. Moreover, range dynamics may reduce an LDG created by a gradient in diversification rates or time for species accumulation, but they cannot reduce an LDG induced by differential ecological limits. We conclude that our simple model provides a null prediction for the effectiveness of the three LDG pathways and can thus aid discussions about the causal mechanisms underlying the LDG or motivate more complex models to confirm or falsify our findings.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000382822",,"0003-0147||1537-5323",,"10.1086/705243","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/382822","en","University of Chicago Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","latitudinal diversity gradient||ecological limits||diversification||speciation||extinction||dispersal","A Minimal Model for the Latitudinal Diversity Gradient Suggests a Dominant Role for Ecological Limits",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-12-05T03:36:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000497985900002","Amer Natur","5","The American Naturalist","194","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, gaps remain in our understanding of the relationships between the isotopic signatures of leaf waxes and the plants’ source water. In this study, we investigated the influence of plant growth form, habitat and season on the distribution patterns and δ²Hwax values of 14 plant species (among which are two grasses, five trees and seven shrubs) sampled during four successive dry and wet seasons in three distinct habitats around Lake Chala in equatorial East Africa. Variation in δ²Hwax was analyzed with linear mixed-effect models and compared with the associated values of xylem water (δ²Hxylem), leaf water (δ²Hleaf) and biosynthetic hydrogen fractionation (εbio). Our results show that plant growth form was the most important driver of modern-day δ²Hwax variability in the study area, and that differences in δ²Hwax among habitats to a large extent reflect how each major growth forms is represented in those habitats. Individual plant species appear to express substantial species-specific isotopic fractionation that cannot be attributed to the tested external factors but rather seem to depend on intrinsic (e.g., plant phenological and biosynthesis-related) factors. For the purpose of calibrating δ²Hwax signatures against vegetation types, it is thus crucial to analyze representative samples of the plant communities present in the study area. Our results further indicate that paleohydrological studies in regions receiving rain from multiple moisture sources must take into account possible seasonal bias in the δ²Hwax signature relative to annual rainfall, due to unequal use of those moisture sources by the plants. Finally, the strong influence of plant growth form on δ²Hwax values argues for δ²Hwax variation in paleo-records being evaluated in conjunction with independent proxy data on changes in vegetation composition. Differences in n-alkane distribution patterns among trees, shrubs and grasses (e.g., average chain length, carbon preference index and C31/(C29+C31) ratio) may provide such proxies, and can be produced from the same leaf-wax n-alkane dataset used to determine δ²Hwax.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000360273",,"0016-7037||1872-9533",,"10.1016/j.gca.2019.08.004","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/360273","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Influence of plant growth form, habitat and season on leaf-wax n-alkane hydrogen-isotopic signatures in equatorial East Africa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-08-23T12:28:57Z","2021-08-09",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Sources and proportions of modern and aged organic carbon eroded from soils under different land-use within catchments in Nepal – Insights from compound-specific 13C & 14C analysis and novel mixing models","174300","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Rückkehr CH Advanced Postdoc.Mobility",,,,,"60455653","85070869190","000484768900008","Geochim.

In Chile, most soil and SOC data to date is highly concentrated in 25 % of the territory that has intensive agricultural or forestry use. Vast areas beyond those forms of land use have few or no soil data available. Here, we present a new database of SOC for the country, which is the result of an unprecedented national effort under the frame of the Global Soil Partnership that help to build the largest database on SOC to date in Chile named “CHLSOC"" comprising 13,612 data points. This dataset is the product of the compilation from numerous sources including unpublished and difficult to access data, allowing to fill numerous spatial gaps where no SOC estimates were publicly available before. The values of SOC compiled in CHLSOC range from 6×10−5 to 83.3 percent, reflecting the variety of ecosystems that exists in Chile. Profiting from the richness of geochemical, topographic and climatic variability in Chile, the dataset has the potential to inform and test models trying to predict SOC stocks and dynamics at larger spatial scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000385701",,"1866-3591",,"10.5194/essd-2019-161","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/385701","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"CHLSOC: The Chilean Soil Organic Carbon database, a multi-institutional collaborative effort",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2019-12-15T18:59:14Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Earth syst. sci. data, Pap. open discuss.",,"Earth System Science Data Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Whether crop yield–related ecosystem services can be maintained by a few dominant species or rely on high richness remains unclear. Using a global database from 89 studies (with 1475 locations), we partition the relative importance of species richness, abundance, and dominance for pollination; biological pest control; and final yields in the context of ongoing land-use change. Pollinator and enemy richness directly supported ecosystem services in addition to and independent of abundance and dominance. Up to 50% of the negative effects of landscape simplification on ecosystem services was due to richness losses of service-providing organisms, with negative consequences for crop yields. Maintaining the biodiversity of ecosystem service providers is therefore vital to sustain the flow of key agroecosystem benefits to society.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000374049",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.aax0121","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/374049","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"A global synthesis reveals biodiversity-mediated benefits for crop production",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-10-30T18:25:07Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85073876549","000491132700077","Sci Adv","10","Science Advances","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is difficult to partition ecosystem-scale evapotranspiration (ET) measurements into E and T, which makes it difficult to validate satellite data and land surface models. Here, we review current progress in partitioning E and T and provide a prospectus for how to improve theory and observations going forward. Recent advancements in analytical techniques create new opportunities for partitioning E and T at the ecosystem scale, but their assumptions have yet to be fully tested. For example, many approaches to partition E and T rely on the notion that plant canopy conductance and ecosystem water use efficiency exhibit optimal responses to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (D). We use observations from 240 eddy covariance flux towers to demonstrate that optimal ecosystem response to D is a reasonable assumption, in agreement with recent studies, but more analysis is necessary to determine the conditions for which this assumption holds. Another critical assumption for many partitioning approaches is that ET can be approximated as T during ideal transpiring conditions, which has been challenged by observational studies. We demonstrate that T can exceed 95 % of ET from certain ecosystems, but other ecosystems do not appear to reach this value, which suggests that this assumption is ecosystem-dependent with implications for partitioning. It is important to further improve approaches for partitioning E and T, yet few multi-method comparisons have been undertaken to date. Advances in our understanding of carbon–water coupling at the stomatal, leaf, and canopy level open new perspectives on how to quantify T via its strong coupling with photosynthesis. Photosynthesis can be constrained at the ecosystem and global scales with emerging data sources including solar-induced fluorescence, carbonyl sulfide flux measurements, thermography, and more. Such comparisons would improve our mechanistic understanding of ecosystem water fluxes and provide the observations necessary to validate remote sensing algorithms and land surface models to understand the changing global water cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000370418",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-16-3747-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/370418","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Reviews and syntheses: Turning the challenges of partitioning ecosystem evaporation and transpiration into opportunities",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2019-10-14T13:57:54Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85073054362","000488783300001",,"19","Biogeosciences","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As snowfall and snow accumulation vary significantly with elevation and forest cover, the release of meltwater is highly heterogeneous across the catchment landscape, particularly during rain-on-snow events. As a consequence, streamflow generating mechanisms during rain-on-snow events and the snowmelt period are complex in mountainous headwater catchments. In order to improve predictions of water availability in the future, these processes need to be better understood. In this PhD thesis, the hydrological processes during snow accumulation, snow melt and rain-on-snow events were investigated in the 47 km2 Alp catchment in Central Switzerland. For this, a snowmelt lysimeter system was designed to obtain high-resolution measurements of snowpack outflow (defined as snowmelt and rain) and its chemical composition at the plot scale (Part I). These data were complemented by regular measurements of stream water, precipitation and bulk snowpack properties, so that the resulting database allows for studying the variable hydrological responses of different water sources (Part II). In particular, the spatiotemporal variability of snowpack outflow generation across the catchment landscape was investigated and the snowmelt contribution to streamflow during rain-on-snow events was estimated (Part III). Part I of this thesis compares two different systems used to capture the rate of snowmelt and its isotopic composition at daily intervals during two snowfall-snowmelt seasons in mountainous terrain. The systems were a low-cost unheated precipitation collector and a newly developed snowmelt lysimeter system. The analysis showed that the isotopic compositions of the precipitation samples derived from the unheated precipitation collector were similar to those derived from the snowpack lysimeter system. Thus the sampling method based on the unheated precipitation collector could be a useful alternative for estimating the isotopic composition of snowmelt, especially for remote areas, as it requires little effort to install. The snowmelt lysimeter system requires a power supply and significantly more effort in installation; however, it allows for monitoring snowmelt rates at 10-minute resolution at multiple nearby locations. Part II aims at providing and evaluating a database containing environmental tracers such as geochemical solutes and stable water isotopes in a spatially distributed sampling network in the research Alptal catchment. During a 3.3-year period, different water sources such as precipitation, stream water and snowpack outflow were sampled at daily intervals. To reduce evaporative fractionation effects in the automatic water samplers during each three-week sampling period, the sample bottles were retrofitted. This new design significantly reduced isotopic fractionation in the collected water samples, especially during warm conditions in summer. The environmental tracer data in stream water showed good agreement with bi-weekly measurements carried out by the Swiss National River Monitoring and Survey Programme (NADUF). The database is separated into two parts and contains water fluxes and environmental tracer data at daily intervals in (1) precipitation and stream water and (2) snowpack outflow. Database (1) also includes measurements of snowpack outflow volumes at ten-minute resolution. Both datasets are publically available on www.envidat.ch (10.16904/envidat.70 and 10.16904/envidat.71). In Part III, the generation of snowmelt and streamflow are investigated for several rain-on-snow events in a 0.7 km2 tributary of the Alptal valley. Snowpack outflow volumes were measured with snowmelt lysimeter systems at three different elevations characterized by different vegetation (e.g., open grassland and evergreen forest). The differences in snowpack outflow volumes at the three sites could mainly be explained by initial snow depth and rainfall volumes, which in turn are affected by vegetation cover and elevation. An end-member mixing analysis based on stable water isotopes showed that snowpack outflow contributions to streamflow during rain-on-snow events were highly variable between the three lysimeter sites. Our results suggest that hydrological processes during rain-on-snow events are very heterogeneous across the catchment landscape mainly also due to effects of vegetation and elevation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000380996",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/380996","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Tracing snow-hydrological processes in a pre-alpine catchment with stable water isotopes",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2019-11-27T19:41:44Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"26065",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The discharge sensitivity of Fyw has been defined as the rate of increase in Fyw with increasing discharge (Q), and has been estimated by the linear regression slope between Fyw and Q, hereafter called DS(Q). The combined use of both metrics, Fyw and DS(Q), provides a promising method for catchment inter-comparison studies that seek to understand streamflow generation processes. Here we explore the discharge sensitivity of Fyw in the intensively sampled small Mediterranean research catchment Can Vila. Intensive sampling of high flows at Can Vila allows young water fractions to be estimated for the far upper tail of the flow frequency distribution. These young water fractions converge toward 1 at the highest flows, illustrating a conceptual limitation in the linear regression method for estimating DS(Q) as a metric of discharge sensitivity: Fyw cannot grow with discharge indefinitely, since the fraction of young water in discharge can never be larger than 1. Here we propose to quantify discharge sensitivity by the parameter of an exponential-type equation expressing how Fyw varies with discharge. The exponential parameter (Sd) approximates DS(Q) at moderate discharges where Fyw is well below 1; however, the exponential equation and its discharge sensitivity metric better capture the non-linear relationship between Fyw and Q and are robust with respect to changes in the range of sampled discharges, allowing comparisons between catchments with strongly contrasting flow regimes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000391366",,"1812-2116||1812-2108",,"10.5194/hess-2019-447","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/391366","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Technical note: An improved discharge sensitivity metric for young water fractions",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2020-01-17T09:35:55Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hydrol. earth syst. sci.",,"Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, gaps remain in our understanding of the isotopic relationships between the leaf waxes and the plants' source water. In this study, we investigated the influence of plant growth form, habitat and season on the distribution patterns and δ²Hwax values of 14 plant species (among which are two grasses, five trees and seven shrubs) sampled during four successive dry and wet seasons in three distinct habitats around Lake Chala in equatorial East Africa. Variation in δ²Hwax was analyzed with linear mixed-effect models and compared with the associated values of xylem water (δ²Hxylem), leaf water (δ²Hleaf) and biosynthetic hydrogen fractionation (εbio) (Figure 1). Our results show that plant growth form was the most important driver of modern-day δ²Hwax variability in the study area, and that differences in δ²Hwax between habitats to a large extent reflect the representation of the three major growth forms in those habitats. Individual plant species appear to express substantial species-specific isotopic fractionation that cannot be attributed to the tested external factors but rather seem to depend on intrinsic (e.g., plant phenological and biosynthesis-related) factors. For the purpose of calibrating δ²Hwax signatures against vegetation types, it is thus crucial to analyze representative samples of the plant communities present in the study area. Our results further indicate that paleohydrological studies in regions receiving rain from multiple moisture sources must take into account possible seasonal bias in the δ²Hwax signature relative to annual rainfall (Figure 1), due to unequal use of those moisture sources by the plants (De Wispelaere et al., 2017). Finally, the strong influence of plant growth form on δ²Hwax values argues for systematic evaluation of δ²Hwax variation in paleo-records in conjunction with independent proxy data on changes in vegetation composition. Differences in n-alkane distribution patterns (average chain length, carbon preference index and C31/(C29+C31) ratio) among trees, shrubs and grasses may provide such a proxy, and can be produced from the same leaf-wax n-alkane dataset used to determine δ²Hwax.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000394700",,,,"10.3997/2214-4609.201902992","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/394700","en","European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers (EAGE)","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Influence of plant growth form, habitat and season on leaf-wax n-alkane hydrogen-isotopic signatures in equatorial East Africa",,"Conference Paper","Open access","Conference Proceedings, 29th International Meeting on Organic Geochemistry, Sep 2019",,"2020-01-28T08:42:31Z",,,,,,"yes","29th International Meeting on Organic Geochemistry (IMOG 2019)","September 1-6, 2019","Gothenburg, Sweden",,"Sources and proportions of modern and aged organic carbon eroded from soils under different land-use within catchments in Nepal – Insights from compound-specific 13C & 14C analysis and novel mixing models","174300","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Rückkehr CH Advanced Postdoc.Mobility",,,,,,,,,,"EarthDoc","2019","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Most water age studies to date have focused on individual compartments (or subdisciplines) of the hydrological cycle such as the unsaturated or saturated zone, vegetation, atmosphere, or rivers. However, recent studies have shown that processes at the interfaces between the hydrological compartments (e.g., soil‐atmosphere or soil‐groundwater) govern the age distribution of the water fluxes between these compartments and thus can greatly affect water travel times. The broad variation from complete to nearly absent mixing of water at these interfaces affects the water ages in the compartments. This is especially the case for the highly heterogeneous critical zone between the top of the vegetation and the bottom of the groundwater storage. Here, we review a wide variety of studies about water ages in the critical zone and provide (1) an overview of new prospects and challenges in the use of hydrological tracers to study water ages, (2) a discussion of the limiting assumptions linked to our lack of process understanding and methodological transfer of water age estimations to individual disciplines or compartments, and (3) a vision for how to improve future interdisciplinary efforts to better understand the feedbacks between the atmosphere, vegetation, soil, groundwater, and surface water that control water ages in the critical zone.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000374956",,"8755-1209||0096-1043||1944-9208",,"10.1029/2018RG000633","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/374956","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","travel times||water ages||tracer hydrology||stable isotopes||critical Zone||terrestrial water cycle","The Demographics of Water: A Review of Water Ages in the Critical Zone",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2019-11-03T03:34:47Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85068217460","000492796700004","Rev.

Local engagement can also contribute to solutions to ecosystem management challenges by diversifying the range of options and contextualizing their applicability. The benefits to local communities of ecosystem service-based policies relative to other interventions, such as oil palm development, are, therefore, best understood from the perspectives of the local communities themselves. We used observations, focus group discussions, and interviews in four villages along the Belayan River, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, to explore how local communities in different oil palm development contexts perceive Ecosystem Services (ES). The main livelihood activity differed across these villages, which were either fishing, oil palm smallholder communities, or forest-dependent communities. Perceptions about ES varied across villages, though three services were perceived to be crucial in all four villages, namely fish provision, water quality, and land availability. These services can be a common concern entry point for discussions on landscape management. Despite common recognition of the negative impacts of oil palm development on these crucial services, all communities are nevertheless choosing to expand oil palm. Communities identified a wide array of direct and indirect drivers underlying this trend, including social influence, financial capital, ecological factors, and subsidies from local government. Early engagement of local policymakers, oil palm companies, and local communities is essential to the maintenance of crucial and widely recognized ecosystem services in oil palm landscapes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000355143",,"2624-893X",,"10.3389/ffgc.2019.00041","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/355143","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Beyond oil palm: perceptions of local communities of environmental change",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-07-25T08:42:30Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we use remote sensing and functional trait approaches—commonly used to understand plant acclimation to environmental fluctuations—to evaluate rainforest responses to an El Niño event at a site in northern Borneo. Spaceborne measurements (i.e. normalised difference vegetation index calculated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data) show the rainforest canopy greened throughout 2015, coinciding with a strengthening of the El Niño event in Sabah, Malaysia, then lost greenness in early 2016, when the El Niño was at its peak. Leaf chemical and structural traits measured for mature leaves of 65 species (104 branches from 99 tree canopies), during and after this El Niño event revealed that chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations were 35% higher in mid 2015 than in mid 2016. Foliar concentrations of the nutrients N, P, K and Mg did not vary, suggesting the mineralisation and transportation processes were unaffected by the El Niño event. Leaves contained more phenolics, tannins and cellulose but less Ca and lignin during the El Niño event, with concentration shifts varying strongly among species. These changes in functional traits were also apparent in hyperspectral reflectance data collected using a field spectrometer, particularly in the shortwave infrared region. Leaf-level acclimation and leaf turnover could have driven the trait changes observed. We argue that trees were not water limited in the initial phase of the El Niño event, and responded by flushing new leaves, seen in the canopy greening trend and higher pigment concentrations (associated with young leaves); we argue that high evaporative demand and depleted soil water eventually caused leaves to drop in 2016. However, further studies are needed to confirm these ideas. Time-series of vegetation dynamics obtained from space can only be understood if changes in functional traits, as well as the quantity of leaves in canopies, are monitored on the ground.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000358958",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab2eae","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/358958","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","El Nino||leaf greening||leaf trait dynamics||ground-based reflectance||tropical forests","Changes in leaf functional traits of rainforest canopy trees associated with an El Niño event in Borneo",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-08-16T02:20:38Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85072736719","000478754100004","Environ.

However, due to differences in topography and forest cover, the generation of snowpack outflow volumes and their contribution to streamflow are spatially and temporally variable during ROS events. In order to adequately predict such flood events with hydrological models, an enhanced process understanding of the contribution of rainwater and snowmelt to stream water is needed.  In this study, we monitored and sampled snowpack outflow with fully automated snowmelt lysimeter systems installed at three different elevations in a pre-Alpine catchment in central Switzerland. We measured snowpack outflow volumes during the winters of 2017 and 2018, as well as snowpack outflow isotopic compositions in winter 2017. Snowpack outflow volumes were highly variable in time and space, reflecting differences in snow accumulation and melt. In winter 2017, around 815 mm of snowpack outflow occurred at our reference site (grassland 1220 m a.s.l. – metres above sea level), whereas snowpack outflow was 16 % less at the nearby forest site (1185 m a.s.l.), and 62 % greater at another grassland site located 200 m higher (1420 m a.s.l.). A detailed analysis of 10 ROS events showed that the differences in snowpack outflow volumes could be explained mainly by rainfall volumes and initial snow depths.  The isotope signals of snowpack outflow were more damped than those of incoming rainwater at all three sites, with the most damped signal at the highest elevation site because its snowpack was the thickest and the residence times of liquid water in its snowpack were the longest, thus enhancing isotopic mixing in the snowpack. The contribution of snowpack outflow to streamflow, estimated with an isotope-based two-component end-member mixing model, differed substantially among the three lysimeter sites (i.e. between 7±4 and 91±21 %). Because the vegetation in our study catchment is a mixture of grassland and forest, with elevations ranging from 1000 to 1500 m a.s.l., our site-specific hydrograph separation estimates can only provide a range of snowpack outflow contributions to discharge from different parts of the study area. Thus, the catchment-average contribution of snowpack outflow to stream discharge is likely to lie between the end-member mixing estimates derived from the three site-specific data sets. This information may be useful for improving hydrological models in snow-dominated catchments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000322059",,"1027-5606||1607-7938","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/391374||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322059","10.5194/hess-23-2983-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/391374||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/392885","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Monitoring snowpack outflow volumes and their  isotopic composition to better understand streamflow  generation during rain-on-snow events",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-31T15:06:29Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hydrol.

An extensive literature review covering publications from 1970 to 2018 identified a prominent lack of studies, which (i) observed watersheds that are small enough to address runoff and soil delivery of individual land uses, (ii) were considerably smaller than erosive rain cells (<400 ha), (iii) accounted for the episodic nature of erosive rainfall and soil conditions by sufficiently long monitoring time series, (iv) accounted for the topographic, pedological, agricultural and meteorological variability by measuring at high spatial and temporal resolution, (v) combined many watersheds to allow comparisons, and (vi) were made available. Here we provide such a dataset comprising 8 years of comprehensive soil erosion monitoring (e.g. agricultural management, rainfall, runoff, sediment delivery). The dataset covers 14 adjoining and partly nested watersheds (sizes 0.8 to 13.7 ha), which were cultivated following integrated (four crops) and organic farming (seven crops and grassland) practices. Drivers of soil loss and runoff in all watersheds were determined with high spatial and temporal detail (e.g., soil properties are available for 156 m2 blocks, rain data with 1 min resolution, agricultural practices and soil cover with daily resolution). The long-term runoff and especially the sediment delivery data underline the dynamic and episodic nature of associated processes, controlled by highly dynamic spatial and temporal field conditions (soil properties, management, vegetation cover). On average, the largest 10 % of events lead to 85.4 % sediment delivery for all monitored watersheds. The analysis of the Scheyern dataset clearly demonstrates the distinct need for long-term monitoring in runoff and erosion studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000382779",,"1680-7340||1680-7359",,"10.5194/adgeo-48-31-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/382779","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Filling the gap between plot and landscape scale - eight years of soil erosion monitoring in 14 adjacent watersheds under soil conservation at Scheyern, Southern Germany",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-12-04T15:22:33Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adv. geosci.",,"Advances in Geosciences","48","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we try to assess whether the large lineage richness found in a New Guinean clade of mayflies (Ephemeroptera), namely the Thraulus group (Leptophlebiidae) could be associated with the recent orogenic processes, by applying a combination of phylogenetic, biogeographic and ecological shift analyses. New Guinean representatives of the Thraulus group appear monophyletic, with the possible exception of a weakly-supported early-diverging clade from the Sunda Islands. Dating analyses suggest an Eocene origin of the Thraulus group, predating by several million years current knowledge on the origin of other New Guinean aquatic organisms. Biogeographic inferences indicate that 27 of the 28 inferred dispersals (96.4%) occurred during the Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene, while only one dispersal (3.6%) took place during the Pliocene-Pleistocene. This result contrasts with the higher number of altitudinal shifts (15 of 22; 68.2%) inferred during the Pliocene-Pleistocene. Our study illustrates the role played by—potentially ecological—diversification along the elevation gradient in a time period concomitant with the establishment of high-altitude ecological niches, i.e., during orogenesis of the central New Guinean mountain range. This process might have taken over the previous main mode of diversification at work, characterized by dispersal and vicariance, by driving lineage divergence of New Guinean Leptophlebiidae across a wide array of habitats along the elevation gradient. Additional studies on organisms spanning the same elevation range as Thraulus mayflies in the tropics are needed to evaluate the potential role of the ecological opportunity or taxon cycles hypotheses in partly explaining the latitudinal diversity gradient.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000395465",,"2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2019.00233","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/395465","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Amplicon-sequencing||Altitudinal shifts||Freshwater insects||Tropical diversity||Thraulus","Biogeography and Ecological Diversification of a Mayfly Clade in New Guinea",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-29T13:24:16Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Adaptation measures have been identified in literature, but how these can be implemented remains unclear. Current certification programmes have the potential to provide guidance on how sustainability criteria can be addressed and taken up by farmers. We identify climate change adaptation options, their scale of application, and the necessary implementation steps. We show that implementation complexity strongly increases with the degree of climate change. With modest climatic changes, incremental adaptations might suffice, but more substantial climatic change will require radical social-institutional changes for adaptation uptake and interventions. For the majority of smallholders the implementation of any measure is largely constrained by a lack of access to knowledge networks and training material, organisational support, and (mainly financial) resources. A landscape approach that encompasses collective action and coordinated cross-sector planning can overcome some of these barriers. Certification approaches can facilitate a move in this direction. Yet, the implementation of transformative adaptations requires visioning, realignment of policies and incentives, and new market formations. This entails a repositioning and revision of certification schemes to allow for more effective adaptation uptake for the benefit of smallholders and the environment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000338567",,"1462-9011||1873-6416",,"10.1016/j.envsci.2019.03.017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338567","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Agroforestry||Coffee||Climate change||Landscape||Adaptation||Implementation","An innovation perspective to climate change adaptation in coffee systems",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2019-04-18T01:04:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85063767303","000470950000002","Environ.

In Madagascar, where corruption and political instability are rampant, forest regulations have been issued during the last 15 years to facilitate illegal rosewood exploitation. The current situation precludes non-detriment findings (under which the exporting State ensures that a proposed action will not be detrimental to the survival of a species) intended to enable sustainable use of standing populations, but the Malagasy government, backed by the World Bank, is promoting the sale of massive stocks of confiscated precious wood. We argue that allowing the sale of these stocks would encourage further illegal harvest. No suitable tools are available to identify, control or monitor standing trees or cut timber, and there are substantial knowledge gaps regarding species limits, population sizes, distribution and abundance. When combined with taxonomic confusion and weak governance, these factors necessitate uplifting all of Madagascar's precious woods to Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000340635",,"0006-3207||1873-2917",,"10.1016/j.biocon.2019.04.007","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340635","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Rosewood stocks||Timber trade||Precious timber||Trafficking||China||Africa||Forest regulations||Forest governance","Uplisting of Malagasy precious woods critical for their survival",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-05-04T01:12:07Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064571138","000472696400009","Biol Conserv",,"Biological Conservation","235","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As the implementation of these commitments happens within countries, different actors from global to local scales must negotiate the “what, where and how” of specific forest restoration projects. We interviewed actors at national, state and local scales to gather their narratives regarding barriers and strategies for upscaling forest restoration and compared the narratives among them and with those that prevail in the global literature on FLR. We based the local scale in four Atlantic Forest landscapes. We classified the narratives gathered according to three discourses commonly used in environmental policy arenas: (1) ecological modernization, advocating market solutions; (2) green governmentality, with its emphasis on technocratic solutions; and (3) civic environmentalism promoting governance. Brazilian legislation with its mandate of forest restoration in private lands appeared as the main restoration driver in the interviews. However, when political will for enforcement weakens, other strategies are needed. An ecological modernization narrative, around increasing funding, incentives, market and investments, prevailed in the narratives on barriers and strategies for all actors from the global to the local scales. Similarities nevertheless diminished from the global to the local scale. The narratives of national actors resembled those found in the global literature, which emphasize strategies based on increased capacity building, within a green governmentality narrative, and governance arrangements, a civic environmentalist narrative. These narratives appeared less at state scales, and were almost absent at local scales where forest restoration was perceived mostly as a costly legal mandate. Similar narratives across all actors and scales indicate that a focus on improving the economics of restoration can aid in upscaling forest restoration in Brazilian Atlantic Forest landscapes. However, discrepant narratives also show that inclusive governance spaces where the negotiation of FLR interventions can take place is key to increase trust and aid implementation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000358125",,"1999-4907",,"10.3390/f10070530","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/358125","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Forest landscape restoration||Discourse analysis||Governance||Perceptions||Brazil||Atlantic Forest","Narratives across scales on barriers and strategies for upscaling forest restoration: A Brazilian case study",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-08-13T08:51:23Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000482080800029",,"7","Forests","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We monitored emergence, characteristics, and survival of seedlings across ten tree species in temperate mixed deciduous forests of Central Europe over one and a half year. We tested whether the timing of emergence represents a trade‐off for seedling survival between minimizing frost risk and maximizing the length of the growing period. Almost two‐thirds of the seedlings died during the first growing period. The timing of emergence was decisive for seedling survival. Although seedlings that emerged early faced a severe late frost event, they benefited from a longer growing period resulting in increased overall survival. Larger seedling height and higher number of leaves positively influenced survival. Seedlings growing on moss had higher survival compared to mineral soil, litter, or herbaceous vegetation. Synthesis.

To this end, we present new paleomagnetic data from Jurassic and Cretaceous oceanic sedimentary and volcanic Large Igneous Province‐related rocks of the Nicoya Peninsula and Murciélago Islands of northwestern Costa Rica. We use these data, in combination with constraints from marine magnetic anomalies to infer the age of the lithospheric basement, seismic tomography to locate deep‐mantle plume generation zones, and general kinematic feasibility, to test different reconstruction scenarios connecting the Caribbean Plate to the Farallon Plate as restored from Pacific spreading records. Our resulting reconstruction implies that the western Caribbean subduction zone initiated around 100 Ma, in an intraoceanic setting, breaking up oceanic lithosphere of at least 70 Myr old.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000362546",,"2169-9313||0148-0227||2169-9356",,"10.1029/2018JB016369","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/362546",,"Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Caribbean||Mesozoic||plate tectonic reconstruction||Farallon||paleomagnetism||Nicoya","The Caribbean and Farallon Plates Connected: Constraints From Stratigraphy and Paleomagnetism of the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-09-05T03:22:34Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000481819500003","J. geophys. res.

The spread of non-native species adds to these uncertainties, particularly in forests recently colonised by novel tree species. To anticipate future forest composition, and thus the provision of ecosystem services, a thorough understanding of the factors influencing the establishment of non-native tree species is essential. We studied the presence and abundance of regeneration of Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle in 89 plots on a regular grid in three sites in southern Switzerland to determine the main drivers of its establishment. All sites are located in abandoned, i.e. currently unmanaged stands of Castanea sativa Mill. Propagule pressure is caused by single mature A. altissima that colonised the area ca 40 years ago. We found high rock cover, low litter cover and high light availability to be the most important predictors for the presence of A. altissima regeneration, whereas its abundance was positively influenced by high light availability, low litter cover and high browsing on regeneration of competing species. However, the presence models performed much better than the abundance models. Interestingly, the most important factors favouring the establishment of A. altissima in recently undisturbed sites were found to be similar in a nearby site after a severe forest fire, which suggests a similar establishment strategy after a disturbance as in recently undisturbed forests. Based on our results we expect a further expansion of the species in lowland forests currently dominated by C. sativa, likely controlled primarily by light availability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000349496",,"1619-0033",,"10.3897/neobiota.46.35722","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/349496","en","Pensoft Publishers","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Ailanthus altissima (tree of heaven)||browsing||Castanea sativa (sweet chestnut)||Gap Light Index (GLI)||invasive tree||light availability||litter cover||non-native tree||propagule pressure","Low litter cover, high light availability and rock cover favour the establishment of Ailanthus altissima in forests in southern Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-06-25T02:07:19Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000470918200001",,"46","Neobiota",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We consider one of those downgraded species, the giant panda, a bamboo specialist. Massive bamboo flowering could be a natural disaster for giant pandas. Using scenario analysis, we explored possible impacts of the next bamboo flowering in the Qinling and Minshan Mountains that are home to most giant pandas. Our results showed that the Qinling Mountains could experience large-scale bamboo flowering leading to a high risk of widespread food shortages for the giant pandas by 2020. The Minshan Mountains could similarly experience a large-scale bamboo flowering with a high risk for giant pandas between 2020 and 2030 without suitable alternative habitat in the surrounding areas.

Indeed, the largest beetle suborder, Polyphaga, mostly includes plant eaters among its approximately 315,000 species. In particular, plants defend themselves with a diversity of specialized toxic chemicals. These may impose selective pressures that drive genomic diversification and speciation in phytophagous beetles. However, evidence of changes in beetle gene repertoires driven by such interactions remains largely anecdotal and without explicit hypothesis testing.  Results We explore the genomic consequences of beetle-plant trophic interactions by performing comparative gene family analyses across 18 species representative of the two most species-rich beetle suborders. We contrast the gene contents of species from the mostly plant-eating suborder Polyphaga with those of the mainly predatory Adephaga. We find gene repertoire evolution to be more dynamic, with significantly more adaptive lineage-specific expansions, in the more speciose Polyphaga. Testing the specific hypothesis of adaptation to plant feeding, we identify families of enzymes putatively involved in beetle-plant interactions that underwent adaptive expansions in Polyphaga. There is notable support for the selection hypothesis on large gene families for glutathione S-transferase and carboxylesterase detoxification enzymes.  Conclusions Our explicit modeling of the evolution of gene repertoires across 18 species identifies putative adaptive lineage-specific gene family expansions that accompany the dietary shift towards plants in beetles. These genomic signatures support the popular hypothesis of a key role for interactions with plant chemical defenses, and for plant feeding in general, in driving beetle diversification.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000344939",,"1474-760X",,"10.1186/s13059-019-1704-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/344939","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Gene family evolution||Beetle-plant trophic interactions||Beetle diversification||Detoxification enzymes","Genomic signatures accompanying the dietary shift to phytophagy in polyphagan beetles",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-06-01T02:15:05Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85066041087","000468330900001","Genome Biol",,"Genome Biology","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite the wealth of soil radiocarbon data that has been reported over the past 75 years, the ability to apply these data to global scale questions is limited by our capacity to synthesis and compare measurements generated using a variety of methods. Here we describe the International Soil Radiocarbon Database (ISRaD, soilradiocarbon.org), an open-source archive of soils data that include data from bulk soils, or whole-soils; distinct soil carbon pools isolated in the laboratory by a variety of soil fractionation methods; samples of soil gas or water collected interstitially from within an intact soil profile; CO2 gas isolated from laboratory soil incubations; and fluxes collected in situ from a soil surface. The core of ISRaD is a relational database structured around individual datasets (entries) and organized hierarchically to report soil radiocarbon data, measured at different physical and temporal scales, as well as other soil or environmental properties that may also be measured at one or more levels of the hierarchy that may assist with interpretation and context. Anyone may contribute their own data to the database by entering it into the ISRaD template and subjecting it to quality assurance protocols. ISRaD can be accessed through: (1) a web-based interface, (2) an R package (ISRaD), or (3) direct access to code and data through the GitHub repository, which hosts both code and data. The design of ISRaD allows for participants to become directly involved in the management, design, and application of ISRaD data. The synthesized dataset is available in two forms: the original data as reported by the authors of the datasets; and an enhanced dataset that includes ancillary geospatial data calculated within the ISRaD framework. ISRaD also provides data management tools in the ISRaD-R package that provide a starting point for data analysis. This community-based dataset and platform for soil radiocarbon and a wide array of additional soils data information in soils where data are easy to contribute and the community is invited to add tools and ideas for improvement. As a whole, ISRaD provides resources that can aid our evaluation of soil dynamics and improve our understanding of controls on soil carbon dynamics across a range of spatial and temporal scales. The ISRaD v1.0 dataset (Lawrence et al., 2019) is archived and freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2613911.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000385703",,"1866-3591",,"10.5194/essd-2019-55","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/385703","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"An open source database for the synthesis of soil radiocarbon data: ISRaD version 1.0",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2019-12-15T18:59:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Earth syst. sci. data, Pap. open discuss.",,"Earth System Science Data Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Consequently, the local viscosity of the fluid also varies in space with a non-linear dependence on the Darcy velocity. Therefore, an effective viscosity μeff is usually used to describe the flow at the Darcy scale. For most non-Newtonian flows the rheology of the fluid can be described by a (non linear) function of the shear rate. Current approaches estimate the effective viscosity by first calculating an effective shear rate mainly by adopting a power-law model for the rheology and including an empirical correction factor. In a second step this averaged shear rate is used together with the real rheology of the fluid to calculate μeff. In this work, we derive a semi-analytical expression for the local viscosity profile using a Carreau type fluid, which is a more broadly applicable model than the power-law model. By solving the flow equations in a circular cross section of a capillary we are able to calculate the average viscous resistance ⟨μ⟩ directly as a spatial average of the local viscosity. This approach circumvents the use of classical capillary bundle models and allows to upscale the viscosity distribution in a pore with a mean pore size to the Darcy scale. Different from commonly used capillary bundle models, the presented approach does neither require tortuosity nor permeability as input parameters. Consequently, our model only uses the characteristic length scale of the porous media and does not require empirical coefficients. The comparison of the proposed model with flow cell experiments conducted in a packed bed of monodisperse spherical beads shows, that our approach performs well by only using the physical rheology of the fluid, the porosity and the estimated mean pore size, without the need to determine an effective shear rate. The good agreement of our model with flow experiments and existing models suggests that the mean viscosity ⟨μ⟩ is a good estimate for the effective Darcy viscosity μeff providing physical insight into upscaling of non-Newtonian flows in porous media.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000346883",,"2296-424X",,"10.3389/fphy.2019.00071","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/346883","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","non-newtonian fluids||porous media||flow profile||shear rate||effective viscosity","Determination of the Effective Viscosity of Non-newtonian Fluids Flowing Through Porous Media",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-06-12T02:09:33Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000469467800001",,,"Frontiers in Physics","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

However, gaps remain in our understanding of the isotopic relationships between the leaf waxes and the plants' source water. In this study, we investigated the influence of plant growth form, habitat and season on the distribution patterns and δ²Hwax values of 14 plant species (among which are two grasses, five trees and seven shrubs) sampled during four successive dry and wet seasons in three distinct habitats around Lake Chala in equatorial East Africa. Variation in δ²Hwax was analyzed with linear mixed-effect models and compared with the associated values of xylem water (δ²Hxylem), leaf water (δ²Hleaf) and biosynthetic hydrogen fractionation (εbio) (Figure 1). Our results show that plant growth form was the most important driver of modern-day δ²Hwax variability in the study area, and that differences in δ²Hwax between habitats to a large extent reflect the representation of the three major growth forms in those habitats. Individual plant species appear to express substantial species-specific isotopic fractionation that cannot be attributed to the tested external factors but rather seem to depend on intrinsic (e.g., plant phenological and biosynthesis-related) factors. For the purpose of calibrating δ²Hwax signatures against vegetation types, it is thus crucial to analyze representative samples of the plant communities present in the study area. Our results further indicate that paleohydrological studies in regions receiving rain from multiple moisture sources must take into account possible seasonal bias in the δ²Hwax signature relative to annual rainfall (Figure 1), due to unequal use of those moisture sources by the plants (De Wispelaere et al., 2017). Finally, the strong influence of plant growth form on δ²Hwax values argues for systematic evaluation of δ²Hwax variation in paleo-records in conjunction with independent proxy data on changes in vegetation composition. Differences in n-alkane distribution patterns (average chain length, carbon preference index and C31/(C29+C31) ratio) among trees, shrubs and grasses may provide such a proxy, and can be produced from the same leaf-wax n-alkane dataset used to determine δ²Hwax.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000394692",,"1029-7006||1607-7962",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/394692","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Influence of plant growth form, habitat and season on leaf-wax n-alkane hydrogen-isotopic signatures in equatorial East Africa",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2020-01-28T08:32:55Z",,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2019","April 7-12, 2019","Vienna, Austria",,"Sources and proportions of modern and aged organic carbon eroded from soils under different land-use within catchments in Nepal – Insights from compound-specific 13C & 14C analysis and novel mixing models","174300||174300","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Rückkehr CH Advanced Postdoc.Mobility",,,,,,,,"GRA",,"Geophysical Research Abstracts","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Our current understanding of both present and future carbon dynamics is limited because we fail to accurately represent soil processes across temporal and spatial scales, partly because of the paucity of data on the relative importance and hierarchical relationships between microbial, geochemical and climatic controls. Using observations from a 3000 ka soil chronosequence, we show how soil carbon dynamics are driven by the relationship between short-term biotic responses and long-term mineral weathering. We linked temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic respiration to biogeochemical soil properties through their relationship with microbial activity and community composition. In a final step, we tested if the dependencies of soil organic carbon dynamics on mineral properties can be translated into a model framework and help to improve SOC modeling on decadal to millennial timescales using a version of the soil weathering model SoilGen including the functionality of the multi-pool C turnover model RothC. We found that soil mineralogy, in particular changes in mineral reactivity and resulting nutrient availability, impacts the response of heterotrophic soil respiration to warming by altering carbon inputs, carbon stabilization, microbial community composition and extracellular enzyme activity. We demonstrate that biogeochemical alteration of the soil matrix (and not short-term warming) controls the composition of microbial communities and strategies to metabolize nutrients. More specifically, weathering first increases and then reduces nutrient availability and retention, as well as the potential of soils to stabilize carbon. We conclude that there is a great benefit of including geochemical rate modifiers in SOC models that can help to explain the varying importance of biotic and abiotic soil components along weathering and geochemical sequences.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000390573",,"1029-7006||1607-7962",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/390573","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Mineral weathering diversifies the response of soil carbon and microbial dynamics to warming",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2020-01-15T08:03:52Z",,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2019","April 7-12, 2019","Vienna Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"GRA",,"Geophysical Research Abstracts","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

With a population largely relying on agriculture, and high poverty and malnutrition rates continuously afflicting the country, farmers in Madagascar are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of the hunger gap, further putting pressure on already fragile ecosystems. Using a case study in the Alaotra region, we examine the seasonal trends of climate and agricultural resource dynamics, as well as characterize farmers’ experiences of and strategies used in response to the hunger gap, in order to assess how conservation may better consider the hunger gap to align its objectives with local needs. Results show that farmers are vulnerable to climatic events during a large part of the year, exacerbating the impacts of the hunger gap. The hunger gap appears to have varying degrees of impact on communities around Lake Alaotra, linked to factors such as road quality and agrarian structures—for example, land tenure and size of parcels—contributing to growing environmental degradation. We end by discussing various past and present responses aimed at improving the resilience of farmers of the Alaotra region, including improved accessibility, agricultural intensification, and conservation agriculture.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000344759",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su11072147","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/344759","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Food insecurity||Hunger gap||Seasonality||Livelihood||Adaptation||Madagascar","Biting the Bullet: Dealing with the Annual Hunger Gap in the Alaotra, Madagascar",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-05-30T02:16:45Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"AlaReLa Madagascar, the Alaotra Resilience Landscape","146852","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","r4d - Thematically Open Call",,,,,,,"000466551600324",,"7","Sustainability","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Soil C is composed of a complex mixture of organic molecules of varying sources, energy contents, and degrees of stabilization, and are cycled at different rates in soils. Thus the “age” of these molecules can be largely variable and widely distributed. Since management practices can modify both the amount of carbon that enters the soils and the rates at which C is cycled, we expect management practices to affect times scales of soil carbon cycling. In this contribution, we present results from a unique set of archived soil samples collected between 1959 and 2008 from a long-term pasture production study in New Zealand. Thirteen subsamples were analyzed for radiocarbon analyses, and a three-pool feedback model was fit to the data, which spans over 60 years. Such highly constrained models can accurately investigate differences in management effects on mean system age (MSA) and mean transit time (MTT). Management effects were observed showing significant differences in MSA and MTT across both irrigation and fertilization trials. In particular, we observed: 1) irrigated pastures have a large fast-cycling pool due to higher productivity in spite of lower system transit times. 2) Frequent irrigation decreases the amount of long-term stable C in pastures. 3) Despite no difference in soil C accumulation, fertilized pastures store C longer than unfertilized pastures. These results suggest a potential paradigm shift toward prioritizing management that promotes long-term storage of C above simple increases in soil C content, which could lead to more effective methods of addressing rising atmospheric C. Results from this study could be applied to systems that are lacking spatio-temporal resolution present here.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522423",,"1029-7006||1607-7962",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522423","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Fertilization and irrigation effects on the time scale of carbon cycling in New Zealand Pastures",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2021-12-28T17:46:38Z",,,,,,"no","EGU General Assembly 2019","April 7-12, 2019","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"GRA",,"Geophysical Research Abstracts","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Liana cutting is a management practice currently applied to encourage seedling regeneration and tree growth in some logged tropical forests. However, there is limited empirical evidence of its effects on forest demographic rates in Southeast Asia.  2. We used 22 four‐hectare plots in the Sabah Biodiversity Experiment (a reduced impact logging site) enrichment line planted with 16 dipterocarp species to assess the effects of complete liana cutting on tree growth and survival. We compared plots where lianas were only cut along planting lines (standard enrichment line planting) with those with one (2014) or two rounds (2011 and 2014) of complete liana cutting.  3. We found increased seedling growth following the first complete liana cut in 2011 relative to the enrichment line planting, consistent with previous studies. The response after 3 years to the cutting in 2014 depended on whether lianas had been previously cut or not: in twice‐cut plots, seedling growth was not significantly different from the standard enrichment planting controls, whereas growth in plots with only one complete cut in 2014 was significantly slower. Seedling survival decreased through time for both once‐ and twice‐cut liana treatments but remained stable in controls.  4. Sapling growth after the 2014 liana cutting showed a similar pattern to seedling growth, while tree growth following the 2014 liana cutting was significantly lower than controls regardless of whether lianas were cut twice (2011 and 2014) or once (2014).  5. Differences in response between the two rounds of liana cutting were likely due to changes in precipitation—2011 was followed by consistent rainfall while 2014 was followed by two severe droughts within 2 years.  6. Synthesis and applications. Our results generally support the widely reported positive effects of liana cutting on tree growth and survival. However, reduced growth and survival after the 2015/2016 El Niño suggests that drought may temporarily undermine the benefits of liana cutting in logged tropical forests. Managers of similar areas in SE Asia should consider halting liana cutting during El Niño events. In other tropical areas, seedling survival should be monitored to assess to what extent results from SE Asia are transferable.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000338556",,"0021-8901||1365-2664",,"10.1111/1365-2664.13335","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338556","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate change||forest conservation||forest restoration||liana||logged forest||plant–climate interactions||tree demography||tropical forest","Positive effects of liana cutting on seedlings are reduced during El Niño-induced drought",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-04-18T01:03:35Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Disentangling the effect of competition, facilitation and climate on community assembly","167760","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Rückkehr CH Advanced Postdoc.Mobility",,,,,,"85061064079","000467989500010","J.

Understanding the stability of buried C could be of key importance for the global C cycle, but factors controlling the stabilization of this buried SOC pool are not fully understood, especially the role of soil minerals in weathering sequences. Our study aims to investigate the effects of soil deposition on physical and geochemical SOC stabilization mechanisms along a mineralogical gradient. For this, we carried out SOC physical fractionation, incubation and soil mineral quantification experiments on soils from depositional settings. Our results show that, on average, depositional sites have the lowest total reserve in base (TRB) and hence have a more advanced weathering stage, relatively to stable sites. Significant correlations (p<0.001) between C:Mpy (pyrophosphate exactable C:sum of Al and Fe oxides) and TRB indicated that weathering can facilitate the chelation mechanism of SOC stabilization by creating organo-metal complexes. Relative to stable profiles, depositional profiles generally have a larger proportion of 2:1 expandable clay-sized minerals (smectite and vermiculite), which are characterized by high specific surface area, leading to organo-mineral C protection. Our results also showed that SOC fractions (micro-aggregates, aggregated silt & clay and coarse POM) were closely related (p<0.001) to poorly crystalline Al and Fe oxides, indicating that the presence of these oxides can control the formation of aggregates and influence C stabilization. However, due to continuous soil weathering in burial sites, reactive minerals will be transformed into less reactive forms over time and this may temporally limit SOC protection in buried sites.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000390577",,"1029-7006||1607-7962","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526242||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/390577",,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/533188","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Soil deposition and weathering interactively controlling the stabilization of soil organic carbon",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2020-01-15T08:09:54Z",,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2019","April 7-12, 2019","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,"106086941",,,"GRA",,"Geophysical Research Abstracts","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In spite of this, caterpillars with highly diverse life histories appear to lack resident microbiota. Gut physiology, endogenous digestive enzymes, and limited social interactions may contribute to this pattern, but the consequences of shifts in social activity and diet on caterpillar microbiota are largely unknown. Phengaris alcon caterpillars undergo particularly dramatic social and dietary shifts when they parasitize Myrmica ant colonies, rapidly transitioning from solitary herbivory to ant tending (i.e., receiving protein‐rich regurgitations through trophallaxis). This unique life history provides a model for studying interactions between social living, diet, and caterpillar microbiota. Here, we characterized and compared bacterial communities within P. alcon caterpillars before and after their association with ants, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR. After being adopted by ants, bacterial communities within P. alcon caterpillars shifted substantially, with a significant increase in alpha diversity and greater consistency in bacterial community composition in terms of beta dissimilarity. We also characterized the bacterial communities within their host ants (Myrmica schencki), food plant (Gentiana cruciata), and soil from ant nest chambers. These data indicated that the aforementioned patterns were influenced by bacteria derived from caterpillars’ surrounding environments, rather than through transfers from ants. Thus, while bacterial communities are substantially reorganized over the life cycle of P. alcon caterpillars, it appears that they do not rely on transfers of bacteria from host ants to complete their development.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000340605",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.5010","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340605","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","16S amplicon sequencing||butterflies||Lepidoptera||Lycaenidae||myrmecophily||Spiroplasma","Bacterial communities within Phengaris (Maculinea) alcon caterpillars are shifted following transition from solitary living to social parasitism of Myrmica ant colonies",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-05-04T01:08:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064824814",,"Ecol Evol","8","Ecology and Evolution","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Individual strategies, shaped by the hunters' values and expectations, are changing in response to the region's economic development, but they still face the contrasting challenges of poverty and overhunting. For conservation initiatives to be implemented effectively, it is crucial to take into account people's strategies with their underlying drivers and their adaptive capabilities within a transforming socio-economic environment. To uncover hunting strategies in the Colombian Amazon and their evolution under the current transition, we co-designed a role-playing game together with the local stakeholders. The game revolves around the tension between ecological sustainability and food security—hunters' current main concern. It simulates the mosaic of activities that indigenous people perform in the wet and dry season, while also allowing for specific hunting strategies. Socio-economic conditions change while the game unfolds, opening up to emerging alternative potential scenarios suggested by the stakeholders themselves. Do hunters give up hunting when given the opportunity of an alternative income and protein source? Do institutional changes affect their livelihoods? We played the game between October and December 2016 with 39 players—all of them hunters—from 9 different communities within the Ticoya reserve. Our results show that providing alternatives would decrease overall hunting effort, but impacts are not spatially homogenous. Legalizing trade could lead to overhunting except when market rules and competition come into place. When it comes to coupled human-nature systems, the best way forward to produce socially just and resilient conservation strategies might be to trigger an adaptive process of experiential learning and scenario exploration. The use of games as “boundary objects” can guide stakeholders through the process, eliciting the plurality of their strategies, their drivers and how outside change affects them.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000343592",,"2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2019.00034","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/343592","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","wildmeat||hunting||role-playing games||wildlife management||Colombia||indigenous||alternative livelihoods||companion modeling","Hunting in Times of Change: Uncovering Indigenous Strategies in the Colombian Amazon Using a Role-Playing Game",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-05-23T04:22:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000467393600001","Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We present a method to disentangle the various influences by performing a conservative-tracer test while sampling a stream section at various locations for chemical analysis of micropollutants. By comparing the outflow concentrations of contaminants with the tracer signal convoluted by the inflow time series, we estimated reaction rate coefficients and calculated the contaminant removal along a river section. The method was tested at River Steinlach, Germany, where 38 contaminants were monitored. Comparing day-time and night-time experiments allowed distinguishing photo-dependent degradation from other elimination processes. While photo-dependent degradation showed to be highly efficient for the removal of metroprolol, bisoprolol, and venlafaxine, its impact on contaminant removal was on a similar scale to the photo-independent processes when averaged over 24 h. For a selection of compounds analyzed in the present study, bio- and photodegradation were higher than in previous field studies. In the Steinlach study, we observed extraordinarily effective removal processes that may be due to the higher proportion of treated wastewater, temperature, DOC and nitrate concentrations, but also a higher surface to volume ratio from low flow conditions that favorizes photodegradation through the shallow water column and a larger transient storage than observed in comparable studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000331496",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.379","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/331496","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Micropollutants||Transfer function||(de)convolution||Photodegradation||Photo-independent degradation","Fate of wastewater contaminants in rivers: Using conservative-tracer based transfer functions to assess reactive transport",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-03-15T06:23:44Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000455039600120","Sci.

Dabei ist die Etablierung der Keimlinge aus Samen ein komplexer Vorgang, welcher von vielen Faktoren abhängt und bei einem Grossteil der Samen nicht erfolgreich endet. Für eine erfolgreiche Etablierung müssen keimfähige Samen an Stellen vorhanden sein, welche eine Keimung zulassen. Dabei spielen die räumliche Verteilung der Samenbäume als Samenproduzenten und die Eigenschaften des Keimsubstrats als Mikrohabitat wichtige Rollen. Um die räumlichen Zusammenhänge der Samenbäume und Keimlinge zu untersuchen, wurden Samenbäume in verschiedenen Waldbeständen an drei Standorten im Raum Zürich kartiert. In Kombination mit Keimlings- und Mikrohabitatsaufnahmen einer vorhergehenden Arbeit an denselben Standorten konnten die Zusammenhänge analysiert werden. Zusätzlich konnte mit den vorhandenen Daten das Keimbeet und die Wirkung des Mikrohabitats auf die Anzahl der Keimlinge untersucht werden. Von den 20 vorkommenden Baumarten im Gebiet wurde der Bergahorn (Acer pseudoplatanus), die Buche (Fagus sylvatica), die Esche (Fraxinus excelsior), die Fichte (Picea abies), die Hagebuche (Carpinus betulus) und die Tanne (Abies alba) genauer untersucht. Der räumliche Zusammenhang von Samenbäumen und Keimlingen wurde anhand von erstellten Samenbaumkarten, gemessenen Distanzen von Samenbäumen zu Keimlingen und der Wirkung der Basalfläche auf die Anzahl der Keimlinge untersucht. Anhand der Grösse eines Samenbaumes und der Distanz zu den Keimlingen wurde ein Samendichte-Index berechnet, welcher als erklärende Variable zur Vorhersage der Anzahl Keimlinge in generalisierten linearen gemischten Modellen (GLMM) verwendet wurde. Das Keimbeet der Baumarten wurde mit einer Hauptkomponentenanalyse untersucht und die Wirkung des Mikrohabitats auf die Keimlinge durch die Integration in den GLMMs analysiert. Die gefundenen Resultate zeigen, dass die Baumarten des Bestandes mit den Baumarten der Keimlinge grösstenteils übereinstimmen, obwohl es zahlenmässig starke Unterschiede zwischen den Baumarten gibt. Mit zunehmender Distanz vom Samenbaum nimmt die Anzahl der Keimlinge ab und dass dieser Effekt hängt mit den Eigenschaften der Samen zusammen. Das Keimbeet der untersuchten Baumarten kann beschrieben werden, wobei nicht für jede Baumart ein spezifisches Keimbeet charakterisiert werden kann. Mit den GLMM lassen sich Vorhersagen zur Anzahl der Keimlinge bei gegebenen Samenbäumen und Mikrohabitat in weiteren Beständen machen, welche als Hilfe bei der Waldbewirtschaftung gebraucht werden können.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438035",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438035","de","ETH Zürich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Räumliche Zusammenhänge zwischen Keimlingen und Samenbäumen an drei Standorten im Raum Zürich.",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,"2020-09-02T12:35:59Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted using a suite of impact models (for health, agriculture, biodiversity, land use, floods and forestry) across Europe with respect to changes in key climate and socio-economic variables. Depending on the indicators, aggregated grid or indicative site results are reported for eight rectangular sub-regions that together span Europe from northern Finland to southern Spain and from western Ireland to the Baltic States and eastern Mediterranean, each plotted as scenario-neutral impact response surfaces (IRSs). These depict the modelled behaviour of an impact variable in response to changes in two key explanatory variables. To our knowledge, this is the first time the IRS approach has been applied to changes in socio-economic drivers and over such large regions. The British Isles region showed the smallest sensitivity to both temperature and precipitation, whereas Central Europe showed the strongest responses to temperature and Eastern Europe to precipitation. Across the regions, sensitivity to temperature was lowest for the two indicators of river discharge and highest for Norway spruce productivity. Sensitivity to precipitation was lowest for intensive agricultural land use, maize and potato yields and Scots pine productivity, and highest for Norway spruce productivity. Under future climate projections, North-eastern Europe showed increases in yields of all crops and productivity of all tree species, whereas Central and East Europe showed declines. River discharge indicators and forest productivity (except Holm oak) were projected to decline over southern European regions. Responses were more sensitive to socio-economic than to climate drivers for some impact indicators, as demonstrated for heat-related mortality, coastal flooding and land use.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000333353",,"1436-3798||1436-378X",,"10.1007/s10113-018-1421-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/333353","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Impact model||Sensitivity analysis||Temperature||Precipitation||Population||Gross domestic product (GDP)","Determining sectoral and regional sensitivity to climate and socio-economic change in Europe using impact response surfaces",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-03-24T02:27:59Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85054518163","000461300900006","Reg Environ Change","3","Regional Environmental Change","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For this, the spatial and temporal variability of the isotopic composition of meltwater needs to be captured by the sampling method. This study compares an optimized snowmelt lysimeter system and an unheated precipitation collector with focus on their ability to capture snowmelt rates and the isotopic composition of snowmelt. The snowmelt lysimeter system consists of three individual unenclosed lysimeters at ground level with a surface of 0.14 m2 each. The unheated precipitation collector consists of a 30 cm-long, extended funnel with its orifice at 2.3 m above ground. Daily snowmelt samples were collected with both systems during two snowfall-snowmelt periods in 2016. The snowmelt lysimeter system provided more accurate measurements of natural melt rates and allowed for capturing the small-scale variability of snowmelt process at the plot scale, such as lateral meltwater flow from the surrounding snowpack. Because of the restricted volume of the extended funnel, daily melt rates from the unheated precipitation collector were up to 43% smaller compared to the snowmelt lysimeter system. Overall, both snowmelt collection methods captured the general temporal evolution of the isotopic signature in snowmelt.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000309952",,,,"10.2478/johh-2018-0007","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/309952","en","Walter de Gruyter GmbH","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Snowmelt lysimeter||Snowmelt collection||Snowmelt rate||Stable water isotopes","An Optimized Snowmelt Lysimeter System for Monitoring Melt Rates and Collecting Samples for Stable Water Isotope Analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-12-11T10:37:34Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000449717800003",,"1","Journal of Hydrology and Hydromechanics","67","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, quantifying lagged temperature effects on spring phenology is still challenging. Here, we aimed at investigating lagged and potentially non-linear effects of daily maximum temperatures on the probability of leaf unfolding in temperate woody species growing across large elevational gradients. We analyzed 5280 observations of leaf-out time of four tree species (European beech, horse chestnut, European larch, Norway spruce) and one shrub species (common hazel) that were recorded by volunteers over 40 years at 42 locations in Switzerland. We used a case-crossover sampling design to match leaf-out dates with control dates (i.e., dates before or after leaf-out), and analyzed these data with conditional logistic regression accounting for lagged temperature effects over 60 days. Multivariate meta-analyses were used to synthesize lagged temperature and elevational effects on leaf unfolding across multiple phenological stations. Temperature effects on the probability of leaf unfolding were largest at relatively short lags (i.e., within ca. 10 days) and decreased with increasing lags. Short- to mid-term effects (i.e., within ca. 10 to 20 days) were larger for late-leafing species known to be photoperiod-sensitive (beech, Norway spruce). Temperature effects increased for the broadleaved species (horse chestnut, hazel, beech) with decreasing elevation, particularly within ca. 10 to 40 days, i.e., leaf unfolding occurs more rapidly at low elevations for a given daily maximum temperature. Our novel findings provide evidence of cumulative and long-term temperature effects on leaf unfolding, whereby the efficiency of relatively high temperatures to trigger leaf-out becomes higher shortly before bud burst. These lagged associations between temperature and leaf unfolding improve our understanding of phenological responses across temperate woody species with differing ecological requirements that occur along elevational gradients.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000334321",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2019.00398","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/334321","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","phenology||conifers||broadleaved species||maximum temperature||distributed lag models||lag effects||multivariate meta-analysis||elevation","Daily maximum temperatures induce lagged effects on leaf unfolding in temperate woody species across large elevational gradients",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-03-28T08:13:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064230080","000462698000001","Front.

Here we test whether annually resolved tree-ring stable carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) isotopes can be used as proxies for reconstructing past NPP. Stable isotope chronologies from four sites within three distinct hydroclimatic environments in the eastern United States (US) were compared in time and space against satellite-derived NPP products, including the long-term Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS3g) NPP (1982–2011), the newest high-resolution Landsat NPP (1986–2015), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, 2001–2015) NPP. We show that tree-ring isotopes, in particular δ18O, correlate strongly with satellite NPP estimates at both local and large geographical scales in the eastern US. These findings represent an important breakthrough for estimating interannual variability and long-term changes in terrestrial productivity at the biome scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000325370",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-019-08634-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/325370","en","Springer Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Tree-ring isotopes capture interannual vegetation productivity dynamics at the biome scale",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-02-15T07:08:50Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85061576244","000458608500003","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Due to temporal dynamics in climate and vegetation activity, there are significant regional variations in carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between the biosphere and atmosphere in forests that are affecting the global C cycle. Current forest CO2 flux dynamics are controlled by instantaneous climate, soil, and vegetation conditions, which carry legacy effects from disturbances and extreme climate events. Our level of understanding from the legacies of these processes on net CO2 fluxes is still limited due to their complexities and their long-term effects. Here, we combined remote sensing, climate, and eddy-covariance flux data to study net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) at 185 forest sites globally. Instead of commonly used non-dynamic statistical methods, we employed a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), called Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) that captures information from the vegetation and climate’s temporal dynamics. The resulting data-driven model integrates interannual and seasonal variations of climate and vegetation by using Landsat and climate data at each site. The presented LSTM algorithm was able to effectively describe the overall seasonal variability (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE = 0.66) and across-site (NSE = 0.42) variations in NEE, while it had less success in predicting specific seasonal and interannual anomalies (NSE = 0.07). This analysis demonstrated that an LSTM approach with embedded climate and vegetation memory effects outperformed a non-dynamic statistical model (i.e. Random Forest) for estimating NEE. Additionally, it is shown that the vegetation mean seasonal cycle embeds most of the information content to realistically explain the spatial and seasonal variations in NEE. These findings show the relevance of capturing memory effects from both climate and vegetation in quantifying spatio-temporal variations in forest NEE.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000325091",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0211510","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/325091","en","Public Library of Science","CC0 1.0 Universal","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/",,"Memory effects of climate and vegetation affecting net ecosystem CO2 fluxes in global forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-02-14T03:49:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85061122422","000457874000068","PLoS ONE","2","PLoS ONE","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Quantitative studies on the importance of mortality submodels are scarce. We evaluated 15 dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) regarding their sensitivity to different formulations of tree mortality under different degrees of climate change. The set of models comprised eight DVMs at the stand scale, three at the landscape scale, and four typically applied at the continental to global scale. Some incorporate empirically derived mortality models, and others are based on experimental data, whereas still others are based on theoretical reasoning. Each DVM was run with at least two alternative mortality submodels. Model behavior was evaluated against empirical time series data, and then, the models were subjected to different scenarios of climate change. Most DVMs matched empirical data quite well, irrespective of the mortality submodel that was used. However, mortality submodels that performed in a very similar manner against past data often led to sharply different trajectories of forest dynamics under future climate change. Most DVMs featured high sensitivity to the mortality submodel, with deviations of basal area and stem numbers on the order of 10–40% per century under current climate and 20–170% under climate change. The sensitivity of a given DVM to scenarios of climate change, however, was typically lower by a factor of two to three. We conclude that (1) mortality is one of the most uncertain processes when it comes to assessing forest response to climate change, and (2) more data and a better process understanding of tree mortality are needed to improve the robustness of simulated future forest dynamics. Our study highlights that comparing several alternative mortality formulations in DVMs provides valuable insights into the effects of process uncertainties on simulated future forest dynamics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000331772",,"2150-8925",,"10.1002/ecs2.2616","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/331772","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate change impacts||forest dynamics||model comparison||mortality modeling||succession","Tree mortality submodels drive simulated long-term forest dynamics: assessing 15 models from the stand to global scale",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-03-17T03:29:14Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85062691972","000461577000033",,"2","Ecosphere","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Microfluidics offers a compelling approach to create controlled emulsions and microcapsules for these applications, but upscaling of this technology for the robust encapsulation of chemically diverse active ingredients is not yet demonstrated. Here, it is shown that microfluidic step emulsification can be exploited in upscaled glass devices to robustly produce monodisperse double emulsions and functional microcapsules in tandem at high throughput rates. The effect of geometrical parameters of the devices and the operating flow rates on the morphology, dimensions, and structure of monodisperse double emulsions is investigated and quantified using simple quantitative models. Using such double emulsions as templates, mechanoresponsive microcapsules that can be embedded in a soft matrix to generate damage‐reporting polymer parts that change color in areas subjected to excessive mechanical loads are created. Thanks to the chemical versatility and mechanical robustness of glass, this platform should enable the high‐throughput encapsulation of a wide variety of chemicals while providing the exquisite control achievable through microfluidics.",,,,"1616-3028||1616-301X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/319523||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/321640","10.1002/adfm.201806821","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322385","en","Wiley",,,"Double emulsions||High-throughput||Microencapsulation||Microfluids||Monodisperse||Step emulsification","Controlled Massive Encapsulation via Tandem Step Emulsification in Glass",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2019-01-24T15:01:03Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85058035937","000456216900015","Adv.

Apocynaceae is a clade of >5300 species with a worldwide distribution. A database representing >10 % of species in the family was used to explore the diversity of pollinators and evolutionary shifts in pollination systems across major clades and regions. Methods: The database was compiled from published and unpublished reports. Plants were categorized into broad pollination systems and then subdivided to include bimodal systems. These were mapped against the five major divisions of the family, and against the smaller clades. Finally, pollination systems were mapped onto a phylogenetic reconstruction that included those species for which sequence data are available, and transition rates between pollination systems were calculated. Key Results: Most Apocynaceae are insect pollinated with few records of bird pollination. Almost three-quarters of species are pollinated by a single higher taxon (e.g. flies or moths); 7 % have bimodal pollination systems, whilst the remaining approx. 20 % are insect generalists. The less phenotypically specialized flowers of the Rauvolfioids are pollinated by a more restricted set of pollinators than are more complex flowers within the Apocynoids + Periplocoideae + Secamonoideae + Asclepiadoideae (APSA) clade. Certain combinations of bimodal pollination systems are more common than others. Some pollination systems are missing from particular regions, whilst others are over-represented. Conclusions: Within Apocynaceae, interactions with pollinators are highly structured both phylogenetically and biogeographically. Variation in transition rates between pollination systems suggest constraints on their evolution, whereas regional differences point to environmental effects such as filtering of certain pollinators from habitats. This is the most extensive analysis of its type so far attempted and gives important insights into the diversity and evolution of pollination systems in large clades.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000322765",,"1095-8290||0305-7364",,"10.1093/aob/mcy127","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322765","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Apocynaceae||Asclepiadaceae||bimodal pollination system||biogeography||fly pollination||generalization||mutualism||phylogeny||plant–pollinator interactions||pollination ecology||specialization||stapeliads","The diversity and evolution of pollination systems in large plant clades: Apocynaceae as a case study",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-02-03T04:33:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85058056328","000462548600007","Ann Bot","2","Annals of Botany","123","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Results showed that regional species pool exerted a positive effect on the recovery ratio of species richness and this effect was stronger in selective cutting forests than that in clear cutting forests. We also found that temperature had a negative effect, and the shape complexity of forest patches as well as the percentage of forest cover in the landscape had positive effects on the recovery ratio of species richness.

Despite recent advances in our understanding of the physiological mechanisms leading to death, we still lack robust indicators of mortality risk that could be applied at the individual tree scale. Here, we build on a previous contribution exploring the differences in growth level between trees that died and survived a given mortality event to assess whether changes in temporal autocorrelation, variance, and synchrony in time-series of annual radial growth data can be used as early warning signals of mortality risk. Taking advantage of a unique global ring-width database of 3065 dead trees and 4389 living trees growing together at 198 sites (belonging to 36 gymnosperm and angiosperm species), we analyzed temporal changes in autocorrelation, variance, and synchrony before tree death (diachronic analysis), and also compared these metrics between trees that died and trees that survived a given mortality event (synchronic analysis). Changes in autocorrelation were a poor indicator of mortality risk. However, we found a gradual increase in inter-annual growth variability and a decrease in growth synchrony in the last ∼20 years before mortality of gymnosperms, irrespective of the cause of mortality. These changes could be associated with drought-induced alterations in carbon economy and allocation patterns. In angiosperms, we did not find any consistent changes in any metric. Such lack of any signal might be explained by the relatively high capacity of angiosperms to recover after a stress-induced growth decline. Our analysis provides a robust method for estimating early-warning signals of tree mortality based on annual growth data. In addition to the frequently reported decrease in growth rates, an increase in inter-annual growth variability and a decrease in growth synchrony may be powerful predictors of gymnosperm mortality risk, but not necessarily so for angiosperms.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000315307",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2018.01964","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/315307","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","tree mortality||Ring-width||Forest||Growth||Resilience indicators||drought||biotic agents||variance","Early-Warning Signals of Individual Tree Mortality Based on Annual Radial Growth",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-13T08:35:10Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Predicting growth-dependent tree mortality: a key challenge for population ecology","140968","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,,,,,"85062726358","000455109300001","Front.

Local engagement can also contribute to solutions for ecosystem management challenges by diversifying the range of options, and contextualizing their applicability. The benefits to local communities of ecosystem service-based policies for regulating industrial developments, such as oil palm industry growth, are therefore best understood from the perspectives of the local communities themselves.  The goal of my study was to assess land-use change in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, and to identify the causes and effects of the increasing expansion of the oil palm industry. I used various tools to explore how local communities perceive the changes to ecosystem services in an oil palm-dominated landscape. The research was conducted in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, between 2016 and 2018. In the following chapters, I present the details of my study. In Chapter 2, I examine community perceptions of environmental change. I used observations, focus group discussions (FGD), and interviews in four villages along the Belayan River, in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, to explore how ecosystems are perceived by local communities living in different oil palm development contexts. I also used a novel tabletop Role Playing Game (RPG) to understand how these communities make land-use management decisions to meet their livelihood needs. The game is presented in Chapters 3 and 4. In Chapter 3, I describe my RPG and assess its value as a research tool, and in Chapter 4, I present the details of how I used my RPG to gather information on the demographic factors that affect land-use changes.  Main livelihood activities differed across the villages, which were either fishing communities, oil palm smallholder communities, or forest-dependent communities. Perceptions of ecosystem services also varied across the villages, although three services were considered crucial by all four villages: fish provision, water quality, and land availability. These services can be a common-concern entry point for discussions on landscape management. Despite common recognition of the negative impacts of oil palm development on these crucial services, all communities are nevertheless choosing to expand the oil palm industry. The communities identified a wide array of direct and indirect drivers underlying this trend, including social influence, financial capital, ecological factors, and subsidies from local governments.   This was evident in the game sessions, where most players chose to expand oil palm land-use in their landscapes. Their decisions in the game provided us with an understanding of how and why land-use changes occur. Decisions were affected by the demographics of players, particularly concerning how they allocated their labour in the game. For example, ethnicity and livelihood were shown to affect the amount of paddy farming, ethnicity, and education were shown to affect oil palm expansion, and livelihood and gender were shown to affect land clearing.   In terms of land management, this study highlighted that every landscape has different types of actors that collectively affect land management decisions, which lead to oftendifferent land cover outcomes. I learned that the processes of planning and managing sustainable lands should be adapted to local contexts since the different actors have different characteristics, values, and perceptions for managing their land. Thus, to manage land more sustainably, it is necessary to include the more holistic knowledge of local communities, even though other factors, such as institutions (policy and social relations) and nature (climate change) are also drivers behind people’s land-use decisions. If crucial, widely valued ecosystem services are to be maintained in oil palm landscapes, it is essential to engage local people, along with policymakers and oil palm companies in the beginning stages of land-use policymaking processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429332",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429332","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Oil palm||INDONESIA (SOUTH EAST ASIA).

To address these challenges, we measured and partitioned ET with two subcanopy and concurrent above canopy EC towers in a montane forest at Sagehen Creek (California), having a pronounced Mediterranean climate. We analysed these paired measurements for 15 months and will present the spatial and temporal dynamics of this flux partitioning approach.

As atmospheric CO2 concentration increases, plants can reduce the opening of their stomata and still enhance photosynthesis. This CO2 fertilization effect can lead to increased growth but also to reduced transpiration rates, thereby contributing to warmer surface temperatures. There is ongoing debate on how these contrasting effects will influence our climate, in particular the contribution of forest ecosystems. It is however difficult to measure transpiration to understand these changes. Direct eddy covariance (EC) measurements are currently the best available approach to directly observe interactions linked to biosphere-atmosphere CO2 and water vapor exchange. While there are well-established methods to partition CO2 fluxes into the component fluxes of photosynthesis and respiration, there is still no standardized method to partition water vapor fluxes (evapotranspiration) into the component fluxes of evaporation and transpiration. In this study, we are using two years of concurrent below and above canopy EC measurements in a mixed deciduous forest in Switzerland to partition water vapor fluxes into the biological transpiration and physical evaporation. We compare our results with evaporation modeled with the Haghighi & Or (HO) model, and transpiration obtained from two models, namely the ecosystem demographic (ED2) and the Haghighi & Kirchner (HK) transpiration models, as well as derived from plot-level sap flow measurements. We found that transpiration accounted on average for 80% of evapotranspiration, emphasizing a considerably lower contribution from evaporation. Mid-afternoon reductions in transpiration were found during periods of high vapor pressure deficit in summer. Despite pronounced differences in environmental conditions during the observed years, evapotranspiration and its transpiration component had a low inter-annual variability in this mixed forest. These results suggest a reliable access of the trees to water resources and stomatal regulation in response to enhanced atmospheric evaporative demand. Our results show the potential of concurrent below and above canopy EC measurements to partition evapotranspiration in forested areas.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000370428",,"1029-7006||1607-7962",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/370428","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Partitioning evapotranspiration with concurrent eddy covariance measurements in a mixed forest",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2019-10-14T14:28:46Z",,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2019","April 7-12, 2019","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"GRA",,"Geophysical Research Abstracts","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Conventional georeferencing using ground control points (GCPs) provides reliable positioning, but the geometrical accuracy critically depends on the number and spatial layout of the GCPs. This limits the time and cost effectiveness. Direct georeferencing of the UAV images with differential GNSS, such as PPK (post-processing kinematic), may overcome these limitations by providing accurate and directly georeferenced surveys. To investigate the positional accuracy, repeatability and reproducibility of digital surface models (DSMs) generated by a UAV–PPK–SfM workflow, we carried out multiple flight missions with two different camera–UAV systems: a small-form low-cost micro-UAV equipped with a high field of view (FOV) action camera and a professional UAV equipped with a digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera. Our analysis showed that the PPK solution provides the same accuracy (MAE: ca. 0.02 m, RMSE: ca. 0.03 m) as the GCP method for both UAV systems. Our study demonstrated that a UAV–PPK–SfM workflow can provide consistent, repeatable 4-D data with an accuracy of a few centimeters. However, a few flights showed vertical bias and this could be corrected using one single GCP. We further evaluated different methods to estimate DSM uncertainty and show that this has a large impact on centimeter-level topographical change detection. The DSM reconstruction and surface change detection based on a DSLR and action camera were reproducible: the main difference lies in the level of detail of the surface representations. The PPK–SfM workflow in the context of 4-D Earth surface monitoring should be considered an efficient tool to monitor geomorphic processes accurately and quickly at a very high spatial and temporal resolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000364100",,"2196-632X||2196-6311",,"10.5194/esurf-7-807-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/364100","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Evaluating the potential of post-processing kinematic (PPK) georeferencing for UAV-based structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry and surface change detection",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-09-15T02:33:44Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85071869674","000484141900002","Earth Surf.

Their provisioning is increasingly challenged by rapid changes in climate and socio-economy, and the spread of non-native tree species. To ensure the continuous provision of ecosystem services, sound scientific knowledge on the potential of tree species to cope with and adapt to these changes is required. In this thesis, I focus on the ecology of the tree species Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle native to China, which was introduced to many continents, including Europe. Since the 1950s, the tree has spread in lowland forests in southern Switzerland that used to be dominated by Castanea sativa Mill. Chapter 1: Recent reports of regeneration of A. altissima in relatively undisturbed forests in southern Switzerland seemed to contradict the characterisation of the species as shade intolerant. Therefore, we studied the shade tolerance of juvenile A. altissima in six sites at various colonisation stages. Results indicate that A. altissima is more shade tolerant than early-successional Larix decidua Mill. and Pinus sylvestris L.. This was more pronounced for vegetative regeneration (i.e., root sprouts) that may profit from resources of canopy trees. Therefore, we conclude that A. altissima displays a low to intermediate shade tolerance in early regeneration. Chapter 2: The establishment of A. altissima has primarily been studied in managed forests or after a severe natural disturbance. Hence, we analysed the factors determining the presence and abundance of generative regeneration of A. altissima in forests that lack a severe, large-scale disturbance. It was found that high rock cover, low litter cover, and high light availability are the most important factors that determine A. altissima occurrence, whereas its abundance was positively influenced by high light availability, low litter cover, and high browsing on competing regeneration. The results of this study suggest that A. altissima will be able to further expand its distribution in lowland forests in southern Switzerland currently dominated by C. sativa. Chapter 3: Short-term growth reactions of trees to weather conditions can reveal growth optima and limits, and thus help to predict growth responses to climate change. To this end, we studied hourly stem growth of mature A. altissima and co-occurring C. sativa in two sites in southern Switzerland, comprising four years of continuous dendrometer measurements. The weather conditions in which the trees achieved highest hourly growth and conditions in which largest proportions of seasonal growth occurred were determined. A. altissima achieved highest growth rates and increased amounts of growth in warmer and drier weather conditions compared to C. sativa, especially in the site with lower interspecific competition. Hence, we conclude that A. altissima has a greater potential than C. sativa to cope with predicted future climate conditions. Chapter 4: Species that are able to establish and spread outside their native range are mainly analysed in the introduced range only. However, studies in the native range may increase the understanding of their success in colonising new environments. Hence, we analysed and compared radial growth patterns of A. altissima in both its native and non-native range in eastern China and southern Switzerland, respectively. Growth rates were similar despite lower amounts of growing season precipitation in China. Furthermore, negative correlations between annual radial growth and average seasonal temperature at the warmest site suggest that the growth of A. altissima starts to be limited by average growing season temperatures > 21 °C. These results confirm the findings of Chapter 3 as well as the high drought tolerance of A. altissima reported in other studies. Overall, I expect that the distribution of A. altissima will increase in southern Switzerland due to a rising propagule pressure and its tolerance of the warm and dry conditions expected under a changing climate. Furthermore, higher frequencies of disturbance events (e.g., fire or windthrow) and the expected further increase in mortality rates of C. sativa due to pathogens and drought may lead to greater dispersal opportunities for A. altissima. An increase in the distribution and density of A. altissima could, however, lead to a higher pathogen load, thus limiting the further spread of the tree. Non-native species are frequently viewed in a negative light (e.g., invasive or aggressive) hindering an objective assessment of their impacts. Thus, I advocate an ecosystem functions and services centred assessment, which is open to both positive and negative effects. Moreover, it is important to consider the socio-ecological context in such assessments, which may result in spatially diverse outcomes and management approaches. For example, a non-native tree species may be promoted for industrial wood production but suppressed in nature conservation areas. This thesis extends our knowledge of the ecological characteristics of A. altissima at different life stages. Thus, it adds to the fundamental understanding that is required to anticipate future scenarios of forest composition. This may then be used to predict the provisioning of ecosystem functions and services. Such predictions are a prerequisite for informed management decisions and practices.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000364287",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/364287","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Ailanthus altissima (tree of heaven)||Castanea sativa (sweet chestnut)||Non-native tree||Invasive tree||Shade tolerance||Colonisation||Gap Light Index (GLI)||Browsing||litter cover||Propagule presure||Point dendrometer||Maximum growth||Radial growth||Tree-ring||Climate growth relationship||Vessel lumen area||Wood anatomy","Tree of heaven or hell?

Yet, as global change could reduce the future effectiveness of existing PAs in covering high species richness, updating the boundaries of existing PAs or creating new ones might become necessary to uphold conservation goals. Modelling tools are increasingly used by policymakers to support the spatial prioritization of biodiversity conservation, enabling the inclusion of scenarios of environmental changes to achieve specific targets. Here, using the Western Swiss Alps as a case study, we show how integrating species richness derived from species distribution model predictions for four taxonomic groups under present and future climate and land-use conditions into two conservation prioritization schemes can help optimize extant and future PAs. The first scheme, the “Priority Scores Method” identified priority areas for the expansion of the existing PA network. The second scheme, using the zonation software, allowed identifying priority conservation areas while incorporating global change scenarios and political costs. We found that existing mountain PAs are currently not situated in the most environmentally nor politically suitable locations when maximizing alpha diversity for the studied taxonomic groups and that current PAs could become even less optimum under the future climate and land-use change scenarios. This analysis has focused on general areas of high species richness or species of conservation concern and did not account for special habitats or functional groups that could have been used to create the existing network. We conclude that such an integrated framework could support more effective conservation planning and could be similarly applied to other landscapes or other biodiversity conservation indices.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000332751",,,,"10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e00589","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/332751","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Conservation prioritization||Decision support tools||Land costs||Species distribution models||Switzerland||Zonation","Climate and land-use changes reshuffle politically-weighted priority areas of mountain biodiversity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-03-21T04:10:26Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85062841504","000465448800014",,,"Global Ecology and Conservation","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although it is commonly assumed that summer rainfall recharges plant-available water during the growing season, the seasonal origins of water used by plants have not been systematically explored. We characterize the seasonal origins of waters in soils and trees by comparing their midsummer isotopic signatures (δ2H) to seasonal isotopic cycles in precipitation, using a new seasonal origin index. Across 182 Swiss forest sites, xylem water isotopic signatures show that summer rain was not the predominant water source for midsummer transpiration in any of the three sampled tree species. Beech and oak mostly used winter precipitation, whereas spruce used water of more diverse seasonal origins. Even in the same plots, beech consistently used more winter precipitation than spruce, demonstrating consistent niche partitioning in the rhizosphere. All three species' xylem water isotopes indicate that trees used more winter precipitation in drier regions, potentially mitigating their vulnerability to summer droughts. The widespread occurrence of winter isotopic signatures in midsummer xylem implies that growing-season rainfall may have minimally recharged the soil water storages that supply tree growth, even across diverse humid climates (690–2068 mm annual precipitation). These results challenge common assumptions concerning how water flows through soils and is accessed by trees. Beyond these ecological and hydrological implications, our findings also imply that stable isotopes of δ18O and δ2H in plant tissues, which are often used in climate reconstructions, may not reflect water from growing-season climates.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000330413",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-23-1199-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/330413","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Seasonal origins of soil water used by trees",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-03-11T11:42:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85062389819","000460119000002","Hydrol.

Here I propose an ensemble approach to hydrograph separation that uses regressions between tracer fluctuations in precipitation and discharge to estimate the average fraction of new water (e.g., same-day or same-week precipitation) in streamflow across an ensemble of time steps. The points comprising this ensemble can be selected to isolate conditions of particular interest, making it possible to study how the new water fraction varies as a function of catchment and storm characteristics. Even when new water fractions are highly variable over time, one can show mathematically (and confirm with benchmark tests) that ensemble hydrograph separation will accurately estimate their average. Because ensemble hydrograph separation is based on correlations between tracer fluctuations rather than on tracer mass balances, it does not require that the end-member signatures are constant over time, or that all the end-members are sampled or even known, and it is relatively unaffected by evaporative isotopic fractionation.  Ensemble hydrograph separation can also be extended to a multiple regression that estimates the average (or “marginal”) transit time distribution (TTD) directly from observational data. This approach can estimate both “backward” transit time distributions (the fraction of streamflow that originated as rainfall at different lag times) and “forward” transit time distributions (the fraction of rainfall that will become future streamflow at different lag times), with and without volume-weighting, up to a user-determined maximum time lag. The approach makes no assumption about the shapes of the transit time distributions, nor does it assume that they are time-invariant, and it does not require continuous time series of tracer measurements. Benchmark tests with a nonlinear, nonstationary catchment model confirm that ensemble hydrograph separation reliably quantifies both new water fractions and transit time distributions across widely varying catchment behaviors, using either daily or weekly tracer concentrations as input. Numerical experiments with the benchmark model also illustrate how ensemble hydrograph separation can be used to quantify the effects of rainfall intensity, flow regime, and antecedent wetness on new water fractions and transit time distributions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000322303",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-23-303-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322303","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Quantifying new water fractions and transit time distributions using ensemble hydrograph separation: Theory and benchmark tests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-02-01T04:44:06Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060402006","000456247000001","Hydrol.

Information on past and future land use change and the resulting alteration of landscape service provisioning are valuable inputs for policy making and planning. Land use transitions in Switzerland (2009–2081) were simulated using statistical models informed by past land use changes as well as environmental and socio-economic data (1979–2009). By combining land use types with additional contextual landscape information, eight landscape services, based on both (semi-)natural and artificial landscapes, were quantified and investigated on how they would evolve under projected land use changes. Investigation of land use transitions showed region-dependent trends of urban expansion, loss of agricultural area, and forest regrowth. Landscapes cannot accommodate all services simultaneously, and this study sheds light on some competing landscape services, in particular (i) housing at the expense of agriculture and (ii) vanishing recreation opportunities around cities as city limits, and thus housing and job provisioning, expand. Model projections made it possible to pinpoint potential trade-offs between landscape services in a spatially explicit manner, thereby providing information on service provision losses and supporting planning. While future changes are presented as extrapolations of the patterns quantified in the past, policy changes might cause deviation from the projections presented here. A major challenge is to produce socio-economic and policy scenarios to inform projections that will differ from current landscape management. Given that urban sprawl is affecting many land surfaces globally, the approach used here could be generalized to other countries in similar situations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000371761",,,,"10.1057/s41599-019-0316-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/371761","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Assessing potential landscape service trade-offs driven by urbanization in Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-10-20T03:04:21Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85073231357",,,"1","Palgrave Communications","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we describe, present, and make available to the public two extensive data sets of stable water isotopes in streamflow and precipitation at the Plynlimon experimental catchments in central Wales. Stable isotope data are available at 7-hourly intervals for 17 months, and at weekly intervals for 4.25 years. Precipitation isotope values were highly variable in both data sets, and the high temporal resolution of the 7-hourly streamwater samples revealed rich isotopic dynamics that were not captured by the weekly sampling.  We used ensemble hydrograph separation to calculate new water fractions and transit time distributions from both data sets. Transit time distributions estimated by ensemble hydrograph separation were broadly consistent with those estimated by spectral fitting methods, suggesting that they can reliably quantify the contributions of recent precipitation to streamflow. We found that on average, roughly 3 % of streamwater was made up of precipitation that fell within the previous 7 h, and 13 %–15 % of streamwater was made up of precipitation that fell within the previous week. The contributions of recent precipitation to streamflow were highest during large events, as illustrated by comparing new water fractions for different discharges and precipitation rates. This dependence of new water fractions on water fluxes was also reflected in their seasonal variations, with lower new water fractions and more damped catchment transit time distributions in spring and summer compared to fall and winter.  We also compared new water fractions obtained from stable water isotopes against those obtained from concentrations of chloride, a solute frequently used as a passive tracer of catchment transport processes. After filtering the chloride data for dry deposition effects, we found broadly similar new water fractions using chloride and stable water isotopes, indicating that these different tracers may yield similar inferences about catchment storage and transport, if potentially confounding factors are eliminated.  These stable isotope time series comprise some of the longest and most detailed publicly available catchment isotope data sets. They complement extensive solute data sets that are already publicly available for Plynlimon, enabling a wide range of future analyses of catchment behavior.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000376095",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-23-4367-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/376095","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"New water fractions and transit time distributions at Plynlimon, Wales, estimated from stable water isotopes in precipitation and streamflow",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-11-08T03:33:15Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85074342314","000492842400001","Hydrol.

Our objective is to develop a data product that concisely quantifies the seasonality of stable isotope ratios in precipitation. We fit sine curves defined by amplitude, phase, and offset parameters to quantify annual precipitation isotope cycles at 653 meteorological stations on all seven continents. At most of these stations, including in tropical and subtropical regions, sine curves can represent the seasonal cycles in precipitation isotopes. Additionally, the amplitude, phase, and offset parameters of these sine curves correlate with site climatic and geographic characteristics. Multiple linear regression models based on these site characteristics capture most of the global variation in precipitation isotope amplitudes and offsets; while phase values were not well predicted by regression models globally, they were captured by zonal (0–30∘ and 30–90∘) regressions, which were then used to produce global maps. These global maps of sinusoidal seasonality in precipitation isotopes based on regression models were adjusted for the residual spatial variations that were not captured by the regression models. The resulting mean prediction errors were 0.49 ‰ for δ18O amplitude, 0.73 ‰ for δ18O offset (and 4.0 ‰ and 7.4 ‰ for δ2H amplitude and offset), 8 d for phase values at latitudes outside of 30∘, and 20 d for phase values at latitudes inside of 30∘. We make the gridded global maps of precipitation δ2H and δ18O seasonality publicly available. We also make tabulated site data and fitted sine curve parameters available to support the development of regionally calibrated models, which will often be more accurate than our global model for regionally specific studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000361965",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-23-3423-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/361965","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Global sinusoidal seasonality in precipitation isotopes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-09-03T02:30:26Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85071237132","000482005200001","Hydrol.

Since the 1950s, the species has progressively invaded forests in southern Switzerland. Despite the growing understanding of the specie’s ecology at the tree level, it remains uncertain how its presence will influence stand level dynamics as well as the structure, species composition and ecosystem functioning of forest. To tackle this knowledge gap, the long-term dynamics of natural and managed forest stands in southern and northern Switzerland were modelled under the current climatic conditions as well as a future climate scenario (RCP8.5). For this purpose, the species A. altissima was parametrized for the forest gap model ForClim and the model behaviour was evaluated with independent empirical data at four sites in southern Switzerland. Following this evaluation step, the long-term forest dynamics were simulated at a representative site in southern and northern Switzerland, respectively. The results show that A. altissima’s share in the basal area increased during the first 100 years of the simulation period. In the long-term (> 200 years) however, A. altissima did not gain dominance in any of the investigated scenarios. However, an increasing management intensity led to a rising share of A. altissima in terms of basal area. Furthermore, the tree species composition was less altered at sites with a higher species diversity, especially if those included species well-suited for future climatic conditions. Based on these results, it seems reasonable to assume that the abundance of A. altissima will increase locally and influence the tree species composition, particularly at managed sites. However, the species is not expected to be capable of a complete displacement of the indigenous tree species, but rather to become an additional admixed tree species. The results of this thesis further more emphasise the high potential of forest management to regulate the mixture proportion of A. altissima.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000588293",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588293","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), ForClim, long-term forest dynamics, Switzerland","The tree of heaven a threat or an opportunity for the Swiss forestry?",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,"2022-12-20T07:06:23Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, forest ecosystems are subject to manifold pressures and considered to be particularly sensitive to rapid climate change. A particular uncertainty remains in larger scale assessments (i.e., regional to national scale) due to the effects of local-scale drivers of climate change impacts (e.g., related to site-, species- and stand-specific responses), which is particularly important for forest management and planning.  Multiple dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) have been developed to analyze forest ecosystems and their dynamics. Among the various types of DVMs, forest gap models (FGMs) have been introduced to represent stand-scale dynamics as upscaled from individual tree behavior, thus allowing to represent uneven-aged, mixed-species stands. This renders them principally suitable to assess the future development of today’s forest stands under changing environmental conditions while accounting for site-specific factors.  Even though many ecological models strive for generality and realism, so far few FGMs have been applied across large areas (e.g., the national to continental scale). This may be due to parameterization problems and insufficient representation of underlying mechanisms. To overcome these issues, many models are (re-)calibrated locally or adapted structurally to reflect local conditions. Yet, such strategies tend not to increase a model’s general applicability across a broad range of conditions. Furthermore, model developments aiming at structural improvements typically focus on one single process. However, due to unaccounted process interactions, such efforts are at risk of ‘getting the right patterns for the wrong reason’ (i.e., missing ecological reality). Thus, recent pleas have been made to jointly revisit the ecological processes at the core of DVMs to increase the consistency of process interactions.  Using the state-of-the-art FGM ForClim, this PhD thesis aims to enhance the robustness of the projections for various fields of FGM applications (e.g., natural and managed forest stand dynamics) across a range of spatial and temporal scales. A particular focus was on the consistency of the simulated processes and their interactions. Specifically, these efforts were geared towards providing locally accurate climate impact assessments over large areas, representing a current research frontier in FGMs and DVMs in general.  In Chapter 1, I conducted a sensitivity analysis of the ForClim model to analyze model behavior and identify model components that deserve particular attention for reducing uncertainties of parameter estimates and/or improving process representation. Since the relative parameter influence may not be constant over time and likely varies with site conditions, stand structure and species composition, I analyzed the model’s parameter sensitivity at 30 representative sites across Europe and compared results for monospecific and mixed stands at two system states in time (i.e., early and late succession). Key parameters causing the largest variability in model outputs were related to tree establishment, the water and light regimes, growth and temperature, whereby the relative parameter influence of the latter strongly varied with local climate conditions. Moreover, model sensitivity differed between monospecific and mixed stands as well as between early and late successional stages, reflecting the differential influence of ecological processes with stand structure. In addition, model application at a European scale (i.e., far beyond the geographical range ForClim was originally developed for) pointed at model shortcomings. Since ForClim proved to be highly sensitive to water-related parameters across most of the European continent (Chapter 1) and accurately representing water limitations in DVMs is of utmost importance in view of climate change, I revisited ForClim’s water module in Chapter 2. Most DVMs explicitly model water availability based on a water balance with potential evapotranspiration (PET) as the main driver. I assessed the performance of ForClim’s water module, which includes the PET formulation by Thornthwaite and Mather (1957), by confronting simulated with observed monthly AET at forested FLUXNET sites. Further, I included alternative PET formulations in the comparison, particularly the one by Priestley and Taylor (1972) featuring a higher degree of mechanistic detail. The performance of the water module as applied in ForClim depended primarily on climate type independent of the PET formulation applied. I thus conclude that increasing the complexity of the PET formulation will hardly improve the estimates of water deficiencies at an annual scale in ForClim. Rather, more attention should be payed to forest-specific features in the context of the water balance, such as the representation of belowground and phenological processes, because most water balance models have been developed for agricultural applications.  In Chapter 3, I scrutinized the representation of ForClim’s core processes and the consistency of their interplay. I developed a set of alternative process and parameter representations for the core processes light availability, tree establishment, growth and mortality, based on ecological theory and diverse sources of empirical data. I applied a pattern-oriented modeling (POM) approach to test all combinations of the standard and alternative formulations (yielding 504 model versions) against a comprehensive set of empirical patterns for diverse model applications and a wide range of site conditions. I found that adapting one process in isolation can improve model performance for one specific application. However, the best model versions typically included more than one alternative process or parameter formulation. Thus, simultaneously considering multiple core processes is key for revealing internal inconsistencies in the model framework and model improvements. In this context, POM proved to be highly suitable to bridge various fields of model application and to compare model outputs with a broad set of patterns comprising diverse forest characteristics at different temporal and spatial scales. I conclude that the forest ecology community should make good use of the ever-increasing data availability and the POM framework to challenge the core processes of DVMs in a holistic manner. Finally, the increasing impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems have triggered multiple model-based impact assessments for the future, which however feature considerable uncertainty regarding local impacts over larger areas (i.e., regional to national scales). In Chapter 4, I aimed at bridging this gap by analyzing the climate change sensitivity until the end of the 22nd century for 71 typical managed Swiss forests. To account for various sources of uncertainty in the projections, the effect of eight different model versions (developed in Chapter 3) as well as alternative soil types and climate change scenarios were considered. The simulations showed substantial changes in basal area and species composition, with dissimilar responses to climate change across and within elevation zones. I identified the following stands as being most prone to negative climate-induced impacts: (1) stands in the sub-montane and low montane elevations zones and (2) stands located on poor soils in the high montane and subalpine elevation zones. The introduction of additional, more climatically adapted species partly mitigated the negative impacts of climate change, suggesting that admixing drought-tolerant species is advisable across all elevations to increase the resistance and resilience of forest stands to climate change. Yet, the large influence of site conditions and the choice of the forest model on some of the projections indicates that uncertainty sources other than the climate change scenarios need to be considered in impact assessments. By considering diverse sources of uncertainty, including structural and parameter-related uncertainties of the model, I was thus able to demonstrate their key relevance for an improved, evidence-based decision support in forest management under climate change. Throughout the thesis, I presented an approach to improve the robustness, accuracy and generality of FGMs, and demonstrated how to upscale climate-change impact assessments from the local to the national scale, which I believe are important steps in advancing the frontier of large-scale applications of FGMs. The insights from this thesis are furthermore relevant for other DVMs, especially for those that feature strong structural similarity with ForClim.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000397310",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/397310","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","forest ecology||ECOLOGICAL MODELS (ECOLOGY)||climate change||Forest gap model||sensitivity analysis||Morris screening method||Europe||Potential evapotranspiration||FLUXNET||pattern-oriented modeling||long-term forest dynamics||Establishment||growth||mortality||forest management||Species composition||Switzerland||uncertainty||Adaption||dynamic vegetation model||WALDBIOLOGIE + WALDÖKOLOGIE (ÖKOLOGIE)||MODELLRECHNUNG UND SIMULATION IN DEN UMWELTWISSENSCHAFTEN||Klimawandel","Towards robust projections of future forest dynamics: why there is no silver bullet to cope with complexity",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2020-02-06T10:17:17Z","2023-02-06",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"26061",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
