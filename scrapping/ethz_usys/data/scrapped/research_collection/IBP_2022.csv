Yet, relatively little is known quantitatively about the spatiotemporal structure of these variations. To address this gap, we use the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Wave and Sediment Transport (COAWST) model, to which we added the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling (BEC) model computing the biogeochemical processes in the water column, and a coral polyp physiology module that interactively simulates coral photosynthesis, respiration and calcification. The coupled model, configured for the north-shore of Moorea Island, successfully simulates the observed (i) circulation across the wave regimes, (ii) magnitude of the metabolic rates, and (iii) large gradients in biogeochemical conditions across the reef. Owing to the interaction between coral net community production (NCP) and coral calcification, the model simulates distinct day versus night gradients, especially for pH and the saturation state of seawater with respect to aragonite (Ωα). The strength of the gradients depends non-linearly on the wave regime and the resulting residence time of water over the reef with the low wave regime creating conditions that are considered as “extremely marginal” for corals. With the average water parcel passing more than twice over the reef, recirculation contributes further to the accumulation of these metabolic signals. We find diverging temporal and spatial relationships between total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (≈ 0.16 for the temporal vs. ≈ 1.8 for the spatial relationship), indicating the importance of scale of analysis for this metric. Distinct biogeochemical niches emerge from the simulated variability, i.e., regions where the mean and variance of the conditions are considerably different from each other. Such biogeochemical niches might cause large differences in the exposure of individual corals to the stresses associated with e.g., ocean acidification. At the same time, corals living in the different biogeochemical niches might have adapted to the differing conditions, making the reef, perhaps, more resilient to change. Thus, a better understanding of the mosaic of conditions in a coral reef might be useful to assess the health of a coral reef and to develop improved management strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591853","2296-7745",,"10.3389/fmars.2022.1004107","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591853","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","coral reefs||carbonate chemistry||Moorea||circulation||coral metabolism||biogeochemical niches||modeling","A space-time mosaic of seawater carbonate chemistry conditions in the north-shore Moorea coral reef system","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-12T08:10:59Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85145491397",,"000906483800001",,,"Frontiers in Marine Science","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

GLODAPv2.2022 is an update of the previous version, GLODAPv2.2021 (Lauvset et al., 2021). The major changes are as follows: data from 96 new cruises were added, data coverage was extended until 2021, and for the first time we performed secondary quality control on all sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) data. In addition, a number of changes were made to data included in GLODAPv2.2021. These changes affect specifically the SF6 data, which are now subjected to secondary quality control, and carbon data measured on board the RV Knorr in the Indian Ocean in 1994–1995 which are now adjusted using certified reference material (CRM) measurements made at the time. GLODAPv2.2022 includes measurements from almost 1.4 million water samples from the global oceans collected on 1085 cruises. The data for the now 13 GLODAP core variables (salinity, oxygen, nitrate, silicate, phosphate, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, pH, chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11), CFC-12, CFC-113, CCl4, and SF6) have undergone extensive quality control with a focus on systematic evaluation of bias. The data are available in two formats: (i) as submitted by the data originator but converted to World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) exchange format and (ii) as a merged data product with adjustments applied to minimize bias. For the present annual update, adjustments for the 96 new cruises were derived by comparing those data with the data from the 989 quality-controlled cruises in the GLODAPv2.2021 data product using crossover analysis. SF6 data from all cruises were evaluated by comparison with CFC-12 data measured on the same cruises. For nutrients and ocean carbon dioxide (CO2) chemistry comparisons to estimates based on empirical algorithms provided additional context for adjustment decisions. The adjustments that we applied are intended to remove potential biases from errors related to measurement, calibration, and data handling practices without removing known or likely time trends or variations in the variables evaluated. The compiled and adjusted data product is believed to be consistent to better than 0.005 in salinity, 1 % in oxygen, 2 % in nitrate, 2 % in silicate, 2 % in phosphate, 4 µmol kg−1 in dissolved inorganic carbon, 4 µmol kg−1 in total alkalinity, 0.01–0.02 in pH (depending on region), and 5 % in the halogenated transient tracers. The other variables included in the compilation, such as isotopic tracers and discrete CO2 fugacity (f CO2), were not subjected to bias comparison or adjustments. The original data, their documentation, and DOI codes are available at the Ocean Carbon and Acidification Data System of NOAA NCEI (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/ocean-carbon-acidification-data-system/oceans/GLODAPv2_2022/, last access: 15 August 2022). This site also provides access to the merged data product, which is provided as a single global file and as four regional ones – the Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans – under https://doi.org/10.25921/1f4w-0t92 (Lauvset et al., 2022). These bias-adjusted product files also include significant ancillary and approximated data, which were obtained by interpolation of, or calculation from, measured data. This living data update documents the GLODAPv2.2022 methods and provides a broad overview of the secondary quality control procedures and results.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000593415","1866-3516||1866-3508",,"10.5194/essd-14-5543-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/593415","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"GLODAPv2.2022: the latest version of the global interior ocean biogeochemical data product","Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-18T15:13:13Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"126784100",,,"000901153400001","Earth syst. sci. data","12","Earth System Science Data","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Interactions between these SRO mineral phases and soil organic carbon (OC) promote long-term stabilization of the latter through the formation of mineral-organic complexes and aggregates. However, Icelandic soils are also exposed to high rainfall events, which induce anoxic conditions, facilitate microbial reduction of ferric Fe, and may lead to the mobilization of mineral-associated OC. Here, we explored the fate of OC during Fe redox cycling by incubating six organic-rich soil horizons from three typical soil types across Iceland (Histosols, Histic and Gleyic Andosols) as soil slurries under anoxic conditions for up to 5 weeks and followed the effects of re-oxidation after 1, 2, and 5 weeks. Changes in solid-phase Fe speciation were assessed by combining Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy with time-resolved parallel selective chemical extractions, and trends in aqueous element contents were measured in both the dissolved (<3 kDa) and fine colloidal fractions (3 kDa to 0.45 µm). In all soils, anoxic incubation resulted in microbial reduction of Fe(III) and concomitant increases in soil solution pH. However, soils containing SRO Fe minerals underwent more extensive Fe reduction. Rapid (<1 wk) increases in aqueous element contents (including Fe, Al, and OC) were recorded in all soil slurries, and mobilization of colloids occurred in soil horizons which reached the highest pH values (>4.6). Mobilized colloids persisted during re-oxidation of the soil slurries, which also resulted in the formation of new Fe mineral phases, the composition of which was influenced by initial soil Fe mineralogy. Collectively, our results suggest that increases in the frequency of redox cycles in Icelandic soils are likely to result in shifts in Fe mineralogy and may contribute to the increased mobilization of soil OC as organic-Fe-/Al-colloids.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000582238","0016-7061||1872-6259",,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.116217","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/582238","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Iceland||Iron biogeochemistry||Organic carbon||Colloids||Wetlands","Iron speciation changes and mobilization of colloids during redox cycling in Fe-rich, Icelandic peat soils","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-22T04:08:09Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Iron mineral dynamics in redox-affected soils and sediments: Pushing the frontier toward in-situ studies","788009","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85140331644",,"000919522500003","Geoderma",,"Geoderma","428","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Understanding NP uptake and depuration in marine organisms intended for human consumption is imperative for food safety, but until now it has been limited due to analytical constraints. Oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were exposed to polystyrene NPs doped with palladium (Pd), allowing the measurements of their uptake into tissues by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) combined with electron microscopy. Oysters were exposed for 6 days (d) to “Smooth” or “Raspberry” NPs, followed by 30 d of depuration with the aim of assessing the NP concentration in C. gigas following exposure, inferring the accumulation and elimination rates, and understanding the clearance of Pd NPs during the depuration period. After 6 d, the most significant accumulation was found in the digestive gland (106.6 and 135.3 μg g–1 dw, for Smooth and Raspberry NPs, respectively) and showed the most evident depuration (elimination rate constant KSmooth = 2 d–1 and KRaspberry = 0.2 d–1). Almost complete depuration of the Raspberry NPs occurred after 30 d. While a post-harvesting depuration period of 24–48 h for oysters could potentially reduce the NP content by 75%, more research to validate these findings, including depuration studies of oysters from the field, is required to inform practices to reduce human exposure through consumption.",,,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.2c02269","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/581517","en","American Chemical Society",,,"Bivalves||Nanoplastics||Biaccumulation||Food safety||Molluscs","Short Depuration of Oysters Intended for Human Consumption Is Effective at Reducing Exposure to Nanoplastics","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-11-18T07:40:53Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)","186856","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Eccellenza",,,"85142662888",,"000886691600001","Environ.

We suggest aerial imagery and videos, captured by drones, to be ""boundary objects "", easily interpretable landscape representations that might create a common understanding across stakeholders through their universal interpretability. We collected drone imagery and videos from different angles of a wide range of landscapes in Zambia, showing agricultural areas, forests, wetlands and water infrastructure. Then, we took the imagery back to the field to probe the perceptions of multiple stakeholders, including staff from both governmental and non-governmental organizations, hydropower operators, small-and large-scale farmers. In focus group discussions, we assessed the interpretability of oblique images, taken at an angle by a video drone, compared to nadir (vertical) imagery from Google Earth and from a high-end mapping drone. We show that oblique images produced better identification results across all groups of stakeholders, but especially from small-scale farmers, suggesting this type of imagery is helpful to empower people who lack previous experience in interpreting nadir images. Overall, the appreciation of the aesthetic value and the perceived professional benefits of drone imagery are high, but technical and legal barriers impede a wider adoption of the technology. While we highlight ethical concerns and technical limitations, we suggest that conservationists and environmental planners could benefit from a critical use of affordable video drones so as to produce intuitive landscape representations useful for more effective multi-stakeholder collaborations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000570829","0169-2046||1872-6062","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575176||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/570829","10.1016/j.landurbplan.2022.104571","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575308","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Drone imagery to create a common understanding of landscapes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-15T11:36:27Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,"85138056378",,"000861576400001","Landsc. urban plan.",,"Landscape and Urban Planning","228","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Since then, this exchange of information on chemicals that are expected to occur in the environment, along with the accompanying expert knowledge and references, has become a valuable knowledge base for ""suspect screening"" lists. The NORMAN-SLE now serves as a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) chemical information resource worldwide. Results: The NORMAN-SLE contains 99 separate suspect list collections (as of May 2022) from over 70 contributors around the world, totalling over 100,000 unique substances. The substance classes include per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pharmaceuticals, pesticides, natural toxins, high production volume substances covered under the European REACH regulation (EC: 1272/2008), priority contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) and regulatory lists from NORMAN partners. Several lists focus on transformation products (TPs) and complex features detected in the environment with various levels of provenance and structural information. Each list is available for separate download. The merged, curated collection is also available as the NORMAN Substance Database (NORMAN SusDat). Both the NORMAN-SLE and NORMAN SusDat are integrated within the NORMAN Database System (NDS). The individual NORMAN-SLE lists receive digital object identifiers (DOIs) and traceable versioning via a Zenodo community (https://zenodo.org/communities/norman-.sle), with a total of > 40,000 unique views, > 50,000 unique downloads and 40 citations (May 2022). NORMAN-SLE content is progressively integrated into large open chemical databases such as PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the US EPA's CompTox Chemicals Dashboard (https://comptox. epa.gov/dashboard/), enabling further access to these lists, along with the additional functionality and calculated properties these resources offer. PubChem has also integrated significant annotation content from the NORMAN-SLE, including a classification browser (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/classification/#hid=101). Conclusions: The NORMAN-SLE offers a specialized service for hosting suspect screening lists of relevance for the environmental community in an open, FAIR manner that allows integration with other major chemical resources. These efforts foster the exchange of information between scientists and regulators, supporting the paradigm shift to the ""one substance, one assessment"" approach.

However, little is known about their environmental impacts in the atmosphere. MnPs could act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) or ice-nucleating particles (INPs), affecting cloud formation processes. In sufficient quantities, they could change the cloud albedo, precipitation and lifetime, collectively impacting the Earth’s radiation balance and climate. In this Perspective, we evaluate the potential impact of MnPs on cloud formation by assessing their ability to act as CCN or INPs. Based on an analysis of their physicochemical properties, we propose that MnPs can act as INPs and potentially as CCN after environmental aging processes such as photochemical weathering and the sorption of macromolecules or trace soluble species onto the particle surface. The actual climate impact(s) of MnPs depend on their abundance relative to other aerosols. The concentration of MnPs in the atmosphere is currently low, so they are unlikely to make a substantial contribution to radiative forcing in regions exposed to other aerosols, either from natural sources or anthropogenic pollution. Nevertheless, MnPs will potentially cause non-negligible perturbations in unpolluted remote or marine clouds and generate local climate impacts, particularly in view of an increase in the release of MnPs to the environment in the future. Further measurements, coupled with better characterization of the physiochemical properties of MnPs, will enable a more accurate assessment of the climate impacts of MnPs acting as INPs and CCN.",,,"1752-0908||1752-0894",,"10.1038/s41561-022-01051-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580671","en","Nature",,,"Atmospheric science||Environmental sciences","Potential impacts of atmospheric microplastics and nanoplastics on cloud formation processes","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-11-15T07:25:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)","186856","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Eccellenza",,,"85141958889",,"000883294100004","Nat.

This study provides an estimation of the age and source of the contamination by using XRF core scanning, ICP-OES, and Hg-AFS for quantitative measurements of trace metals and MC-ICP-MS for the stable isotope analysis of mercury. Radiometric dating (137Cs, 210Pb, and Pu dating) of two proximal cores and varve chronology in a distal core suggest two different contaminations, one stemming from around 1960 (Zn, Cd) and an earlier one from 1880 (Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Sn). The XRF data suggest two different contamination pathways: one by landfill of contaminated soil and another one by industrial wastewater effluents. Maximum concentrations found within all samples are in the range of per mil (dry weight) for Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Sn, and Zn and lie within the top 10 cm of the sediment cores. The analysis of the mercury isotopic composition (δ202Hg and Δ199Hg) shows a significantly different signature for one of the cores, indicating a second mercury source. We could not identify the exact source or process leading to the isotopic fractionation of mercury, but the isotopic data confirm two different sources.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557042","0944-1344||1614-7499",,"10.1007/s11356-022-21288-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557042","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Heavy metals||Lake sediment||Multi-proxy approach||Industrial pollution||Mercury||Stable mercury isotopes||Lake Zurich||Switzerland||Toxic metals||Trace metals","Tracking the legacy of early industrial activity in sediments of Lake Zurich, Switzerland: using a novel multi-proxy approach to find the source of extensive metal contamination","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-09T11:25:38Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85133182152",,"000818647300005","Environ Sci Pollut Res","57","Environmental Science and Pollution Research","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02330 - Dep.

Unlike crustacean zooplankton (e.g., copepods) that feed on preys that are an order of magnitude smaller, filter-feeding allows FFGM to have access to a wider range of organisms, with predator over prey ratios as high as 105 : 1. In addition, most FFGM produce carcasses and/or fecal pellets that sink 10 times faster than those of copepods. This implies a rapid and efficient export of organic matter to depth. Even if these organisms represent <5 % of the overall planktonic biomass, the induced organic matter flux could be substantial. Here we present a first estimate of the influence of FFGM organisms on the export of particulate organic matter to the deep ocean based on the marine biogeochemical model NEMO-PISCES. In this new version of PISCES, two processes characterize FFGM: the preference for small organisms due to filter feeding, and the rapid sinking of carcasses and fecal pellets. To evaluate our modeled FFGM distribution, we compiled FFGM abundance observations into a monthly biomass climatology using a taxon-specific conversion. A model-observation comparison supports the model ability to quantify the global and large-scale patterns of FFGM biomass distribution, but reveals an urgent need to better understand the factors triggering the boom-and-bust FFGM dynamics before we can reproduce the observed spatio-temporal variability of FFGM. FFGM contribute strongly to carbon export at depth (0.4 Pg C yr-1 at 1000 m), particularly in low-productivity region (up to 40 % of organic carbon export at 1000 m) where they dominate macrozooplankton by a factor of 2. The FFGM-induced export increases in importance with depth, with a simulated transfer efficiency close to one.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594829",,,"10.5194/egusphere-2022-1282","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594829","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Including filter-feeding gelatinous macrozooplankton in a global marine biogeochemical model: model-data comparison and impact on the ocean carbon cycle","Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2023-01-25T13:22:49Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Atlantic ECOsystems assessment, forecasting & sustainability||Our common future ocean – quantifying coupled cycles of carbon, oxygen, and nutrients for determining and achieving safe operating spaces with respect to tipping points||Earth system models for the future","862923||820989||101003536","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC||EC","H2020||H2020||H2020",,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These data demonstrate isotope fractionation during incomplete (non-quantitative) reduction and removal of Cr above the chemocline, driving isotopically light Cr accumulation in euxinic deep waters. Sediment authigenic Cr is isotopically distinct from overlying waters but comparable to average continental crust. New and published data from other redox-stratified basins show analogous patterns. This challenges assumptions from δ53Cr paleoredox applications that quantitative Cr reduction and removal limits isotope fractionation.

To determine whether 1O2 can be a competitive atmospheric oxidant, we must first quantify its production in organic aerosols (OA). Here, we report the spatiotemporal distribution of 1O2 over a 1-year dataset of PM10 extracts at two locations in Switzerland, representing a rural and suburban site. Using a chemical probe technique, we measured 1O2 steady-state concentrations with a seasonality over an order of magnitude peaking in wintertime at 4.59 ± 0.01 × 10–13 M and with a quantum yield of up to 2%. Next, we identified biomass burning and anthropogenic secondary OA (SOA) as the drivers for 1O2 formation in the PM10 aqueous extracts using source apportionment data. Importantly, the quantity, the amount of brown carbon present in PM10, and the quality, the chemical composition of the brown carbon present, influence the concentration of 1O2 sensitized in each extract. Anthropogenic SOA in the extracts were 4 times more efficient in sensitizing 1O2 than primary biomass burning aerosols. Last, we developed an empirical fit to estimate 1O2 concentrations based on PM10 components, unlocking the ability to estimate 1O2 from existing source apportionment data. Overall, 1O2 is likely a competitive photo-oxidant in PM10 since 1O2 is sensitized by ubiquitous biomass burning OA and anthropogenic SOA.",,,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.2c04554","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/579835","en","American Chemical Society",,,"Singlet oxygen||Brown carbon||Photochemistry||Organic aerosols||Atmospheric chemistry","Singlet Oxygen Seasonality in Aqueous PM10 is Driven by Biomass Burning and Anthropogenic Secondary Organic Aerosol","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-11-07T13:25:43Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85141475278",,"000885924700001","Environ.

Despite the chemical similarity of selenium to the two more abundantly studied elements sulfur and arsenic, the understanding of its accumulation in soils and availability for plants is limited. The lack of understanding of soil selenium cycling is largely due to the unavailability of methods to characterize selenium species in soils, especially the organic ones. Here we develop a size-resolved multi-elemental method using liquid chromatography and elemental mass spectrometry, which enables an advanced characterization of selenium, sulfur, and arsenic species in soil extracts. We apply the analytical approach to soils sampled along the Kohala rainfall gradient on Big Island (Hawaii), which cover a large range of organic carbon and (oxy)hydroxides contents. Similarly to sulfur but contrarily to arsenic, a large fraction of selenium is found associated with organic matter in these soils. However, while sulfur and arsenic are predominantly found as oxyanions in water extracts, selenium mainly exists as small hydrophilic organic compounds. Combining Kohala soil speciation data with concentrations in parent rock and plants further suggests that selenium association with organic matter limits its mobility in soils and availability for plants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000582554","2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-022-34731-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/582554","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Understanding soil selenium accumulation and bioavailability through size resolved and elemental characterization of soil extracts","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-23T05:11:20Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Forms and dynamics of soil phosphorus along a climosequence on basalt-derived soils (CLIMP)","162422","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85141867403",,"000884426700018","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the conceptual and methodological frameworks for aquatic eDNA detection and interpretation were developed primarily in freshwater environments and have not been well established for estuaries and marine environments that are by nature dynamic, turbid, and hydrologically complex. Environmental context and species life history are critical for successful application of eDNA methods, and the challenges associated with eDNA detection in estuaries were the subject of a symposium held at the University of California Davis on January 29, 2020 (https:// marinescie nce.ucdavis. edu/engagement/past-events/edna). Here, we elaborate upon topics addressed in the symposium to evaluate eDNA methods in the context of monitoring and biodiversity studies in estuaries. We first provide a concise overview of eDNA science and methods, and then examine the San Francisco Estuary (SFE) as a case study to illustrate how eDNA detection can complement traditional monitoring programs and provide regional guidance on future potential eDNA applications. Additionally, we offer recommendations for enhancing communication between eDNA scientists and natural resource managers, which is essential for integrating eDNA methods into existing monitoring programs. Our intent is to create a resource that is accessible to those outside the field of eDNA, especially managers, without oversimplifying the challenges or advantages of these methods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000555953","1559-2731||1559-2723",,"10.1007/s12237-022-01080-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/555953","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biodiversity||Environmental DNA||Estuary||Invasive species||Monitoring||San Francisco Estuary","Environmental DNA Methods for Ecological Monitoring and Biodiversity Assessment in Estuaries","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-04T04:30:47Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85132813008",,"000815563600001",,,"Estuaries and coasts","45","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Anomalies in Arctic stratospheric ozone become particularly important in spring, when returning sunlight allows them to alter stratospheric temperatures via shortwave heating, thus modifying atmospheric dynamics. At the same time, the stratospheric circulation undergoes a transition in spring with the final stratospheric warming (FSW), which marks the end of winter. A causal link between stratospheric ozone anomalies and FSWs is plausible and might increase the predictability of stratospheric and tropospheric responses on sub-seasonal to seasonal timescales. However, it remains to be fully understood how ozone influences the timing and evolution of the springtime vortex breakdown. Here, we contrast results from chemistry climate models with and without interactive ozone chemistry to quantify the impact of ozone anomalies on the timing of the FSW and its effects on surface climate. We find that ozone feedbacks increase the variability in the timing of the FSW, especially in the lower stratosphere. In ozone-deficient springs, a persistent strong polar vortex and a delayed FSW in the lower stratosphere are partly due to the lack of heating by ozone in that region. High-ozone anomalies, on the other hand, result in additional shortwave heating in the lower stratosphere, where the FSW therefore occurs earlier. We further show that FSWs in high-ozone springs are predominantly followed by a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) with positive sea level pressure anomalies over the Arctic and cold anomalies over Eurasia and Europe. These conditions are to a significant extent (at least 50 %) driven by ozone. In contrast, FSWs in low-ozone springs are not associated with a discernible surface climate response. These results highlight the importance of ozone-circulation coupling in the climate system and the potential value of interactive ozone chemistry for sub-seasonal to seasonal predictability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000584639","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-22-13997-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/584639","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Effects of Arctic ozone on the stratospheric spring onset and its surface impact","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-03T05:37:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The Overlooked Role of Stratospheric Ozone in forcing Northern Hemispheric climate (TORSO)||Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events","180043||198896","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Ambizione||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,"85142607516",,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodologies to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ.  For the year 2021, EFOS increased by 5.1 % relative to 2020, with fossil emissions at 10.1 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 (9.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 1.1 ± 0.7 GtC yr−1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission (including the cement carbonation sink) of 10.9 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1 (40.0 ± 2.9 GtCO2). Also, for 2021, GATM was 5.2 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 (2.5 ± 0.1 ppm yr−1), SOCEAN was 2.9  ± 0.4 GtC yr−1, and SLAND was 3.5 ± 0.9 GtC yr−1, with a BIM of −0.6 GtC yr−1 (i.e. the total estimated sources were too low or sinks were too high). The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2021 reached 414.71 ± 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2022 suggest an increase in EFOS relative to 2021 of +1.0 % (0.1 % to 1.9 %) globally and atmospheric CO2 concentration reaching 417.2 ppm, more than 50 % above pre-industrial levels (around 278 ppm). Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2021, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr−1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use change emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extratropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set.

A significant fraction of this CH4 is produced by anaerobic Archaea. Here, we describe the first CH4 production by facultative anaerobic wood-rot fungi during growth on hydroxylated/carboxylated aromatic compounds, including lignin and lignite. The amount of CH4 produced by fungi is positively correlated with the amount of CH3Cl produced during the rapid growth period of the fungus. Biochemical, genetic, and stable isotopic tracer analyses reveal the existence of a novel halomethane-dependent fungal CH4 production pathway during the degradation of phenol and benzoic acid monomers and polymers and utilization of cyclic sugars. Even though this halomethane-dependent pathway may only play a side role in anaerobic fungal activity, it could represent a globally significant, previously overlooked source of biogenic CH4 in natural ecosystems. IMPORTANCE Here, we demonstrate that wood-rot fungi produce methane anaerobically without the involvement of methanogenic archaea via a new, halomethane-dependent pathway. These findings of an anaerobic fungal methane formation pathway open another avenue in methane research and will further assist with current efforts in the identification of the processes involved and their ecological implications.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000572562","2165-0497",,"10.1128/spectrum.01700-22","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572562","en","American Society of Microbiology","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","fungal methane||halomethane-dependent pathway||wood-rot fungi","Methane Production by Facultative Anaerobic Wood-Rot Fungi via a New Halomethane-Dependent Pathway","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-25T03:03:10Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85140856387",,"000855351300001","Microbiol Spectr","5","Microbiology Spectrum","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To enable robust and accurate assessment of extraction workflows, PET MPs with an inorganic tracer (Indium, 0.2% wt) were spiked into individual soil subgroups and standard soils with varying compositions. Due to the selectivity of the metal tracer, MPs recovery rates could be quickly and quantitatively assessed using ICP-MS. The evaluation of different methods specifically adapted to the soil properties were assessed by isolating MPs from complex soil matrices by systematically investigating specific subgroups (sand, silt, clay, non-lignified and lignified organic matter) before applying the workflow to standard soils. Removal of recalcitrant organic matter is one of the major hurdles in isolating MPs for further size and chemical characterization, requiring novel approaches to remove lignocellulosic structures. Therefore, a new biotechnological method (3-F-Ultra) was developed which mimics natural degradation processes occurring in aerobic (Fenton) and anaerobic fungi (CAZymes). Finally, a Nile Red staining protocol was developed to evaluate the suitability of the workflow for non-metal-doped MPs, which requires a filter with minimal background residues for further chemical identification, e.g. by μFTIR spectroscopy. Image analysis was performed using a Deep Learning tool, allowing for discrimination between the number of residues in bright-field and MPs counted in fluorescence mode to calculate a Filter Clearness Index (FCI). To validate the workflow, three well-characterized standard soils were analyzed applying the final method, with recoveries of 88% for MPs fragments and 74% for MPs fibers with an average FCI of 0.75. Collectively, this workflow improves our current understanding of how to adapt extraction protocols according to the target soil composition, allowing for improved MPs analysis in environmental sampling campaigns.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000566489","0269-7491||1878-2450||1873-6424",,"10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119933","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566489","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Microplastics||Soil||ICP-MS||Organic matter||CAZymes||Deep learning","Systematic development of extraction methods for quantitative microplastics analysis in soils using metal-doped plastics","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-25T13:03:04Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)","186856","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Eccellenza",,,"85136307899",,,"Environ Pollut",,"Environmental Pollution","311","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, analyses of atmospheric CO2 records from 49 stations between 1980 and 2018 reveal substantial trends and variations in this amplitude globally. While no significant trends can be discerned before 2000 in most places, strong positive trends emerge after 2000 in the southern high latitudes. Using factorial simulations with an atmospheric transport model and analyses of surface ocean Pco2 observations, we show that the increase is best explained by the onset of increasing seasonality of air-sea CO2 exchange over the Southern Ocean around 2000. Underlying these changes is the long-term ocean acidification trend that tends to enhance the seasonality of the air-sea fluxes, but this trend is modified by the decadal variability of the Southern Ocean carbon sink. The seasonal variations of atmospheric CO2 thus emerge as a sensitive recorder of the variations of the Southern Ocean carbon sink.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000577296","2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.abq0220","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/577296","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Enhance seasonal amplitude of atmospheric CO2 by the changing Southern Ocean carbon sink","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-22T03:09:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85139766804",,"000882137600013","Sci Adv","41","Science Advances","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we use purposefully collected data from 87 sites to model how agricultural habitats, including semi-natural pastures, sown temporary grassland (leys), cereal crops, and forest habitats comprising both mature production forests and clear-cuts, contribute to landscape-scale diversity of plants, bumblebees and butterflies in boreonemoral Sweden. At the local scale, species richness was highest in semi-natural pastures, intermediate in cereal crops and leys and lowest in forest. In clear-cuts, species richness was similarly high to that in semi-natural pastures. Countryside species-area models show that at a landscape scale, the high local richness in clear-cuts was more than offset by the low species richness encountered in forest. At landscape scale, semi-natural pastures, and in the case of plants also cereal crops, were major contributors of unique species. Leys and semi-natural pastures were both important contributors to bumblebee diversity. The effect of the surrounding landscape composition on local diversity was weak, suggesting that area-based approximations of landscape-scale species richness were reasonable. We conclude that clear-cuts constitute habitats for open-land species but cannot maintain landscape -scale diversity in the face of agricultural abandonment when open land is replaced by even-aged production forests. Maintaining farmland, in particular semi-natural pastures but also cereals and leys, is therefore critical to maintaining the landscape-scale species richness of plants and insects in forestry-dominated areas.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576045","0006-3207||1873-2917",,"10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109728","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576045","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Countryside species area relationship||Farmland afforestation||High nature value farmland||Grassland ley||Pollinator diversity||Semi -natural grassland","Landscape-scale diversity of plants, bumblebees and butterflies in mixed farm-forest landscapes of Northern Europe: Clear-cuts do not compensate for the negative effects of plantation forest cover","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-15T02:56:45Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000863234800001","Biol Conserv",,"Biological Conservation","274","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study aims in validating citizen science water quality collected data (nitrate, phosphate and turbidity) with those collected and measured by professional scientists in the laboratory. A second objective of the study is to use citizen scientist data to identify the patterns of seasonal and spatial variations in nutrient conditions and forecast potential changes based on expected changes in population and climate (to 2050). The results showed that the concentrations of nitrate and phosphate measured by citizen scientists nearly matched those established by professional scientists, with overall accuracy of 91% and 74%, respectively. For total suspended solids measured by professional and turbidity measured by citizen scientists, results show that, using 14 NTU as a cut-off, citizen scientist measurements of Sec-chi tube depth to identify lake TSS below 7.0 mg/L showed an accuracy of 88%. In both laboratory and citizen scientist-based studies, all measured water quality variables were significantly higher during the wet season compared to the dry season. Climate factors were discovered to have a major impact on the likelihood of exceeding water quality restrictions in the next decades (2050), which could deteriorate lake conditions. Upscaling citizen science to more communities on the lake and other African Great Lakes would raise environmental awareness, inform management and mitigation activities, and aid long-term decision-making.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000566940","0167-6369||1573-2959",,"10.1007/s10661-022-10354-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566940","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Citizen science||Lake Tanganyika||Nitrate||Phosphate||Turbidity","Citizen scientist monitoring accurately reveals nutrient pollution dynamics in Lake Tanganyika coastal waters","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-28T05:28:58Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Bridge for Researchers in Danger Going to Europe - Step II","824601","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85136499024",,"000842475900008","Environ.

Utilizing stable carbon isotope (13C-)labelled poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), a synthetic polyester, we herein present an analytical approach to continuously quantify PBS mineralization to 13CO2 during soil incubations and, thereafter, to determine non-mineralized PBS-derived 13C remaining in the soil. We demonstrate extensive PBS mineralization (65 % of added 13C) and a closed mass balance on PBS-13C over 425 days of incubation. Extraction of residual PBS from soils combined with kinetic modeling of the biodegradation data and results from monomer (i.e., butanediol and succinate) mineralization experiments suggest that PBS hydrolytic breakdown controlled the overall PBS biodegradation rate. Beyond PBS biodegradation in soil, the presented methodology is broadly applicable to investigate biodegradation of other biodegradable polymers in various receiving environments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000575381","2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-022-33064-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575381","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Biodegradation of poly(butylene succinate) in soil laboratory incubations assessed by stable carbon isotope labelling","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-12T03:10:27Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85138892239",,"000861535700016","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02330 - Dep.

While these processes have been studied extensively as independent systems, the coexistence of iron minerals is common in nature. Yet it remains unclear how coexisting goethite influences ferrihydrite transformation. Here, we reacted ferrihydrite and goethite mixtures with Fe(II) for 24 h. Our results demonstrate that with more goethite initially present in the mixture more ferrihydrite turned into goethite. We further used stable Fe isotopes to label different Fe pools and probed ferrihydrite transformation in the presence of goethite using 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy and changes in the isotopic composition of solid and aqueous phases. When ferrihydrite alone underwent Fe(II)-catalyzed transformation, Fe atoms initially in the aqueous phase mostly formed lepidocrocite, while those from ferrihydrite mostly formed goethite. When goethite was initially present, more goethite was formed from atoms initially in the aqueous phase, and nanogoethite formed from atoms initially in ferrihydrite. Our results suggest that coexisting goethite promotes formation of more goethite via Fe(II)-goethite electron transfer and template-directed nucleation and growth. We further hypothesize that electron transfer onto goethite followed by electron hopping onto ferrihydrite is another possible pathway to goethite formation. Our findings demonstrate that mineral transformation is strongly influenced by the composition of soil solid phases.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000570287","0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.2c03925","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/570287","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Fe(II)−Fe(III) electron transfer||recrystallization||template-directed nucleation||labile Fe(III)||electron hopping","Coexisting Goethite Promotes Fe(II)-Catalyzed Transformation of Ferrihydrite to Goethite","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-13T06:36:59Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Iron mineral dynamics in redox-affected soils and sediments: Pushing the frontier toward in-situ studies","788009","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85137159370",,"000855245800001","Environ.

Previous work showed that aqueous photodegradation of methoxy-substituted aromatics (ArOCH3) produces CO considerably more efficiently than aromatic carbonyls. Following on this precedent, we propose that the methoxy aromatic groups of lignin act as the C source for the photochemical formation of CO from terrestrial DOM via a two-step pathway: formal hydrolytic demethylation to methanol and methanol oxidation to CO. To test the reasonableness of this mechanism, we investigated the photochemistry of eight lignin model compounds. We first observed that initial CO production rates are positively correlated with initial substrate degradation rates only for models containing at least one ArOCH3 group, regardless of other structural features. We then confirmed that all ArOCH3-containing substrates undergo formal hydrolytic demethylation by detecting methanol and the corresponding phenolic transformation products. Finally, we showed that hydroxyl radicals, likely oxidants to initiate methanol oxidation to CO, form during irradiation of all models. This work proposes an explicit mechanism linking ubiquitous, abundant, and easily quantifiable DOM functionalities to CO photoproduction. Our results further hint that methanol may be an abundant (yet overlooked) DOM photoproduct and a likely precursor of formaldehyde, formic acid, and CO2 and that lignin photodegradation may represent a source of hydroxyl radicals.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000570352","0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.2c03762","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/570352","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","dissolved organic matter photodegradation||carbon monoxide||reaction mechanism||lignin||methanol||hydroxyl radicals||carbon cycling||methoxy-substituted aromatics","Photochemical Production of Carbon Monoxide from Dissolved Organic Matter: Role of Lignin Methoxyarene Functional Groups","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-13T09:03:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Reactivity-based characterization of photoexcited natural organic matter","188565||188565","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT||Projekte MINT",,,"85137856167",,"000882832700001","Environ.

Monitoring PAI therefore increases the understanding of environmental health, integrity, and functioning, and studying complex interactions through accurate, cost-effective sampling can aid in the management of detrimental anthropogenic impacts. Environmental DNA (eDNA)-based monitoring represents an increasingly common, nondestructive approach for biodiversity monitoring, which could help to elucidate PAI. Here, we aim to provide an overall discussion on the potential of using eDNA to study PAI. We assessed the existing literature on this subject from 2009 to 2021 using a freely accessible web search tool. The search was conducted by using keywords involving eDNA and PAI, including both species-specific and metabarcoding approaches, recovering 43 studies. We summarized the advantages and current limitations of such approaches, and we outline research priorities to improve future eDNA-based methods for PAI analysis. Among the 43 studies identified using eDNA to measure PAI such as pollination, herbivory, mutualistic, and parasitic relationships, they have often identified higher taxonomic diversity in several direct comparisons with DNA-based gut/bulk sampling and conventional survey methods. Research needs include the following: better understanding of the influencing factors of eDNA detection involved in PAI (e.g., eDNA degradation, origin, and types), methodological standardization (sampling methods and primer development), and more inclusive sequence reference databases. If these research priorities are addressed, it will have a significant impact to enable PAI biodiversity monitoring with eDNA. In the future, the implementation of eDNA methods to study PAI can particularly benefit the scalability of environmental biomonitoring surveys that are imperative for ecosystem health assessments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000575390","2637-4943",,"10.1002/edn3.308","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575390","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biodiversity loss||Biodiversity sampling||Conservation management||Ecosystem functioning||Environmental DNA (eDNA)||Molecular ecology||Nondestructive||Plant-animal interactions (PAI)","Plant–animal interactions in the era of environmental DNA (eDNA)—A review","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-12T03:11:00Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85130253713",,,,"5","Environmental DNA","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, research on terrestrial eDNA detection from foliage surfaces has been limited. In this study, we developed methods to capture and detect eDNA using qPCR from an invasive forest pest, hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), and three of its biological control predators Leucotaraxis piniperda, Leucotaraxis argenticollis, and Laricobius nigrinus. We designed four highly efficient qPCR assays with a low limit of detection (1–10 copies/reaction). The assay targeting A. tsugae was species-specific. The assays targeting Le. piniperda, and Le. argenticollis were biotype-specific in addition to being species-specific demonstrating applications of eDNA analysis beyond species-level detection. The La. nigrinus assay also detected DNA from closely related and hybridizing Laricobius rubidus. The eDNA methods were evaluated against traditional detection methods. We collected foliage samples from three strata (bottom, middle, and top) of eastern hemlock trees to detect the presence of A. tsugae. The detection of the biological control predators was evaluated using western hemlock foliage samples collected from the predators' native range in western Washington. The eDNA methods had significantly higher positive detection rates (2.8–4.5 times) than conventional methods of all target species. The strata of sampling were not significant in determining the presence of A. tsugae infestation. The eDNA concentration positively correlated with the observed density for all species. This study demonstrates the efficacy of eDNA analysis as a more sensitive tool for early detection of A. tsugae and to track the establishment of its biological control predators.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000575389","2637-4943",,"10.1002/edn3.317","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575389","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Adelges tsugae||Biological control||Biotype-specific qPCR||eDNA||Hemlock woolly adelgid||Invasive species||Laricobius nigrinus||Leucopis argenticollis||Leucapis piniperda","Sensitive environmental DNA (eDNA) methods to detect hemlock woolly adelgid and its biological control predators Leucotaraxis silver flies and a Laricobius beetle","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-12T03:11:00Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85130563063",,,,"5","Environmental DNA","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The main conveyor of waters from the Arctic Ocean to lower latitudes is the East Greenland Current (EGC), flowing southward through Fram Strait. It is therefore crucial to determine and monitor the composition of the EGC, a mixture of polar waters of different origins. Here we present a pilot study on the potential of the long-lived anthropogenic radionuclides 129I and 236U as tracers of the EGC water mass composition, based on a time series of 236U and 129I concentrations measured across Fram Strait in the years 2016, 2018, and 2019. The overall spatial distribution of 236U and 129I was similar among the three sampling years, but a decrease in concentration was observed in the upper water column of the EGC. The observed changes could only partly be attributed to the transient nature of the radionuclide signals, but instead pointed to changes in the EGC water mass composition. To investigate these changes, 236U and 129I were first combined in a mixing model featuring the endmembers expected in the upper EGC. We distinguished between Pacific Water (PAC), Atlantic Water advected from the Arctic Ocean (ATL), and Atlantic Water recirculating in Fram Strait (RAC). In 236U-129I tracer space, PAC and RAC showed similar tracer signatures, but were well distinguished from ATL. From 2016 to 2018/19, a decrease in the ATL fraction was evident for the upper EGC. Secondly, the respective combination of 236U and 129I with salinity showed differences in absolute water mass fractions, but similar temporal trends. Both suggested an increase in PAC of about 20% for the uppermost layer of the EGC (samples with potential densities below 26.5) and an increase in RAC of about 10−20 % for denser samples. 129I and 236U, in combination with salinity, were shown to be suitable tracers to investigate water mass composition in Fram Strait, with the advantage that they can distinguish Atlantic Water advected from the Arctic Ocean from that recirculating in Fram Strait.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000574353","2296-7745",,"10.3389/fmars.2022.973507","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/574353","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Water mass composition in Fram Strait determined from the combination of 129I and 236U: Changes between 2016, 2018, and 2019","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-05T03:13:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Combining U-236 with other multi-sourced anthropogenic tracers as a new tool to study ocean circulation||A new multitracer approach in Oceanography: combining U-236 with conventional anthropogenic radionuclides in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans||How fast do Atlantic Waters circulate and what are their pathways through the Arctic Ocean and in the Meridional Overturning Circulation?

Values of Γ and Δ determined separately using the two tracer pairs, SF6-CFC-11, and 129I-CFC-11 are in good agreement for gas solubilities estimated for saturation levels of 0.90, but agreement decreases for other gas saturation levels. Both Γ and Δ increase rapidly with increasing depth below the base of the intermediate water layer (ca. 1,000 m), but maintaining a value of Δ/Γ ≅ 1 supporting the use of this proportionality in applications of TTDs to deep ocean transport of substances such as anthropogenic carbon.

Some methanotrophs have developed Cu acquisition strategies, in which they exude Cu-binding ligands termed chalkophores under conditions of low Cu availability. A well-characterised chalkophore is methanobactin (mb), exuded by the microaerophilic methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. Aerobic methanotrophs generally reside close to environmental oxic-anoxic interfaces, where the formation of Cu sulphide phases can aggravate the limitation of bioavailable Cu due to their low solubility. The reactivity of chalkophores towards such Cu sulphide mineral phases has not yet been investigated. In this study, a combination of dissolution experiments and equilibrium modelling was used to examine the dissolution and solubility of bulk and nanoparticulate Cu sulphide minerals in the presence of mb as influenced by pH, oxygen and natural organic matter. In general, we show that mb is effective at increasing the dissolved Cu concentrations in the presence of a variety of Cu sulphide phases that may potentially limit Cu bioavailability. More Cu was mobilised per mole of mb from Cu sulphide nanoparticles compared with well-crystalline bulk covellite (CuS). In general, the efficacy of mb at mobilising Cu from Cu sulphides is pH-dependent. At lower pH, e.g. pH 5, mb was ineffective at solubilizing Cu. The presence of mb increased dissolved Cu concentrations between pH 7 and 8.5, where the solubility of all Cu sulphides is generally low, both in the presence and absence of oxygen. These results suggest that chalkophore-promoted Cu mobilisation from sulphide phases is an effective extracellular mechanism for increasing dissolved Cu concentrations at oxic-anoxic interfaces, particularly in the neutral to slightly alkaline pH range. This suggests that aerobic methanotrophs may be able to fulfil their Cu requirements via the exudation of mb in natural environments where the bioavailability of Cu is constrained by very stable Cu sulphide phases.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000554667","1472-4677||1472-4669",,"10.1111/gbi.12505","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/554667","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","aerobic methane oxidation||chalkophore||Cu sulphide dissolution||ligand-promoted dissolution||methanobactin||microbial Cu acquisition","Copper mobilisation from Cu sulphide minerals by methanobactin: Effect of pH, oxygen and natural organic matter","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-26T02:57:11Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85132073474",,"000812613500001",,"5","Geobiology","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This hypothesis is tested by comparing the levels of four selected perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) (i.e., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)) in various global environmental media (i.e., rainwater, soils, and surface waters) with recently proposed guideline levels. On the basis of the four PFAAs considered, it is concluded that (1) levels of PFOA and PFOS in rainwater often greatly exceed US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Lifetime Drinking Water Health Advisory levels and the sum of the aforementioned four PFAAs (sigma 4 PFAS) in rainwater is often above Danish drinking water limit values also based on sigma 4 PFAS; (2) levels of PFOS in rainwater are often above Environmental Quality Standard for Inland European Union Surface Water; and (3) atmospheric deposition also leads to global soils being ubiquitously contaminated and to be often above proposed Dutch guideline values. It is, therefore, concluded that the global spread of these four PFAAs in the atmosphere has led to the planetary boundary for chemical pollution being exceeded. Levels of PFAAs in atmospheric deposition are especially poorly reversible because of the high persistence of PFAAs and their ability to continuously cycle in the hydrosphere, including on sea spray aerosols emitted from the oceans. Because of the poor reversibility of environmental exposure to PFAS and their associated effects, it is vitally important that PFAS uses and emissions are rapidly restricted.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000565791","0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.2c02765","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/565791","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","PFAS||planetary boundary||chemical pollution||environmental exposure","Outside the Safe Operating Space of a New Planetary Boundary for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-24T02:50:29Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"ZeroPM: Zero pollution of Persistent, Mobile substances","101036756","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85136123284",,"000836184400001","Environ.

The prevailing opinion is that primary Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides, such as ferrihydrite (simplified formula of Fe(OH)3), were precipitated from the ocean's photic zone by marine plankton, and a fraction of these minerals was subsequently transformed into secondary magnetite and siderite by dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (DIRB). However, aside from broad estimates, it is currently unknown what fraction of the primary Fe(III) minerals was sedimented to the seafloor where it was eventually lithified, and what fraction was reduced by DIRB in the water column, thus forming a microbial Fe cycle in the water column. To test this, we conducted Fe cycling experiments with marine phototrophic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria and DIRB under conditions mimicking the Precambrian ocean water column with elevated Fe(II) and Si concentrations. We followed secondary mineral formation over three consecutive redox cycles (oxidation followed by reduction) over a time interval of up to 58 days to determine which mineral phases would ultimately have settled as BIF forming sediments. We used wet geochemical methods to follow Fe speciation, measured dissolved silica and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations, determined cell-mineral associations using fluorescence and electron microscopy, and characterized the mineralogy of the precipitates using 57Fe-Moessbauer spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Our results showed that both the absence of silica and an increasing number of Fe cycles favored the formation of more crystalline minerals, such as goethite (α-FeOOH). However, in the presence of high concentrations of monomeric silica, as suggested for ancient oceans (2.2 mM), only short-range ordered (SRO) Fe(III) minerals such as ferrihydrite were observed. These did not transform into the more thermodynamically stable goethite during repeated Fe cycling. Interestingly, no magnetite formed in any of the setups. Instead, increasing Si concentrations favored the formation of increasing quantities of Fe(II) minerals. Microscopy revealed a tight association between microbial biomass and minerals formed. Dissolved silica analysis showed the removal of Si from solution congruent with Fe(II) oxidation and a release of Si during Fe(III) reduction. Together, these results suggest an important role of co-precipitated biomass as well as silica for secondary mineral formation by either constraining crystal growth and/or inhibiting Fe(II)-induced mineral transformation. Overall, our results imply that microbial Fe cycling during settling of primary ferrihydrite through the photic zone in a Precambrian ocean would have resulted in the partial transformation of ferrihydrite into secondary Fe(II) mineral phases in the water column. This would have resulted in the accumulation of mixtures of a ferrihydrite-silica composite and Fe(II) minerals in the initial BIF forming sediments.",,,"0016-7037||1872-9533",,"10.1016/j.gca.2022.05.016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/561057","en","Elsevier",,,"Photoferrotrophy||Ferrous iron oxidation||Ferric iron reduction||Fe(III) minerals||Secondary mineral formation||Fe cycling||Banded Iron Formations","Microbial Fe cycling in a simulated Precambrian ocean environment: Implications for secondary mineral (trans)formation and deposition during BIF genesis","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-08-01T04:42:28Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85132227330",,"000834661600004","Geochim.

It is hypothesized that drinking water resources contain nanoplastics (NPs), but the detection of NPs is challenging. We, therefore, used palladium (Pd)-labeled NPs to investigate the behavior and removal of NPs during conventional drinking water treatment processes including ozonation, sand and activated carbon filtration. Ozone doses typically applied in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) hardly affect the NPs transport in the subsequent filtration systems. Amongst the different filtration media, NPs particles were most efficiently retained when aged (i.e. biofilm coated) sand was used with good agreements between laboratory and pilot scale systems. The removal of NPs through multiple filtration steps in a municipal full-scale DWTP was simulated using the MNMs software code. Removal efficiencies exceeding 3-log units were modeled for a combination of three consecutive filtration steps (rapid sand filtration, activated carbon filtration and slow sand filtration with 0.4-, 0.2- and 3.0-log-removal, respectively). According to the results from the model, the removal of NPs during slow sand filtration dominated the overall NPs removal which is also supported by the laboratory-scale and pilot-scale data. The results from this study can be used to estimate the NPs removal efficiency of typical DWTPs with similar water treatment chains.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000550011","0304-3894||1873-3336",,"10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.129011","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/550011","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Nanoplastics||Drinking water treatment||Ozonation||Sand filtration||Granular activated carbon","Nanoplastics removal during drinking water treatment: Laboratory- and pilot-scale experiments and modeling","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-01T03:07:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)||The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems","186856||168105","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Eccellenza||Ambizione",,,"85130567109",,"000807244200005",,,"Journal of Hazardous Materials","436","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Importantly, we used metal-doped polystyrene nanoplastics (nominal concentrations of 0.5, 5 and 50 mg plastics L-1), which allowed quantitative assessment of nanoplastics exposure across this complex biological system. Despite the ecological importance of periphyton in fresh waters, we are yet to understand whether microbial diversity and functions in periphyton, as well as grazer populations, are respectively impacted by accumulation of nanoplastics and dietary exposure. We demonstrated that periphyton efficiently accumulates and retains nanoplastics, which are consequently transferred to the grazers through dietary exposure although this did not lead to notable impacts on periphyton communities. Conversely, combined nanoplastics exposure and grazing pressure shifted community composition. Moreover, dietary exposure resulted in inhibited reproduction and reduced growth of the primary consumer, potentially leading to severe consequences for population dynamics due to trophic interactions in streams.",,,"2051-8153||2051-8161",,"10.1039/d2en00101b","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/559638","en","Royal Society of Chemistry",,,,"Important ecological processes are affected by the accumulation and trophic transfer of nanoplastics in a freshwater periphyton-grazer food chain","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-07-23T03:02:45Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)||The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems","186856||168105","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Eccellenza||Ambizione",,,"85135113179",,"000825689300001","Environ.

We show that hydrodynamic forcing controls organismal assemblages in surface sediments, while in deeper layers selective feeding by worms on fine, algae-rich particles strongly decreases the abundance and richness of all three domains. In these deeper layers, bacterial and eukaryotic network connectivity decreases, while percentages of clades involved in degradation of refractory organic matter, oxidative nitrogen and sulfur cycling increase.

Three redox active minerals (i.e., birnessite (MnO2), magnetite (Fe3O4), and hematite (Fe2O3)) and one redox inactive mineral (Ottawa sand (SiO2)) were spiked with pyrene and thermally treated. Under dry, anoxic conditions, 100%, 75% +/- 3%, 70% +/- 15%, and 14% +/- 28% of the initial pyrene mass was removed with birnessite, magnetite, hematite, and Ottawa sand, respectively, after treatment at 250 degrees C for 30 min.

Baseline studies with Ottawa sand resulted in volatilization alone of pyrene with no transformation observed. Increased pyrene loading was used to evaluate potential transformation pathways based on identified by-products, demonstrating that both oxidative and reductive pathways were operative depending on the conditions. Reaction products in the presence of redox active minerals indicate transformation was dominated by reduction via hydrogenation in dry experiments, and by oxidation via hydroxyl radicals in wet experiments. The latter was unexpected, because only low hydroxyl radical concentrations have been detected in mineral-water systems at ambient temperature.

Persistence has been successfully characterized for readily and for slowly degradable chemicals using standardized tests, but for the third group of chemicals with intermediate degradability (""middle group""), the assessment is less straightforward. Whether chemicals of this group behave as persistent or not in a given environment depends on environmental factors such as the presence of sorbents that can limit the bioavailability of chemicals. Uncertainties associated with current persistence assessments of chemicals in the middle group do not imply that persistence assessment is generally inconsistent, too ambiguous for regulatory use, and not useful in chemical hazard and risk assessment. Given the complexity of the environmental factors influencing chemical degradation, and the diversity of commercial chemicals, it has to be accepted though that for chemicals in the middle group even improved testing methods will not remove all of the immanent heterogeneity in their persistence data. For cases with widely different but technically valid persistence data, a weight-of-evidence approach is necessary and the ""benefit of the doubt"" should follow the precautionary principle in order to protect human and ecosystem health. We maintain that technically valid persistence data, although they might be considered dissatisfying from a scientific point of view because of high variability or even inconclusiveness, can well be sufficient for regulatory purposes. As with anything, also in persistence assessment, the scientific logic aims for a mechanistic description of the processes involved, low uncertainty, and a comprehensive understanding derived from a broad empirical basis. If the scientific logic is used as a benchmark in the regulatory context, this may easily lead to ""paralysis by analysis"". While regulatory decisions should be based on sound science, discrepancies between scientific goals and regulatory needs and, consequently, different levels of requirements (must-have versus nice-to-have) for degradation studies need to be recognized and appreciated. We further advocate for enhancing consistency between regulatory persistence assessments (""one substance-one assessment""), which is currently not the case.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000558947","2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/d2em00213b","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/558947","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"To be or not to be degraded: in defense of persistence assessment of chemicals","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-20T03:12:20Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"ZeroPM: Zero pollution of Persistent, Mobile substances||NCCR Catalysis SNF Management KTT","101036756||180544","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF","H2020||NCCR (NFS)",,,"85134669985",,"000823775400001","Environ Sci Process Impacts","8","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using a multiproxy approach, we investigate changes in diatom, green algae, and vascular plant biomolecules in sedimentary records from the past centuries across five temperate lakes with different trophic histories. Despite past increases in the input and burial of OC in sediments of eutrophic lakes, biomolecule quantities in sediments of all lakes are primarily controlled by postburial microbial degradation over the time scales studied. We, moreover, observe major differences in biomolecule degradation patterns across diatoms, green algae, and vascular plants. Degradation rates of labile diatom DNA exceed those of chemically more resistant diatom lipids, suggesting that chemical reactivity mainly controls diatom biomolecule degradation rates in the lakes studied. By contrast, degradation rates of green algal and vascular plant DNA are significantly lower than those of diatom DNA, and in a similar range as corresponding, much less reactive lipid biomarkers and structural macromolecules, including lignin. We propose that physical shielding by degradation-resistant cell wall components, such as algaenan in green algae and lignin in vascular plants, contributes to the long-term preservation of labile biomolecules in both groups and significantly influences the long-term burial of OC in lake sediments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000568163","2752-6542",,"10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac076","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/568163","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","lake sediments||biomolecules||DNA||long-term preservation||physical shielding","Long-term preservation of biomolecules in lake sediments: potential importance of physical shielding by recalcitrant cell walls","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-31T14:17:56Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Role of Bioturbation in Controlling Microbial Community Composition and Biogeochemical Cycles in Marine and Lacustrine Sediments","163371","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,,,"3","PNAS Nexus","1","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To be able to counteract this alarming trend, it is paramount to closely monitor biodiversity at global scales. Because this is practically impossible with traditional methods, the last decade has seen a strong push for new solutions. In aquatic ecosystems, the monitoring of species from environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as one of the most powerful tools at our disposal, but in terrestrial ecosystems, the power of eDNA for monitoring has so far been hampered by the local scale of the samples. In this study, we report the successful detection of insects from airborne eDNA from samples taken in the field. We compare our results to two traditional insect monitoring methods (1) light traps for moth monitoring and (2) transect walks for the monitoring of butterflies and wild bees. Airborne eDNA metabarcoding revealed DNA from six classes of arthropods, and twelve order of insects—including representatives from the four largest orders: Diptera (flies), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Coleoptera (beetles), and Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants). We did not detect all species observed using traditional methods and suggest further directions for the development of airborne eDNA metabarcoding. We also recovered DNA from nine species of vertebrates, including frogs, birds, and mammals as well as from 12 other phyla. Airborne eDNA has the potential to become a powerful tool for terrestrial biodiversity monitoring, with many impactful applications including the monitoring of pests, invasive, or endangered species and disease vectors.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576731","2637-4943",,"10.1002/edn3.290","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576731","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","aerosols||biodiversity||DNA barcoding||environmental DNA||Insecta","Airborne environmental DNA metabarcoding for the monitoring of terrestrial insects—A proof of concept from the field","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-19T03:05:32Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85126021276",,,,"4","Environmental DNA","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Surface climate predictability in the Northern Hemisphere might be improved due to a previously proposed, albeit uncertain, link to springtime ozone depletion in the Arctic. Here we use observations and targeted chemistry–climate experiments from two models to isolate the surface impacts of ozone depletion from complex downward dynamical influences. We find that springtime stratospheric ozone depletion is consistently followed by surface temperature and precipitation anomalies with signs consistent with a positive Arctic Oscillation, namely, warm and dry conditions over southern Europe and Eurasia and moistening over northern Europe. Notably, we show that these anomalies, affecting large portions of the Northern Hemisphere, are driven substantially by the loss of stratospheric ozone. This is due to ozone depletion leading to a reduction in short-wave radiation absorption, when in turn causing persistent negative temperature anomalies in the lower stratosphere and a delayed break-up of the polar vortex. These results indicate that the inclusion of interactive ozone chemistry in atmospheric models can considerably improve the predictability of Northern Hemisphere surface climate on seasonal timescales.",,,"1752-0908||1752-0894",,"10.1038/s41561-022-00974-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/560208","en","Nature",,,"Atmospheric chemistry||Atmospheric dynamics","Springtime arctic ozone depletion forces northern hemisphere climate anomalies","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-07-27T05:47:04Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The Overlooked Role of Stratospheric Ozone in forcing Northern Hemispheric climate (TORSO)||Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application||Remote Drivers of Extreme Temperature Events","180043||170523||198896","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Ambizione||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,"85133595901",,"000824755900010","Nat.

Efforts to better understand their ecology uncovered a surprising diversity, vertical structure, and seasonal succession. It is an open question how this diversity has to be considered in models of microbial methane oxidation. Likewise, it is unclear to what extent simple microbial traits related to the kinetics of the oxidation process and temperature optimum, suggested by previous studies, suffice to understand the observed ecology of methane oxidizing bacteria. Here we incorporate niche partitioning in a mechanistic model of seasonal lake mixing and microbial methane oxidation in a stratified lake. Can we model MOB diversity and niche partitioning based on differences in methane oxidation kinetics and temperature adaptation? We found that our model approach can closely reproduce diversity and niche preference patterns of methanotrophs that were observed in seasonally stratified lakes. We show that the combination of trait values resulting in coexisting methanotroph communities is limited to very confined regions within the parameter space of potential trait combinations. However, our model also indicates that the sequence of community assembly, and variations in the stratification and mixing behavior of the lake result in different stable combinations. A scenario analysis introducing variable mixing conditions showed that annual weather conditions and the pre-existing species also affect the developing stable methanotrophic species composition of the lake. Both, effect of pre-existing species and the environmental impact suggest that the MOB community in lakes may differ from year to year, and a stable community may never truly occur.

Accurate information on the global extent and distribution of peatlands is presently lacking but is needed by Earth system models (ESMs) to simulate the effects of climate change on the global carbon and hydrologic balance. Here, we present Peat-ML, a spatially continuous global map of peatland fractional coverage generated using machine learning (ML) techniques suitable for use as a prescribed geophysical field in an ESM. Inputs to our statistical model follow drivers of peatland formation and include spatially distributed climate, geomorphological and soil data, and remotely sensed vegetation indices. Available maps of peatland fractional coverage for 14 relatively extensive regions were used along with mapped ecoregions of non-peatland areas to train the statistical model. In addition to qualitative comparisons to other maps in the literature, we estimated model error in two ways. The first estimate used the training data in a blocked leave-one-out cross-validation strategy designed to minimize the influence of spatial autocorrelation. That approach yielded an average r(2) of 0.73 with a root-mean-square error and mean bias error of 9.11 % and -0.36 %, respectively. Our second error estimate was generated by comparing Peat-ML against a high-quality, extensively ground-truthed map generated by Ducks Unlimited Canada for the Canadian Boreal Plains region. This comparison suggests our map to be of comparable quality to mapping products generated through more traditional approaches, at least for boreal peatlands.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000555528","1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-15-4709-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/555528","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A map of global peatland extent created using machine learning (Peat-ML)","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-30T02:58:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85132995843",,"000813051400001","Geosci. model dev.","12","Geoscientific Model Development","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They are widely used as sentinel species for the overall response of marine ecosystems to environmental stressors associated with climate change and changes in ocean chemistry. However, currently we are unable to project the effects of climate change on shelled pteropods at the population level, due to the missing spatio-temporal characterization of the response of pteropods to environmental stressors, and the limited information on the pteropod life history and life-cycle. In this study, we implement a shelled pteropod Individual-Based Model (IBM), i.e. we simulate a pteropod population as a set of discrete individuals over several generations, life-stages (eggs, larvae, juveniles and adults) and as a function of temperature, food availability, and aragonite saturation state. The model is able to provide an abundance signal that is consistent with the abundance signal measured in the temperate region. In addition, the modeled life-stage progression matches the reported size spectrum across the year, with two major spawning periods in spring and fall, and maturation in March and September. Furthermore, our IBM correctly predicts the abundance maxima of younger, smaller and potentially more susceptible life-stages in spring and winter. Thus, our model provides a tool for advancing our understanding of the response of pteropod populations to future environmental changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000541779","0304-3800||1872-7026||0167-8892",,"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2022.109944","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/541779","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Pteropods||Individual-based modeling||Life-cycle||California current system","Individual-based modeling of shelled pteropods","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-09T03:12:47Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"X-EBUS: Extreme Ocean Weather Events and their Role for Ocean Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems","175787","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85127154642",,"000792691400006","Ecol.

Much like ensembles of Earth system models that are constructed by perturbing their initial conditions, our synthetic ensemble members exhibit different phasing of internal variability and a common externally forced signal. Our synthetic ensembles illustrate an important role for internal variability in the temporal evolution of global and regional CO2 flux and produce a wide range of possible trends over 1990-1999 and 2000-2009. We assume a specific externally forced signal and calculate the rank of the observed trends within the distribution of statistically modeled synthetic trends during these periods. Over the decade 1990-1999, three of four observation-based products exhibit small negative trends in globally integrated sea-air CO2 flux (i.e., enhanced ocean CO2 absorption with time) that are within one standard deviation of the mean in their respective synthetic ensembles. Over the decade 2000-2009, however, three products show large negative trends in globally integrated sea-air CO2 flux that have a low rate of occurrence in their synthetic ensembles. The largest positive trends in global and Southern Ocean flux over 1990-1999 and the largest negative trends over 2000-2009 fall nearly two standard deviations away from the mean in their ensembles.

This shoaling compresses the vertical habitat of heterotrophic organisms between the well oxygenated surface and the hypoxic interface. Superimposed on this long-term trend, natural variability can cause shorter-term, extreme habitat compression events, which we term Transient Habitat Reduction Extreme Events (THREEs). Here, we investigate THREEs in the Eastern Pacific (EP) between 1979 and 2016 using output from a high-resolution hindcast simulation with the coupled physical-biogeochemical ocean model ROMS-BEC. We identify THREEs on the basis of the hypoxic interface being shallower than the 99th percentile of its variability and requiring a minimum duration of five days. We find that THREEs compress the aerobic habitat by up to 50%-70% (locally exceeding 80%) in the subtropical and tropical EP and reach horizontal scales exceeding 300 km in the tropical EP. There, THREEs are pre-conditioned by La Nina conditions and occur primarily in boreal winter and spring. In the subtropical EP, THREEs are associated with mesoscale eddies and occur independently of the season. 71% (32%) of all THREEs are characterized by unusually high acidity (cold) conditions (i.e., below the first percentile), thus constituting compound events. The strong habitat compression during THREEs is bound to lead to substantial changes in water column biogeochemistry, in food-web interactions, and in ecosystem structure. Yet, so far, very little is known about the impact of these transient phenomena.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000554609","0148-0227||2169-9275",,"10.1029/2022JC018429","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/554609","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","extreme events||oxygen variability||eastern Pacific||habitat compression||compound events","Strong Habitat Compression by Extreme Shoaling Events of Hypoxic Waters in the Eastern Pacific","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-25T02:59:49Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"X-EBUS: Extreme Ocean Weather Events and their Role for Ocean Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems","175787","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85133343038",,"000811932500001","J. geophys. res.

To date, a quantitative understanding of how soil characteristics control As and Cd accumulation in rice grains under field conditions is still deficient. Based on 31 paired soil-grain samples collected in southern China, we statistically explored which soil parameter or parameter combination from various soil analyses best estimates As and Cd in rice. We found that CaCl2 extraction of field-moist soil collected at rice harvest provided the best estimation (R2adj = 0.47–0.60) for grain Cd followed by dry soil CaCl2 extraction (R2adj = 0.38–0.49), where CaCl2 extractable Cd from moist or dry soil was the dominant soil parameter. Compared to soil totals, parameters from neither dry soil ascorbate-citrate extraction nor anoxic soil incubation improved model performance for grain As (R2adj ≤ 0.44), despite their closer relevance to soil redox conditions during plant As uptake. A key role of soil-available sulfur in controlling grain As was suggested by our models. Our approach and results may help develop potential soil amendment strategies for decreasing As and/or Cd accumulation in soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000546970",,,"10.3390/soilsystems6020036","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/546970","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","food safety||multivariate regression||redox||soil extraction||soil amendment||sulfur","Exploring Key Soil Parameters Relevant to Arsenic and Cadmium Accumulation in Rice Grain in Southern China","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-13T02:55:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Reducing Cd and As uptake by rice in contaminated paddy soils: From biogeochemical processes to improved paddy management","170120","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Sino-Swiss Science and Technology Cooperation (SSSTC)",,,"85129155016",,"000818301400001",,"2","Soil Systems","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As a result, the comparability of atmospheric levels measured by PAS and concentrations measured by active air sampling (AAS) remains unclear. Long-term PAS data, without conversion into concentrations, provide temporal trends that are similar to, and consistent with, trends from AAS data. However, for more comprehensive environmental and human health assessments of SVOCs, it is also essential to harmonize and pool air concentration data from the major AAS and PAS monitoring networks in Europe. To address this need, we calculated and compared concentration data for 28 SVOCs (including organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) at the six monitoring sites in Europe with 10 years of co-located AAS (EMEP) and PAS (MONET) data: Birkenes, Kosetice, Pallas, Rao, Storhofoi, and Zeppelin. Atmospheric SVOC concentrations were derived from PAS data using the two most common computation models. Long-term agreement between the AAS and PAS data was strong for most SVOCs and sites, with 79% of the median PAS-derived concentrations falling within a factor of 3 of their corresponding AAS concentrations. However, in both models it is necessary to set a sampler-dependent correction factor to prevent underestimation of concentrations for primarily particle-associated SVOCs. In contrast, the models overestimate concentrations at sites with wind speeds that consistently exceed 4 m s(-1). We present two recommendations that, if followed, allow MONET PAS to provide sufficiently accurate estimates of SVOC concentrations in air so that they can be deployed together with AAS in regional and global monitoring networks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000548159","2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/d2em00007e","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/548159","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Comparability of semivolatile organic compound concentrations from co-located active and passive air monitoring networks in Europe","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-20T03:07:03Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"CETOCOEN Excellence / Teaming Phase 2","857560","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85133100496",,"000793895900001","Environ Sci Process Impacts","6","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This reanalysis yields an estimate for the globally integrated coastal ocean CO2 flux of −0.25 ± 0.05 Pg C year−1, with polar and subpolar regions accounting for most of the CO2 removal (>90%). A framework that classifies river-dominated ocean margin (RiOMar) and ocean-dominated margin (OceMar) systems is used to conceptualizecoastal carbon cycle processes. The carbon dynamics in three contrasting case study regions, the Baltic Sea, the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and the South China Sea, are compared in terms of the spatio-temporal variability of surface pCO2. Ocean carbon models that range from box models to three-dimensional coupled circulation-biogeochemical models are reviewed in terms of the ability to simulate key processes and project future changes in different continental shelf regions. Common unresolved challenges remain for implementation of these models across RiOMar and OceMar systems. The long-term trends in coastal ocean carbon fluxes for different coastal systems under anthropogenic stress that are emerging in observations and numerical simulations are highlighted. Knowledge gaps in projecting future perturbations associated with before and after net-zero CO2 emissions in the context of concurrent changes in the land-ocean-atmosphere coupled system pose a key challenge.  - A new synthesis yields an estimate for a globally integrated coastal ocean carbon sink of −0.25 Pg C year−1, with greater than 90% of atmospheric CO2 removal occurring in polar and subpolar regions.  - The sustained coastal and open ocean carbon sink is vital in mitigating climate change and meeting the target set by the Paris Agreement.  - Uncertainties in the future coastal ocean carbon cycle are associated with concurrent trends and changes in the land-ocean-atmosphere coupled system.  - The major gaps and challenges identified for current coastal ocean carbon research have important implications for climate and sustainability policies.",,,"0084-6597||1545-4495",,"10.1146/annurev-earth-032320-090746","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551479","en","Annual Reviews",,,"carbon cycle||coastal ocean||air-sea CO2 flux||continental margin||river-dominated ocean margin||RiOMar||ocean-dominated margin||OceMar||carbon neutrality","Carbon Fluxes in the Coastal Ocean: Synthesis, Boundary Processes, and Future Trends","Review Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-06-08T16:46:42Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Climate-Carbon Interactions in the Coming Century","821003","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85130385734",,"000804955000023","Annu.

Cationic functionalization of the fullerene cage provided the most effective approach to increase water solubility, but common synthesis practices inadvertently complicated the photochemistry of these systems by introducing iodide as a counterion. This problem was overlooked until recent work noted a potentiation effect which occurred when photosensitizers were used to inactivate microorganisms with added potassium iodide. In this work, several photochemical pathways were explored to determine the extent and underlying mechanisms of iodide’s interference in the photosensitization of singlet oxygen by cationic fulleropyrrolidinium ions and rose bengal. Triplet excited state sensitizer lifetimes were measured via laser flash photolysis to probe the role of I– in triplet sensitizer quenching. Singlet oxygen production rates were compared across sensitizers in the presence or absence of I–, SO42–, and other anions. 3,5-Dimethyl-1H-pyrazole was employed as a chemical probe for iodine radical species, such as I·, but none were observed in the photochemical systems. Molecular iodine and triiodide, however, were found in significant quantities when photosensitizers were irradiated in the presence of I– and O2. The formation of I2 in these photochemical systems calls into question the interpretations of prior studies that used I– as a counterion for photosensitizer materials. As an example, MS2 bacteriophages were inactivated here by cationic fullerenes with and without I– present, showing that I– moderately accelerated the MS2 deactivation, likely by producing I2. Production of I2 did not appear to be directly correlated with estimates of 1O2 concentration, suggesting that the relevant photochemical pathways are more complex than direct reactions between 1O2 and I– in the bulk solution. On the basis of the results here, iodine photochemistry may be underappreciated and misunderstood in other environmental systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557027","1936-0851||1936-086X",,"10.1021/acsnano.2c02281","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557027","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Iodine||photochemistry||singlet oxygen||MS2 bacteriophage||cationic fullerene||C60||photosensitizer","The Overlooked Photochemistry of Iodine in Aqueous Suspensions of Fullerene Derivatives","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-09T11:24:20Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000812148900105","ACS Nano","5","ACS Nano","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It has been argued that PFAS should only be employed in those uses that are necessary for health or safety or are critical for the functioning of society and where no alternatives are available (“essential-use concept”). Implementing the essential-use concept requires a sufficient understanding of the current uses of PFAS and of the availability, suitability, and hazardous properties of alternatives. To illustrate the information requirements under the essential-use concept, we investigate seven different PFAS uses, three in consumer products and four industrial applications. We investigate how much information is available on the types and functions of PFAS in these uses, how much information is available on alternatives, their performance and hazardous properties and, finally, whether this information is sufficient as a basis for deciding on the essentiality of a PFAS use. The results show (i) the uses of PFAS are highly diverse and information on alternatives is often limited or lacking; (ii) PFAS in consumer products often are relatively easy to replace; (iii) PFAS uses in industrial processes can be highly complex and a thorough evaluation of the technical function of each PFAS and of the suitability of alternatives is needed; (iv) more coordination among PFAS manufacturers, manufacturers of alternatives to PFAS, users of these materials, government authorities, and other stakeholders is needed to make the process of phasing out PFAS more transparent and coherent.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000512283","0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.1c03732","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/512283","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","PFAS||Essential use||Chrome plating||Fluoropolymer||Carpet","Information Requirements under the Essential-Use Concept: PFAS Case Studies","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-28T09:15:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Innovative Training Network on PER and polyfluorinated alkyl substances towards the Future Of Research and its Communication in Europe 3","860665||860665","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC","H2020||H2020",,,"10.1021/acs.est.1c03732",,"000804806300024","Environ.

Here, we characterize and develop understanding of Eastern North Pacific upper ocean biogeochemical properties during the Winter of 2013–2014 using in situ observations, an observation-based product, and reconstructions from a collection of ocean models. We find that the Blob is associated with significant upper ocean biogeochemical anomalies: A 5% increase in aragonite saturation state (temporary reprieve of ocean acidification) and a 3% decrease in oxygen concentration (enhanced deoxygenation). Anomalous advection and mixing drive the aragonite saturation anomaly, while anomalous heating and air-sea gas exchange drive the oxygen anomaly. Marine heatwaves do not necessarily serve as an analog for future change as they may enhance or mitigate long-term trends.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000545882","0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2021gl096938","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/545882","en","American Geophysical Union","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Ocean Biogeochemical Signatures of the North Pacific Blob","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-09T09:31:24Z","2023-04-26",,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Our common future ocean – quantifying coupled cycles of carbon, oxygen, and nutrients for determining and achieving safe operating spaces with respect to tipping points","820989","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85130091365",,,"Geophys.

Visualization of nanoplastics in roots was performed with synchrotron micro X-ray fluorescence (µXRF). Nanoplastics accumulated on the root epidermis, especially at the root tip and in root maturation zones. A close relationship between plant roots, rhizodeposits and nanoplastics behaviour was shown. Reinforcement of the cell wall in roots was evidenced using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and synchrotron-computed microtomography (µCT). Synchrotron-computed nanotomography (nanoCT) evidenced the presence of globular structures but they could not be identified as nanoplastics since they were observed both in the control and treated roots.

Thereby, biodiversity can be assessed through direct collection of targeted organisms, through indirect evidence of their presence (e.g. signs, environmental DNA, camera trap, etc.), or through extrapolations from species distribution and species richness models. Differences in approaches used in biodiversity assessment, however, may come with individual challenges and hinder cross-study comparability. In the context of rapidly developing techniques, we compared three different approaches in order to better understand assessments of aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity. Specifically, we compared the community composition and species richness of three orders of aquatic macroinvertebrates (mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies, hereafter EPT) obtained via eDNA metabarcoding and via traditional in situ kicknet sampling to catchment-level based predictions of a species richness model. We used kicknet data from 24 sites in Switzerland and compared taxonomic lists to those obtained using eDNA amplified with two different primer sets. Richness detected by these methods was compared to the independent predictions made by a statistical species richness model, that is, a generalized linear model using landscape-level features to estimate EPT diversity. Despite the ability of eDNA to consistently detect some EPT species found by traditional sampling, we found important discrepancies in community composition between the kicknet and eDNA approaches, particularly at a local scale. We found the EPT-specific primer set fwhF2/EPTDr2n, detected a greater number of targeted EPT species compared to the more general primer set mlCOIintF/HCO2198. Moreover, we found that the species richness measured by eDNA from either primer set was poorly correlated to the richness measured by kicknet sampling (Pearson correlation = 0.27) and that the richness estimated by eDNA and kicknet were poorly correlated with the prediction of the species richness model (Pearson correlation = 0.30 and 0.44, respectively). The weak relationships between the traditional kicknet sampling and eDNA with this model indicates inherent limitations in upscaling species richness estimates, and possibly a limited ability of the model to meet real world expectations. It is also possible that the number of replicates was not sufficient to detect ambiguous correlations. Future challenges include improving the accuracy and sensitivity of each approach individually, yet also acknowledging their respective limitations, in order to best meet stakeholder demands and address the biodiversity crisis we are facing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000578113","2534-9708",,"10.3897/mbmg.6.79351","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/578113","en","Pensoft Publishers","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Ephemeroptera||Metabarcoding||Plecoptera||Trichoptera||Water DNA","A triad of kicknet sampling, eDNA metabarcoding, and predictive modeling to assess richness of mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies in rivers","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-27T09:14:54Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Global measure of biodiversity by understanding biogeochemical cycling of environmental DNA in lakes","852621","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,,,"Metabarcoding and Metagenomics","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Today, OC burial in marine sediments mainly takes place under oxygen-rich water columns, where most OC is stabilized through intimate association with sediment grains and biogenic minerals. In prior episodes of Earth’s past, when large parts of the oceans were anoxic, the mode of sedimentary OC burial must have been very different, however. Present-day analogues indicate that surface sediments accumulating under low-oxygen water columns are often “soupy” in texture. Moreover, most OC occurs in large (100–2,000 μm diameter) organic and organo-mineral aggregates which, due to their low density, are prone to wave- and current-induced resuspension. Upon mobilization, these aggregates can undergo lateral transport within so-called nepheloid layers, and may be translocated hundreds of kilometres, and on timescales of thousands of years. Little is known about processes of formation, resuspension and hydrodynamic properties of these aggregates in oxygen-poor waters, or which factors control their eventual breakdown or burial. The goal of this study is to examine the drivers and biogeochemical consequences of this resuspension on OC cycling in modern, oxygen-depleted, “Semi-Liquid Ocean Bottom” (SLOB) regions. We argue that models of sediment and OM hydrodynamics and redistribution that describe sedimentation processes in oxygenated ocean waters of the modern ocean are a poor analogue for equivalent processes occurring under oxygen-deficient conditions. In the latter, we hypothesize that 1) the abundance of low-density organic-rich particles and aggregates leads to a greater propensity for sediment remobilization at low(er) shear stress, and 2) upon resuspension into low-oxygen bottom waters, remobilized OM may be subject to less degradation (less attenuation) during lateral transport, leading to efficient and widespread translocation to distal centres of deposition. We address specific aspects of the SLOB hypothesis utilizing a combination of literature and new data, focussing on the Benguela Upwelling Region as a model system.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000546682","2296-6463",,"10.3389/feart.2022.886395","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/546682","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Sedimentary Hydrodynamic Processes Under Low-Oxygen Conditions: Implications for Past, Present, and Future Oceans","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-11T17:06:19Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The Semi-Liquid Ocean Bottom (SLOB) Hypothesis","ETH-07 19-1","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,"85130964961",,"000803912000001","Front.

Understanding the persistence of eDNA is complex because it exists in a mixture of different states (e.g., dissolved, particle adsorbed, intracellular, and intraorganellar), and each state is expected to have a specific decay rate that depends on environmental parameters. Thus, improving knowledge about eDNA conversion rates between states and the reactions that degrade eDNA in different states is needed. Here, we focus on eukaryotic extraorganismal eDNA, outline how water chemistry and suspended mineral particles likely affect conversion among each eDNA state, and indicate how environmental parameters affect persistence of states in the water column. On the basis of deducing these controlling parameters, we synthesized the eDNA literature to assess whether we could already derive a general understanding of eDNA states persisting in the environment. However, we found that these parameters are often not being measured or reported when measured, and in many cases very few experimental data exist from which to draw conclusions. Therefore, further study of how environmental parameters affect eDNA state conversion and eDNA decay in aquatic environments is needed. We recommend analytic controls that can be used during the processing of water to assess potential losses of different eDNA states if all were present in a water sample, and we outline future experimental work that would help determine the dominant eDNA states in water.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000549182","0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.1c07638","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/549182","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","environmental DNA||states||persistence||aquatic environments","The Multiple States of Environmental DNA and What Is Known about Their Persistence in Aquatic Environments","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-27T04:24:43Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Global measure of biodiversity by understanding biogeochemical cycling of environmental DNA in lakes","852621","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85128844867",,"000798709200004","Environ.

However, the effect and the fate of silicate during Fe mineral recrystallization and transformation are not entirely understood and especially remain unclear for lepidocrocite. In this study, we reacted (Si-)ferrihydrite (Si/Fe = 0, 0.05, and 0.18) and (Si-)lepidocrocite (Si/Fe = 0 and 0.08) with isotopically labeled 57Fe(II) (Fe(II)/Fe(III) = 0.02 and 0.2) at pH 7 for up to 4 weeks. We followed Fe mineral transformations with X-ray diffraction and tracked Fe atom exchange by measuring aqueous and solid phase Fe isotope fractions. Our results show that the extent of ferrihydrite transformation in the presence of Fe(II) was strongly influenced by the solid phase Si/Fe ratio, while increasing the Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio (from 0.02 to 0.2) had only a minor effect. The presence of silicate increased the thickness of newly formed lepidocrocite crystallites, and elemental distribution maps of Fe(II)-reacted Si-ferrihydrites revealed that much more Si was associated with the remaining ferrihydrite than with the newly formed lepidocrocite. Pure lepidocrocite underwent recrystallization in the low Fe(II) treatment and transformed to magnetite at the high Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio. Adsorbed silicate inactivated the lepidocrocite surfaces, which strongly reduced Fe atom exchange and inhibited mineral transformation. Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate that Fe(II)-catalyzed Si-ferrihydrite transformation leads to the redistribution of silicate in the solid phase and the formation of thicker lepidocrocite platelets, while lepidocrocite transformation can be completely inhibited by adsorbed silicate. Therefore, silicate is an important factor to include when considering Fe mineral dynamics in soils under reducing conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000549183","0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.1c08789","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/549183","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","iron||goethite||magnetite||atom exchange||redox||crystal morphology||elemental mapping","Stabilization of Ferrihydrite and Lepidocrocite by Silicate during Fe(II)-Catalyzed Mineral Transformation: Impact on Particle Morphology and Silicate Distribution","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-27T04:24:43Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Iron mineral dynamics in redox-affected soils and sediments: Pushing the frontier toward in-situ studies","788009","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85128829683",,"000798709200063","Environ.

Here, we use a hindcast simulation from 1984 to 2019 with a high-resolution regional ocean model (ROMS-BEC) to identify and track ocean acidification extremes (OAX) in the northeast Pacific and the California current system (CCS). In the first step, we identify all grid-cells whose pH and omega(A) are simultaneously below their first percentile over the analysis period (1984-2019). In the second step, we aggregate all neighboring cells with extreme conditions into three-dimensional time evolving events, permitting us to track them in a Lagrangian manner over their lifetime. We detect more than 22 thousand events that occur at least once in the upper 100 m during their lifetime, with broad distributions in terms of size, duration, volume, and intensity, and with 26% of them harboring corrosive conditions (omega(A) < 1). By clustering the OAXs, we find three types of extremes in the CCS. Near the coast, intense, shallow, and short-lasting OAXs dominate, caused by strong upwelling. A second type consists of large and long-lasting OAX events that are associated with westward propagating cyclonic eddies. They account for only 3% of all extremes, but are the most severe events. The third type is small extremes at depth arising from pycnocline heave. OAXs potentially have deleterious effects on marine life. Marine calcifiers, such as pteropods, might be especially impacted by the long-lasting events with corrosive conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000549160","0148-0227||2169-9275","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/511157||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/549160","10.1029/2021JC018159","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/556513","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Ocean acidification||Extreme events||space-time tracking||California current system","Tracking the space-time evolution of ocean acidification extremes in the California Current System and Northeast Pacific","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-22T07:46:35Z",,,,,,,,,,,,"X-EBUS: Extreme Ocean Weather Events and their Role for Ocean Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems||Our common future ocean – quantifying coupled cycles of carbon, oxygen, and nutrients for determining and achieving safe operating spaces with respect to tipping points","175787||820989","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","Projekte MINT||H2020",,,"85130622232",,"000795869500001","J. geophys. res.

Therefore, the investigation of their transport pathways is important to understand the structure of the AMOC and how climate properties are exported from the North Atlantic to lower latitudes. There is growing evidence from Lagrangian model simulations and observations that ISOW and LSW detach from boundary currents and spread off-boundary, into the basin interior in the Atlantic Ocean. Nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities of Sellafield and La Hague have been releasing artificial iodine (129I) into the northeastern Atlantic since the 1960ies. As a result, 129I is supplied from north of the Greenland-Scotland passages into the subpolar region labelling waters of the southward flowing lower AMOC. To explore the potential of 129I as tracer of boundary and interior ISOW and LSW transport pathways, we analyzed the tracer concentrations in seawater collected during four oceanographic cruises in the subpolar and subtropical North Atlantic regions between 2017 and 2019. The new tracer observations showed that deep tracer maxima highlighted the spreading of ISOW along the flanks of Reykjanes Ridge, across fracture zones and into the eastern subpolar North Atlantic supporting recent Lagrangian studies. Further, we found that 129I is intruding the Atlantic Ocean at unprecedented rate and labelling much larger extensions and water masses than in the recent past. This has enabled the use of 129I for other purposes aside from tracing ISOW. For example, increasing tracer levels allowed us to differentiate between newly formed 129I-rich LSW and older vintages poorer in 129I content. Further, 129I concentration maxima at intermediate depths could be used to track the spreading of LSW beyond the subpolar region and far into subtropical seas near Bermuda. Considering that 129I releases from Sellafield and La Hague have increased or levelled off during the last decades, it is very likely that the tracer invasion will continue providing new tracing opportunities for 129I in the near future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000551518","2296-7745",,"10.3389/fmars.2022.897729","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551518","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","artificial radionuclides||I-129||ISOW||LSW||AMOC||iodine||ocean circulation","Rapidly Increasing Artificial Iodine Highlights Pathways of Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water and Labrador Sea Water","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-09T03:33:33Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"A new era of transient tracers in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans||A new multitracer approach in Oceanography: combining U-236 with conventional anthropogenic radionuclides in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans||How fast do Atlantic Waters circulate and what are their pathways through the Arctic Ocean and in the Meridional Overturning Circulation?

Here we describe and synthesize datasets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data products. The terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the first time, an approach is shown to reconcile the difference in our ELUC estimate with the one from national greenhouse gas inventories, supporting the assessment of collective countries' climate progress.  For the year 2020, EFOS declined by 5.4 % relative to 2019, with fossil emissions at 9.5 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 (9.3 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), and ELUC was 0.9 ± 0.7 GtC yr−1, for a total anthropogenic CO2 emission of 10.2 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1 (37.4 ± 2.9 GtCO2). Also, for 2020, GATM was 5.0 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 (2.4 ± 0.1 ppm yr−1), SOCEAN was 3.0 ± 0.4 GtC yr−1, and SLAND was 2.9 ± 1 GtC yr−1, with a BIM of −0.8 GtC yr−1. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2020 reached 412.45 ± 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2021 suggest a rebound in EFOS relative to 2020 of +4.8 % (4.2 % to 5.4 %) globally.  Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2020, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr−1 persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use changes emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade. This living data update documents changes in the methods and datasets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this dataset (Friedlingstein et al., 2020, 2019; Le Quéré et al., 2018b, a, 2016, 2015b, a, 2014, 2013).

Sorption and mobility of IOCs are distinctively different from those of neutral compounds. Due to electrostatic interactions with natural sorbents, existing concepts for describing neutral organic contaminant sorption, and by extension mobility, are inadequate for IOC. Predictive models developed for neutral compounds are based on octanol-water partitioning of compounds (Kow) and organic-carbon content of soil/sediment, which is used to normalize sorption measurements (KOC). We revisit those concepts and their translation to IOC (Dowand DOC) and discuss compound and soil properties determining sorption of IOC under water saturated conditions. Highlighting possible complementary and/or alternative approaches to better assess IOC mobility, we discuss implications on their regulation and risk assessment. The development of better models for IOC mobility needs consistent and reliable sorption measurements at well-defined chemical conditions in natural porewater, better IOC-, as well as sorbent characterization. Such models should be complemented by monitoring data from the natural environment. The state of knowledge presented here may guide urgently needed future investigations in this field for researchers, engineers, and regulators.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000545757","0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.2c00570","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/545757","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ionizable organic compound||anion||cation||zwitterion||sorption model||environmental risk assessment||contaminant fate","Sorption and Mobility of Charged Organic Compounds: How to Confront and Overcome Limitations in Their Assessment","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-08T03:39:52Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85127956487",,"000793137500002","Environ.

On the volcanic island of Iceland, wetlands are replenished with Fe-rich surface-, ground- and springwater. Combined with extensive drainage of lowland wetlands, which forms artificial redox gradients, accumulations of bright orange (a)biotically-derived Fe-rich flocs are common features of Icelandic wetlands. These loosely consolidated flocs are easily mobilized, and, considering the proximity of Iceland's lowland wetlands to the coast, are likely to contribute to the suspended sediment load transported to coastal waters. To date, however, little is known regarding (Fe) mineral and elemental composition of the flocs. In this study, flocs from wetlands (n = 16) across Iceland were analyzed using X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic techniques (X-ray absorption and 57Fe Mössbauer) combined with chemical extractions and (electron) microscopy to comprehensively characterize floc mineral, elemental, and structural composition. All flocs were rich in Fe (229–414 mg/g), and floc Fe minerals comprised primarily ferrihydrite and nano-crystalline lepidocrocite, with a single floc sample containing nano-crystalline goethite. Floc mineralogy also included Fe in clay minerals and appreciable poorly-crystalline aluminosilicates, most likely allophane and/or imogolite. Microscopy images revealed that floc (bio)organics largely comprised mineral encrusted microbially-derived components (i.e. sheaths, stalks, and EPS) indicative of common FeOB Leptothrix spp. and Gallionella spp. Trace element contents in the flocs were in the low μg/g range, however nearly all trace elements were extracted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. This finding suggests that the (a)biotic reductive dissolution of floc Fe minerals, plausibly driven by exposure to the varied geochemical conditions of coastal waters following floc mobilization, could lead to the release of associated trace elements. Thus, the flocs should be considered vectors for transport of Fe, organic carbon, and trace elements from Icelandic wetlands to coastal waters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529133","0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151567","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529133","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Freshwater flocs||Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria||Biominerals||Wetlands||EXAFS||57Fe Mössbauer","Mineral characterization and composition of Fe-rich flocs from wetlands of Iceland: Implications for Fe, C and trace element export","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-27T10:00:29Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Stability of Short-Range-Order lron Minerals during Biogeochemical Redox Processes and lmplications for Carbon Dynamics in High Latitude, Volcanic Seils||Iron mineral dynamics in redox-affected soils and sediments: Pushing the frontier toward in-situ studies","SEED-13 18-2||788009||SEED-13 18-2||788009||SEED-13 18-2||788009","10.13039/501100003006||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100003006||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100003006||10.13039/501100000780","ETHZ||EC||ETHZ||EC||ETHZ||EC","ETH Seeds||H2020||ETH Seeds||H2020||ETH Seeds||H2020",,,"85119404706",,"000766811900012","Sci.

While mean changes in ocean carbonate chemistry have been widely studied, little is known about the trends and interannual to decadal variability of episodic high acidity extreme events. Understanding the temporal variability of such extreme events is crucial to investigate their potential predictability. Using a regional ocean model coupled to a biogeochemical-ecosystem model (ROMSBEC) we found that acidification extreme events increase from 1984 through 2019 in the upper 250 m of the Northeast Pacific, mostly due to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration. The increase is enhanced in the highly productive California Current System (CCS) by changes in upwelling strength. Our study further reveals that El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) modulate the long-term trends in acidification extreme events, especially in the southern and central parts of the CCS. La Niña (El Niño) increases (decreases) the amount of extreme conditions experienced by the region. Similarly, the positive (negative) phase of NPGO is associated with more (less) extreme conditions. These results offer potential for predicting unusual acidity stress ahead of time in some regions of the Northeast Pacific ocean, such as the CCS.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594866",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594866","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Anthropogenically forced increase in acidification extreme conditions in the Northeast Pacific ocean modulated by climate modes","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2023-01-25T14:38:53Z",,,,,"yes","14th IBP PhD Congress 2022","April 22, 2022","Zurich, Switzerland",,,,"X-EBUS: Extreme Ocean Weather Events and their Role for Ocean Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems","175787","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Observational evidence suggests that extremes superimposed on the long-term ocean acidification trend and seasonal variations have resulted in widespread dissolution, lack of accretion, and developmental delays in calcifying pteropods. However, a comprehensive attribution of ecosystem impacts to carbonate chemistry perturbations at different time scales is limited. Here, we quantify the effects of ocean acidification at different time-scales on the population-level across several generations of pteropods. We use an individual-based model with life stage specific responses to environmental conditions in a regional hindcast simulation (1984-2019) of the CalCS to compare the effects of longterm ocean acidification with the seasonal variation and short-lived acidification extremes. We find that the timing of extremes and life-stage composition of the pteropod community determine the life-stage specific impact relative to the long term trend and the seasonal variation. Extremes during periods of rapid growth significantly increase the mortality of the juvenile life-stages. The life-stage dependent responses to extremes suggest that life cycle dynamics need to be investigated in future impact and attribution studies to accurately characterize and quantify the effects of ocean acidification extremes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594898",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594898","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Pteropod population-level responses to acidification across different time-scales in the California Current System","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2023-01-25T16:17:41Z",,,,,"yes","14th IBP PhD Congress 2022","April 22, 2022","Zurich, Switzerland",,,,"X-EBUS: Extreme Ocean Weather Events and their Role for Ocean Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems","175787","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Assessing the horizontal gradients in dissolved gas concentrations from large river reaches to connecting canals and wetland lakes remains a challenge in many deltaic systems. To elucidate the processes affecting local CO2 and CH4 concentrations in the Romanian part of the Danube Delta, we mapped dissolved O2, N2, He and Ar using a portable gas-equilibration membrane-inlet mass spectrometer (GE-MIMS), along with CO2, CH4, water temperature and conductivity. We measured the concentrations along the aquatic continuum from a small houseboat during two campaigns, in spring and autumn, to capture different hydrological and plant growth conditions. Delta-scale concentration patterns were comparably stable across seasons. Small connecting channels were highly influenced by the riparian wetland, which was strongest in the eastern part of the biosphere reserve. These sites represented the delta’s CO2 and CH4 hotspots and showed clear signs of excess air, i.e., supersaturation of dissolved noble gases with respect to air-saturated water. As the adjacent wetland was permanently inundated, this signal was likely caused by root aeration of Phragmites australis, as opposed to traditional excess air formation via water table fluctuations in the unsaturated zone. The special vegetation setting with reed growing on floating peat coincided with the highest CO2 and CH4 concentrations (>700 μmol/L CO2 and 13 μmol/L CH4, respectively) observed in an adjacent channel. Shallow lakes, on the other hand, were major sites of photosynthetic production with O2 oversaturation reaching up to 150% in spring. The observed deficit in non-reactive gases (He, Ar and N2) indicated that the lakes were affected by O2 ebullition from macrophytes. According to our estimations, this ebullitive flux decreased O2 concentrations by up to 2 mg/L. This study highlights the effect of plant-mediated gas transfer on dissolved gas concentrations and supports recent studies stressing the need to account for ebullitive gas exchange when assessing metabolism parameters from O2 in shallow, productive settings.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000541740","2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2022.838126","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/541740","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","carbon cycle||greenhouse gases||noble gases||plant-mediated gas transfer||ebullition||excess air||Danube Delta||membrane-inlet mass spectrometry","Spatial Mapping of Dissolved Gases in the Danube Delta Reveals Intense Plant-Mediated Gas Transfer","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-08T12:23:24Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85128463047",,"000784363800001","Front.

However, the latest estimate of the accumulation of Cant in the ocean interior by Gruber et al. (2019) extends only to 2007, preventing an independent assessment. Here, we exploit ~100,000 additional dissolved inorganic carbon and other biogeochemical observations from the quality-controlled data product GLODAPv2.2021, to extend the previous analysis to the 2010s. We refine the eMLR(C*) method that was used by Gruber et al. (2019) in three ways: (1) introduction of objective data cleaning, gap filling and rarefaction procedures, (2) increase in the robustness of the multiple linear regression models through a more stringent predictor and model selection, and (3) enhanced quality of the mapping of the Cant fields by relying on an ensemble approach that considers biases of the method identified through testing with synthetic data generated from an ocean biogeochemical model. Preliminary results confirm that globally the ocean continued to accumulate Cant after 2007, with an average uptake rate of 3.2 ± 0.3 PgC yr-1 for the decade from 2004 through 2014. This is slightly higher than the uptake rate of 2.6 ± 0.3 PgC yr-1 previously determined for the 1994 through 2007 period, which is consistent with the expected increase of the rate based on the growth of atmospheric CO2. On a basin scale, the Atlantic Ocean reveals a steady Cant accumulation across both decades. In contrast, our preliminary results suggest that the Cant accumulation in the Pacific Ocean increased in the second decade, while it might have decreased in the Indian Ocean. Zooming into regional scales, we find that biases associated with the eMLR(C*) method on decadal time scales can mask anomalous changes in the storage rate of Cant. This calls for a continued sampling effort in order to identify changing storage patterns on longer time scales.",,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/593232","en","Ocean Sciences Meeting 2022",,,,"Decadal evolution of oceanic sink for anthropogenic carbon from 1994 to 2014","Other Conference Item","Metadata only",,,,"2023-01-18T09:55:43Z",,,,,"yes","Ocean Sciences Meeting 2022 (OSM 2022)","February 24 - March 4, 2022","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) consume a significant fraction of this sedimentary methane, but the factors that control their distributions and activities are not understood. By combining genetic approaches (pmoA, 16S rRNA gene, metagenomics) with geochemical and sedimentological analyses, we investigate the role of trophic state, electron acceptors, oxygen (O2) and methane fluxes, and potential methylotrophic partner organisms in driving the distributions, abundances, and community compositions of MOB across five lakes in central Switzerland. Although methane fluxes were highest in the eutrophic lakes, methanotrophic abundances peaked in oxic and anoxic sediments of an oligotrophic lake. In all lakes, Type I gammaproteobacterial Methylococcaceae dominated oxic and suboxic bottom water and surface sediments, showing strong correlations with abundances of putatively methylotrophic Methylophilaceae, whereas Type II alphaproteobacterial Methylocystaceae increased in deeper, anoxic sediment layers. Methanotrophic bacteria belonging to the NC10 phylum were predominantly detected within denitrifying sediment of the oligotrophic lake, matching their presumed nitrite-dependent lifestyle. While dominant MOB taxa at the genus-level follow vertical distributions of different aerobic and anaerobic respiration reactions, trophic state at the time of sediment deposition was the best predictor of MOB community structure at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level. Elevated methane fluxes combined with low MOB abundances in surface sediments of eutrophic lakes, moreover, support the notion that in eutrophic lakes a major portion of sedimentary methane bypasses the biological methane filter and escapes to overlying water.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000536706","2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2022.857358","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/536706","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Greenhouse gas emissions||MOB||Methanotrophy||Microbial community||Eutrophication||Oligotrophic||Methane oxidation||pmoA","Redox Zone and Trophic State as Drivers of Methane-Oxidizing Bacterial Abundance and Community Structure in Lake Sediments","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-12T11:02:39Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Role of Bioturbation in Controlling Microbial Community Composition and Biogeochemical Cycles in Marine and Lacustrine Sediments","163371","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85127730523",,"000777715800001","Front.

The results show a clear reduction of the number of native species, which have been supplanted by colonizing non-native species, especially in the reservoir. Four native species detected prior to dam construction have apparently disappeared, but 12 new species were registered post-construction. We analyzed spatial changes in beta diversity in the aquatic environments surrounding the dam. The new environment generated by the reservoir presents a unique species composition and contributes significantly to the total beta diversity of the system. Altogether three distinct new fish assemblages emerged following reservoir formation and there are now six assemblages where there had previously been three. This dramatic change, already visible within a decade of construction, highlights just how strong of an impact dam construction has on habitats and how rapidly fish communities react in this hotspot for endemic fish diversity. Our findings demonstrate the importance of monitoring fish communities for revealing the impact of damming on river ecosystems and informs potential complementary fish diversity inventories elsewhere in the Magdalena River basin.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000541709",,,"10.1590/1982-0224-2021-0091","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/541709","en","Sociedade Brasileira de Ictiologia","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","beta diversity||freshwater ichthyofauna||hydropower||long-term monitoring||magdalena river||Magdalena River","Fish community turnover in a dammed Andean River over time","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-08T11:00:22Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","Neotropical Ichthyology","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Atlantic waters entering the Arctic Ocean often carry an isotopic signature dominantly originating from European reprocessing facilities with some smaller contribution from global fallout nuclides, whereas northern Pacific waters are labeled with nuclides released during the atmospheric nuclear testing period only. In the Arctic Ocean, 233U originates from global fallout while 236U carries both, a global fallout and a prominent nuclear reprocessing signal. Thus, the 233U/236U ratio provides a tool to identify water masses with distinct U sources. In this work, 233U and 236U were analyzed in samples from the GN01 GEOTRACES expedition to the western Arctic Ocean in 2015. The study of depth profiles and surface seawater samples shows that: (a) Pacific and Atlantic waters show enhanced signals of both radionuclides, which can be unraveled based on their 233U/236U signature; and (b) Deep and Bottom Waters show extremely low 233U and 236U concentrations close to or below analytical detection limits with isotopic ratios distinct from known anthropogenic U sources. The comparably high 233U/236U ratios are interpreted as a relative increase of naturally occurring 233U and 236U and thus for gradually reaching natural 233U/236U levels in the deep Arctic Ocean. Our results set the basis for future studies using the 233U/236U ratio to distinguish anthropogenic and pre-anthropogenic U in the Arctic Ocean and beyond.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000541798","0148-0227||2169-9275",,"10.1029/2021JC017790","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/541798","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"The Potential of 233U/236U as a Water Mass Tracer in the Arctic Ocean","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-10T05:50:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"How fast do Atlantic Waters circulate and what are their pathways through the Arctic Ocean and in the Meridional Overturning Circulation?

In an integrated biogeochemical and microbiological study on a eutrophic and oligotrophic lake, we estimated N removal rates from pore water concentration gradients in sediments. Simultaneously, the abundance of different microbial N transformation genes was investigated using metagenomics on a seasonal and spatial scale. We observed that contrasting nutrient concentrations in sediments were associated with distinct microbial community compositions and significant differences in abundances of various N transformation genes. For both characteristics, we observed a more pronounced spatial than seasonal variability within each lake. The eutrophic Lake Baldegg showed a higher denitrification potential with higher nosZ gene (N2O reductase) abundances and higher nirS:nirK (nitrite reductase) ratios, indicating a greater capacity for complete denitrification. Correspondingly, this lake had a higher N removal efficiency. The oligotrophic Lake Sarnen, in contrast, had a higher potential for nitrification. Specifically, it harbored a high abundance of Nitrospira, including some with the potential for comammox. Our results demonstrate that knowledge of the genomic N transformation potential is important for interpreting N process rates and understanding how the lacustrine sedimentary N cycle responds to variations in trophic conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000537918","2379-5042","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/535506||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/537918",,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551024","en","American Society for Microbiology","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","metagenomics||microbial ecology||freshwater||pore water||DNRA||nitrification||denitrification||anammox||comammox||nitrogen transformation","Microbial Nitrogen Transformation Potential in Sediments of Two Contrasting Lakes Is Spatially Structured but Seasonally Stable","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-05T14:58:58Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85125211851",,"000778088300012||000762032500008",,"1","mSphere","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Natural climate variations complicate the interpretation of past Hg accumulation rates (HgARs), warranting additional research. Here, we investigated Hg stable isotopes in a ca. 8k year-long sediment core of Lake Titicaca and combined isotopic data with organic biomarkers and biogeochemical measurements. A wet period in the early Holocene (8000–7300 BP) induced strong watershed erosion, leading to a high HgAR (20.2 ± 6.9 μg m-2 year-1), which exceeded the 20th century HgAR (8.4 ± 1.0 μg m-2 year-1). Geogenic Hg input dominated during the early Holocene (fgeog = 79%) and played a minor role during the mid- to late Holocene (4500 BP to present; fgeog = 20%) when atmospheric Hg deposition dominated. Sediment Δ200Hg values and the absence of terrestrial lignin biomarkers suggest that direct lake uptake of atmospheric Hg(0), and subsequent algal scavenging of lake Hg, represented an important atmospheric deposition pathway (42%) during the mid- to late Holocene. During wet episodes of the late Holocene (2400 BP to present), atmospheric Hg(II) deposition was the dominant source of lake sediment Hg (up to 82%). Sediment Δ199Hg values suggest that photochemical reduction and re-emission of Hg(0) occurred from the lake surface. Hg stable isotopes show promise as proxies for understanding the history of Hg sources and transformations and help to disentangle anthropogenic and climate factors influencing HgAR observed in sediment archives.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529763","2472-3452",,"10.1021/acsearthspacechem.1c00304","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529763","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Hg stable isotopes||climate variations||Holocene||atmospheric deposition||erosion||sediment archive","Climatic Controls on a Holocene Mercury Stable Isotope Sediment Record of Lake Titicaca","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-30T03:41:20Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85124042506",,"000745896300001","ACS earth space chem.","2","ACS Earth and Space Chemistry","6","::ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Knowledge of P speciation and solubility in such soils is poorly understood. Here we investigated: i) the P speciation in the clay size fraction of sandy soils, ii) the pH-dependent solubility of soil orthophosphate (PO4–P), and iii) the particle size-dependent solubility of the soil P. The studied loamy sand soils were low in organic matter (2.6–7.9 g kg−1) and deficient in available P (1.5–8.5 mg kg−1), and kaolinite (21%) was the only clay mineral identified using X-ray diffraction technique in the clay-sized particles. The P K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure analysis revealed that P associated with Al phases, 45% adsorbed to gibbsite and 35% in variscite (AlPO₄·2H₂O), dominated the P speciation in the clay-sized particles. The very low PO4–P solubilities in the investigated bulk soils exhibited a pronounced positive pH-dependent pattern that was consistent with the pH-dependent solubility of Al3+ and Fe3+. Geochemical modeling suggested that the maximum PO4–P solubilities were linked to the solubility of variscite and strengite (FePO₄·2H₂O), indicating that PO4–P solubilities were controlled by the solubility of Al3+ and Fe3+ as restricted by the pH-dependent solubility of Al phases and Fe (hydr)oxides. The analysis of particle size fractions revealed that the largest size fraction (1000–2000 µm), containing visible plant debris and contributing the least to total soil mass (<0.126%), contained most of the total soil P stocks (50–60%). The small size factions (<250 µm) were the key to available PO4–P. Our data highlighted the pivotal role of Al/Fe (hydr)oxides and kaolinite in controlling the pH-dependent solubility of PO4–P in these tropical sandy soils having very limited contents of total and available P and a high risk of P loss.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000517337","0016-7061||1872-6259",,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115590","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517337","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Al oxides||Fe oxides||orthophosphate||Phosphate||XANES||XAS","Speciation and pH- and particle size-dependent solubility of phosphorus in tropical sandy soils","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-27T04:13:48Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85119284624",,"000725437100008","Geoderma",,"Geoderma","408","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Understanding uptake into organisms is key in assessing these effects, but this is often limited by the analytical challenges to quantify smaller-sized plastics in complex matrices. This study used MPFs and NPs containing inorganic tracers (In, Pd) to quantify uptake in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris. Following seven days exposure, tracer concentrations were measured in earthworms and faeces. Earthworms exposed to 500 μg MPFs/g soil retained an estimated 32 MPFs in their tissues, while at 5000 μg MPFs/g earthworms retained between 2 and 593 MPFs. High variation in body burdens of MPFs was linked to soil retention in earthworms and reduced faeces production, suggesting egestion was being affected by MPFs. NPs uptake and elimination was also assessed over a more extended time-period of 42 days. After 1 day, NPs were no longer detectable in faeces during the elimination phase. However, some retention of NPs in the earthworms was estimated, not linked to retained soil, indicating not all NPs were eliminated. MPFs and NPs uptake can be quantified in earthworms and both particle types can be retained beyond the depuration period, suggesting the potential for longer-term accumulation.",,,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/521420","en","Elsevier",,,"Plastic||Soil||Terrestrial||Bioaccumulation||Lumbricus terrestris","Earthworms ingest microplastic fibres and nanoplastics with effects on egestion rate and long-term retention","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-12-20T04:13:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)","186856||186856||186856","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Eccellenza||Eccellenza||Eccellenza",,,"85117364009",,"000755057800013","Sci.

Here, we use a high-resolution coupled physical-biogeochemical model to study the processes sustaining biological production and export in long-living cyclonic (CE) and anticyclonic (AE) eddies of the northern Canary Upwelling System (CanUS). We track the eddies for 18 months as they propagate offshore, and study their composite properties in time in a Lagrangian manner. Our model shows that long-living CEs sustain their production with the nitrogen that they initially trap in the nearshore nutrient-rich waters and keep isolated in their cores. The vertical input of nitrate from below tends to be comparatively small, and is mostly driven by mixing. In contrast, AEs tend to start with low nutrient concentrations in their core as they do not trap coastal waters, but have elevated concentrations at their periphery. In AEs, stirring is responsible for both the building up of the positive nitrate anomaly at depth and the enhanced lateral input of organic nitrogen in the near-surface. Compared to CEs, the input of nitrate into the euphotic zone by vertical mixing is substantially more important. Though regenerated production dominates in both types of eddies, new production is higher than the regional average in CE cores and at the rim of AEs, partially compensating for the intense losses due to sinking. Both cyclonic trapping and transport and anticyclonic stirring shape the regional pattern of organic matter and nutrients in the northern CanUS.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000534830","0148-0227||2169-9275",,"10.1029/2021JC017691","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/534830","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"On the Processes Sustaining Biological Production in the Offshore Propagating Eddies of the Northern Canary Upwelling System","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-02T04:33:52Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"CALNEX: Quantifying the exchange of carbon and nutrients between the coastal and open seas: A comparative modeling study of the California and Canary Current Systems","149384","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,"85125151253",,"000765614000016","J. geophys. res.

Such knowledge is crucial for public authorities to manage water resources especially as we are facing growing inputs of bioactive chemicals with adverse environmental effects. My work is rooted in environmental and analytical chemistry of aquatic enzymes, natural toxins, and micropollutants. I investigate the environmental behavior of these molecules to define the exposure side of human and ecological risk assessment. My team has built an expertise for analytical solutions to study site-specific damage of biomolecules of varied complexity. My aim is to elucidate how long-lived these biomolecules are in environmental and engineered systems. Therefore, we study transformation processes with a particular focus on photochemical and enzymatic reactions. Presented is a cumulative thesis in accordance with the current regulation in the Department of Environmental Systems Science at ETH Zürich. The thesis is structured in three parts: In chapter 1, I highlight the impact of daylight on the environmental chemistry of biomolecules emphasizing some of my contributions. In chapter 2-5, I present detailed studies of each focus area: photochemical transformation of micropollutants (chapter 2), photochemical transformation of enzymes and their building blocks (chapter 3), diversity of bioactive and toxic biomolecules from cyanobacteria (chapter 4), and production dynamics and environmental fate processes of natural products (chapter 5). At the beginning of each chapter, you find a brief overview followed by the individual studies. In chapter 6, I highlight new avenues of my current and future research on the environmental chemistry of cyanobacterial toxins.

To investigate the impact of the underexplored deep lacustrine biosphere on the sediment geochemical environment and vice versa, we performed a comprehensive microbiological and geochemical characterization of a sedimentary sequence from Lake Cadagno covering its entire environmental history since formation following glacial retreat. We found that both geochemical gradients and microbial community shifts across the ∼13.5 kyr subsurface sedimentary record reflect redox changes in the lake, going from oxic to anoxic and sulfidic. Most microbial activity occurs within the top 20 cm of sediment, where millimolar sulfate concentrations diffusing in from the bottom water are almost completely consumed. In deeper sediment layers, organic carbon remineralization is much slower but microorganisms nonetheless subsist on fermentation, sulfur cycling, metal reduction, and methanogenesis. The most surprising finding was the presence of a deep, oxidizing groundwater source. This water source generates an inverse redox gradient at the bottom of the sedimentary sequence and could contribute to the remineralization of organic matter sequestered in the energy-limited deep subsurface.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529936","2296-6463",,"10.3389/feart.2021.754888","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529936","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Lake sediments||Deep biosphere||Bacteria||Archaea||Redox gradients","Ancient and Modern Geochemical Signatures in the 13,500-Year Sedimentary Record of Lake Cadagno","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-31T08:38:42Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Microbial cycling of sulfurized organic matter in freshwater sediments","182096","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85124600078",,"000760861900001","Front.

The mineralization of the hydrolysis product of P4MCL, 6-hydroxy-4-methylhexanoic acid (4MHA), was herein investigated by synthesizing tailor-made molecules with C-13 labels in the carboxylic acid group (4MHA-(COOH)-C-13) or the methyl group (4MHA-(CH3)-C-13) and incubating each separately in a soil. Isotope-sensitive cavity ringdown spectroscopy on the efflux gas was then used to quantitatively monitor the mineralization of each isotopomer. These experiments clearly demonstrated that 4MHA was assimilated and utilized by the soil microorganisms and provided insight into position-specific mineralization. The (CO2)-C-13 evolution rate profiles and overall extents of mineralization to (CO2)-C-13 (similar to 85% and similar to 46% for carboxyl-and methyl-labeled carbons, respectively) are consistent with the methyl carbon being preferentially incorporated into biomass rather than respired, whereas the carboxyl carbon is preferentially used for energy production and thus mineralized more rapidly (presumably by decarboxylation). These findings agree with previous reports regarding variations in the extents of mineralization of carbon atoms in different oxidation states. Moreover, this work demonstrates the value of systematically probing biodegradation of polymer hydrolysis products by the precise design of C-13-labeled molecules.",,,"2168-0485",,"10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c07948","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529758","en","American Chemical Society",,,"4-Methylcaprolactone||Biodegradation||Carbon-13 labeling||Cavity ringdown spectroscopy||Polymer","Site-Specific Mineralization of a Polyester Hydrolysis Product in Natural Soil","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-01-30T03:41:20Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85123933974",,"000745885100001","ACS Sustainable Chem.

The small microbial community subsisted with high potential cell-specific rates of energy metabolism, which approach the rates of active surface sediments and laboratory cultures. Our discovery is in stark contrast to the extremely low metabolic rates otherwise observed in the deep subseafloor. As cells appear to invest most of their energy to repair thermal cell damage in the hot sediment, they are forced to balance delicately between subsistence near the upper temperature limit for life and a rich supply of substrates and energy from thermally driven reactions of the sedimentary organic matter.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529207","2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-021-27802-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529207","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Rapid metabolism fosters microbial survival in the deep, hot subseafloor biosphere","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-27T12:40:22Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85123708514",,"000747410400011","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To ensure efficient respiration, a widespread strategy among iron-reducing microorganisms is the use of extracellular electron shuttles (EES) that transfer two electrons from the microbial cell to the iron oxide surface. Yet, a fundamental understanding of how EES-oxide redox thermodynamics affect rates of iron oxide reduction remains elusive. Attempts to rationalize these rates for different EES, solution pH, and iron oxides on the basis of the underlying reaction free energy of the two-electron transfer were unsuccessful. Here, we demonstrate that broadly varying reduction rates determined in this work for different iron oxides and EES at varying solution chemistry as well as previously published data can be reconciled when these rates are instead related to the free energy of the less exergonic (or even endergonic) first of the two electron transfers from the fully, two-electron reduced EES to ferric iron oxide. We show how free energy relationships aid in identifying controls on microbial iron oxide reduction by EES, thereby advancing a more fundamental understanding of anaerobic respiration using iron oxides.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529016","0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2115629119","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529016","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","microbial iron oxide reduction||anaerobic respiration||free energy relationship||one-electron reduction potential","Thermodynamic controls on rates of iron oxide reduction by extracellular electron shuttles","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-27T04:13:13Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85123127146",,"000748778000019","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","3","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","119","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recently, the labelling of plastics with inorganic metals (e.g., palladium) has allowed measurements of nanoplastic uptake. The aim of the current study was to quantitatively assess the uptake of nanoplastics by the fish gut using palladium-doped nanoplastics (with a mean hydrodynamic radius of 202 ± 7 nm). By using an ex vivo gut sac exposure system, we show that in 4 h between 200 and 700 million nanoplastics (representing 2.5–9.4% of the administered nanoplastics dose) can enter the mucosa and muscularis layers of the intestine of salmon. Of the particles taken up, up to 700,000 (representing 0.6% of that taken into the tissue) of the nanoplastics passed across the gut epithelium of the anterior intestine and exit into the serosal saline. These data, generated in highly controlled conditions provide a proof-of-concept study, suggesting the potential for nanoplastics to distribute throughout the body, indicating the potential for systemic exposure in fish.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522261","0160-4120||1873-6750",,"10.1016/j.envint.2021.106994","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522261","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Plastic nanoparticle||Gut||Gastrointestinal tract||Intestine||Uptake","Demonstrating the translocation of nanoplastics across the fish intestine using palladium-doped polystyrene in a salmon gut-sac","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-24T05:47:38Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)","186856||186856","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Eccellenza||Eccellenza",,,"85121206361",,"000733713000007","Environ.

We combined controlled chemostat cultivation and transcriptomics to examine how the marine sulfate reducer, Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, copes with substrate (sulfate or lactate) limitation. The half-saturation uptake constant (Km) for lactate was 1.2 µM, which is the first value reported for a marine SRM, while the Km for sulfate was 3 µM. The measured residual lactate concentration in our experiments matched values observed in situ in marine sediments, supporting a key role of SRM in the control of lactate concentrations. Lactate limitation resulted in complete lactate oxidation via the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway and differential overexpression of genes involved in uptake and metabolism of amino acids as an alternative carbon source. D. autotrophicum switched to incomplete lactate oxidation, rerouting carbon metabolism in response to sulfate limitation. The estimated free energy was significantly lower during sulfate limitation (−28 to −33 kJ mol−1 sulfate), suggesting that the observed metabolic switch is under thermodynamic control. Furthermore, we detected the upregulation of putative sulfate transporters involved in either high or low affinity uptake in response to low or high sulfate concentration.",,,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-021-01061-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/496559","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Response to substrate limitation by a marine sulfate-reducing bacterium","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-07-20T16:21:33Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85110823148",,"000675113000002","ISME J","1","The ISME Journal","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In turn, zooplankton communities play a critical role in regulating the transfer of organic matter produced in the surface ocean to deeper layers. Yet, the links between zooplankton community composition and the strength of vertical fluxes of particles remain elusive, especially on a global scale. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of variations in zooplankton community composition and vertical particle flux in the upper kilometer of the global ocean. Zooplankton samples were collected across five depth layers and vertical particle fluxes were assessed using continuous profiles of the Underwater Vision Profiler (UVP5) at 57 stations covering seven ocean basins. Zooplankton samples were analysed using a Zooscan and individual organisms were classified into 19 groups for the quantitative analyses. Zooplankton abundance, biomass and vertical particle flux decreased from the surface to 1000 m depth at all latitudes. The zooplankton abundance decrease rate was stronger at sites characterised by oxygen minima (<5µmol O2.kg−1) where most zooplankton groups showed a marked decline in abundance, except the jellyfishes, molluscs, annelids, large protists and a few copepod families. The attenuation rate of vertical particle fluxes was weaker at such oxygen-depleted sites. Canonical redundancy analyses showed that the epipelagic zooplankton community composition depended on the temperature, on the phytoplankton size distribution and the surface large particulate organic matter while oxygen was an additional important factor for structuring zooplankton in the mesopelagic. Our results further suggest that future changes in surface phytoplankton size and taxa composition and mesopelagic oxygen loss might lead to profound shift in zooplankton abundance and community structure in both the euphotic and mesopelagic ocean. These changes may affect the vertical export and hereby the strength of the biological carbon pump.",,,"0079-6611",,"10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102717","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/520163","en","Elsevier",,,,"Patterns of mesozooplankton community composition and vertical fluxes in the global ocean","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-12-11T04:37:35Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85120444217",,"000784289100001","Prog.

Especially in developing countries such as India, the rapid economic development over the last three decades has led to a large-scale migration from rural to urban areas in search of a better life. Cities such as Delhi have grown in size and population by many times in recent decades. This expansion has been accompanied by large-scale industrialization, an increase in vehicular emissions, large-scale fossil fuel usage for energy generation, rapid construction activities, and unchecked combustion of trash and municipal waste. The wide-scale combustion activities have put the air quality in Delhi among the poorest in the World. Air pollution is deteriorating people’s health and quality of life and putting millions of Indians at risk of air quality associated health problems. The health risks posed by air pollution are largely due to exposure to aerosol particles of 2.5 µm or less in diameter (PM2.5), which can penetrate deep into human lungs and cause oxidative stress resulting in inflammation and other cardiovascular diseases. The ability of PM2.5 to cause oxidative stress has a strong relationship with its composition and in turn with its sources. The in-depth knowledge of the composition and formation processes of aerosols is a very important aspect of devising policies that can help in mitigating this problem of air pollution. Especially, in developing countries where policymakers have to maintain the economic growth while mitigating the air pollution related issues, a thorough understanding of the origins of air pollution is essential for designing policies that maximize efficacy in decreasing air pollution while minimizing the impact on economic activity. Atmospheric aerosols consist of inorganic and organic fractions with the organic fraction often being the dominant one. The organic aerosol (OA) is composed of a large number of individual species thus making a complete characterization of their chemical composition, extremely challenging. OA originates from two main pathways: direct emissions which are known as primary organic aerosol (POA) and from oxidation of vapors and subsequent condensation to form new particles or on existing particles which is known as secondary organic aerosol (SOA). In the first study of this thesis, we present a comprehensive source apportionment study of the organic aerosol across three sites in the Delhi area using the data obtained by two aerosol mass spectrometers (AMS) and an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM). This study provides information on dominant sources of POA and reports the total SOA contribution to total OA at three different sites in Delhi. The dominant sources of POA observed in this study were related to traffic and solid fuel combustion. Another important observation was a strong diurnal variation in the relative contribution of POA vs. SOA where POA sources dominated the total OA during nighttime and SOA dominated the total OA during daytime. A large contribution of SOA to total OA during daytime hours is an important observation and has implications for public health concerns as SOA has been found to have greater toxicity compared to POA. The second study of this thesis aims to address the important questions related to the contribution of individual sources of SOA in Delhi. SOA source resolution has historically been inaccessible due to instrument limitations. Here we present the first field deployment in Delhi of a recently developed extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (EESI-TOF), which provides novel real-time near-molecular measurements of the OA composition suitable for separating individual SOA sources. Source apportionment analysis resolved four different SOA sources namely aromatic SOA, biogenic SOA, aged biomass burning, and mixed urban SOA. A dominant contribution from aromatic SOA to total SOA was observed during daytime whereas biogenic SOA and aged biomass burning were the largest contributors to SOA during nighttime. As aromatic SOA was shown to be the dominant SOA component during daytime in Delhi, the third study of this thesis was designed to probe the chemical composition and evolution of SOA formed by the reaction of a mixture of aromatic VOCs (volatile organic compounds) with OH and NO3 radicals using smog chamber experiments. The VOC mixture consisted of toluene (C7H8), ethylbenzene (C8H10), tri-methylbenzene (C9H12), phenol (C6H6O), cresol (C7H8O), 2,6-dimethylphenol (C8H10O) and 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (C9H12O). The ratios of toluene (C7H8), ethylbenzene (C8H10), and tri-methylbenzene (C9H12) used in this mixture were similar to the ratios of these VOCs found in the daytime traffic-related factor in a recent VOC source apportionment study in Delhi. Substituted aromatics i.e., phenol (C6H6O), cresol (C7H8O), 2,6-dimethylphenol (C8H10O), and 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (C9H12O) were added in equal amounts. This study provided a comparison of the chemical composition and evolution of SOA formed from the above mentioned VOCs with OH and NO3 radicals. SOA from the oxidation of the aromatics with NO3 was dominated by high molecular weight, CxHyOzN1-2 type dimer species attributed to RO¬2 + RO2 reactions, whereas SOA from the oxidation with OH was dominated by CxHyOz type monomer species most likely formed as a result of RO2 + NO and RO2 + HO2 reactions. High time-resolution measurements allowed us to observe a rapid change in the SOA composition in the experiments with NO3 even after the complete consumption of the reactive VOCs, indicating the importance of particle-phase reactions and the dynamic nature of SOA composition. The chemical composition of SOA formed with OH was relatively stable over the course of experiments which, however, might be due to different experimental protocols where OH experiments had continuous gas-phase chemistry happening and thus probably replenishing the products/species which were transformed due to particle-phase reactions. Overall, this study provided a detailed comparison of the SOA composition between OH and NO3 systems and laid down the importance of particle-phase reactions in determining the SOA composition at a particular time coordinate.   Overall, this thesis quantified the relative importance of POA vs. SOA during different times of the day at an urban site in Delhi and revealed that POA sources such as traffic and biomass burning dominate the total OA mass during nighttime and that SOA dominates the total OA mass during daytime. Moreover, high chemical resolution information provided by the EESI-TOF allowed us to determine that aromatic SOA and mixed urban SOA are the dominant contributors of total SOA during daytime while biogenic SOA and aged biomass burning are dominant SOA sources during nighttime. A detailed characterization of SOA composition from aromatic VOC oxidation by OH and NO3 radicals was also performed, as a valuable asset in understanding the process of SOA formation and evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000568669",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/568669","en","ETH Zurich",,,"source apportionment||Atmospheric chemistry||Analytical chemistry||mass spectrometry||extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry||Positive matrix factorisation (PMF)||atmospheric aerosols||secondary organic aerosol||Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)||air pollution||Environmental science","Source apportionment and compositional analysis of organic aerosols in Delhi, India, using novel soft ionization mass spectrometric methods","Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2022-09-03T19:33:53Z","2023-09-05",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"28180",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These factors raise questions about the confidence in present sampling strategies and associated machine learning (ML) reconstructions. Previous studies have not yielded a clear understanding of the origin of uncertainties and biases for the reconstructions of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) at the surface ocean (pCO(2)(ocean)). We examine these questions through a series of semi-idealized observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) using a high-resolution (+/- 10 km) coupled physical and biogeochemical model (NEMO-PISCES, Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean, Pelagic Interactions Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies). Here we choose 1 year of the model sub-domain of 10 degrees of latitude (40-50 degrees S) by 20 degrees of longitude (10 degrees W-10 degrees E). This domain is crossed by the sub-Antarctic front and thus includes both the sub-Antarctic zone and the polar frontal zone in the south-east Atlantic Ocean, which are the two most sampled sub-regions of the Southern Ocean. We show that while this sub-domain is small relative to the Southern Ocean scales, it is representative of the scales of variability we aim to examine. The OSSEs simulated the observational scales of pCO(2)(ocean) in ways that are comparable to existing ocean CO2 observing platforms (ships, Wave Gliders, carbon floats, Saildrones) in terms of their temporal sampling scales and not necessarily their spatial ones. The pCO(2) reconstructions were carried out using a two-member ensemble approach that consisted of two machine learning (ML) methods, (1) the feed-forward neural network and (2) the gradient boosting machines. The baseline data were from the ship-based simulations mimicking ship-based observations from the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT). For each of the sampling-scale scenarios, we applied the two-member ensemble method to reconstruct the full sub-domain pCO(2)(ocean). The reconstruction skill was then assessed through a statistical comparison of reconstructed pCO(2) cean and the model domain mean. The analysis shows that uncertainties and biases for pCO(2)(ocean) reconstructions are very sensitive to both the spatial and the temporal scales of pCO(2) sampling in the model domain. The four key findings from our investigation are as follows: (1) improving ML-based pCO(2) reconstructions in the Southern Ocean requires simultaneous high-resolution observations (<3 d) of the seasonal cycle of the meridional gradients of pCO(2)(ocean); (2) Saildrones stand out as the optimal platforms to simultaneously address these requirements; (3) Wave Gliders with hourly/daily resolution in pseudomooring mode improve on carbon floats (10 d period), which suggests that sampling aliases from the 10 d sampling period might have a greater negative impact on their uncertainties, biases, and reconstruction means; and (4) the present seasonal sampling biases (towards summer) in SOCAT data in the Southern Ocean may be behind a significant winter bias in the reconstructed seasonal cycle of pCO(2)(ocean).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000570249","1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-19-4171-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/570249","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The sensitivity of pCO(2) reconstructions to sampling scales across a Southern Ocean sub-domain: a semi-idealized ocean sampling simulation approach","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-13T06:18:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Our common future ocean – quantifying coupled cycles of carbon, oxygen, and nutrients for determining and achieving safe operating spaces with respect to tipping points","820989","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85140636604",,"000850452900001",,"17","Biogeosciences","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Assessing extent and rates of oxidative biodegradation processes in natural and engineered environments, however, is particularly challenging. Oxygenated reaction products are typically metabolized further and the quantification of transient hydroxylated products is a complex analytical task. Moreover, rates of oxygenation follow complex reaction kinetics that require consideration of O2 activation steps prior to enzyme-substrate interactions. Finally, microorganisms are known to adapt their metabolism to the presence of anthropogenic contaminants, in part, as a consequence of oxidative stress, thus enabling biotransformation of contaminants previously considered recalcitrant. Despite the paramount importance of enzymatic contaminant oxygenation reactions, their catalytic cycles are understood only poorly. Critical aspects for enzymatic interactions with organic contaminants, such as the unproductive activation of O2 and generation of reactive oxygen species, are even overlooked completely in mechanistic descriptions. It was the goal of this thesis to elucidate the role of such O2 uncoupling for assessing the biodegradation of organic compounds. To that end, this study focused on Rieske dioxygenases, a sub- class of non-heme ferrous iron dioxygenases, that is responsible for the initial steps of biodegradation of aromatic moieties in a broad range of environmental contaminants. The specific objectives of this work were (i) to identify the reactions leading to O2 uncoupling in the catalytic cycles of Rieske dioxygenases, (ii) to assess the relevance of the O2 uncoupling phenomenon through systematic evaluation of a broad range of enzyme-substrate combinations, and (iii) to test the hypothesis of enzymatic adaptation to new substrates as a response to the generation of reactive oxygen species from O2 uncoupling. The three objectives were examined in laboratory enzyme assays of differ- ent nitroarene dioxygenases, a class of Rieske dioxygenases capable of dioxygenating nitroaromatic contaminants. Using nitrobenzene dioxygenase (NBDO) as a prototypical Rieske dioxygenase, we established experimental procedures for quantifying mass- and electron balances as well as for assessing the rate-limiting steps of O2 activation and nitroaromatic substrate hydroxylation. O2 uncoupling was quantified on the basis of the consumption of O2 and aromatic substrates vs. the formation of nitrite and substituted catechols. The rate-limiting steps of O2 activation in the presence of different nitroaromatic substrates were inferred from 18O kinetic isotope effects (18O KIEs) of dissolved O2, whereas 13C kinetic isotope effects (13C KIEs) of nitroaromatic compounds were used as probes for the timing of substrate hydroxylation. All 18O KIEs of O2 determined in this study were confined to values between 1.012 and 1.021 that are indicative of O2 activation as FeIII-(hydro)peroxo species. Conversely, the magnitude of 13C KIEs for ten different substrates of NBDO correlated with the increasing extent of O2 uncoupling. These ob- servations enabled us to postulate a catalytic mechanism for nitroarene dioxygenases, in which O2 uncoupling with release of unreacted substrate occurs after the rate-limiting step of O2 activation as FeIII-(hydro)peroxo species. These Fe-oxygen species also initi- ate the following asynchronous hydroxylation of the aromatic moieties. The comparison of O2 uncoupling with methylated, fluorinated, chlorinated, and hydroxylated nitrobenzene isomers, and nitrobenzene as substrates of NBDO and 2- nitrotoluene dioxygenase (2NTDO) revealed the enzyme- and substrate-specificity of unproductive O2 activation. O2 uncoupling ranged from 2% to 100% for both enzymes and can thus constitute the primary enzyme activity. We did not observe any correlation of O2 uncoupling for the various substrates of NBDO and 2NTDO. NBDO hydroxylates meta-substituted substrates most efficiently, whereas 2NTDO favours hydroxylation of ortho-substituted compounds. This enzyme-substrate specificity could be due to distinct active site residues controlling substrate positioning in the two enzymes. Our data also implies that the O2 uncoupling and hydroxylation activity of nitroarene dioxygenases cannot be assessed from simple structure-reactivity relationships. The extent of O2 uncoupling quantified in enzyme assays facilitates the characteriza- tion of adaptation of microorganisms expressing Rieske dioxygenases to new substrates. Using wild-type 2NTDO from Acidovorax sp. strain JS42 as well as mutant enzymes that have evolved towards 3- and 4-nitrotoluene in laboratory evolution experiments, we found that the mutant nitroarene dioxygenases increased their efficiency in the hydrox- ylation of the new substrates over the course of adaptation. O2 uncoupling observed in vitro also match observations related to improved microbial growth determined in vivo after adaptation. Our data suggest indirectly that the poor efficiencies of O2 ac- tivation concomitant with the generation and release of reactive oxygen species could be a critical factor in the emergence and selection of mutations that result in the ability of microorganisms to grow on new substrates. The positions of point mutations in the adapted enzymes in proximity to the active site did not allow conclusions on the molecular causes of changes in the efficiency of O2 activation. The outcome of this study illustrates that unproductive O2 activation with release of the unreacted substrate and reactive oxygen species represents a critical path in the catalytic cycle of Rieske dioxygenases with general relevance for assessing oxida- tive biodegradation of organic contaminants. Occurrence of O2 uncoupling precludes the assessment of biotransformation rates on the basis of simple structure-reactivity relationships. Our findings warrant future studies on the specific consequences of re- active oxygen species generated from O2 uncoupling in cellular systems as well as the adaptation of Rieske dioxygenases upon exposure to substrate mixtures to establish the mechanistic link between enzyme activity and the evolution of oxidative biodegradation pathways.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000564065",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/564065","en","ETH Zurich",,,"AROMATISCHE UMWELTSCHADSTOFFE||DEGRADATION, DECOMPOSITION, TRANSFORMATION, PERSISTENCE OF POLLUTANTS (ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS)||ISOTOPENFRAKTIONIERUNG (PHYSIK VON MOLEKULARSYSTEMEN)||ENZYMKINETIK (BIOCHEMIE)||ABBAU, ZERSETZUNG, UMWANDLUNG, PERSISTENZ VON UMWELTSCHADSTOFFEN (UMWELTPROBLEME)||BIOLOGICAL OXIDATIONS + OXIDATIVE DEGRADATIONS (BIOCHEMISTRY)||ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION (PHYSICS OF MOLECULAR SYSTEMS)||BIOCHEMISCHE OXIDATIONEN + OXIDATIVER ABBAU (BIOCHEMIE)||ENZYME KINETICS (BIOCHEMISTRY)||AROMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS||ENZYME ADAPTATION","The Role of Oxygen Uncoupling by Rieske Non-Heme Iron Dioxygenases in the Biodegradation of Aromatic Contaminants","Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2022-08-16T09:15:09Z","2024-08-15",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"28414",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The rates and pathways of iron mineral transformation processes have been studied intensely in model systems such as mixed suspensions, but transformation in complex heterogeneous porous media is not well understood. Here, mesh bags containing 0.5 g of ferrihydrite were incubated in five water-saturated paddy soils with contrasting microbial iron-reduction potential for up to twelve weeks. Using X-ray diffraction analysis, we show near-complete transformation of the ferrihydrite to lepidocrocite and goethite within six weeks in the soil with the highest iron(ii) release, and slower transformation with higher ratios of goethite to lepidocrocite in soils with lower iron(ii) release. In the least reduced soil, no mineral transformations were observed. In soils where ferrihydrite transformation occurred, the transformation rate was one to three orders of magnitude slower than transformation in comparable mixed-suspension studies. To interpret the spatial distribution of ferrihydrite and its transformation products, we developed a novel application of confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy in which we identified and mapped minerals on selected cross sections of mesh bag contents. After two weeks of flooded incubation, ferrihydrite was still abundant in the core of some mesh bags, and as a rim at the mineral-soil interface. The reacted outer core contained unevenly mixed ferrihydrite, goethite and lepidocrocite on the micrometre scale. The slower rate of transformation and uneven distribution of product minerals highlight the influence of biogeochemically complex matrices and diffusion processes on the transformation of minerals, and the importance of studying iron mineral transformation in environmental media.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000572789","2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/d2em00290f","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572789","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Ferrihydrite transformations in flooded paddy soils: rates, pathways, and product spatial distributions","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-27T03:03:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85139847498",,"000856042500001","Environ Sci Process Impacts","10","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Analyses of porewater and sediment samples from the 1461-m core recovered at IODP Expedition 351, Site U1438, included major and trace elements, strontium radiogenic isotope ratio (Sr-87/Sr-86), and taxonomic identification of archaeal classes and bacterial orders. Sediment X-ray diffraction and thin section analyses show that smectite, zeolites and chlorite are the main authigenic minerals. A multicomponent solute diffusion and reaction numerical model was developed to simulate the long-term diagenesis that took place in this sedimentary sequence and to account for the transition to a calcium chloride brine at about 670 mbsf. Numerical results indicate that 45% of the initial amount of volcanic ash has been dissolved at 750 mbsf. At this depth, 13% of the initial water (H2O) in the pore space is estimated to have been transferred to the solid phase by the formation of zeolites, which accounts for an increase in porewater chloride concentration. In contrast, dissolution of anorthite and volcanic ash combined with sodium uptake by zeolites accounts for the predominance of calcium in the brine. In the upper 160 m of the sedimentary column, the electrochemical migration of solutes causes chloride to move in the opposite direction of the concentration gradient, i.e., uphill diffusion, sustaining downward diffusion of seawater chloride into the sediments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576089","2296-6463",,"10.3389/feart.2022.869567","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576089","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","volcanic ash||zeolites||electrochemical migration||reaction-diffusion model||PHREEQC||deep-sea oligotrophic prokaryotes","Formation of calcium chloride brines in volcaniclastic-rich sediments","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-16T02:54:37Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85140650400",,"000864028200001","Front.
