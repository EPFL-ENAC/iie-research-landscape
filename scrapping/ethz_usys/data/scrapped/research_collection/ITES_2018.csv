Drawing on a dataset of >135,000 trees from the Peruvian Amazon, we assessed its manifestation in biomass accumulation and seed production of Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) which plays a keystone role in carbon sequestration and NTFP harvesting in Amazonia. For the first time, we find both negative and positive effects of conspecific proximity on seed production and above ground biomass at small and large nearest neighbour distances, respectively. Plausible explanations for negative effects at small distances are fine-scale genetic structuring and competition for shared resources, whereas positive effects at large distances are likely due to increasing pollen limitation and suboptimal growth conditions. Finally, findings suggest that most field plots in Amazonia used for estimating carbon storage are too small to account for distance and density-dependent effects and hence may be inadequate for measuring species-centric ecosystem services.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000282079","2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-018-29886-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/282079","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Fine-scale processes shape ecosystem service provision by an Amazonian hyperdominant tree species",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-08-13T08:05:49Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85051065183",,"000440670200053","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is assumed that statistical proximity indicates similar provenance, but this assumption often remains untested. Especially for small areas with high topographic complexity, it is unknown to what extent statistical proximity and geographical provenance are correlated.  In this paper, dendro-provenancing is framed as a search for statistical Nearest Neighbors. The ‘k-Nearest Neighbors leave one-out cross-validation’ process (k-NN) is proposed as a method for validating dendro-provenancing approaches. Furthermore, it allows researchers to consistently compare and evaluate different proximity measures with respect to their suitability for dendro-provenancing. The validation process is demonstrated on a data set of 401 ring-width series of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) encompassing 15 sites along elevational gradients in north-eastern Switzerland. Moreover, a new type of plot, the so-called scissor plot, is introduced to visualize the k-NN validation process.  Results indicate that dendro-provenancing depends heavily on differences in between sites high-frequency signal. Mean classification success for the relevant stages of the k-NN (CSR¯open)1 ranged from 71.8% to 79.2% for the best performing measures. Classification errors occurred mainly between sites at elevations of 1000–1198 m a.s.l. At all other elevations and between different regions of the study area, only moderate differences in classification performance were detected. Thus, the results indicate that dendro-provenancing may be principally feasible even in a small region as studied here.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302568",,,"10.1016/j.dendro.2018.09.008","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302568","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Dendrochronology||Method||Cross-validation||Nearest neighbor classiﬁcation||Elevational transect||Proximity measure","Evaluating the key assumptions underlying dendro-provenancing: How to spruce it up with a scissor plot",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-11-09T06:01:42Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85054928025",,"000451071500015",,,"Dendrochronologia","52","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In order to better understand streamflow-generating mechanisms, two-component hydrograph separation studies often seek to relate the event-water fraction Qe∕Q to storm characteristics or antecedent wetness conditions. However, these relationships may be obscured because the same factors that influence Qe also necessarily influence total discharge Q as well. Here we propose that the fractions of event water and pre-event water relative to total precipitation (Qe∕P and Qpe∕P), instead of total discharge, provide useful alternative tools for studying catchment storm responses. These two quantities separate the well-known runoff coefficient (Q∕P, i.e., the ratio between total discharge and precipitation volumes over the event timescale) into its contributions from event water and pre-event water. Whereas the runoff coefficient Q∕P quantifies how strongly precipitation inputs affect streamflow, the fractions Qe∕P and Qpe∕P track the sources of this streamflow response.  We use high-frequency measurements of stable water isotopes for 24 storm events at a steep headwater catchment (Erlenbach, central Switzerland) to compare the storm-to-storm variations in Qe/Q,Qe/P and Qpe∕P. Our analysis explores how storm characteristics and antecedent wetness conditions affect the mobilization of event water and pre-event water at the catchment scale. Isotopic hydrograph separation shows that catchment outflow was typically dominated by pre-event water, although event water exceeded 50 % of discharge for several storms. No clear relationships were found linking either storm characteristics or antecedent wetness conditions with the volumes of event water or pre-event water (Qe, Qpe), or with event water as a fraction of discharge (Qe∕Q), beyond the unsurprising correlation of larger storms with greater Qe and greater total Q. By contrast, event water as a fraction of precipitation (Qe∕P) was strongly correlated with storm volume and intensity but not with antecedent wetness, implying that the volume of event water that is transmitted to streamflow increases more than proportionally with storm size under both wet and dry conditions. Conversely, pre-event water as a fraction of precipitation (Qpe∕P) was strongly correlated with all measures of antecedent wetness but not with storm characteristics, implying that wet conditions primarily facilitate the mobilization of old (pre-event) water, rather than the fast transmission of new (event) water to streamflow, even at a catchment where runoff coefficients can be large.  Thus, expressing event- and pre-event-water volumes as fractions of precipitation rather than discharge was more insightful for investigating the Erlenbach catchment's hydrological behaviour. If Qe∕P and Qpe∕P exhibit similar relationships with storm characteristics and antecedent wetness conditions in other catchments, we suggest that these patterns may potentially be useful as diagnostic “fingerprints” of catchment storm response.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000305902","1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-22-5847-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/305902","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Studying catchment storm response using event- and pre-event-water volumes as fractions of precipitation rather than discharge",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-11-24T15:46:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85056599334",,"000449995800003","Hydrol.

In Madagascar, where forest decentralization has been implemented since the 1990s to spur local resource users’ involvement in management processes, impacts remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate farmers’ perceptions and practices regarding forest use under various forest governance systems, using a participatory gaming approach implemented in the Zahamena region of Madagascar. We report on (i) the conceptual models of the Zahamena socio-ecological system; (ii) the actual research tool in the form of a tabletop role-playing game; and (iii) main outcomes of the gaming workshops and accompanying research. The results allow the linking of game reality with real-world perceptions based on game debriefing discussions and game workshop follow-up surveys, as well as interviews and focus group research with other natural resource users from the study area. Results show that the Zahamena protected area plays the role of buffer zone by slowing down deforestation and degradation. However, this fragile barrier and CBNRM are not long-term solutions in the face of occurring changes. Rather, the solution lies in one of the main causes of the problem: agriculture. Further use of tools such as participatory gaming is recommended to enhance knowledge exchange and the development of common visions for the future of natural resource management to foster resilience of forest governance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302488","1999-4907",,"10.3390/f9100624","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302488","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","participatory modeling||role-playing games||stakeholder engagement||transdisciplinary research||slash-and-burn agriculture||deforestation||forest degradation||community-based forest management","Approaching local perceptions of forest governance and livelihood challenges with companion modeling from a case study around Zahamena National Park, Madagascar",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-11-09T05:53:52Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85054741516",,"000448550700043",,"10","Forests","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The absence of an objective and practical definition of species recovery that is applicable across taxonomic groups leads to inconsistent targets in recovery plans and frustrates reporting and maximization of conservation impact. We devised a framework for comprehensively assessing species recovery and conservation success. We propose a definition of a fully recovered species that emphasizes viability, ecological functionality, and representation; and use counterfactual approaches to quantify degree of recovery. This allowed us to calculate a set of 4 conservation metrics that demonstrate impacts of conservation efforts to date (conservation legacy); identify dependence of a species on conservation actions (conservation dependence); quantify expected gains resulting from conservation action in the medium term (conservation gain); and specify requirements to achieve maximum plausible recovery over the long term (recovery potential). These metrics can incentivize the establishment and achievement of ambitious conservation targets. We illustrate their use by applying the framework to a vertebrate, an invertebrate, and a woody and an herbaceous plant. Our approach is a preliminary framework for an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Green List of Species, which was mandated by a resolution of IUCN members in 2012. Although there are several challenges in applying our proposed framework to a wide range of species, we believe its further development, implementation, and integration with the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species will help catalyze a positive and ambitious vision for conservation that will drive sustained conservation action.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000295559","0888-8892||1523-1739",,"10.1111/cobi.13112","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/295559","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","conservation impact||conservation optimism||recovered species||red lists||Saiga tatarica||threatened species","Quantifying species recovery and conservation success to develop an IUCN Green List of Species",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-10-12T16:48:06Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85045702321",,"000445181300015","Conserv.

Quantifying and understanding how water cycles through the Earth's critical zone is important to provide society and policymakers with the scientific background to manage water resources sustainably, especially considering the ever-increasing worldwide concern about water scarcity. Stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in water have proven to be a powerful tool for tracking water fluxes in the critical zone. However, both mechanistic complexities (e.g. mixing and fractionation processes, heterogeneity of natural systems) and methodological issues (e.g. lack of standard protocols to sample specific compartments, such as soil water and xylem water) limit the application of stable water isotopes in critical-zone science. In this commentary, we examine some of the opportunities and critical challenges of isotope-based ecohydrological applications and outline new perspectives focused on interdisciplinary research opportunities for this important tool in water and environmental science.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302384","1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-15-6399-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302384","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ideas and perspectives: Tracing terrestrial ecosystem water fluxes using hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes - challenges and opportunities from an interdisciplinary perspective",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-11-09T05:24:28Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85055813997",,"000448694100003",,"21","Biogeosciences","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although most industrial oil palm plantations are located in Southeast Asia, it is argued that much of their future expansion will occur in Africa. We assessed how this could affect the continent’s primates by combining information on oil palm suitability and current land use with primate distribution, diversity, and vulnerability. We also quantified the potential impact of large-scale oil palm cultivation on primates in terms of range loss under different expansion scenarios taking into account future demand, oil palm suitability, human accessibility, carbon stock, and primate vulnerability. We found a high overlap between areas of high oil palm suitability and areas of high conservation priority for primates. Overall, we found only a few small areas where oil palm could be cultivated in Africa with a low impact on primates (3.3 Mha, including all areas suitable for oil palm). These results warn that, consistent with the dramatic effects of palm oil cultivation on biodiversity in Southeast Asia, reconciling a large-scale development of oil palm in Africa with primate conservation will be a great challenge.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000286961","0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.1804775115","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/286961","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","oil palm||primate||vulnerability||biodiversity||biofuel","Small room for compromise between oil palm cultivation and primate conservation in Africa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-09-05T02:44:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000442861600062","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","35","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","115","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Native forests on oceanic islands are important refugia for endemic species, many of which are rare and highly threatened. Long-term monitoring schemes for those biota and ecosystems are urgently needed: (i) to provide quantitative baselines for detecting changes within island ecosystems, (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation and management actions, and (iii) to identify general ecological patterns and processes using multiple island systems as repeated ‘natural experiments’. In this contribution, we call for a Global Island Monitoring Scheme (GIMS) for monitoring the remaining native island forests, using bryophytes, vascular plants, selected groups of arthropods and vertebrates as model taxa. As a basis for the GIMS, we also present new, optimized monitoring protocols for bryophytes and arthropods that were developed based on former standardized inventory protocols. Effective inventorying and monitoring of native island forests will require: (i) permanent plots covering diverse ecological gradients (e.g. elevation, age of terrain, anthropogenic disturbance); (ii) a multiple-taxa approach that is based on standardized and replicable protocols; (iii) a common set of indicator taxa and community properties that are indicative of native island forests’ welfare, building on, and harmonized with existing sampling and monitoring efforts; (iv) capacity building and training of local researchers, collaboration and continuous dialogue with local stakeholders; and (v) long-term commitment by funding agencies to maintain a global network of native island forest monitoring plots.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000268507","1572-9710||0960-3115",,"10.1007/s10531-018-1553-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268507","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Beta-diversity||Ecological gradients||Forest monitoring protocols||Island conservation||Long-term monitoring||Sampling standardization","Global Island Monitoring Scheme (GIMS): a proposal for the long-term coordinated survey and monitoring of native island forest biota",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-06-08T07:04:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85046550641",,"000436794700007",,"10","Biodiversity and Conservation","27","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Seedling emergence and early establishment in treatment and in control plots were monitored over two years. Tree seedling emergence occurred at and several hundred metres above the current treeline when viable seeds and suitable microsites for germination were available. However, dense vegetation cover at lower elevations and winter mortality at higher elevations particularly limited early recruitment. Post-dispersal predation, species, and provenance also affected emergence and early establishment. This study demonstrates the importance of understanding multiple abiotic and biotic drivers of early seedling recruitment that should be incorporated into predictions of treeline dynamics under climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000279516","2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-018-28808-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/279516","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Biotic and abiotic drivers of tree seedling recruitment across an alpine treeline ecotone",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-07-31T04:46:51Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85050339836",,"000439026000055","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Natural populations deliver a wide range of products that provide income for millions of people and need to be exploited sustainably. Large heterogeneity in individual performance within these exploited populations has the potential to improve population recovery after exploitation and thus help sustain yields over time.  2. We explored the potential of using individual heterogeneity to design smarter harvest schemes, by sparing individuals that contribute most to future productivity and population growth, using the understorey palm Chamaedorea elegans as a model system. Leaves of this palm are an important non‐timber forest product and long‐term inter‐individual growth variability can be evaluated from internode lengths.  3. We studied a population of 830 individuals, half of which was subjected to a 67% defoliation treatment for 3 years. We measured effects of defoliation on vital rates and leaf size—a trait that determines marketability. We constructed integral projection models in which vital rates depended on stem length, past growth rate and defoliation and evaluated transient population dynamics to quantify population development and leaf yield. We then simulated scenarios in which we spared individuals that were either most important for population growth or had leaves smaller than marketable size.  4. Individuals varying in size or past growth rate responded similar to leaf harvesting in terms of growth and reproduction. By contrast, a reduction in survival chance was smaller in large individuals than in small ones. Simulations showed that harvest‐induced population decline was greatly reduced when sparing individuals from size and past growth classes that contributed most to population growth. Under this scenario, cumulative leaf harvest over 20 years was somewhat reduced, but long‐term leaf production was sustained. A threefold increase in leaf yield was generated when individuals with small leaves were spared.  5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates the potential to create smarter systems of palm leaf harvest by accounting for individual heterogeneity within exploited populations. Sparing individuals that contribute most to population growth ensured sustained leaf production over time. The concepts and methods presented here are generally applicable to exploited plant and animal species which exhibit considerable individual heterogeneity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000271737","0021-8901||1365-2664",,"10.1111/1365-2664.13100","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/271737","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Chamaedorea||forest management||harvest simulations||individual heterogeneity||Integral projection model||leaf harvesting||non‐timber forest product||palm leaves||population dynamics||sustainability","Towards smarter harvesting from natural palm populations by sparing the individuals that contribute most to population growth or productivity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-06-22T13:59:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85042123863",,"000434970200012","J.

However, it is not well understood how heterogeneity in physical channel form, particularly in relation to and caused by in‐stream woody debris, regulates stream metabolism in lowland streams. We combined conservative and reactive stream tracers to investigate relationships between patterns in stream channel morphology and hydrological transport (form) and metabolic processes as characterized by ecosystem respiration (function) in a forested lowland stream at baseflow. Stream reach‐scale ecosystem respiration was related to locations (“hotspots”) with a high abundance of woody debris. In contrast, nearly all other measured hydrological and geomorphic variables previously documented or hypothesized to influence stream metabolism did not significantly explain ecosystem respiration. Our results suggest the existence of key differences in physical controls on ecosystem respiration between lowland stream systems (this study) and smaller upland streams (most previous studies) under baseflow conditions. As such, these findings have implications for reactive transport models that predict biogeochemical transformation rates from hydraulic transport parameters, for upscaling frameworks that represent biological stream processes at larger network scales, and for the effective management and restoration of aquatic ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000322053","1936-0592||1936-0584",,"10.1002/eco.1952","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322053","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Ecosystem respiration||Hydrological tracer||Solute transport||Stream metabolism||Woody debris","Woody debris is related to reach‐scale hotspots of lowland stream ecosystem respiration under baseflow conditions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2019-01-31T15:02:17Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"5","Ecohydrology","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Thus, Fyw may be a useful metric in catchment inter-comparison studies that investigate landscape and hydro-climatic controls on streamflow generation. Here, we explore how Fyw varies with catchment characteristics and climatic forcing, using an extensive isotope data set from 22 small-to medium-sized (0.7-351 km2) Swiss catchments. We find that flow-weighting the tracer concentrations in streamwater resulted in roughly 26% larger young water fractions compared to the corresponding unweighted values, reflecting the fact that young water fractions tend to be larger when catchments are wet and discharge is correspondingly higher. However, flow-weighted and unweighted young water fractions are strongly correlated with each other among the catchments. They also correlate with terrain, soil, and land-use indices, as well as with mean precipitation and measures of hydrologic response. Within individual catchments, young water fractions increase with discharge, indicating an increase in the proportional contribution of faster flow paths at higher flows. We present a new method to quantify the discharge sensitivity of Fyw, which we estimate as the linear slope of the relationship between the young water fraction and flow. Among the 22 catchments, discharge sensitivities of Fyw are highly variable and only weakly correlated with Fyw itself, implying that these two measures reflect catchment behaviour differently. Based on strong correlations between the discharge sensitivity of Fyw and several catchment characteristics, we suggest that low discharge sensitivities imply greater persistence in the proportions of fast and slow runoff flow paths as catchment wetness changes. In contrast, high discharge sensitivities imply the activation of different dominant flow paths during precipitation events, such as when subsurface water tables rise into more permeable layers and/or the river network expands further into the landscape.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000279714","1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-22-3841-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/279714","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Sensitivity of young water fractions to hydro-climatic forcing and landscape properties across 22 Swiss catchments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-08-01T04:28:02Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85050458010",,"000439274600001","Hydrol.

Whether these networks were formed by groundwater sapping, ice melt, or fluvial runoff has been debated for decades. These different scenarios have profoundly different implications for Mars’ climatic history and thus for its habitability in the distant past. Recent studies on Earth revealed that valley networks in arid landscapes with more surface runoff branch at narrower angles, while in humid environments with more groundwater flow, branching angles are much wider. We find that valley networks on Mars generally tend to branch at narrow angles similar to those found in arid landscapes on Earth. This result supports the inference that Mars once had an active hydrologic cycle and that Mars’ valley networks were formed primarily by overland flow erosion, with groundwater seepage playing only a minor role.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000274382","2375-2548","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/321630||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/274382","10.1126/sciadv.aar6692","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322167","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Branching geometry of valley networks on Mars and Earth and its implications for early Martian climate",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-07-06T16:07:05Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85049167143",,"000443175500036","Sci Adv","6","Science Advances","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Efforts to protect and restore the remaining forests of Borneo hinge on recognizing the ecosystem services they provide, including their ability to store and sequester carbon. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a remote sensing technology that allows forest structural properties to be captured in great detail across vast geographic areas. In recent years ALS has been integrated into statewide assessments of forest carbon in Neotropical and African regions, but not yet in Asia. For this to happen new regional models need to be developed for estimating carbon stocks from ALS in tropical Asia, as the forests of this region are structurally and compositionally distinct from those found elsewhere in the tropics. By combining ALS imagery with data from 173 permanent forest plots spanning the lowland rainforests of Sabah on the island of Borneo, we develop a simple yet general model for estimating forest carbon stocks using ALS-derived canopy height and canopy cover as input metrics. An advanced feature of this new model is the propagation of uncertainty in both ALS- and ground-based data, allowing uncertainty in hectare-scale estimates of carbon stocks to be quantified robustly. We show that the model effectively captures variation in aboveground carbon stocks across extreme disturbance gradients spanning tall dipterocarp forests and heavily logged regions and clearly outperforms existing ALS-based models calibrated for the tropics, as well as currently available satellite-derived products. Our model provides a simple, generalized and effective approach for mapping forest carbon stocks in Borneo and underpins ongoing efforts to safeguard and facilitate the restoration of its unique tropical forests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000274352","1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-15-3811-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/274352","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Estimating aboveground carbon density and its uncertainty in Borneo's structurally complex tropical forests using airborne laser scanning",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-07-06T14:22:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85049195167",,"000435954900001",,"12","Biogeosciences","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, while OP-induced carbon emissions and biodiversity losses have received significant attention, OP water requirements have been marginalized and little is known on the ecohydrological changes (water and surface energy fluxes) occurring from forest clearing to plantation maturity. Numerical simulations supported by field observations from seven sites in Southeast Asia (five OP plantations and two tropical forests) are used here to illustrate the temporal evolution of OP actual evapotranspiration (ET), infiltration/runoff, gross primary productivity (GPP) and surface temperature as well as their changes relative to tropical forests. Model results from large-scale commercial plantations show that young OP plantations decrease ecosystem ET, causing hotter and drier climatic conditions, but mature plantations (age > 8−9 yr) have higher GPP and transpire more water (up to +7.7%) than the forests they have replaced. This is the result of physiological constraints on water use efficiency and the extremely high yield of OP (six to ten times higher than other oil crops). Hence, the land use efficiency of mature OP, i.e. the high productivity per unit of land area, comes at the expense of water consumption in a trade of water for carbon that may jeopardize local water resources. Sequential replanting and herbaceous ground cover can reduce the severity of such ecohydrological changes and support local water/climate regulation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000273156","1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aac54e","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/273156","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","oil palm plantations||tropical forests||carbon/water fluxes||biophysical modeling","Ecohydrological changes after tropical forest conversion to oil palm",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-06-30T03:31:23Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Oil Palm Adaptive Landscapes (OPAL)","152019","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","r4d - Ecosystems: Gesuch",,,,"85049784761",,"000435633600002","Environ.

Evaporation leaves a characteristic signature on the isotopic composition of the water that is left behind, such that in dual-isotope space, evaporated waters plot below the local meteoric water line (LMWL) that characterizes precipitation. Soil and xylem water samples can often plot below the LMWL as well, suggesting that they have also been influenced by evaporation. These soil and xylem water samples frequently plot along linear trends in dual-isotope space. These trend lines are often termed ""evaporation lines"" and their intersection with the LMWL is often interpreted as the isotopic composition of the precipitation source water. Here we use numerical experiments based on established isotope fractionation theory to show that these trend lines are often by-products of the seasonality in evaporative fractionation and in the isotopic composition of precipitation. Thus, they are often not true evaporation lines, and, if interpreted as such, can yield highly biased estimates of the isotopic composition of the source water.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000266434","1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-22-2881-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/266434","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Effects of climatic seasonality on the isotopic composition of evaporating soil waters",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-05-30T05:06:40Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85047090879",,"000432362200001","Hydrol.

Van Valen’s seminal work from 1973 proposed the “Law of constant extinction,” which states that the probability of extinction of taxa is not dependent on their age. This assumption of age-independent extinction has prevailed for decades with its assessment based on survivorship curves, which, however, do not directly account for the incompleteness of the fossil record, and have rarely been applied at the species level. Here, we present a Bayesian framework to estimate extinction rates from the fossil record accounting for age-dependent extinction (ADE). Our approach, unlike previous implementations, explicitly models unobserved species and accounts for the effects of fossil preservation on the observed longevity of sampled lineages. We assess the performance and robustness of our method through extensive simulations and apply it to a fossil data set of terrestrial Carnivora spanning the past 40 myr. We find strong evidence of ADE, as we detect the extinction rate to be highest in young species and declining with increasing species age. For comparison, we apply a recently developed analogous ADE model to a dated phylogeny of extant Carnivora. Although the phylogeny-based analysis also infers ADE, it indicates that the extinction rate, instead, increases with increasing taxon age. The estimated mean species longevity also differs substantially, with the fossil-based analyses estimating 2.0 myr, in contrast to 9.8 myr derived from the phylogeny-based inference. Scrutinizing these discrepancies, we find that both fossil and phylogeny-based ADE models are prone to high error rates when speciation and extinction rates increase or decrease through time. However, analyses of simulated and empirical data show that fossil-based inferences are more robust. This study shows that an accurate estimation of ADE from incomplete fossil data is possible when the effects of preservation are jointly modeled, thus allowing for a reassessment of Van Valen’s model as a general rule in macroevolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000268293","1063-5157||1076-836X",,"10.1093/sysbio/syx082","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268293","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Age-dependent extinction||diversification||macroevolution||PyRate||Bayesian inference","Estimating Age-Dependent Extinction: Contrasting Evidence from Fossils and Phylogenies",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-06-08T05:02:14Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85043490262",,"000433058600007","Syst Biol","3","Systematic Biology","67","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This  study  is  part  ofthe interregional IAEA Technical Cooperation Project INT5153 “Assessing the Impact of Climate Change and itsEffects on Soil and Water Resources in Polar and Mountainous Regions” and aims to elucidate driving factors(climatic  versus  geochemical)  of  soil  organic  carbon  (SOC)  stabilization  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  alongaltitudinal transects in different mountain regions.We present novel data from altitudinal transects of four different mountain regions (Zongo, Cordillera Real, Bo-livia; Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania; Gongga, Hengduan Mountains, China; Rauris, Hohe Tauern, Austria). Allaltitudinal transects cover a wide range of natural ecosystems under different climatic (MAT, MAP) and soil geo-chemical parameters. Bulk soil samples (four field replicates per ecosystems) were subjected to a combination ofaggregate and particle-size fractionation followed by organic C, total nitrogen (N), stable isotope (13C,15N) andradiocarbon (14C) analyses of all fractions. Bulk soils were further characterized for their texture, geochemistry(Na, K, Ca, Mg, CECpot, Al, Fe, Mn, Si, pH), nutrient status (NH+4, NO−3, Ptot)and incubated for 63 days to assessgreenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, NO, N2O). Moreover, stable C isotope signatures of CO2were determinedto estimate potential sources of soil respiration (using Keeling plots).Cumulative soil CO2emissions (in gCO2-Ckg−1SOC)were highest for the high altitude grassland and forest sitesof Rauris (25.5-25.8) and lowest for the Kilimanjaro forests (4.8-6.9) as well as Bolivian high altitude grasslands(2.5-4.3). Soil CO2emissions were negatively correlated with SOC content (Pearson correlation coefficient rp=-0.35, p=0.002), showing that soils with low SOC contents release the highest amount of CO2per soil C, possiblydue to large fractions of unprotected SOC and thus low SOC stabilization.Particulate  organic  matter  (POM)  and  sand  content  were  positively  correlated  with  CO2emissions  (rp=0.43,p<0.001  and  rp=0.57,  p<0.001,  respectively)  and  negatively  correlated  with  SOC  content  (rp=-0.61,  p<0.001for sand content), showing that high amounts of POM and/or a sandy soil texture impede SOC storage and supportCO2emissions. In contrast, microaggregates and clay minerals were negatively correlated with CO2emissions(rp=-0.45, p<0.001 and rp=-0.51, p<0.001, respectively) and positively correlated with SOC content (rp=0.84,p<0.001 for clay content), showing their importance for SOC stabilization.Cation exchange capacity (CEC) was positively correlated with SOC content (rp=0.93, p<0.001) and negativelycorrelated with CO2emissions (rp=-0.41, p<0.001). Oppositely, both Si content and the Si/Al ratio were negatively correlated with SOC content (rp=-0.86, p<0.001 and rp=-0.56, p<0.001, respectively) and positively correlatedwith CO2emissions (rp=0.36, p=0.002 and rp=0.34, p=0.003). These relationships point towards an important roleof soil weathering and geochemistry for the potential of soils to store SOC or release CO2.Further results of soil fractionation, greenhouse gas emissions and geochemistry will be presented in conjunctionwith climatic data of the altitudinal transects to elucidate driving factors of SOC (de)stabilization in high altitudemountain regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000394687","1029-7006||1607-7962",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/394687","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Climatic versus geochemical controls on soil organic matter stabilization and greenhouse gas emissions along altitudinal transects in different mountain regions",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,"2020-01-28T08:26:05Z",,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2018","April 8-13, 2018","Vienna, Austria","Sources and proportions of modern and aged organic carbon eroded from soils under different land-use within catchments in Nepal – Insights from compound-specific 13C & 14C analysis and novel mixing models","174300||174300","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Rückkehr CH Advanced Postdoc.Mobility",,,,,,,"GRA",,"Geophysical Research Abstracts","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The respective fluxes of modern (biospheric) and aged OCare poorly constrained, and mechanisms controlling OC export have remained elusive. Recently, the age of riverineOC was found to increase with the proportion of human-dominated landscapes within a catchment, potentially dueto aged soil OC that is mobilized by human disturbance and reintroduced into the modern C cycle (Butman et al.,2015). Furthermore, most previous studies have focused on catchment outlets, whereas a greater within-catchmentfocus will undoubtedly provide further direction to pinpoint locations of aged OC export to the river, and to betterconstrain its impact on the C cycle and aquatic biogeochemistry.This study aims (1) to quantify the sources and proportions of modern versus aged OC exported from soils intoriver systems within a catchment and (2) to investigate if theses sources and proportions of OC are dependent onthe different types of land-use within a catchment. Therefore, bulk14C and compound-specific14C analyses ofvegetation markers (long-chain fatty acids, FAs) in soils under different land-use and suspended river sedimentswill be performed and the proportions of modern versus aged OC determined by application of isotope mixingmodels.The study site is located in the mid-hill region of Nepal within a catchment that exhibits different land-uses includ-ing various types of forest and agricultural land-use. Soils were sampled before and sediments during monsoonseasons. A broad data basis is already available for the content and stable C isotopes (δ13C) of bulk OC and FAs.Fatty acids will be collected in sufficient amounts by preparative gas chromatography and will be analyzed for14Cusing accelerator mass spectrometry. Isotope mixing models that use bulk and compound-specific13C and14Cdata will be applied to estimate the relative contributions of modern versus aged OC.The study will generate an extensive14C dataset of bulk OC and specific vegetation markers in soils under differentland-use and suspended river sediments to provide a within-catchment focus on the mechanisms controlling OCexport from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Combination with the available complementary datasets for13Cof bulk OC and specific vegetation markers will reveal the sources and proportions of modern versus aged OCwithin the catchment. This information is needed to develop accurate constraints on fluvial transfer of modernOC, which is of importance to predict OC fluxes quantitatively as a result of anthropogenic change. The studyfurthermore aims to test whether soils under different land-use export different proportions of modern versus agedOC into river systems and thus determines the responds to human disturbance such as changes in soil management.In summary, our study will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the factors that control the sources,transport pathways and turnover times of terrestrial OC within river systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000394682","1029-7006||1607-7962",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/394682","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Sources and proportions of modern versus aged organic carbon eroded from soils under diﬀerent land-use within a Nepalese catchment – Insights from bulk and compound-speciﬁc 13C & 14C analysis in combination with novel isotope mixing models",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,"2020-01-28T08:16:41Z",,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2018","April 8-13, 2018","Vienna, Austria","Sources and proportions of modern and aged organic carbon eroded from soils under different land-use within catchments in Nepal – Insights from compound-specific 13C & 14C analysis and novel mixing models","174300||174300","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Rückkehr CH Advanced Postdoc.Mobility",,,,,,,"GRA",,"Geophysical Research Abstracts","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study we assessed patterns of FSGS in three species of Dipterocarpaceae (Parashorea tomentella, Shorea leprosula and Shorea parvifolia) across four different tropical rain forests in Malaysia using nuclear microsatellite markers. Topographic heterogeneity varied across the sites. We hypothesised that forests with high topographic heterogeneity would display increased FSGS among the adult populations driven by habitat associations. This hypothesis was not supported for S. leprosula and S. parvifolia which displayed little variation in the intensity and scale of FSGS between sites despite substantial variation in topographic heterogeneity. Conversely, the intensity of FSGS for P. tomentella was greater at a more topographically heterogeneous than a homogeneous site, and a significant difference in the overall pattern of FSGS was detected between sites for this species. These results suggest that local patterns of FSGS may in some species be shaped by habitat heterogeneity in addition to limited gene flow by pollen and seed dispersal. Site factors can therefore contribute to the development of FSGS. Confirming consistency in species’ FSGS amongst sites is an important step in managing timber tree genetic diversity as it provides confidence that species specific management recommendations based on species reproductive traits can be applied across a species’ range. Forest managers should take into account the interaction between reproductive traits and site characteristics, its consequences for maintaining forest genetic resources and how this might influence natural regeneration across species if management is to be sustainable.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000254318","1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0193501","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/254318","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Are patterns of fine-scale spatial genetic structure consistent between sites within tropical tree species?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-03-31T03:03:18Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85044165528",,"000427703500006","PLoS ONE","3","PLoS ONE","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, there is little quantitative knowledge on the factors that are conducive to or hindering spruce establishment on CWD. We examined spruce regeneration on CWD by sampling 303 plots (50 cm × 50 cm each) on 56 downed logs in a virgin forest in the Swiss Alps. Variables describing microsite conditions were measured, and fungi were isolated from wood samples. To investigate the relationship between the ecological factors and establishment success, two models were fitted with seedling and sapling density as response variables, respectively. Besides log diameter, the models identified different ecological factors as significant for seedling and sapling establishment, i.e., regeneration depends on different factors in different development stages. Seedling density depended on the type of rot, log inclination, and decay stage. Sapling density depended mainly on light availability, cover by bark and moss, the time of tree fall, and the distance between the log surface and the forest floor. A total of 22 polypore fungi were isolated from the wood samples, four of them being threatened species. White- and brown-rot fungi were found in all decay stages. The visual assessment of the type of rot in the field corresponded in only 15% of cases to the type of rot caused by the isolated fungi; hence caution is needed when making field assessments of rot types.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000250031","1999-4907",,"10.3390/f9030120","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/250031","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CWD||Picea abies||microsites||deadwood||polypore diversity","Ecological factors influencing norway spruce regeneration on nurse logs in a subalpine virgin forest",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-03-15T03:58:53Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85043260514",,"000428508200023",,"3","Forests","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this paper, we focus on community-based forest management in the inner Terai region of Nepal and explore the role of community and user attributes such as group size, social heterogeneities, forest user’ perception on forests, and affiliation to the user group, in the collective action of managing community forests. Household surveys were carried out with 180 households across twelve community forest users’ groups. We first measured ethnic diversity, income inequality, landholding inequality, and user perception towards the use and management of community forests to understand their effect on the participation of forest users in the management of community forests. Our results show that among the studied variables, group size (number of forest users affiliated to the community forests) and perception of the management of their community forests are strong predictors of forest user participation in community forest management. Income inequality and ethnic diversity were found to have no significant association. Land inequality, however, was found to decrease participation in the management and use of community forests. These community and user attributes play a crucial role in the success of collective action and may vary from community to community. Hence they need to be duly considered by the practitioners prior to any community-based project interventions for stimulating successful collective action.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000252752","1999-4907",,"10.3390/f9030136","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/252752","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","participation||community attributes||perception||social heterogeneity||ethnic diversity||collective action||community forest management||Nepal","Role of community and user attributes in collective action: Case study of community-based forest management in Nepal",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-03-26T02:42:14Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85043987876",,"000428508200039",,"3","Forests","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Understanding macroevolutionary processes using phylogenetic trees is a challenging and complex process that draws on mathematics, computer science and biology. Given the development of complex mathematical models and the growing computational processing power, simulation tools are becoming increasingly popular.  2. In order to simulate phylogenetic trees, most evolutionary biologists are forced to build their own algorithms or use existing tools built on different platforms and/or as standalone programmes. The absence of a simulation tool accommodating for user‐chosen model specifications limits, amongst others, model testing and pipelining with approximate Bayesian computation methods or other subsequent statistical analysis.  3. We introduce “TreeSimGM,” an r‐package simulation tool for phylogenetic trees under a general Bellman and Harris model. This package allows the user to specify any desired probability distribution for the waiting times until speciation and extinction (e.g. age‐dependent speciation/extinction). Upon speciation, the user can specify whether one descendant species corresponds to the ancestor species inheriting its age or whether both descendant species are new species of age 0. Moreover, it is possible to scale the waiting time to speciation/extinction for newly formed species. Thus, “TreeSimGM” not only allows the user to simulate stochastic phylogenetic trees assuming several popular existing models, such as the Yule model, the constant‐rate birth–death model, and proportional to distinguishable arrangement models, but it also allows the user to formulate new models for exploration. A short explanation of the supported models and a few examples of how to use our package are presented here.  4. As an r‐package, “TreeSimGM” allows flexible and powerful stochastic phylogenetic tree simulations. Moreover, it facilitates the pipelining of outputs or inputs with other functions in r. “TreeSimGM” contributes to the tools available to the r community in the fields of ecology and evolution, is freely available under the GPL‐2 licence and can be downloaded at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TreeSimGM.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000251720","2041-210X||2041-2096",,"10.1111/2041-210X.12917","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/251720","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","birth–death model||macroevolution||phylogeny||simulation","TreeSimGM: Simulating phylogenetic trees under general Bellman–Harris models with lineage-specific shifts of speciation and extinction in R",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-03-22T04:14:58Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"New phylogenetic methods  for inferring complex population dynamics","335529","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,"85043505036",,"000426867600030","Methods Ecol.

Islands have traditionally been used as model systems to unravel the processes shaping biological diversity. MacArthur and Wilson's island biogeographic model predicts diversity to be based on dynamic interactions between colonization and extinction rates, while treating islands themselves as geologically static entities. The current spatial configuration of islands should influence meta-population dynamics, but long-term geological changes within archipelagos are also expected to have shaped island biodiversity, in part by driving diversification. Here, we compare two mechanistic models providing inferences on species richness at a biogeographic scale: a mechanistic spatial-temporal model of species diversification and a spatial meta-population model. While the meta-population model operates over a static landscape, the diversification model is driven by changes in the size and spatial configuration of islands through time. We compare the inferences of both models to floristic diversity patterns among land patches of the Indo-Australian Archipelago. Simulation results from the diversification model better matched observed diversity than a meta-population model constrained only by the contemporary landscape. The diversification model suggests that the dynamic re-positioning of islands promoting land disconnection and reconnection induced an accumulation of particularly high species diversity on Borneo, which is central within the island network. By contrast, the meta-population model predicts a higher diversity on the mainlands, which is less compatible with empirical data. Our analyses highlight that, by comparing models with contrasting assumptions, we can pinpoint the processes that are most compatible with extant biodiversity patterns.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000251712","2054-5703",,"10.1098/rsos.171366","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/251712","en","Royal Society Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","allopatric speciation||continental drift||dispersal||diversification||meta-population model||neutral model","Comparing spatial diversification and meta-population models in the indo-Australian Archipelago",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-03-22T04:13:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85043596750",,"000428874600012","R.

Plants that persist in remnant forest patches are threatened by many biotic and abiotic changes that are associated with fragmentation. Several of these fragments consequently contain fewer plant species than they once did but, in the absence of contiguous forest, remain the only strongholds of plant and animal diversity in many parts of the world. However, the future of diversity in forest fragments may be uncertain as fragmentation can influence plant-animal interactions that shape plant communities. Some of these changes may already be apparent in the youngest life stages of fragmented plant communities, which would then form the template for the future of those fragments. By examining the compositions of differently aged plant communities in forest fragments, we may be able to identify interactions that are especially influenced by fragmentation, as various plant-animal interactions play structuring roles during different stages of a plant’s life cycle. In this thesis, we primarily investigate relationships between fragment area and processes that structure plant communities in a tropical forest.  In the first data chapter (the second chapter of this thesis), we examine the compositions of four life stages of woody plants across a gradient of fragment size. We show that plant species are primarily affected by fragment size during their transitions from seeds to saplings. We discuss several possible explanations for the observed patterns but suggest that altered interactions between plants and their natural enemies (insects and fungal pathogens) may be particularly important drivers. Such plant-enemy interactions have the potential to maintain plant diversity by causing the negative density-dependent mortality of locally abundant plant species, and by allowing the persistence of locally rare species (the Janzen-Connell Hypothesis). As the modification of diversity-maintaining interactions can have catastrophic long-term consequences for the plant diversity in small fragments, it was important to investigate whether plant-enemy interactions are indeed sensitive to fragment size.   In the second data chapter (the third chapter of this thesis), we investigate the relationship between fragment area and (soil-borne) fungus-induced mortality of six woody plant species in a shadehouse experiment. We present evidence that the pathogenic effects of fungi on one plant species increased with increasing fragment size. Although we show that plant fungus-interactions can be influenced by fragment size, further experiments are required to investigate whether such effects (even when spread across the community) can influence the diversity maintained in a forest fragment.   In the third data chapter (the fourth chapter of this thesis), we first examine the roles of insects and fungi in maintaining woody plant seedling diversity in an Indian rainforest. We then investigate whether the diversity-maintaining abilities of these natural enemies are influenced by fragment size. We present evidence that insects play important roles in maintaining gamma diversity primarily by suppressing common plant species independent of density. We show that they maintain more diversity in large fragments than in smaller fragments, as smaller fragments were dominated by insect-resistant species. We present evidence that fungi caused the density-dependent mortality of one plant species but infer the presence of more such interactions in the community. We show that fungi may be sensitive to fragment size, and that fungi maintain more beta diversity of woody plant seedlings in large fragments than in small fragments.  In conclusion, I show in my thesis that insects and fungi play important roles in maintaining woody plant seedling diversity. I further show that these essential plant-enemy interactions are predictably influenced by the size of a forest fragment, and that the plant diversity in small fragments may consequently be at risk from the breakdown of such interactions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000267356",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/267356","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Syzygium rubicundum||Rainforest||COEXISTENCE (PLANT ECOLOGY)||Coexistence theory||Janzen-Connell||Herbivorous insects||Fungal pathogens||Negative density dependence||Fragmentation||plant-pathogen interactions||Plant-herbivore interactions||Fragment size||DIVERSITY (PLANT ECOLOGY)||Diversity||Biodiversity||SEEDLING DAMAGE + PLANTLET DAMAGE (PLANT PATHOLOGY)||Seedling mortality||Seedling recruitment||Seedling survival||Seed dispersal||Tropics","The Influence of Fragment Size on Biotic Interactions that structure Plant Communities in the Asian Tropics",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access","DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2018-06-04T10:29:19Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24963",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, climate change has also an indirect impact on ecosystems, through changes in the composition and diversity of plant communities. The relative importance of these direct and indirect effects has not been evaluated within a same generic approach yet. Here we took advantage of a novel approach for disentangling these two effects in European temperate forests across a large climatic gradient, through a large simulation-based study using a forest succession model. We first showed that if productivity positively correlates with realized tree species richness under a changed climate, indirect effects appear pivotal to understand the magnitude of climate change impacts on forest productivity. We further detailed how warmer and drier conditions may affect the diversity-productivity relationships (DPRs) of temperate forests in the long term, mostly through effects on species recruitment, ultimately enhancing or preventing complementarity in resource use. Furthermore, losing key species reduced the strength of DPRs more severely in environments that are becoming climatically harsher. By disentangling direct and indirect effects of climate change on ecosystem functioning, these findings explain why high-diversity forests are expected to be more resilient to climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000258174","2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-018-23763-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/258174","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Long-term response of forest productivity to climate change is mostly driven by change in tree species composition",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-04-15T04:02:38Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85044930775",,"000429095600036","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The relative shifts in the timing of leaf unfolding vs. the timing and intensity of frost events determine whether frost risk changes under climate warming. Here we test whether the frost risk for unfolding leaves of 13 European tree and shrub species has changed over more than 60 years using dynamic state-space models and phenological observations from 264 sites located between 200 and 1900 m a.s.l. across Switzerland. Trees and shrubs currently feature sufficient safety margins regarding frost risk, which increase from early- to late-leafing species and tend to decrease with increasing elevation. Particularly after 1970 to 1990 and at higher elevations, leaf unfolding has advanced across all species. While the time between the last critical frost and leaf unfolding has shifted from predominantly positive trends in the late 1950s and 1960s to a trend reversal since the 2000s, the minimum temperature during leaf unfolding has mostly increased since the 1980s. These dynamic shifts in leaf unfolding and frost risk demonstrate species- and site-specific responses of trees and shrubs to climate cooling and warming.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000273052","2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-018-27893-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/273052","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Climate-induced shifts in leaf unfolding and frost risk of European trees and shrubs",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-06-29T09:48:11Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85049254163",,"000436789500052","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While they are expected to promote tree species diversity, they can also negatively affect the provisioning of ecosystem goods and services (EGS). Especially in the face of climate change and altered disturbance regimes, the ability of forests to provide EGS is increasingly threatened. The maintenance or enhancement of tree species diversity is seen as a possibility to increase the resistance and resilience of forests and to secure the provisioning of EGS for the future. Thus, unravelling the relationship between tree species diversity and EGS under multiple disturbances and climate change has become increasingly important in ecology over the last decades. However, little is known on this relationship at large spatio-temporal scales due to the limitations of empirical studies.  Dynamic vegetation models (DVM) can be used to assess the proposed benefits of tree species diversity in a holistic way. Forest landscape models, one important type of DVMs, are especially suitable to simulate forest dynamics and tree species diversity under changing climatic conditions and over large spatial and temporal scales. They also allow to study the complex relationship between tree species diversity and interacting disturbances while controlling for site history and environmental conditions. The forest landscape model LandClim was used to address the following objectives: (1) to assess how tree species diversity can influence the ability of a forest to provide single and multiple EGS, (2) to evaluate the impact of multiple disturbances on tree species diversity, and (3) to quantify the resistance and resilience of mixed-species forests to multiple disturbances and climate change.  In Chapter I, I systematically evaluated the suitability of monocultures and mixed-species forests to provide single and multiple EGS at the landscape scale. To this end, I simulated all possible combinations of dominant tree species in two mesic landscapes in Central Europe (region around the Mt. Feldberg in the Black Forest in Germany, and the Dischma valley in the Canton of Grisons in Switzerland). To quantify their ability to provide EGS, several EGS metrics were examined: protection against natural hazards (avalanche and rockfall protection), aboveground biomass and habitat quality for birds. Simulation results indicated that mixed-species forests were generally better in providing multiple EGS whereas monocultures were often best for single EGS. Moreover, changing environmental conditions along an elevational gradient had a strong impact on the structure of the different species combinations and therefore on the provisioning of EGS. Thus, tree species diversity per se is not a good predictor of multifunctionality, but it is important to select species as part of the mixtures that occupy different ecological niches and that are best suited for the local environmental conditions.  Forest disturbances can act as important drivers for biodiversity. In Chapter II, I evaluated the relative contribution of two distinctive disturbance agents (i.e., windthrow and ungulate browsing) for tree species diversity at the landscape scale and assessed the shape of the diversity-disturbance relationship. Simulations were run with varying browsing intensities and wind severities in four landscapes in Central Europe, differing in species pools and landscape complexity. My findings showed that tree species diversity in all four landscapes was influenced strongly by understorey (browsing) and overstorey (wind) disturbances, and their relative contribution depended highly on species composition, species-specific vulnerabilities to the disturbance, and forest structure, particularly tree size structure, mediated by growing conditions within the landscape. Tree species diversity was found to peak at intermediate browsing pressure, as dominant but browsing-intolerant species disappeared from the landscape. By contrast, more frequent and more severe wind regimes increased tree species diversity almost linearly by generating a mosaic of uneven-aged forest patches. Thus, the pattern and diversity of forest landscapes in Central Europe are shaped by understorey and overstorey disturbances. Tree species diversity may help to enhance forest resistance and resilience to disturbances and climate change. In Chapter III, I systematically explored the influence of multiple factors on the resistance and resilience to multiple disturbances and climate change at the landscape scale. To this end, I simulated a wide range of mixtures of three major Central European tree species (i.e., Norway spruce, European beech and Silver fir) under current and future climate, including wind and bark beetle disturbances. Simulation results indicated that even though spruce-dominated forests were least resistant to wind disturbance, increasing spruce proportion had a positive influence on resilience under current climate. Moreover, in the absence of climate change, forest resilience generally decreased with elevation and the co-occurrence of bark beetle outbreaks. Under climate change, elevation and spruce proportion reversed their influence on forest resilience, with elevation becoming an important positive factor and spruce proportion a negative factor. In interaction with bark beetle outbreaks, enhanced wind disturbances had a negative influence, particularly under water-limited conditions caused by climate change. As high resistance did not necessarily imply high resilience, the two properties should be considered separately in further studies. Additionally, especially the resistance and resilience of spruce-dominated forests to interacting disturbances and climate change could be enhanced if admixed with more drought- and disturbance tolerant species. Based on these findings, I recommend the following future research to further enhance our knowledge about the influence of tree species diversity on EGS provisioning and the diversity-disturbance relationship: (1) to assess the influence of subdominant species on EGS provisioning, (2) to evaluate EGS at multiple time points so as to increase the robustness of the findings, (3) to corroborate the wind module e.g. using a model comparison, and (4) to develop a more dynamic representation of browsing at the landscape scale in order to be able to assess more systematically interaction effects of windthrow and browsing on tree species diversity.  Overall, this thesis demonstrated the usefulness of forest landscape models for biodiversity studies at spatial and temporal scales that are not accessible to either observation or experimentation. The findings highlighted the importance to focus on species with different functional traits in EGS studies, rather than on species diversity itself. Moreover, due to altered growth patterns of tree species under climate change, forest managers need to adapt forests continuously to maintain their resilience to disturbances under changing environmental conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000339837",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/339837","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Forest Ecology||LandClim||Forest disturbances||Dynamic vegetation model||Mixed-species stands||Tree species diversity","The role of tree species diversity for maintaining ecosystem services under multiple disturbances and climate change",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access","DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture","2019-04-27T18:05:08Z","2020-04-29",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"25136",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In addition to field-based biodiversity information, mapping of carbon stocks can greatly accelerate the identification, protection and recovery of forests deemed to be of high conservation value (HCV). We combined airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with satellite imaging and other geospatial data to map forest aboveground carbon density at 30 m (0.09 ha) resolution throughout the Malaysian state of Sabah on the island of Borneo. We used the mapping results to assess how carbon stocks vary spatially based on forest use, deforestation, regrowth, and current forest protections. We found that unlogged, intact forests contain aboveground carbon densities averaging over 200 Mg C ha−1, with peaks of 500 Mg C ha−1. Critically, more than 40% of the highest carbon stock forests were discovered outside of areas designated for maximum protection. Previously logged forests have suppressed, but still high, carbon densities of 60–140 Mg C ha−1. Our mapped distributions of forest carbon stock suggest that the state of Sabah could double its total aboveground carbon storage if previously logged forests are allowed to recover in the future. Our results guide ongoing efforts to identify HCV forests and to determine new areas for forest protection in Borneo.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000217127","0006-3207||1873-2917",,"10.1016/j.biocon.2017.10.020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/217127","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Borneo||Carbon conservation||Carnegie airborne observatory||Deforestation||Land use history||Forest conservation||Sabah||Selective logging","Mapped aboveground carbon stocks to advance forest conservation and recovery in Malaysian Borneo",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2017-12-05T05:47:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85034578899",,"000423005200033","Biol Conserv",,"Biological Conservation","217","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we perform a dimensional analysis of the governing equation of a widely used landscape evolution model (LEM) that combines stream-power incision and linear diffusion laws. Our analysis assumes that length and height are conceptually distinct dimensions and uses characteristic scales that depend only on the model parameters (incision coefficient, diffusion coefficient, and uplift rate) rather than on the size of the domain or of landscape features. We use previously defined characteristic scales of length, height, and time, but, for the first time, we combine all three in a single analysis. Using these characteristic scales, we non-dimensionalize the LEM such that it includes only dimensionless variables and no parameters. This significantly simplifies the LEM by removing all parameter-related degrees of freedom. The only remaining degrees of freedom are in the boundary and initial conditions. Thus, for any given set of dimensionless boundary and initial conditions, all simulations, regardless of parameters, are just rescaled copies of each other, both in steady state and throughout their evolution. Therefore, the entire model parameter space can be explored by temporally and spatially rescaling a single simulation. This is orders of magnitude faster than performing multiple simulations to span multidimensional parameter spaces.  The characteristic scales of length, height and time are geomorphologically interpretable; they define relationships between topography and the relative strengths of landscape-forming processes. The characteristic height scale specifies how drainage areas and slopes must be related to curvatures for a landscape to be in steady state and leads to methods for defining valleys, estimating model parameters, and testing whether real topography follows the LEM. The characteristic length scale is roughly equal to the scale of the transition from diffusion-dominated to advection-dominated propagation of topographic perturbations (e.g., knickpoints). We introduce a modified definition of the landscape Péclet number, which quantifies the relative influence of advective versus diffusive propagation of perturbations. Our Péclet number definition can account for the scaling of basin length with basin area, which depends on topographic convergence versus divergence.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000293162","2196-632X||2196-6311","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/293162||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/321639","10.5194/esurf-6-779-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322386","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Scaling and similarity of a stream-power incision and linear diffusion landscape evolution model",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-10-04T02:50:24Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85053887983",,"000445454900001","Earth Surf.

The results showed that distance to agriculture and orchards as well as distance to plantation forests were the most important variables in predicting species distribution. Furthermore, we found that the total potential suitable habitat for the species in Gilan province is 315,990 hectares. We observed a shift of the species to higher altitudes in the province. We recommend raising awareness about the presence of the species especially among private landowners, creating a network of protected areas on private land, and changing land-use policies at the provincial level as essential measures for the conservation of the species in Gilan province.

Thus, charcoal records from lake sediments have become the primary source for reconstructing past fire activity. Microscopic charcoal particles are generated during forest and grassland fires and can be transported over large distances before being deposited into natural archives. In this paper, we implement microscopic charcoal particles into a global aerosol–climate model to better understand the transport of charcoal on a large scale. Atmospheric transport and interactions with other aerosol particles, clouds, and radiation are explicitly simulated. To estimate the emissions of the microscopic charcoal particles, we use recent European charcoal observations from lake sediments as a calibration data set. We found that scaling black carbon fire emissions from the Global Fire Assimilation System (a satellite-based emission inventory) by approximately 2 orders of magnitude matches the calibration data set best. The charcoal validation data set, for which we collected charcoal observations from all over the globe, generally supports this scaling factor. In the validation data set, we included charcoal particles from lake sediments, peats, and ice cores. While only the Spearman rank correlation coefficient is significant for the calibration data set (0.67), both the Pearson and the Spearman rank correlation coefficients are positive and significantly different from zero for the validation data set (0.59 and 0.48, respectively). Overall, the model captures a significant portion of the spatial variability, but it fails to reproduce the extreme spatial variability observed in the charcoal data. This can mainly be explained by the coarse spatial resolution of the model and uncertainties concerning fire emissions. Furthermore, charcoal fluxes derived from ice core sites are much lower than the simulated fluxes, which can be explained by the location properties (high altitude and steep topography, which are not well represented in the model) of most of the investigated ice cores. Global modelling of charcoal can improve our understanding of the representativeness of this fire proxy. Furthermore, it might allow past fire emissions provided by fire models to be quantitatively validated. This might deepen our understanding of the processes driving global fire activity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000285894","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-11813-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/285894","en","European Geophysical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Implementing microscopic charcoal particles into a global aerosol-climate model",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-08-31T04:30:40Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85052128158",,"000442099800003","Atmos. chem. phys.","16","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Efficient mitigation efforts should prioritize retrofitting sections of glass exhibiting the highest mortality of birds. Most collision studies, however, record location meta-data at a spatial scale too coarse (i.e., compass direction of facing façade) to be useful for large buildings with complex geometries. Through spatial analysis of three seasons of survey data at a large building at a university campus, we found that GPS data were able to identify collision hotspots while compass directions could not. To demonstrate the broad applicability and utility of this georeferencing approach, we identified collision hotspots at two additional urban areas in North America. The data for this latter exercise were collected via the citizen science database, iNaturalist, which we review for its potential to generate the georeferenced data necessary for directing building retrofits and mitigating a major source of anthropogenic bird mortality.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000248948","2167-8359",,"10.7717/peerj.4215","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/248948","en","PeerJ","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bird window collisions||Citizen science||Georeferencing||Bird conservation||Urban ecology","Geo-referencing bird-window collisions for targeted mitigation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-03-11T01:49:04Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000419200900008","PeerJ","1","PeerJ","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Fractal scaling presents challenges to the identification of deterministic trends because (1) fractal scaling has the potential to lead to false inference about the statistical significance of trends and (2) the abundance of irregularly spaced data in water-quality monitoring networks complicates efforts to quantify fractal scaling. Traditional methods for estimating fractal scaling – in the form of spectral slope (β) or other equivalent scaling parameters (e.g., Hurst exponent) – are generally inapplicable to irregularly sampled data. Here we consider two types of estimation approaches for irregularly sampled data and evaluate their performance using synthetic time series. These time series were generated such that (1) they exhibit a wide range of prescribed fractal scaling behaviors, ranging from white noise (β  =  0) to Brown noise (β  =  2) and (2) their sampling gap intervals mimic the sampling irregularity (as quantified by both the skewness and mean of gap-interval lengths) in real water-quality data. The results suggest that none of the existing methods fully account for the effects of sampling irregularity on β estimation. First, the results illustrate the danger of using interpolation for gap filling when examining autocorrelation, as the interpolation methods consistently underestimate or overestimate β under a wide range of prescribed β values and gap distributions. Second, the widely used Lomb–Scargle spectral method also consistently underestimates β. A previously published modified form, using only the lowest 5 % of the frequencies for spectral slope estimation, has very poor precision, although the overall bias is small. Third, a recent wavelet-based method, coupled with an aliasing filter, generally has the smallest bias and root-mean-squared error among all methods for a wide range of prescribed β values and gap distributions. The aliasing method, however, does not itself account for sampling irregularity, and this introduces some bias in the result. Nonetheless, the wavelet method is recommended for estimating β in irregular time series until improved methods are developed. Finally, all methods' performances depend strongly on the sampling irregularity, highlighting that the accuracy and precision of each method are data specific. Accurately quantifying the strength of fractal scaling in irregular water-quality time series remains an unresolved challenge for the hydrologic community and for other disciplines that must grapple with irregular sampling.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000242983","1027-5606||1607-7938","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/242983||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/321948","10.5194/hess-22-1175-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322180","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Evaluation of statistical methods for quantifying fractal scaling in water-quality time series with irregular sampling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2018-02-22T04:26:58Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85041923770",,"000424971300001","Hydrol.

Here, we assess the reciprocal interactions between soil minerals, SOM and the broad composition of microbial populations in a 530-year chronosequence of podzolic soils. Five pedons, derived from beach sand, are studied. From young to old soils, net acidification parallels mineral dissolution and the formation of eluvial and illuvial horizons. Organo-mineral associations (OMA) accumulate in the illuvial B horizon of the older soils (330–530 years). Apart from contributing to SOM stabilization and protection, organo-mineral compounds progressively fill up interparticle voids. The subsequent loss of porosity leads to horizon induration, decrease of hydraulic conductivity, which promote redoximorphic processes. While recalcitrant SOM is preserved in the topsoil of the old soils, the largest quantity of protected SOM occurs in the indurated, temporalily waterlogged B horizons, through both the OMA accumulation and inhibition of microbial decomposition. SOM protection is thus both time- and horizon-specific. The microbiota also evolve along the chronosequence. Fungi dominate in all horizons of the younger soils and in the topsoil of the older soils, while bacteria prevail in the cemented B horizons of older soils. This shift in microbial community composition is due to the interdependent co-evolution of SOM and minerals during pedogenesis. Our results call for considering the microenvironment and parameters inherent to decomposer microorganisms to understand SOM protection processes in soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000385705","2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2018.00070","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/385705","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Organic matter||Microorganisms||Amino sugars||Carbon fractionation||Micromorphology||SOM protection mechanisms||Podzol||Chronosequence","Soil Microbial Populations Shift as Processes Protecting Organic Matter Change During Podzolization",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"2019-12-15T18:59:59Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Front.
