Red clover is valued for its high yield potential and forage quality. The high amount of genetic diversity present in red clover provides an invaluable, but often poorly characterized resource to improve key traits such as yield, quality, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we examined the genetic and phenotypic diversity within a diverse set of 395 diploid red clover accessions via genome wide allele frequency fingerprinting and multi-location field trials across Europe. We found that the genetic structure of accessions mostly reflected their geographic origin and only few cases were detected, where breeders integrated foreign genetic resources into their local breeding pools. Phenotypic performance of accessions in the multi-location field trials revealed a very high accession x location interaction. Thereby, breeding material and cultivars generally performed well at the location where they were developed. Local adaptation was especially prominent in Nordic red clover accessions that showed a distinct adaptation to the growing conditions and cutting regime of the North. Our results confirmed that red clover cultivars were bred from regional ecotypes and show a narrow adaptation to regional conditions. Our study can serve as a valuable basis for identifying interesting material that express the desired characteristics and contribute to the adaptation of red clover to future climatic conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000588642",,,,"10.1101/2022.12.19.520744","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588642","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","red clover||plant breeding||forage||legume||adaptation","Multi-location trials and population-based genotyping reveal high diversity and adaptation to breeding environments in a large collection of red clover",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2022-12-21T13:32:57Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While adding high-quality organic resources combined with mineral fertilizer has been proposed to counteract this fertility loss, the long-term effectiveness and interactions with site properties still require more understanding. This study used repeated measurements over time to assess the effect of different quantities and qualities of organic resource addition combined with mineral N on the change of soil organic carbon concentrations (SOC) over time (and SOC stocks in the year 2021) in four ongoing long-term trials in Kenya. These trials were established with identical treatments in moist to dry climates, on coarse to clayey soil textures, and have been managed for at least 16 years. They received organic resources in quantities equivalent to 1.2 and 4 t C ha−1 per year in the form of Tithonia diversifolia (high quality, fast turnover), Calliandra calothyrsus (high quality, intermediate turnover), Zea mays stover (low quality, fast turnover), sawdust (low quality, slow turnover) and local farmyard manure (variable quality, intermediate turnover). Furthermore, the addition or absence of 240 kg N ha−1 per year as mineral N fertilizer was the split-plot treatment. At all sites, a loss of SOC, rather than gain, was predominantly observed due to a recent conversion from permanent vegetation to agriculture. The average reduction of SOC concentration over 19 years in the 0 to 15 cm depth ranged from 42 % to 13 % of the initial SOC concentration for the control and the farmyard manure treatments at 4 t C ha−1 yr−1, respectively. Adding Calliandra or Tithonia at 4 t C ha−1 yr−1 limited the loss of SOC concentrations to about 24 % of initial SOC, while the addition of saw dust, maize stover (in 3 of 4 sites) and sole mineral N addition, showed no significant reduction in SOC loss over the control. Site specific analyses, however, did show, that at the site with the lowest initial SOC concentration (about 6 g kg−1), the addition of 4 t C ha−1 yr−1 farmyard manure or Calliandra plus mineral N led to a gain in SOC concentrations. All other sites lost SOC in all treatments, albeit at site specific rates. While subsoil SOC stocks in 2021 were little affected by organic resource additions (no difference in 3 of 4 sites), the topsoil SOC stocks corroborated the results for SOC concentrations. The relative annual change of SOC concentrations showed a higher site specificity in high-quality organic resource treatments than in the control, suggesting that the drivers of site specificity in SOC buildup (mineralogy, climate) need to be better understood for effective targeting of organic resources. Even though farmyard manure showed the most potential for reducing SOC loss, our results clearly show that maintaining SOC with external inputs only is not possible at organic resource rates that are realistic for small scale farmers. Thus, additional agronomic interventions such as intercropping, crop rotations or strong rooting crops may be necessary to maintain or increase SOC.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000610268",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-2022-1416","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/610268","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"High quality organic resources are most efficient in stabilizing soil organic carbon: Evidence from four long-term experiments in Kenya",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2023-05-02T10:11:40Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Integrated soil fertility management for climate smart intensification of maize-based cropping systems in Kenya","172940","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Consequently, appearance is an important selection criterion in the breeding of new cultivars. It is also used for the description of older varieties or landraces. In commercial apple production, sorting devices are used to classify a high number of fruits of a few cultivars. In contrast, the description of fruits from germplasm collections or for breeding is based on a few fruits from many cultivars and is mostly performed visually by pomology experts. Therefore, such visual ratings are laborious, often difficult to compare and generally remain subjective. Here we report on the assembly and testing of a morphometric device, the Phenobox, allowing automated fruit weighting and appearance description using computer-based analysis of five images per fruit. The recoding of approximately 100 fruits each from 15 apple cultivars using the Phenobox was achieved rapidly, with an average handling and recording time below eleven seconds per fruit. The comparison of the fruits of 15 apple cultivars identified significant differences in shape index, fruit width, height and weight. Fruit shape was characteristic for each cultivar, while fruit coloration showed larger variation within sample sets. Assessing a subset of 20 randomly selected fruits per cultivar, fruit height and width were described with a 95% confidence interval (and a 95% confidence level) of ±2.6 and ±2.1 %, respectively, of the mean value calculated using all available fruits, while describing fruit weight this interval was ±6.2 %.  The Phenobox allows for the rapid and consistent description of fruit samples of a single apple genotype. By relating the description confidence intervals with different sample sizes, it was possible to determine an appropriate fruit sample size to efficiently and accuately describe the recorded traits. Therefore, the Phenobox is a useful tool for breeding and the description of apple germplasm collections.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590509","it","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Phenobox: Raw images in TIF format of approximately 100 fruits each from 15 different apple cultivars",,"Dataset",,,,,"2023-01-05T13:04:01Z",,"10 years","2033-01-05T16:02:33Z",,,"Yes","yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The sampling of individual compartments allowed community patterns to be generated using amplicon sequencing of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes. Nitrifying bacteria were identified in the hydroponic compartments, indicating that these compartments may play a larger role than previously thought in the system's nitrogen cycle. In addition to the observed temporal changes in community compositions within the anaerobic compartment, more archaeal reads were obtained from sludge samples than from the aerobic part of the system. Lower bacterial diversity was observed in fresh fish feces, where a highly discrete gut flora composition was seen.

Information about the proximity of the reconstructed SIF (SIFr) datasets to GPP across land cover types and climatic conditions provides important support for a better application of these products for modelling applications. We conducted a multiscale analysis of four different long-term (12 years, 2007–2018) high-resolution global SIFr datasets (0.05° × 0.05°), namely – CSIF (Contiguous SIF), GOSIF (Global OCO-2 SIF), LUE-SIF (Light Use Efficiency SIF), and HSIF (Harmonized SIF) - at 4-day, 8-day, and monthly time scales and found that for the majority of sites, the SIFr is linearly related to ground-based GPP measurements with the eddy covariance method. While the relationship between SIFr and GPP (i.e., the slope - GPP/SIFr) varied significantly across the SIFr datasets, sites, and land cover types, all four SIFr datasets were unequivocally a better predictor of GPP compared to remotely sensed vegetation indices – NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index), sensed by the MODIS satellite. Furthermore, we also analyzed SIF-GPP relationships during drought vs non-drought conditions and found that for about 30% of the sites, comprising mostly non-forests site, the SIF-GPP relationship became weaker (decreased R2) with a lower slope during drought conditions compared to non-drought conditions. Among the four different products, the CSIF (at 4-day timescale) and GOSIF (at 8-day timescale) predicted GPP better compared to LUE-SIF and HSIF across all land cover types. Owing to their long-term availability (since 2000 for CSIF and GOSIF), these SIFr datasets combined with proxies of ecosystem properties can be used to appropriately capture vegetation dynamics and the interannual variabilities across a wide range of climatic conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000575875",,"0034-4257",,"10.1016/j.rse.2022.113282","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575875","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CSIF||GOSIF||GOME-2||OCO-2||HSIF||Eddy-covariance||MODIS","How well do recently reconstructed solar-induced fluorescence datasets model gross primary productivity?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-13T15:21:07Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85139592021",,"000875408000001","Remote Sens.

However, untargeted N fertilization can result in damage to natural ecosystems and threats to human health. Notably, the contamination of groundwater used as drinking water with excessive amounts of nitrate (NO₃⁻) constitutes a serious problem in the Swiss Central Plains and worldwide. The Nmin method constitutes a promising approach to tackle such negative side-effects of N fertilization without compromising crop productivity through a more targeted, site- and year-specific N fertilization based on the measurement of plant-available N (Nmin) in the soil before N fertilizer application. The overall scope of this thesis was to identify aspects of the Nmin method as it is currently used in Switzerland that may be improved during the current routine revision of the official Swiss fertilization recommendations, the GRUD, with a particular focus on the opportunities offered by digitalization.  For this purpose, the Swiss Nmin method was compared to Nmin-based and other N fertilization recommendations from Switzerland, Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom, including the associated soil sampling and analysis methods. This notably included the calculation of the “optimum” N fertilization rate for field experiments with winter wheat conducted by the Swiss Confederation’s center of excellence for agricultural research Agroscope and its partner institutions. Furthermore, the relationship between soil organic matter and clay content and N availability in winter wheat and winter barley was studied using linear mixed models. The feasibility of predicting Nmin in early spring based on 23 vegetation indices calculated from multispectral UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) imagery was assessed for winter wheat using bootstrappingbased correlation analysis and Passing-Bablok regression.  On average, the Swiss N fertilization recommendation yielded appreciably lower “optimum” N fertilization rates than their German and British counterparts, but an undifferentiated increase of N fertilization rates in Switzerland would likely exacerbate the existing NO₃⁻ leaching problems. However, a site- and year-specific flexibility of maximum allowable N fertilization rates based on the Nmin method or similar approaches may enable an increase in crop productivity while reducing the negative side-effects of N fertilization. Furthermore, the lack of a reasonable correction for differences in yield among fields as well as certain aspects of the associated Nmin measurement procedures were identified as the most important points that should be improved in the Swiss Nmin method.  The NDVI and the functionally equivalent NIR / R ratio were identified as the vegetation indices with the highest correlation with Nmin in the 0 - 30 cm soil horizon in early spring (ρ = 0.6675, p < 0.001). Yet, the subsequent Passing-Bablok regression clearly showed that a prediction of Nmin at the field scale based on a vegetation index alone is not sufficiently reliable to be meaningfully integrated in a fertilization recommendation. However, vegetation indices remain useful for the site- and year-specific optimization of N fertilization. In the short term, digitalization eliminates the high need for simplification inherent in non-digitalized fertilization recommendations, allowing us to make the most advanced scientific models of the N cycle usable for farmers. This way, digitalization can contribute to the site- and year-specific optimization of N fertilization even without developing something fundamentally new.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000609680",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/609680","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Nitrogen fertilization||Nmin method||Site-specific N management||Fertilization recommendations||Digitalization||Vegetation indices||Sustainable intensification||Switzerland||Europe","The Nmin method in Switzerland: potential for improvement  and development in the context of digitalization",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,"2023-04-26T16:02:29Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In later years asynchrony played a more important role in increasing community stability as the negative effect of richness on population stability diminished.

A core set of genes, G6PC2, HDAC9, KTN1, MYLK2, NTM, SLC16A1 and SYNDIG1, with central roles in muscle, metabolism, and neurobiology, are key drivers of the racing phenotype. Although racing potential is a multifactorial trait, the genomic architecture shaping the common athletic phenotype in horse populations bred for racing provides evidence for the influence of protein-coding variants in fundamental exercise-relevant genes.

Perennial ryegrass is vulnerable to water deficit, and drought causes significant reductions in biomass yield. Contrastingly, tall fescue exhibits tolerance to water deficit and maintains biomass yield under drought conditions. However, the mechanisms underlying drought tolerance in tall fescue remain unclear. This study revealed several traits of tall fescue that enable it to outperform perennial ryegrass under water deficit. For example, image analysis revealed tall fescue had a higher stomata density in comparison to perennial ryegrass. Whilst other studies have shown a high stomata density leads to increased water loss and decreased survival under water deficit, we found that tall fescue responded earlier to water deficit by closing its stomata to reduce water loss and improve survival under drought. Furthermore, tall fescue maintained its leaf elongation at a significantly lower soil moisture content than perennial ryegrass (tall fescue 35%, perennial ryegrass 69%, p = 0.013). These results suggest that in addition to the known root characteristics, tall fescue has several leaf physiological and morphological features which contribute to improved plant performance under water deficit. Our results demonstrate how two species sharing an ecosystem space have evolved different responses to water deficit.

Here, we elucidated the transfer of Cd from soil to the nib (seed) in a high Cd accumulating cacao cultivar. Here, we elucidated the transfer of Cd from soil to the nib (seed) in a high Cd accumulating cacao cultivar through Cd stable isotope fractionation, speciation (X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy), and localization (Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry). The plant Cd concentrations were 10-28 higher than the topsoil Cd concentrations and increased as placenta< nib< testa< pod husk< root< leaf< branch. The retention of Cd in the roots was low. Light Cd isotopes were retained in the roots whilst heavier Cd isotopes were transported to the shoots (Δ 114/110 Cd shoot-root = 0.27 ± 0.02 ‰ (weighted average ± standard deviation)). Leaf Cd isotopes were heavier than Cd in the branches (Δ 114/110 Cd IF3 leaves-branch = 0.18 ± 0.01 ‰), confirming typical trends observed in annual crops. Nibs and branches were statistically not distinguishable (Δ 114/110 Cd nib-branch = −0.08‰ ± 0.06 ‰), contrary to the leaves and nibs (Δ 114/110 Cd nib-IF3 leaves = -0.25‰ ± 0.05 ‰). These isotope fractionation patterns alluded to a more direct transfer from branches to nibs rather than from leaves to nibs. The largest fraction (57%) of total plant Cd was present in the branches where it was primarily bound to carboxyl-ligands (60-100%) and mainly localized in the phloem rays and phelloderm of the bark. Cadmium in the nibs was mainly bound to oxygen ligands (60-90%), with phytate as the most plausible ligand. The weight of evidence suggested that Cd was transferred like other nutrients from root to shoot and accumulated in the phloem rays and phelloderm of the branches to reduce the transfer to foliage. Finally, the data indicated that the main contribution of nib Cd was from the phloem tissues of the branch rather than from leaf remobilization. This study extended the limited knowledge on Cd accumulation in perennial, woody crops and revealed that the Cd pathways in cacao are markedly different than in annual crops.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000589153",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2022.1055912","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589153","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"From soil to cacao bean: Unravelling the pathways of cadmium translocation in a high Cd accumulating cultivar of Theobroma cacao L",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-24T04:47:49Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85144068534",,,"Front.

It often removes people from their land, erodes local culture and knowledge, involves severe deforestation, soil degradation, environmental pollution, and diminishes biodiversity and agrobiodiversity. Thus, agro-extractivism has severe implications for food security, sustainability, and equity. The inherent simplification and specialisation of whole landscapes ultimately leads to the collapse of local food systems, which limits livelihood opportunities for rural populations, and undermines healthy and sustainable diets. A potential to counterbalance this development lies in diversity throughout the whole food system with particular emphasis on bio-cultural diversity manifesting in healthy social-ecological systems and diverse, healthy diets. Cases from Bolivia and Brazil highlight how food system activities can support different types of diversity when local people jointly construct their food systems, while at the same time strengthening intra-communal links.

Using a systematic review and meta-analysis of nitrogen fertilisation studies in European permanent grasslands, we asked: (i) what relationship form exists between nitrogen application rate and change in plant diversity, compared to zero fertilisation controls; and (ii) how grassland, management and study characteristics affect this relationship. Meta-analysis of 34 control-treatment effects from 14 studies conducted across nine European countries revealed a negative linear relationship between nitrogen fertilisation rate and change in plant species richness, equivalent to approximately 1.5 species/m2 lost for every 100 Kg ha−1 yr−1 of nitrogen added. Fertilisation induced reductions in plant species richness were greater when defoliation rates were lower. We found some evidence that grasslands with a higher baseline plant diversity lost more species when fertilised compared to more species poor grasslands, although uncertainty was high. Due to the diverse grassland types included in the analysis, the variability in fertilisation-driven changes in plant diversity was high. We identified several remaining limitations to our understanding, including uncertainty about non-linear effects, which could aid efforts to optimise the trade-off of plant diversity and increasing grassland yields.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583435",,"2073-4395",,"10.3390/agronomy12122928","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583435","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Enrichment||Plant diversity||Agricultural intensification||Management intensity","The Effects of Nitrogen Fertilisation on Plant Species Richness in European Permanent Grasslands: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-28T11:16:23Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies","774124","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85144906354",,"000902088600001",,"12","Agronomy","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We conducted a short-term field experiment to evaluate the effects of BC with compost and additional fertilizer on different soil GHG fluxes. Application of 1% BC-compost showed no significant effect on CH4 and CO2 fluxes but lowered NO and N2O fluxes compared to the control without BC-compost. The addition of N to BC-compost (0.5% BC-compost + 175 kg N) showed a small mitigation potential for CH4 whereas N2O and NO fluxes significantly increased for one week after the application. The N2:N2O ratio shifted towards N2O production after the application of N-enriched BC-compost. During storage of pure N-enriched BC-compost, high gaseous losses in the form of NO (71.2 ± 2 µg N g−1 h−1), N2O (1319 ± 101 µg N g−1 h−1), and N2 (337.8 ± 93 µg N g−1 h−1) were measured.

With the open-source Python library EOdal (Earth Observation Data Analysis Library) we propose a novel software that enables the development of fully reproducible spatial data science chains through the strict use of open-source developments. Thanks to its modular design, EOdal enables advanced data warehousing especially for remote sensing data, sophisticated spatio-temporal analysis and intersection of different data sources, as well as nearly unlimited expandability through application programming interfaces (APIs).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583234",,"0168-1699||1872-7107",,"10.1016/j.compag.2022.107487","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583234","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Satellite data||Python||Open-source||Earth Observation||Ecophysiology","EOdal: An open-source Python package for large-scale agroecological research using Earth Observation and gridded environmental data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-27T06:32:59Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"PhenomEn","198091","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","COST",,,"85142145412",,"000900029500002","Comput. electron. agric.",,"Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","203","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it is unclear how the herbage feeding mode (grazing vs indoor green-feeding) and conservation (fresh herbage vs hay vs silage) modify the milk FA profile. Therefore, the aim of the present experiment was to investigate the effect of different herbage utilisation methods (including herbage feeding mode and herbage conservation method) on the ruminal biohydrogenation of dietary FA and the consequences on the milk FA composition in cows of two breeds (Holstein and Montbéliarde). Concomitant effects of botanical composition and phenological stage of the herbage on milk FA profile were controlled for by harvesting barn-dried hay and silage simultaneously as first cut from the same ryegrass-dominated grassland in a semi-mountainous region. Seven weeks later, the first regrowth of the same plot was used as fresh herbage, either grazed or fed indoor (indoor green-feeding). Twenty-four Montbéliarde and 24 Holstein cows were randomly allocated to four groups of 12 cows balanced by breed, parity, and milk yield. In a free-stall barn, three groups were given ad libitum access to hay, silage, or fresh herbage, respectively. The fourth group was strip-grazing. All cows were supplemented with 3 kg DM/day of the same energy-rich concentrate. After 2 weeks of adaptation to the forage, samples of forage, concentrate, milk, blood, and rumen fluid were collected. Fatty acid composition of forages, rumen fluid, and milk was analysed by gas chromatography. Haymaking reduced total FA content of the herbage, in particular that of linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA). Still, rumen fluid lipids of hay-fed cows had the highest proportion of rumenic acid, LA, ALA, and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Milk fat from hay-fed cows had the highest proportion of LA, and the apparent transfer rates from feed to milk of LA and ALA were higher in hay-fed cows than in silage-fed cows. The proportion of PUFAs was highest in milk fat from grazing and indoor green-fed Montbéliarde cows and lowest in silage-fed cows of both breeds. In conclusion, the herbage utilisation method affects the ruminal biohydrogenation of LA and ALA, whereby herbage drying particularly increases their transfer from herbage to milk.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000584174",,"1751-7311||1751-732X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/584174||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588010","10.1016/j.animal.2022.100674","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588338","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Dairy cows||Fatty acids||Hay||Indoor green-feeding||Silage","Herbage utilisation method affects rumen fluid and milk fatty acid profile in Holstein and Montbéliarde cows",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-01T04:52:06Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85142523739",,"000892166700004",,"12","Animal","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We examined the roles of sward disturbance, seed addition and land-use intensity (LUI) on PSFs. We conducted a disturbance and seed addition experiment in 10 grasslands along a LUI gradient and characterized plant biomass and richness, soil microbial biomass, community composition and enzyme activities. Greater plant biomass at high LUI was related to a decrease in the fungal to bacterial ratios, indicating highly productive grasslands to be dominated by bacteria. Lower enzyme activity per microbial biomass at high plant species richness indicated a slower carbon (C) cycling. The relative abundance of fungal saprotrophs decreased, while pathogens increased with LUI and disturbance. Both fungal guilds were negatively associated with plant richness, indicating the mechanisms underlying PSFs depended on LUI. We show that LUI and disturbance affect fungal functional composition, which may feedback on plant species richness by impeding the establishment of pathogen-sensitive species. Therefore, we highlight the need to integrate LUI including its effects on PSFs when planning for practices that aim to optimize plant diversity and productivity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000572488",,"0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.18503","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572488","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Aboveground-belowground interactions||Biodiversity and ecosystem functions||Grassland renewal||Microbial biomass||Nutrient cycling||Phospholipid fatty acids||Plant-soil feedbacks||Temperate grassland","Microbial drivers of plant richness and productivity in a grassland restoration experiment along a gradient of land‐use intensity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-23T09:59:56Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85139613677",,"000865814100001","New Phytol.","5","New Phytologist","236","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) is an important forage legume of temperate regions, particularly valued for its high yield potential and its high forage quality. Despite substantial breeding progress during the last decades, continuous improvement of cultivars is crucial to ensure yield stability in view of newly emerging diseases or changing climatic conditions. The high amount of genetic diversity present in red clover ecotypes, landraces, and cultivars provides an invaluable, but often unexploited resource for the improvement of key traits such as yield, quality, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. A collection of 397 red clover accessions was genotyped using a pooled genotyping-by-sequencing approach with 200 plants per accession. Resistance to the two most pertinent diseases in red clover production, southern anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum trifolii, and clover rot caused by Sclerotinia trifoliorum, was assessed using spray inoculation. The mean survival rate for southern anthracnose was 22.9% and the mean resistance index for clover rot was 34.0%. Genome-wide association analysis revealed several loci significantly associated with resistance to southern anthracnose and clover rot. Most of these loci are in coding regions. One quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 1 explained 16.8% of the variation in resistance to southern anthracnose. For clover rot resistance we found eight QTL, explaining together 80.2% of the total phenotypic variation. The SNPs associated with these QTL provide a promising resource for marker-assisted selection in existing breeding programs, facilitating the development of novel cultivars with increased resistance against two devastating fungal diseases of red clover.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000574096",,"0040-5752||1432-2242",,"10.1007/s00122-022-04223-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/574096","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Phenotypic variation and quantitative trait loci for resistance to southern anthracnose and clover rot in red clover",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-04T05:45:00Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"EUCLEG - Third Party Breeding forage and grain legumes to increase EU’s and China’s protein self-sufficiency - EUCLEG","727312||727312","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC","H2020||H2020",,,"85139039709",,"000858642800001","Theor Appl Genet","12","Theoretical and Applied Genetics","135","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We hypothesized that the chlorotic yellow halos frequently observed around necrotic lesions caused by the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici could result from the activity of necrotrophic effectors interacting with the products of toxin sensitivity genes. As an initial step toward testing this hypothesis, we developed an automated image analysis (AIA) workflow that could quantify the degree of yellow halo formation occurring in wheat leaves naturally infected by a highly diverse pathogen population under field conditions. This AIA based on statistical learning was applied to more than 10,000 naturally infected leaves collected from 335 wheat cultivars grown in a replicated field experiment. We estimated a high heritability (h2 = 0.71) for the degree of yellow halo formation, suggesting that this quantitative trait has a significant genetic component. Using genome-wide association mapping, we identified six chromosome segments significantly associated with the yellow halo phenotype. Most of these segments contained candidate genes associated with targets of necrotrophic effectors in other necrotrophic pathogens.

While luminal epithelial cells line the uterine cavity and build the embryo-maternal contact zone, glandular epithelial cells form tubular glands reaching deeply into the endometrial stroma. To facilitate investigations considering the functional and molecular differences between the two populations of epithelial cells and their contribution to reproductive processes, we aimed at establishing differentiated in vitro models of both the luminal and the glandular epithelium of the porcine endometrium using an air-liquid interface (ALI) approach. We first tested if porcine luminal endometrium epithelial cells (PEEC-L) reproducibly form differentiated epithelial monolayers under ALI conditions by monitoring the morphology and the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Subsequently, luminal (PEEC-L) and glandular epithelial cells (PEEC-G) were consecutively isolated from the endometrium of the uterine horn. Both cell types were characterized by marker gene expression analysis immediately after isolation. Cells were separately grown at the ALI and assessed by means of histomorphometry, TEER, and marker gene expression after 3 weeks of culture. PEEC-L and PEEC-G formed polarized monolayers of differentiated epithelial cells with a moderate TEER and in vivo-like morphology at the ALI. They exhibited distinct patterns of functional and cell type-specific marker gene expression after isolation and largely maintained these patterns during the culture period. The here presented cell culture procedure for PEEC-L and -G offers new opportunities to study the impact of embryonic signals, endocrine effectors, and reproductive toxins on both porcine endometrial epithelial cell types under standardized in vitro conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000559717",,"2629-3277||2629-3269",,"10.1007/s12015-022-10410-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/559717","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Endometrium||Glandular epithelium||Luminal epithelium||Air–liquid interface||Cell culture","Luminal and Glandular Epithelial Cells from the Porcine Endometrium maintain Cell Type-Specific Marker Gene Expression in Air–Liquid Interface Culture",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-25T04:09:07Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Epigenetic Effects of Estradiol Exposition (EPOS): 3D-Air-Liquid-Interface cultures of porcine endometrial epithelia to decipher embryo-maternal-interactions that deteriorate embryo development after exposition to endocrine disrupting chemicals","177141","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","COST",,,"85134538207",,"000826813500002","Stem Cell Rev and Rep","8","Stem Cell Reviews and Reports","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Goat is one of the first domesticated species and has evolved rapidly to adapt to diverse environments, including harsh high-altitude conditions with low temperature and poor oxygen supply but strong ultraviolet radiation. Here, we analyzed 331 genomes of domestic goats and wild caprid species living at varying altitudes (high > 3000 m above sea level and low < 1200 m), along with a reference-guided chromosome-scale assembly (contig-N50: 90.4 Mb) of a female Tibetan goat genome based on PacBio HiFi long reads, to dissect the genetic determinants underlying their adaptation to harsh conditions on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Population genomic analyses combined with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed a genomic region harboring the 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthase 2 (PAPSS2) gene showing strong association with high-altitude adaptability (PGWAS = 3.62 × 10−25) in Tibetan goats. Transcriptomic data from 13 tissues revealed that PAPSS2 was implicated in hypoxia-related pathways in Tibetan goats. We further verified potential functional role of PAPSS2 in response to hypoxia in PAPSS2-deficient cells. Introgression analyses suggested that the PAPSS2 haplotype conferring the high-altitude adaptability in Tibetan goats originated from a recent hybridization between goats and a wild caprid species, the markhor (C. falconeri). In conclusion, our results uncover a hitherto unknown contribution of PAPSS2 to high-altitude adaptability in Tibetan goats on QTP, following interspecific introgression and natural selection.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000582748",,"0737-4038||1537-1719",,"10.1093/molbev/msac253","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/582748","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Environmental adaptation||High altitude||Hypoxia||Goat||Genomics||Genetic introgression","Markhor-derived Introgression of a Genomic Region Encompassing PAPSS2 Confers High-altitude Adaptability in Tibetan Goats",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-23T15:53:12Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85143645574",,"000895460100001","Mol Biol Evol","12","Molecular Biology and Evolution","39","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

He is known for having coined the term of ""pedology"" but his role in the development of the soil science needs recognition, the opinions diverging this far with regard to his importance in terms of pedogenesis, soil profile, soil classification and influence on Dokuchaev. The authors of the present article have translated into French and analyzed in detail each of the chapters constituting the first part (""Allgemeine Bodenkunde"" 198 pp.) of his book. These pages include many precise descriptions of the soils in a small area near Fallou's place of residence in a hilly part of Saxony (NE Germany) and bear evidence for his remarkable skills as nature observer. His field experience led him to strongly recommend that soils should be studied in situ, using existing cuts, either natural or artificial. He was first to strive for the ""Earth"" to be recognized as a ""Kingdom"" of its own and for the study of the soils to be established as an independent natural science for the benefit of a wide range of potential stakeholders. The present review is intended to demonstrate that despite some shortcomings due to his sticking to a few outdated basic scientific conceptions, Fallou fully deserves to be regarded as an important forerunner of modern soil science.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000582954",,"1436-8730||0044-3263||1522-2624",,"10.1002/jpln.202200306","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/582954","en","Wiley-VCH","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Fallou||forerunner||history||pedology||soil classification","The contribution of Friedrich Albert Fallou to modern soil science",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-25T07:30:35Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85141973460",,"000882691300001","J.

Moreover, water demand for irrigation has led to overexploitation of the groundwater table causing significant natural resource management challenges. The combination of groundwater changes and increasing drought risk raises concerns about the ability of agricultural producers to be resilient against drought. In this study, we describe the interactions of environmental and socioeconomic processes which influence farmers' livelihoods involved in tomato production in Morocco. Building on system dynamics modelling tools, we aim to improve the understanding of the long-term dynamic behavior of water management and to explore plausible policy scenarios necessary for sustainable and resilient water resource management and agricultural development. Our results show that tomato production is not yet severely impacted by droughts. However, droughts are accelerating the process of groundwater depletion, impacting farmers' livelihoods, by decreasing crop productivity and reducing farmer's revenue over a longer time period, especially since tomatoes are a high-value crop. Therefore, integrated and effective policies are presented as a set of measures for a systemic enhancement of resilience. We conclude that a more radical approach toward water resource conservation and upholding the most vulnerable producers has to be adopted in order to enhance a sustainable and inclusive resilience of the tomato production in Morocco.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000566488",,"0048-9697||1879-1026","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566488||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566911","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157597","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/568294","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Resilience||System dynamics modelling||Socio-ecological systems||Agriculture||Water management","Climate resilience and the human-water dynamics.

Hence, magnitude and drivers of temporal variations in carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes in croplands are urgently needed to develop sustainable, climate-smart agricultural practices. However, our knowledge of GHG fluxes from croplands is still very limited. The eddy covariance technique was used to quantify GHG budgets and N2O emission factors (EF) for pea and maize in Switzerland. The random forest technique was applied for gap-filling N2O and CH4 fluxes as well as to determine the relevance of environmental, vegetation vs. management drivers of the GHG fluxes during two cropping seasons. Environmental (i.e., net radiation, soil water content, soil temperature) and vegetation drivers (i.e., vegetation height) were more important drivers for GHG fluxes at field scale than time since management for the two crop species. Both crops acted as GHG sinks between sowing and harvest, clearly dominated by net CO2 fluxes, while CH4 emissions were negligible. However, considerable N2O emissions occurred in both crop fields early in the season when crops were still establishing. N2O fluxes in both crops were small later in the season when vegetation was tall, despite high soil water contents and temperatures. Results clearly show a strong and highly dynamic microbial-plant competition for N driving N2O fluxes at the field scale. The total loss was 1.4 kg N2O-N ha−1 over 55 days for pea and 4.8 kg N2O-N ha−1 over 127 days for maize. EFs of N2O were 1.5 % (pea) and 4.4 % (maize) during the cropping seasons, clearly exceeding the IPCC Tier 1 EF for N2O. Thus, sustainable, climate-smart agriculture needs to consider crop phenology and better adapt N supply to crop N demand for growth, particularly during the early cropping season when competition for N between establishing crops and soil microorganisms modulates N2O losses.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000563569",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157541","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563569","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Corn||Legume||Eddy covariance||Agriculture||Arable land||Management","Greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, N2O and CH4) of pea and maize during two cropping seasons: Drivers, budgets, and emission factors for nitrous oxide",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-13T08:54:22Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Reconciling innovative farming practices and networks to enable sustainable development of smart Swiss farming systems","172433","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 73: Gesuch",,,"85135843688",,"000864740100009","Sci.

In this study, observed GPP data of 494 site-years from 39 eddy covariance sites in Northern Hemisphere were used to investigate mechanisms of interannual variation of AGPP. This study first decomposed AGPP into three seasonal dynamic attribute parameters (growing season length (CUP), maximum daily GPP (GPPmax), and the ratio of mean daily GPP to GPPmax (αGPP)), and then decomposed AGPP into mean leaf area index (LAIm) and annual photosynthetic capacity per leaf area (AGPPlm). Furthermore, GPPmax was decomposed into leaf area index of DOYmax (the day when GPPmax appeared) (LAImax) and photosynthesis per leaf area of DOYmax (GPPlmax). Relative contributions of parameters to AGPP and GPPmax were then calculated. Finally, environmental variables of DOYmax were extracted to analyze factors influencing interannual variation of GPPlmax. Trends of AGPP in 39 ecosystems varied from −65.23 to 53.05 g C m−2 yr−2, with the mean value of 6.32 g C m−2 yr−2. Photosynthetic capacity (GPPmax and AGPPlm), not CUP or LAI, was the main factor dominating interannual variation of AGPP. GPPlmax determined the interannual variation of GPPmax, and temperature, water, and radiation conditions of DOYmax affected the interannual variation of GPPlmax. This study used the cascade relationship of “environmental variables-GPPlmax-GPPmax-AGPP” to explain the mechanism of interannual variation of AGPP, which can provide new ideas for the AGPP estimation based on seasonal dynamic of GPP.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000564880",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157856","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/564880","en","Elsevier",,,"Annual gross primary productivity||Interannual variation||Maximum daily GPP||Photosynthesis per leaf area||Environmental variables","Photosynthetic capacity dominates the interannual variation of annual gross primary productivity in the Northern Hemisphere",,"Journal Article","Embargoed",,,,"2022-08-19T03:02:17Z","2024-08-05",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"ICOS-CH Phase 3","198227||198227","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen||Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,"85135691858",,"000880123700004","Sci.

This could be particularly important in farming systems, with limited access to inputs and where low soil P availability has been identified. In a pot experiment using soils labelled with radioactive 33P, we examined how a range of cover crop residues directly contribute to P uptake of ryegrass, as well as how they affect P uptake of ryegrass from the soil P pool. Two soils with a low and a moderate P status (6.3 and 15.3 mg Olsen-P kg−1 soil) were chosen for the pot experiment as models for soils that are gradually becoming depleted in available P. Residues from five cover crop species (buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L.), garden sorrel (Rumex acetosa L.), white lupine (Lupinus albus L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth)) showed a wide species-dependent variability in P concentration (3.4–8.8 mg P g-1 DM) and other quality traits. Cover crop residues contributed less to ryegrass growth and P uptake than the water-soluble P fertilizer. At the same P application dose, cover crops contributed 0.4–2.3 mg P kg−1 soil (18–42 %) to the total P uptake of ryegrass depending on species and soil P status, whereas mineral P fertilizer contributed up to 5.2 mg P kg−1 soil (46 %). In the low P soil, application of sorrel and radish significantly increased the P uptake of ryegrass compared to the control without P (by 93 and 75 %, respectively), whereas in the moderate P soil, sorrel and vetch increased the uptake (by 61 and 43 %, respectively). The cover crop effects on P uptake of ryegrass correlated significantly but only moderately well with their P concentration, content of water-extractable P and C:P ratio (R2 = 0.4, R2 = 0.4 and R2 = 0.5, respectively). As expected, the contribution of mineral fertilizer to P uptake of ryegrass was lower in the low P soil with a higher P sorption capacity compared to the moderate P soil, whereas the contribution of cover crops residues in these two soils was species-dependent. Addition of mineral fertilizer resulted in a greater uptake of soil P compared to the control whereas buckwheat and lupin with highest C:P ratios gave rise to a substantially smaller uptake of soil P, which is an indication of microbial P immobilization. Our study demonstrated that cover crop residues may contribute to the P nutrition of the subsequent crop, in some cases substantially, depending on the quality of the residues and the soil P status.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000566913",,"0016-7061||1872-6259",,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.116075","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566913","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Cover crops||Phosphorus uptake||Soil phosphorus status||Isotopic labelling","Differences in cover crop contributions to phosphorus uptake by ryegrass in two soils with low and moderate P status",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-27T03:04:31Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85135881395",,"000861246400007","Geoderma",,"Geoderma","426","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite the chemical similarity of selenium to the two more abundantly studied elements sulfur and arsenic, the understanding of its accumulation in soils and availability for plants is limited. The lack of understanding of soil selenium cycling is largely due to the unavailability of methods to characterize selenium species in soils, especially the organic ones. Here we develop a size-resolved multi-elemental method using liquid chromatography and elemental mass spectrometry, which enables an advanced characterization of selenium, sulfur, and arsenic species in soil extracts. We apply the analytical approach to soils sampled along the Kohala rainfall gradient on Big Island (Hawaii), which cover a large range of organic carbon and (oxy)hydroxides contents. Similarly to sulfur but contrarily to arsenic, a large fraction of selenium is found associated with organic matter in these soils. However, while sulfur and arsenic are predominantly found as oxyanions in water extracts, selenium mainly exists as small hydrophilic organic compounds. Combining Kohala soil speciation data with concentrations in parent rock and plants further suggests that selenium association with organic matter limits its mobility in soils and availability for plants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000582554",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-022-34731-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/582554","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Understanding soil selenium accumulation and bioavailability through size resolved and elemental characterization of soil extracts",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-23T05:11:20Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Forms and dynamics of soil phosphorus along a climosequence on basalt-derived soils (CLIMP)","162422","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85141867403",,"000884426700018","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Greater societal attention in recent years has culminated in changes (or proposed changes) to regulations as well as market-driven initiatives to move away from crated systems. Transitioning from farrowing crates to systems that allow the sow greater freedom of movement and behavioral expression requires a number of key decisions, with various trade-offs apparent when trying to balance the needs of different stakeholders. This review discusses these decisions based on common questions asked by farmers, policy makers and other stakeholders when deciding on a new system to build/approve. Based on the latest scientific evidence and practical insight, decisions such as: whether to retrofit an existing barn or build a new one, what spatial dimensions are necessary per sow place, whether to adopt free farrowing or temporary crating, how to provide substrate/enrichment and be hygienic and environmentally friendly, and how to optimize the human inputs and transition between systems are considered. The aim of this paper is to provide a roadmap for those interested in uptake of higher welfare systems and practices, as well as to highlight areas requiring further optimization and research.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000584661",,"2297-1769",,"10.3389/fvets.2022.998192","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/584661","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","pigs||free farrowing||temporary crating||design||welfare||management||economics||environment","Transitioning from crates to free farrowing: A roadmap to navigate key decisions",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-04T03:54:04Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85142909714",,"000890245800001","Front.

Previous studies have focused on the advanced stages of autumnal leaf senescence and reported that climatic warming delayed senescence, despite the fundamental differences among the stages of senescence. However, the timing of onset of leaf coloration (DLCO), the earliest visual sign of senescence, has rarely been studied. Here, we assessed the response of DLCO to temperature.  Location 30–75° N in the Northern Hemisphere.  Time period 2000–2018.  Major taxa studied Deciduous vegetation.  Methods We retrieved DLCO from high-temporal-resolution satellite data, which were then validated by PhenoCam observations. We investigated the temporal changes in DLCO and the relationship between DLCO and temperature by using satellite and ground observations.  Results DLCO was not significantly (p > .05) delayed between 2000 and 2018 in 94% of the area. DLCO was positively (p < .05) correlated with pre-DLCO mean daily minimum temperature (Tmin) in only 9% of the area, whereas the end of leaf coloration (DLCE) was positively correlated with pre-DLCE mean Tmin over a larger area (34%). Further analyses showed that warming slowed the progress of leaf coloration. Interestingly, DLCO was less responsive to pre-DLCO mean Tmin in areas where daylength was longer across the Northern Hemisphere, particularly for woody vegetation.  Main conclusions The rate of progress of coloration is more sensitive to temperature than its start date, resulting in an extension of the duration of leaf senescence under warming. The dependence of DLCO response to temperature on daylength indicates stronger photoperiodic control on initiation of leaf senescence in areas with longer daylength (i.e., shorter nights), possibly because plants respond to the length of uninterrupted darkness rather than daylength. This study indicates that the onset of leaf coloration was not responsive to climate warming and provides observational evidence of photoperiod control of autumnal leaf senescence at biome and continental scales.",,,,"1466-822X||1466-8238",,"10.1111/geb.13581","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566189","en","Wiley",,,"autumnal leaf senescence||global warming||leaf coloration onset||Northern Hemisphere||photoperiod","Warming does not delay the start of autumnal leaf coloration but slows its progress rate",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-08-25T02:53:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85135817629",,"000840376600001","Glob.

Sentinel-2 spectral imagery is well placed to capture the spatiotemporal variability of SOC, but its capability has only been demonstrated for agricultural regions mostly located in Europe. Furthermore, most studies so far only used single-date images that resulted in spatially non-continuous SOC maps, hampering their ability to aid multiscale SOC assessments. Here, we aim to achieve spatially continuous mapping of SOC in croplands, by creating multitemporal bare soil composites that maximize cropland coverage in two regions of varying agroecosystems and landscape structure in the Northeast China Chernozem region and the Belgian Loam Belt. Bare soil pixels were extracted via spectral index thresholding that excluded contaminated pixels from external perturbance. Multitemporal soil composites were then obtained by averaging over multiple single-date bare soil images that were selected within pre-determined optimal time-windows, corresponding to the region-specific crop sowing periods when best possible surface conditions were expected. Results show that the optimal time-window filter ensured selective inclusion of single-date images that themselves yielded stable and robust SOC predictions across multiple years. Spectral-based models developed from multitemporal composites consistently produced better or similar prediction accuracies than single-date images for both study regions (R2: 0.52–0.62; RMSE: 0.17–0.21 g 100 g−1), while also achieved maximum cropland coverage (>82 %). Bootstrap modelling demonstrated that SOC mapping via multitemporal Sentinel-2 data was associated with small uncertainties. Investigations into the significant spectral bands that contributed to the prediction of SOC suggested that, regardless of the study regions, the physical relationship between spectral bands and SOC that predominantly exists for laboratory spectra is largely translated into Sentinel-2 platforms. This study highlights the widespread applicability of multitemporal Sentinel-2 remote sensing for effective and high-resolution SOC mapping, in order to detect localized soil degradation as well as to inform regional cropland management in diverse agroecosystems.",,,,"0924-2716",,"10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2022.09.013","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/574118","en","Elsevier",,,"Sentinel-2||Soil organic carbon mapping||Multitemporal analysis||Bare soil composite","Towards spatially continuous mapping of soil organic carbon in croplands using multitemporal Sentinel-2 remote sensing",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-10-04T05:50:37Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85138461836",,"000898840000001","ISPRS j. photogramm. remote sens.",,"ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","193","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Sustainable intensification (SI) of agriculture has been proposed as a promising concept for safeguarding global food security, while simultaneously protecting the environment and promoting good quality of life. However, SI often leads to context-specific sustainability trade-offs. Operationalising SI thus needs to be supported by transparent sustainability assessments. In this article, we propose a general systematic approach to developing context-specific frameworks for integrated sustainability assessment of agricultural intensity change. Firstly, we specify a comprehensive system representation for analysing how changes in agricultural intensity lead to a multitude of sustainability outcomes affecting different societal groups across geographical scales. We then introduce a procedure for identifying the attributes that are relevant for assessment within particular contexts, and respective indicator metrics. Finally, we illustrate the proposed approach by developing an assessment framework for evaluating a wide range of intensification pathways in Europe. The application of the approach revealed processes and effects that are relevant for the European context but are rarely considered in SI assessments. These include farmers’ health, workers’ living conditions, cultural heritage and sense of place of rural communities, animal welfare, impacts on sectors not directly related to agriculture (e.g., tourism), shrinking and ageing of rural population and consumers’ health. The proposed approach addresses important gaps in SI assessments, and thus represents an important step forward in defining transparent procedures for sustainability assessments that can stimulate an informed debate about the operationalisation of SI and its contribution towards achieving SDGs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000570290",,"1462-9011||1873-6416",,"10.1016/j.envsci.2022.08.014","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/570290","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sustainable intensification||Systemic approach||Multi-scale||SDGs","Developing context-specific frameworks for integrated sustainability assessment of agricultural intensity change: An application for Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-13T06:37:36Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85137171385",,"000863220700014","Environ.

The development of TDR theories, principles, and methods has been largely governed by researchers from the global North and has reflected their contextual conditions. To enable more context-sensitive TDR framing, we sought to identify which contextual characteristics affect the design and implementation of TDR in six case studies in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and what this means for TDR as a scientific approach. To this end, we distinguished four TDR process elements and identified several associated context dimensions that appeared to influence them. Our analysis showed that contextual characteristics prevalent in many Southern research sites—such as highly volatile socio-political situations and relatively weak support infrastructure—can make TDR a challenging endeavour. However, we also observed a high degree of variation in the contextual characteristics of our sites in the global South, including regarding group deliberation, research freedom, and dominant perceptions of the appropriate relationship between science, society, and policy. We argue that TDR in these contexts requires pragmatic adaptations as well as more fundamental reflection on underlying epistemological concepts around what it means to conduct “good science”, as certain contextual characteristics may influence core epistemological values of TDR.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000565781",,"1862-4065||1862-4057",,"10.1007/s11625-022-01201-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/565781","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Transdisciplinarity||Context||Global South||Epistemology","How context affects transdisciplinary research: insights from Asia, Africa and Latin America",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-23T18:25:53Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"SNF R4D","152167","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 60: Gesuch",,,"85136554088",,"000842907500001","Sustain Sci","6","Sustainability Science","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Herein, a drone that can squeeze its way through arbitrarily long passages that are half its width is presented. This is achieved by developing a quadrotor that synergistically embodies a soft foldable frame, multimodal mobility, and autonomous navigation. The drone exploits visual perception to detect the entrance of the gap and aerial mobility to align and fly toward it. The entry is made possible by the soft design of the frame, which passively folds without breaking when the drone flies and then collides at a controlled speed with the entrance of the passage, i.e., the ""crash to squash"" entry maneuver. Once inside, the quadrotor uses terrestrial locomotion for the traversal. The mechanical design of the drone and the performance of the ""crash to squash"" entry maneuver in passageways of different sizes are experimentally characterized. Finally, the control method is validated by indoor autonomous flights.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000575022",,"2640-4567",,"10.1002/aisy.202200113","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575022","en","Wiley-VCH","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","aerial robotics||foldable mechanisms||multimodal mobility||soft robotics","Crash 2 Squash: An Autonomous Drone for the Traversal of Narrow Passageways",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-10T11:30:07Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"CYbER - CanopY Exploration Robots","186865||186865","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Eccellenza||Eccellenza",,,,,"000860811500001","Adv.

Tested with experimental data from 18 species, our model successfully predicts the simultaneous decline in carbon assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity during progressive soil drought. It also correctly predicts the dependencies of gas exchange on atmospheric vapour pressure deficit, temperature and CO2. Model predictions are also consistent with widely observed empirical patterns, such as the distribution of hydraulic strategies.

To develop a model-based approach for estimating nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils, model calibration is one of the first important steps. Extensive multisite field observations are necessary for this purpose, as agricultural management in Western Europe is complex (e.g., diverse crop rotations, different types of fertilizer and soil tillage). In the present study, we used ca. 24,000 daily N2O flux observations from six cropland sites, two in France and four in Switzerland, to conduct an automatic data-driven calibration of the biogeochemical model DayCent. This model is planned to be used for greenhouse gas reporting in the entire European Union as well as in Switzerland. After a site-specific calibration, a leave-one-out (LOO) cross-evaluation was conducted to assess the model’s ability to predict N2O emissions for sites it was not calibrated for. Mean observed N2O fluxes for 54 interactions of crop cycles, field studies and treatments were used to evaluate the model. The LOO cross-evaluation resulted in a R2 of 0.63 for the prediction of mean N2O fluxes per crop cycle, compared to an R2 of 0.51 obtained with default parameterization. Our results showed that the improvement in N2O predictions was associated with the adjustment of only seven parameters controlling the N cycle in soil (e.g., the maximum daily nitrification amount and the inflection point for the effect of water-filled pore space on denitrification) out of several hundred parameters. These parameters showed a wide range of values between sites, revealing an important challenge for calibration-based improvement of N2O simulations. Despite the remaining uncertainty, our model-based estimates of N2O emission per crop cycle (2.64 kg N ha-1) were clearly closer to measurements (2.67 kg N ha-1) than commonly used emission factor approaches (1.60–1.71 kg N ha-1). Based on extensive field observations, our results suggest that, after data-driven calibration of only few N cycle parameters, DayCent simulations are useful for reporting N2O emissions of complex cropland management. These model based-estimates were more accurate, because they consider key drivers that are disregarded by simpler approaches. Moving towards more complex methods of N2O reporting, is therefore expected to improve the accuracy and additionally allows to assess mitigation options.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000568535",,"1161-0301||1873-7331",,"10.1016/j.eja.2022.126613","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/568535","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Model||Denitrification||Greenhouse gas||IPCC Tier 3||Trace gas","Modeling N2O emissions of complex cropland management in Western Europe using DayCent: Performance and scope for improvement",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-02T10:07:35Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Reconciling innovative farming practices and networks to enable sustainable development of smart Swiss farming systems","172433","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 73: Gesuch",,,"85137301628",,"000867370900006","Eur.

Plant defense phenotypes can be compromised by inbreeding, and there is some evidence that such adverse effects can extend to the transgenerational expression of induced resistance. We explored how the inbreeding status of maternal Solanum carolinense plants influenced the transgenerational effects of herbivory on the defensive traits and herbivore resistance of offspring. Manduca sexta caterpillars were used to damage inbred and outbred S. carolinense maternal plants and cross pollinations were performed to produced seeds from herbivore- damaged and undamaged, inbred and outbred maternal plants. Seeds were grown in the greenhouse to assess offspring defense-related traits (i.e., leaf trichomes, internode spines, volatile organic compounds) and resistance to herbivores. We found that feeding by M. sexta caterpillars on maternal plants had a positive influence on trichome and spine production in offspring and that caterpillar development on offspring of herbivore-damaged maternal plants was delayed relative to that on offspring of undamaged plants. Offspring of inbred maternal plants had reduced spine production, compared to those of outbred maternal plants, and caterpillars performed better on the offspring of inbred plants. Both herbivory and inbreeding in the maternal generation altered volatile emissions of offspring. In general, maternal plant inbreeding dampened transgenerational effects of herbivory on offspring defensive traits and herbivore resistance. Taken together, this study demonstrates that inducible defenses in S. carolinense can persist across generations and that inbreeding compromises transgenerational resistance in S. carolinense.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000580574",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0274920","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/580574","en","PLOS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Adverse effects of inbreeding on the transgenerational expression of herbivoreinduced defense traits in Solanum carolinense",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-11-10T14:00:43Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85140855590",,"000956781500001","PLoS ONE","10","PLoS ONE","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, actual measurements of nitrate leaching from animal manure under field conditions are scarce. In an on-farm field trial in Switzerland over 2.5 years, we used 15N labelling to trace the fate of N from cattle slurry in the soil-plant system and to test whether more nitrate was leached from slurry than from mineral fertiliser. The experiment was conducted on two neighbouring fields with loamy soil in an agricultural area of the Swiss midlands, where nitrate levels in the groundwater are persistently high. Both fields followed the same crop rotation (silage maize – winter wheat – grass-clover), but shifted by one year. We compared three fertiliser treatments: Control (Con), 15N mineral fertiliser (Min), and 15N cattle slurry (Slu). In order to provide a comprehensive fertiliser N balance over several years, we traced the labelled fertilisers into crop biomass, soil, and leached nitrate. In the year of application, 15N recovery in crops was 45–47% for Min, but only 19–23% for Slu. Complementary to this finding, recoveries in soil were greater for Slu than for Min, despite greater NH3 emissions from Slu. Fertiliser recovery in the succeeding crops was small (< 4.6% of the originally applied fertiliser N in the first residual year and < 2.4% in the second) and similar for both fertilisers. Depth translocation of fertiliser N was marginal, with the majority of 15N in soil still in the top 0.3 m after 2.5 years. Along with higher recoveries in soil for Slu, we found significantly more slurry N than mineral fertiliser N lost through leaching. However, less than 5% of cumulated amounts of nitrate leaching over the three crops, which reached up to 205 kg nitrate-N ha-1, originated from direct leaching of the labelled fertilisers. Our findings suggest that most nitrate leaching originated from the mineralisation of soil N.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000560957",,"0167-8809||1873-2305",,"10.1016/j.agee.2022.108093","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/560957","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nitrate leaching||15N labelling||On-farm trial||Cattle slurry||Residual N use efficiency","Leached nitrate under fertilised loamy soil originates mainly from mineralisation of soil organic N",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-30T03:10:57Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85134607177",,"000860787700004","Agric. ecosyst. environ.",,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","338","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, litter decomposition in arable systems remains poorly explored, and it is unclear whether different management practices, such as organic farming, conservation agriculture can mitigate drought effects on litter decomposition.  Thus, we examined the effects of a severe experimental drought on litter decomposition in four cropping systems, i.e., organic vs. conventional farming, each with two levels of tillage (intensive vs. conservation tillage) in Switzerland. We incubated two types of standard litter (tea bags), i.e., high-quality green tea with a low C:N ratio and low-quality rooibos tea with a high C:N ratio. We assessed litter decomposition during the simulated drought and in the post-drought period during three years in three different crops, i.e., pea-barley, maize, and winter wheat. Subsequently, we assessed whether decomposition in the four cropping systems differed in its resistance and resilience to drought.  Drought had a major impact on litter decomposition and suppressed decomposition to a similar extent in all cropping systems. Both drought resistance and resilience of decomposition were largely independent of cropping systems. Drought more strongly reduced decomposition of the high-quality litter compared to the low-quality litter during drought conditions regarding the absolute change in mass remaining (12.3% vs. 6.5 %, respectively). However, the decomposition of high-quality litter showed a higher resilience, i.e., high-quality approached undisturbed decomposition levels faster than low-quality litter after drought. Soil nitrate availability was also strongly reduced by drought (by 32–86 %), indicating the strong reduction in nutrient availability and, most likely, microbial activity due to water shortage. In summary, our study suggests that severe drought has a much stronger impact on decomposition than cropping system indicating that it might not be possible to maintain decomposition under drought by the cropping system approaches we studied. Nevertheless, management options that improve litter quality, such as the use of legume crops with high N concentrations, may help to enhance the resilience of litter decomposition in drought-stressed crop fields.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000556848",,"0167-8809||1873-2305",,"10.1016/j.agee.2022.108078","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/556848","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Drought||Resistance||Resilience||Organic farming||Conservation tillage","Severe drought rather than cropping system determines litter decomposition in arable systems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-08T05:28:21Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85133553325",,"000864091900008","Agric. ecosyst. environ.",,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","338","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Warming of +5°C enhanced photosynthetic properties in oak but not beech, while moisture reduction decreased them in both species. Combined warming and moisture reduction reduced photosynthetic properties for both species, but no exacerbated effects were observed.

The thinner branches of the outer canopy remain inaccessible, despite being of particular interest due to the important physiological processes occurring in the foliage.

The holding force, activation force, and resistance to tilt and rotation offsets are experimentally characterized. The deployment and retrieval of the gripper and sensor are demonstrated outside, where sensor data are collected from previously inaccessible branches in the outer canopy.

Thus, the adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices such as crop diversification and reduction of external inputs represent an alternative strategy to minimize the impacts of intensive agricultural systems to the environment. This study aimed at evaluating the effects of crop rotation, conservation tillage, and low-input strategies on soil quality and farming performance using a set of 7 indicators based on a fuzzy logic approach. Data were collected from three Mediterranean long-term field experiments (LTEs) mostly oriented on cereal-based and vegetables cropping systems, located in Spain and Italy. The selected agro-environmental indicators clearly discriminated both from a geographical point of view and between monoculture and diversification, showing their suitability for the evaluation of diversified cropping systems. Such indicators highlighted that implementing crop diversification and reducing soil disturbance and chemical inputs enhanced soil quality. In this context, the most significant effects of diversified cropping strategies were the increase of crucial variables such as soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (Pav), and bulk density (BD) maintaining a stability of yields in all the three LTEs. These results provide strong evidence for the benefits of crop diversification in Mediterranean areas, highlighting that diversification represents a very promising strategy for more sustainable land management. Simple and composite indicators calculated using fuzzy method can be proposed as tool to assess the effects of diversification strategies on cropping systems performance. This approach can be used to define local solutions to help the re-design of cropping system through crop diversification transition across Europe.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000563322",,"1161-0301||1873-7331",,"10.1016/j.eja.2022.126598","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563322","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Indicators||Fuzzy analysis||Soil quality||Horticulture||Arable crops||Tillage||Crop rotation","A comprehensive assessment of diversified cropping systems on agro-environmental sustainability in three Mediterranean long-term field experiments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-12T03:40:26Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Crop diversification and low-input farming across Europe: from practitioners engagement and ecosystems services to increased revenues and chain organisation","728003","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,"85135390955",,"000860427200004","Eur.

Cassava is a perennial crop, and it can be produced all year round. However, cassava fresh root yield and starch content are strongly influenced by environmental conditions such as rainfall. Therefore, it is important to identify planting and harvest periods to attain maximum yields and starch content and to increase profitability. The present study aimed at (i) comparing changes in fresh root yields and starch contents of cassava planted and harvested at different times around the year (ii) identifying the cassava harvest phase attaining maximum fresh root yields and starch content (iii) assessing how price fluctuations and root yields affect the revenue and income generation across the year. This study was carried from 2017 to 2019 in southwestern Nigeria. Existing cassava fields planted at different months were visited and the planting dates were recorded. Harvesting for each planting month was done at 9, 11 and 13 months after planting (MAP). Fresh root yield and starch content varied across planting months. For all crop ages, the highest fresh root yields were recorded when planted in September and December. The highest root starch content was observed in 9- and 13-months old cassava when planted in March and November, respectively. Cassava fresh root yield and starch content varied across Julian day of harvest with lowest yields obtained between Julian day 60–120 (March and April) which coincides with the beginning of rainfall. Highest fresh root yields and starch content were attained between Julian day 180–330. Revenue showed seasonal variation and was dependent Julian day of harvest. Gross revenue was lowest between Julian day 60 and 120 (March and April) and highest from Julian day 180 (July). Lowest incomes or profits were recorded when cassava was harvested between Julian day 60 and 120 (March and April). About 9.1 % of farmers had negative revenues or lost income when they harvested at 9 MAP hence losing between 150 and 200 USD ha−1 compared with 2.8 % of farmers that lost income when harvesting was done at 11 and 13 MAP losing between 100 and 150 USD ha−1. Thus, farmers’ income generation critically depends on cassava planting and harvest dates. Choosing the right time to plant and harvest cassava is one of the most important decisions farmers can make to maximize profit.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000562066",,"0378-4290||1872-6852",,"10.1016/j.fcr.2022.108639","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/562066","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Rainfall||Cassava||Starch content||Planting month||Crop age||Cassava root yield and harvest month","Effects of expanding cassava planting and harvesting windows on root yield, starch content and revenue in southwestern Nigeria",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-05T03:13:49Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85135067453",,"000881571800009","Field crops res.",,"Field Crops Research","286","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Before commercialization, it is necessary to assess possible ecological impacts, including impacts on non-target arthropods (NTAs) in the field. In the present study, transgenic Bt maize expressing cry1Ab/2Aj and its corresponding non-transformed near isoline were planted under the same environmental and agricultural conditions, and arthropods in the field were collected during the three main growth stages of maize. In a one year trial, the results showed the composition of NTA communities in the transgenic and control maize fields were similar. There were no significant differences for community-level parameters of species richness (S), Shannon–Wiener diversity index (H′), evenness index (J) and Simpson’s dominant concentration (C) between the two types of maize fields. Likewise, a Bray–Curtis dissimilarity and distance analysis showed that Cry1Ab/2Aj toxin exposure did not increase community dissimilarities between Bt and non-Bt maize plots and that the structure of the NTAs community was similar on the two maize varieties. Furthermore, planting of the transgenic cry1Ab/2Aj maize did not affect the density or composition of non-target decomposers, herbivores, predators, parasitoids and pollinator guilds. In summary, our results showed that planting of Bt maize producing Cry1Ab/Cry2Aj proteins do not adversely affect population dynamics and diversity of NTAs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000596939",,"2223-7747",,"10.3390/plants11192520","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/596939","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bacillus thuringiensis||non-target arthropods||biodiversity||community composition||ecological safety assessment","Impact of Transgenic Cry1Ab/2Aj Maize on Abundance of Non-Target Arthropods in the Field",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-02-03T11:13:18Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"19","Plants","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the assessment of physiological drought stress is challenging, and feedback between soil and vegetation is often omitted because of scarce belowground data. Here we aimed to model Swiss forests' water availability during the 2015 and 2018 droughts by implementing the mechanistic soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transport (SVAT) model LWF-Brook90 taking advantage of regionalized depth-resolved soil information. We calibrated the model against soil matric potential data measured from 2014 to 2018 at 44 sites along a Swiss climatic and edaphic drought gradient. Swiss forest soils' storage capacity of plant-available water ranged from 53 mm to 341 mm, with a median of 137 ± 42 mm down to the mean potential rooting depth of 1.2 m. Topsoil was the primary water source. However, trees switched to deeper soil water sources during drought. This effect was less pronounced for coniferous trees with a shallower rooting system than for deciduous trees, which resulted in a higher reduction of actual transpiration (transpiration deficit) in coniferous trees. Across Switzerland, forest trees reduced the transpiration by 23% (compared to potential transpiration) in 2015 and 2018, maintaining annual actual transpiration comparable to other years. Together with lower evaporative fluxes, the Swiss forests did not amplify the blue water deficit. The 2018 drought, characterized by a higher and more persistent transpiration deficit than in 2015, triggered widespread early wilting across Swiss forests that was better predicted by the SVAT-derived mean soil matric potential in the rooting zone than by climatic predictors. Such feedback-driven quantification of ecosystem water fluxes in the soil–plant-atmosphere continuum will be crucial to predicting physiological drought stress under future climate extremes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000559935",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.16332","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/559935","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate impact||European summer drought||physiological drought||plant-available water storage capacity||root water uptake||water balance","Soil–plant interactions modulated water availability of Swiss forests during the 2015 and 2018 droughts",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-25T14:47:59Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"ICOS-CH Phase 3","198227","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,"85134617689",,"000830365400001","Glob.

As an alternative to traditional ground-based sampling at breast height by field crews, we examined the feasibility of aerially sampling and testing material collected from upper canopy branches using a small unoccupied aerial system (sUAS). The pathogen of interest in this study is Ceratocystis lukuohia, the fungal pathogen responsible for Ceratocystis wilt of ‘ōhi‘a, a vascular wilt disease which has caused widespread mortality to ‘ōhi‘ain native forests across the state of Hawai‘i. To characterize the minimum branch diameter needed to successfully detect the pathogen of interest in infected trees, we tested 63 branch samples (0.8–9.6 cm in diameter) collected from felled trees inoculated with C. lukuohia on Hawai‘i Island. Subsequently, we aerially sampled branches from ten symptomatic ‘ōhi‘a (Metrosideros polymorpha) trees using two different branch sampling systems, the Flying Tree Top Sampler from ETH Zurich and the new Kūkūau branch sampler system introduced in this work, producing 29 branch samples with a maximum diameter of 4.2 cm and length of >2 m. We successfully detected the target fungal pathogen from the collected branches and found that branch diameter, leaf presence and condition, as well as wood moisture content are important factors in pathogen detection in sampled branches. None of the smallest branch samples (those <1 cm in diameter) tested positive for C. lukuohia, while 77% of the largest diameter branch samples (5–10 cm) produced positive results. The Kūkūau branch sampler system is capable of retrieving branches up to 7 cm diameter, providing important capacity for pathogenic research requiring larger diameter samples for successful diagnostic testing. Inconclusive and/or non-detection laboratory results were obtained from sample materials that were either too desiccated or from a branch with asymptomatic leaves, suggesting there is an optimal temporal window for sampling.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000572656",,"2504-446X",,"10.3390/drones6100275","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572656","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Rapid ‘ōhi’a death||sUAS||Forest pathogen||Branch diameter||Diagnostic sampling||Ceratocystis lukuohia||Ceratocystis wilt of ‘ōhi’a","Aerial Branch Sampling to Detect Forest Pathogens",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-26T07:47:27Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85140652686",,"000872724400001",,"10","Drones","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As NH3 emissions are mostly generated by agriculture, a particular conflict of interest exists in areas where agricultural production systems are located nearby sensitive ecosystems, as often is the case in Switzerland. Therefore, this study aimed at quantifying and evaluating total N inputs to a mire in the Swiss Alpine foothills during 2007–2019, focusing on NH3 dry deposition. Three surface–vegetation–atmosphere transfer models were used to estimate dry deposition of NH3 based on micrometeorological data in combination with monthly passive sampler NH3 concentration measurements. NH3-N dry deposition summed up to 1.5–5.2 kg N ha–1 a–1, while total N loads were 11.5–14.2 kg N ha–1 a–1, well beyond the critical N loads for raised bogs (5–10 kg N ha–1 a–1), and also higher than the lower limits for oligotrophic fens and mountain hay meadows (10 kg N ha–1 a–1). Hence, the mire studied is most likely negatively affected by eutrophication, which could ultimately lead to biodiversity loss and ecosystem instability.

NEP varies with natural drivers such as precipitation, air temperature, solar radiation, plant functional type (PFT), and soil texture, which affect the gross primary production and ecosystem respiration, and thus the net C sequestration. It is also known that deposition of sulphur and nitrogen influences NEP in forest ecosystems. These drivers' respective, unique effects on NEP, however, are often difficult to be individually identified by conventional bivariate analysis. Here we show that by analyzing 22 forest sites with 231 site-year data acquired from FLUXNET database across Europe for the years 2000–2014, the individual, unique effects of these drivers on annual forest CO₂ fluxes can be disentangled using Generalized Additive Models (GAM) for nonlinear regression analysis. We show that S and N deposition have substantial impacts on NEP, where S deposition above 5 kg S ha−¹ yr−¹ can significantly reduce NEP, and N deposition around 22 kg N ha−¹ yr−¹ has the highest positive effect on NEP. Our results suggest that air quality management of S and N is crucial for maintaining healthy biogeochemical functions of forests to mitigate climate change. Furthermore, the empirical models we developed for estimating NEP of forests can serve as a forest management tool in the context of climate change mitigation. Potential applications include the assessment of forest carbon fluxes in the REDD+ framework of the UNFCCC.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000550974",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156326","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/550974","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Forest carbon uptake||NEE||GPP||RECO||Empirical biogeochemical models||GAM","Disentangling effects of natural and anthropogenic drivers on forest net ecosystem production",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-07T05:51:41Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Operational Global Carbon Observing System","283080","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,"85131433145",,"000809828000012","Sci.

In this study, we aim to understand to what extent the main controls on colluvial SOC stability differ from those observed in non-colluvial soils. Paired soil profiles (non-colluvial versus colluvial) were collected from five sites which differ in climate, soil geochemical background and cultivation history. Topsoil (0-10 cm) and subsoil (30-50 cm) were analysed for SOC fractions, mineral composition, potential soil respiration and radiocarbon content. Our analysis showed that for non-colluvial soils, climate, cultivation history and weathering degree have significant effects on potential soil respiration. In contrast, for colluvial soils, the most influential factor for potential soil respiration was the rate of accretion and this was independent of climatic and geochemical context. Furthermore, accretion rates indirectly affected potential soil respiration by interacting with the degree of weathering of deposited soil. This changed the mineral matrix of colluvial soil settings and thereby may enhance soil mineral-related SOC stabilisation mechanisms. Together, these results suggest that the dominant controls on SOC stability in colluvial soils differ from those in non-colluvial soils, and the soil accretion rate is the most important control on colluvial SOC stability in agricultural systems. Highlights The dominant controls on SOC stability in colluvial and non-colluvial soils were compared. Climate and mineral weathering predominantly control SOC stability in non-colluvial soils. In contrast, the accretion rate is the key factor controlling colluvial SOC stability.

This study investigated if gestating and lactating domestic pigs are an appropriate model for WD-induced metabolic disturbances similar to those observed in humans and if Sp supplementation may attenuate any of these adverse effects. Pigs were fed a WD high in fat, sugars, and cholesterol or a control diet. Half of the animals per diet group were supplemented with 20 g Sp per day. The WD did not increase body weight or adipose tissue accumulation but led to metabolic impairments such as higher cholesterol concentration in plasma, lower IGF1 plasma levels, and signs of hepatic damage compared to the control group. Spirulina supplementation could not reduce all the metabolic impairments observed in WD-fed animals.

We subjected 51 different commercial compound feeds for pigs (38 meals, 13 pellets/granulates) to dry and/or wet sieve analysis. The amount of particles passing the finest sieve (or being soluble) was estimated by the difference to the total dry matter weighed prior to sieving. Mean particle size was calculated based on the weighted average of the material retained on the sieves (MPSsieves), and additionally with accounting for this lost material (MPStotal). Dry sieve analysis of the meals yielded MPSsieves of 0,58–2,90 mm and MPStotal of 0,58–2,89 mm; only 0,02 to 2,71 % of the dry matter passed all sieves. Wet sieve analysis of all meals and pellets yielded similar MPSsieves of 0,63–1,66 mm, but dramatically lower MPStotal of 0,26–1,04 mm; between 35 and 66 % of the dry matter was not retained on the sieves. Pellets had smaller MPS, and a higher proportion of particles passing all sieves than meals. Depending on the reference used, a maximum of 26 % of meals conformed to recommendations for pig feed particle size. None of the pelleted feeds met these criteria, irrespective of the source consulted for the recommendation. Wet sieving should be considered the standard analysis, because in dry sieving, very fine particles adhering to larger particles may not be registered separately but contribute erroneously to larger particle weight. In addition, the MPS calculation should account for material lost through the finest sieve. Reasons why Swiss pig feed does not meet particle size recommendations should be further investigated.",,,,"0036-7281||1664-2848",,"10.17236/sat00366","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/568782","en","Gesellschaft Schweizer Tierärztinnen und Tierärzte",,,"Diet||Ulcer||Stomach health||Prevention||Grinding","Particle size distribution in commercial pig compound feeds in Switzerland: survey and methodological considerations","Partikelgrösse in kommerziellen Schweinefuttermischungen in der Schweiz: Erhebung und methodische Überlegungen||Taille des particules dans les aliments composés commerciaux pour porcs en Suisse: enquête et considérations méthodologiques||Dimensioni granulometriche nelle miscele commerciali di mangimi per suini in Svizzera: indagine e considerazioni metodologiche","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-09-05T09:25:11Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85137138240",,"000861055200003","Schweiz.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate fermentation characteristics of dried fruit and vegetable pomaces in a short-term in vitro experiment using the Hohenheim Gas Test. A selection of six fruit (apple, aronia, orange, pomegranate, red, white grape) and three vegetable (beetroot, carrot, tomato) pomaces was tested in three concentrations (150, 300, 500 g kg(-1) of dry matter (DM)) as supplement to the basal diet (hay, used as control). Three runs were performed, using rumen fluid from one of three different rumen-cannulated cows in each run. Per run, each compound was tested in duplicate. After 24 h incubation, total gas production, methane and CO2 concentration, short-chain fatty acids, in vitro organic matter digestibility as well as microbial counts were determined. In addition, the pomaces' polyphenol content including the fractions non-tannin phenols, condensed tannins and hydrolysable tannins were analysed. Most pomaces did not significantly affect rumen fermentation characteristics in any of the tested dosages and may thus be applied in ruminant nutrition without adverse effects. Aronia significantly decreased (-14.5%) the organic matter digestibility in the highest concentration whereas apple (+12%), carrot (+10%) and beetroot (+8%) increased gas formation related to digestible organic matter. The 500 g kg(-1) dosage of pomegranate significantly decreased methane formation by about 28% without impairing digestibility. Pomegranate was the only pomace of those high in total tannins that contained exceptionally high amounts of hydrolysable (90% of total tannins) and proportionally low amounts of condensed tannins (10% of total tannins), indicating that the hydrolysable tannins most likely reduced the methane production. Therefore, pomegranate pomace may be an interesting option for a methane mitigating feed supplement in ruminants and should be considered for following in vivo testing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519204",,"0931-2439||1439-0396",,"10.1111/jpn.13656","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519204","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","aronia||methane mitigation potential||polyphenol||pomegranate||short-chain fatty acid||tannin","In vitro ruminal fermentation, methane production and nutrient degradability as affected by fruit and vegetable pomaces in differing concentrations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-07T09:31:41Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85118166263",,"000711230000001","J.

Using the soda-lime method, we measured in-situ soil CO2 efflux with single measurements of long exposure time (i.e. 3 day long) in 150 grasslands in three German regions in early summer 2018 and 2019. The grasslands ranged from unfertilized and grazed grasslands to intensively fertilized and frequently harvested ones. To assess effects of grazing and fertilization intensities and plant diversity on soil CO2 efflux, we used Structural Equation Modeling to account for direct effects and indirect effects through soil and plant organic matter quantity and quality. Soil CO2 efflux was suppressed by limited water availability caused by naturally occurring droughts in both study years. Under the prevailing environmental conditions, grazing intensity, plant biomass and plant C:N ratio were not related to soil CO2 efflux. In contrast, fertilization intensity was positively associated with soil CO2 efflux (standardized coefficient of net effect: + 0.04 in 2018 and + 0.03 in 2019). This was because fertilization led to lower plant species richness and, thus, to lower C:N ratios in soils, which were associated with higher soil CO2 efflux (plant species richness net effect: −0.09 in 2018 and −0.18 in 2019; soil C:N ratio direct effect: −0.23 in 2018 and −0.33 in 2019).

Measurement of manure N outputs on dairy farms is laborious, expensive, and impractical at large scales; therefore, models are needed to predict N excreted in urine and feces. Building robust prediction models requires extensive data from animals under different management systems worldwide. Thus, the study objectives were (1) to collate an international database of N excretion in feces and urine based on individual lactating dairy cow data from different continents; (2) to determine the suitability of key variables for predicting fecal, urinary, and total manure N excretion; and (3) to develop robust and reliable N excretion prediction models based on individual data from lactating dairy cows consuming various diets. A raw data set was created based on 5,483 individual cow observations, with 5,420 fecal N excretion and 3,621 urine N excretion measurements collected from 162 in vivo experiments conducted by 22 research institutes mostly located in Europe (n = 14) and North America (n = 5). A sequential approach was taken in developing models with increasing complexity by incrementally adding variables that had a significant individual effect on fecal, urinary, or total manure N excretion. Nitrogen excretion was predicted by fitting linear mixed models including experiment as a random effect. Simple models requiring dry matter intake (DMI) or N intake performed better for predicting fecal N excretion than simple models using diet nutrient composition or milk performance parameters. Simple models based on N intake performed better for urinary and total manure N excretion than those based on DMI, but simple models using milk urea N (MUN) and N intake performed even better for urinary N excretion. The full model predicting fecal N excretion had similar performance to simple models based on DMI but included several independent variables (DMI, diet crude protein content, diet neutral detergent fiber content, milk protein), depending on the location, and had root mean square prediction errors as a fraction of the observed mean values of 19.1% for intercontinental, 19.8% for European, and 17.7% for North American data sets. Complex total manure N excretion models based on N intake and MUN led to prediction errors of about 13.0% to 14.0%, which were comparable to models based on N intake alone. Intercepts and slopes of variables in optimal prediction equations developed on intercontinental, European, and North American bases differed from each other, and therefore region-specific models are preferred to predict N excretion. In conclusion, region-specific models that include information on DMI or N intake and MUN are required for good prediction of fecal, urinary, and total manure N excretion. In absence of intake data, region-specific complex equations using easily and routinely measured variables to predict fecal, urinary, or total manure N excretion may be used, but these equations have lower performance than equations based on intake.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000565250",,"0022-0302||1525-3198",,"10.3168/jds.2021-20885","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/565250","en","American Dairy Science Association","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","manure nitrogen excretion||prediction model||dairy cow","Prediction of nitrogen excretion from data on dairy cows fed a wide range of diets compiled in an intercontinental database: A meta-analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-22T09:15:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85135416165",,"000852718300006","J.

Governments and consumers have become increasingly interested in herbage-based feeding, and premium prices are often paid for these types of dairy products. However, this feeding strategy is presumed to produce more methane per unit of feed or milk than corn silage- or concentrate-based diets due to higher fiber intakes. Immature herbage is preferred to maintain dairy cow performance, but the high content of N and digestible fiber may increase methane and urine N emissions compared with more mature herbage. Tannin-containing feeds, such as vine leaves (Vitis vinifera), may help to combat the emissions associated with feeding immature herbage. Our study aimed to evaluate differences between early-stage (ES; 21 d of regrowth) versus late-stage (LS; 42 d) herbage and the effects of vine leaves on methane and nitrogenous emissions and the milk fatty acid profile of dairy cows. Twenty-four mid- to late-lactating dairy cows were randomized to 4 dietary groups (n = 6) in a factorial study design. Each of the 4 diets contained 69% fresh mixed legume-grass herbage, 13% grass hay, and 5% concentrate on a dry matter (DM) basis. Two diets were based on immature fresh mixed legume-grass herbage and grass hay (ES), and 2 contained more mature fresh mixed legume-grass herbage and grass hay (LS). Of these, 1 contained 13% vine leaves (VL+) and the other an additional 13% hay (VL−). No significant differences were observed in DM intake or milk yield across the diets. Methane emission intensity was lowest with ES-VL+ diets compared with LS-VL− diets (−30%; 17.1 vs. 24.5 mg/kg of energy-corrected milk). Methane yield decreased by 17% and 20% when related to the intake of DM and digested organic matter for ES-VL+ compared with LS-VL− diets (16.9 vs. 20.3 g/kg of DM intake; 23.5 vs. 29.3 g/kg of digestible organic matter). Immature grass and vine leaf addition each caused about half of the respective declines. Cows consuming any of the ES diets and the LS-VL+ diet consumed and excreted (urinary N) significantly more N than those consuming LS diets. However, when related to N intake, no differences were recorded. Unexpectedly, vine leaves did not mitigate urine N excretion; however, they lowered the n-6:n-3 ratio and increased concentrations of vaccenic and rumenic acids in both ES and LS diets. Our results demonstrate that feeding immature herbage in combination with vine leaves reduces methane yield; however, the associated high urinary N losses need to be addressed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000565226",,"0022-0302||1525-3198",,"10.3168/jds.2021-21458","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/565226","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Vitis vinifera||grassland||urine nitrogen||methanogenesis","Effects of early herbage cutting and vine leaves on methane emission, urine nitrogen losses, and the milk fatty acid profile of dairy cows",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-22T08:24:27Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85135290211",,"000852718300003","J.

A field study was carried out with eight diverse Chilean potato landraces and the commercial variety Desiree. Plants were subjected to drought stress for 6 weeks starting at 88 or 110 days after planting. As expected, the treatments had a strong impact on the yield and the number of tubers produced per plant (P<0.01). Surprisingly, there was no significant effect of the treatments on the content of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins or antioxidant activity (P>0.05). Resistant starch content is reported for the first time in these landraces, with values between 26 and 44% DW for raw samples and 5 and 7% DW for boiled samples in plants under well-watered conditions. Bioactive content in general was genotype-dependent and it changed significantly after boiling. Furthermore, our results suggest that bioactive content in raw samples is not necessarily a good predictor for the composition of boiled samples. This is highly relevant considering that screening of varieties with high bioactive content is often carried out in raw tubers. Our results provide valuable information regarding the effect of drought stress in tuber composition and highlight the unexplored potential of the Chilean potato gene pool in the development of varieties with higher bioactive content.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542308",,,,"10.1007/s11540-022-09547-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542308","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Anthocyanins||Biodiversity||Functional food||ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity)||Resistant starch","Effect of Drought Stress on Bioactives and Starch in Chilean Potato Landraces",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-14T02:44:32Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"IDP Bridging Plant Science and Policy","608422","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,"85127350641",,"000774593900001",,"3","Potato Research","65","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Nevertheless, estimates of global CH4 emissions from freshwater aquaculture have large uncertainties due to a lack of data from different aquaculture types. Furthermore, despite that ebullition is a major pathway of CH4 in aquatic systems, the quantification of ebullitive CH4 fluxes from typical freshwater aquaculture ponds has been poorly represented. Here, field measurements of CH4 fluxes over two years were taken to quantify ebullitive CH4 fluxes from inland freshwater fish and crab aquaculture ponds in subtropical China. Ebullitive CH4 fluxes averaged 15.97 ± 1.57 and 11.22 ± 1.26 mg m−2 d−1 in the fish and crab ponds in the first experimental year, respectively, and were 22.86 ± 2.30 and 21.95 ± 2.19 mg m−2 d−1 in the second year. During aquaculture period, ebullition dominated the emission pathways of CH4, accounting for 83% and 98% of the total CH4 emissions in the fish and crab ponds, respectively. Ebullitive CH4 fluxes exhibited considerable spatial variations, with the lowest flux rates captured at the aeration area due to aerator-use in both the fish and crab ponds. Dissolved oxygen and dissolved organic carbon were the two primary factors that drove ebullitive CH4 fluxes in both aquaculture ponds. By incorporating global measurement data, we further assessed the CH4 mitigation potential of aerator use in freshwater aquaculture and revealed the dominant role of ebullition in this mitigation contribution. Together with the rice-based aquaculture, aerator use could reduce CH4 emissions from freshwater aquaculture ponds globally by 71% and in China by 63%.",,,,"0167-8809||1873-2305",,"10.1016/j.agee.2022.108016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/549505","en","Elsevier",,,"Aeration||Aquaculture||Ebullition||Methane||Mitigation potential","Ebullitive CH4 flux and its mitigation potential by aeration in freshwater aquaculture: Measurements and global data synthesis",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-05-30T03:50:30Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85130329673",,"000805414100003","Agric. ecosyst. environ.",,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","335","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To slow and reduce the degradation of these soils, which increases with drainage, the use of plant-based amendments (straw, wood chips, and biochar) has been proposed. Literature on the effects of such amendments in cultivated peatlands is scarce, and questions have been raised regarding the impact of this practice on nutrient cycling, particularly nitrogen (N) dynamics. By means of a six-month incubation experiment, this study assessed the effects of four plant-based amendments (biochar, a forest mix, willow, and miscanthus) on the release kinetics of water-soluble N pools (mineral and organic) in two histosols of differing degrees of decomposition (Haplosaprist and Haplohemist). The amendment rate was set at 15 Mg ha^(−1) on a dry weight basis. The N release kinetics were significantly impacted by soil type and amendment. Miscanthus and willow were the amendments that most reduced the release of soluble organic N (SON) and mineral N (minN). The addition of plant-based amendments reduced the total amount of released N pools during the incubation (cumulative N pools) by 50.3 to 355.2 mg kg^(−1), depending on the soil type, the N pool, and the type of amendment. A significant relationship was found between microbial biomass N, urease activity, and the cumulative N at the end of the incubation. The results showed that the input of plant-based amendments in cultivated peatland decreases N release, which could have a beneficial impact by decreasing N leaching; however, it could also restrict crop growth. Further research is needed to fully assess the impact of such amendments used in cultivated peatlands on N and on C fluxes at the soil–plant and soil–atmosphere interfaces to determine if they constitute a long-term solution for more sustainable agriculture.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591148",,,,"10.3390/nitrogen3030028","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591148","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","cultivated peatland||long-term incubation||mineralization kinetics||miscanthus||willow||biochar||microbial biomass||mineral N||soluble organic N","Impact of Plant-Based Amendments on Water-Soluble Nitrogen Release Dynamics in Cultivated Peatlands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-10T08:13:52Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Nitrogen","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Furthermore, tomato production represents one of the main sources of income for these farmers, which leaves them highly exposed to market price variations. However, the full impact of changing climate and price variations for these farmers has not been assessed. Here, we examined how Ghanaian tomato farmers experience and respond to a double exposure from climate and market related shocks. The objectives were threefold: (i) to investigate how farmers in two different agroecological zones (savannah and semi-equatorial) experience climate and market shocks, (ii) to examine the major response strategies implemented in face of this double exposure, and (iii) to identify paths toward systemic changes to enhance resilience. A survey was conducted with 344 tomato smallholder farmers in the two agroecological zones. The results from the survey were complemented by semi-structured interviews and focus groups. We found that farmers are severely exposed to climate and market shocks, which causes a reduction in both production activities and revenues. A set of agricultural and water management practices, such as crop rotation, supplementary fertilization, and water tanks, have been adopted by farmers as response mechanisms to climate variations. However, no response mechanisms, other than agricultural diversification, are in place yet to face the economic shocks. Thus, enhancing systemic resilience becomes particularly important to face this double exposure and restructure and change feedback mechanisms within the current system. The reestablishment of tomato processing plants or formalizing the stakeholders’ network could both be ways to integrate value-chain stakeholders and support appropriate structures. Encompassing both climate and trading attributes through specific agro-food policies are much-needed for a sustainable and resilient transformation of the tomato production system.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000575949",,"1708-3087",,"10.5751/es-13310-270326","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575949","en","Resilience Alliance","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate change||Ghana||market||resilience||social-ecological system||tomato||transformation","Addressing the resilience of tomato farmers in Ghana facing a double exposure from climate and market",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-14T06:22:16Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000915510600006",,"3","Ecology and Society","27","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Evaluation of restoration activities is indispensable to assess the extent to which targets have been reached. Usually, the main goal of ecological restoration is to restore biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but validation is often based on a single indicator, which may or may not cope with whole-ecosystem dynamics. Network analyses are, however, powerful tools, allowing to examine both the recovery of various biotic and abiotic properties and the integrated response at community and ecosystem level.  2. We used restoration sites where topsoil was removed from former intensively managed grassland and seeds were added. These sites were between 3 and 32 years old. We assessed how plants, soil biota, soil properties and correlation-based interactions between biotic communities and their abiotic environment developed over time and compared the results with (i) intensively managed (not restored), and (ii) well-preserved targeted semi-natural grasslands.  3. Plant, nematode, fungal and prokaryotic diversity and community structures of the restored grasslands revealed clear successional patterns and followed similar trajectories towards targeted semi-natural grasslands. All biotic communities reached targeted diversity levels no later than 18 years post-restoration.  4.  Ecological networks of intensively managed and short-term (~4 years) restored grasslands were less tightly connected compared to those found in mid- and long-term (~18–30 years) restored and target grasslands. Restoration specifically enhanced interactions among biotic communities, but reduced interactions between biotic communities and their abiotic environment as well as interactions among abiotic properties in the short- and mid-term.  5. Synthesis and applications: Overall, our study demonstrated that topsoil removal and seed addition were successful in restoring diverse, tightly coupled and well-connected biotic communities above- and below-ground similar to those found in the semi-natural grasslands that were restoration targets. Network analyses proved to be powerful in examining the long-term re-establishment of functionally connected biotic communities in restored ecosystems. Thus, we provide an approach to holistically assess restoration activities by notably considering the complexity of ecosystems, much in contrast to most traditional approaches.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000535986",,"0021-8901||1365-2664",,"10.1111/1365-2664.14145","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/535986","en","Wiley-Blackwell","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Ecological networks||Grassland restoration||High-intensity restoration method||Long-term recovery||Restoration success||Semi-natural grasslands||Soil diversity","Long‐term recovery of above‐ and below‐ground interactions in restored grasslands after topsoil removal and seed addition",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-08T08:14:44Z","2023-02-26",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85125583201",,"000764976200001","J.

Using a novel application of meta-analysis to data from 30 long-term experiments from Europe and Africa (comprising 25,565 yield records), we investigated how field-scale EI practices interact with each other, and with N fertilizer and tillage, in their effects on long-term crop yields. Here we confirmed that EI practices (specifically, increasing crop diversity and adding fertility crops and organic matter) have generally positive effects on the yield of staple crops. However, we show that EI practices have a largely substitutive interaction with N fertilizer, so that EI practices substantially increase yield at low N fertilizer doses but have minimal or no effect on yield at high N fertilizer doses. EI practices had comparable effects across different tillage intensities, and reducing tillage did not strongly affect yields.",,,,"2398-9629",,"10.1038/s41893-022-00911-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/556481","en","Springer",,,,"Long-term evidence for ecological intensification as a pathway to sustainable agriculture",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-07-06T08:52:28Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85132880243",,"000817066600003","Nat Sustain","9","Nature Sustainability","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To assess the effects of land-use intensity, operational and sensitive ecological indicators that integrate effects of grassland management on ecosystem processes such as organic matter turnover are needed.  Here, we investigated the suitability of measuring the mass loss of standardized tea litter together with extracellular enzyme kinetics as a proxy of litter decomposition in the topsoil of grasslands along a well-defined land-use intensity gradient (fertilization, mowing, grazing) in Central Germany. Tea bags containing either green tea (high-quality litter) or rooibos tea (low-quality litter) were buried in 5 cm soil depth. Litter mass loss was measured after three (early-stage decomposition) and 12 months (mid-stage decomposition). Based on the fluorescence measurement of the reaction product 4-methylumbelliferone, Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics (Vmax: potential maximum rate of activity; Km: substrate affinity) of five hydrolases involved in the carbon (C)-, nitrogen (N)- and phosphorus (P)-cycle (β-glucosidase (BG), cellobiohydrolase (CBH), cellotriohydrolase (CTH), 1,4-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), and phosphatase (PH)) were determined in tea litter bags and in the surrounding soil.  The land-use intensity index (LUI), summarizing fertilization, mowing, grazing, and in particular the frequency of mowing were identified as important drivers of early-stage tea litter decomposition. Mid-stage decomposition was influenced by grazing intensity. The higher the potential activity of all measured C-, N- and P-targeting enzymes, the higher was the decomposition of both tea litters in the early-phase. During mid-stage decomposition, individual enzyme parameters (Vmax of CTH and PH, Km of CBH) became more important.  The tea bag method proved to be a suitable indicator which allows an easy and cost-effective assessment of land-use intensity effects on decay processes in manged grasslands. In combination with enzyme kinetics it is an appealing approach to identify mechanisms driving litter break down.",,,,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155748","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/546310","en","Elsevier",,,"Cellotriohydrolase||Cellobiohydrolase||β-Glucosidase||Phosphatase||N-acetylglucosaminidase||Tea bag index","Enzyme kinetics inform about mechanistic changes in tea litter decomposition across gradients in land-use intensity in Central German grasslands",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-05-10T09:41:01Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85129924352",,"000833001100014","Sci.

As permafrost thaws in a warming world, more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and greenhouse gases are produced and move from soils to surface waters where the DOC can be oxidized to CO2 and also released to the atmosphere. Our main study objective is to measure the release of carbon to the atmosphere via effluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from Toolik Lake, a deep, dimictic, low-arctic lake in northern Alaska. By combining direct eddy covariance flux measurements with continuous gas pressure measurements in the lake surface waters, we quantified the k600 piston velocity that controls gas flux across the air–water interface. Our measured k values for CH4 and CO2 were substantially above predictions from several models at low to moderate wind speeds, and only converged on model predictions at the highest wind speeds. We attribute this higher flux at low wind speeds to effects on water-side turbulence resulting from how the surrounding tundra vegetation and topography increase atmospheric turbulence considerably in this lake, above the level observed over large ocean surfaces. We combine this process-level understanding of gas exchange with the trends of a climate-relevant long-term (30 + years) meteorological data set at Toolik Lake to examine short-term variations (2015 ice-free season) and interannual variability (2010–2015 ice-free seasons) of CH4 and CO2 fluxes. We argue that the biological processing of DOC substrate that becomes available for decomposition as the tundra soil warms is important for understanding future trends in aquatic gas fluxes, whereas the variability and long-term trends of the physical and meteorological variables primarily affect the timing of when higher or lower than average fluxes are observed. We see no evidence suggesting that a tipping point will be reached soon to change the status of the aquatic system from gas source to sink. We estimate that changes in CH4 and CO2 fluxes will be constrained with a range of +30% and −10% of their current values over the next 30 years.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000571096",,"2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2022.948529","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/571096","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Toolik Lake||long-term ecological research||LTER||methane flux||carbon dioxide flux||piston velocity||arctic trends||quantile regression","Effects of long-term climate trends on the methane and CO2 exchange processes of Toolik Lake, Alaska",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-16T12:26:09Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85138964168",,"000861958900001","Front.

In contrast to traditionally bred apple cultivars, genetically modified (GM) plants need to undergo a regulatory risk assessment considering unintended effects before approval for commercial release. To determine potential unintended effects of C44.4.146, we assessed major leaf components and effects on the fitness of the decomposers Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and Folsomia candida (collembolan), which were fed a diet amended with powdered apple leaf material. Leaf material of 'Gala Galaxy', several natural 'Gala' mutants, and the unrelated apple cultivar 'Ladina' were used for comparison. The genetic modification did not alter major leaf components and did not adversely affect survival, growth, or fecundity of the two decomposers. Consistent with previous studies with other GM crops, the differences between conventionally bred cultivars were greater than between the GM line and its non-GM wild type.

Seed dressings using synthetic fungicides were shown effective to reduce infection levels, but their negative environmental impact and exclusion from organic production calls for more sustainable solutions. In this study, a total of eleven different alternative seed treatments were tested in field trials in Switzerland between 2018 and 2021. Treatment types consisted of: hot water, steam, electron, long-term storage, elevated partial pressure of oxygen (EPPO), vinegar, plant extracts and biological control agents (BCAs). The BCAs were tested for potential antagonistic activity against C. lupini during white lupin infection under controlled conditions prior to field trials. Long-term storage and vinegar treatments successfully reduced disease incidence and increased yield to levels similar to those observed for certified seeds, without significantly affecting germination rate. Although promising, effectiveness of these treatments needs further validation. Four BCAs showed significant disease reductions under controlled conditions. Besides lowering disease severity, two BCAs also reduced C. lupini DNA in stem tissue. These reductions, however, were not observed in the field, highlighting the importance of field validations. The treatments identified in this study provide a solid basis for the development of sustainable and effective seed protection strategies in white lupin to control C. lupini successfully.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000544666",,"0261-2194||1873-6904",,"10.1016/j.cropro.2022.106009","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/544666","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biological control||Seed dressing||Colletotrichum lupini||Lupinus albus||Long-term storage||Vinegar","The potential of alternative seed treatments to control anthracnose disease in white lupin",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-02T09:41:45Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85129247018",,"000804365500007","Crop prot.",,"Crop Protection","158","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In addition, grass silage replacing maize silage can contribute to dietary crude protein (CP) supply as well and complies with the natural diet of ruminants. An experiment with 30 Limousin-sired beef bulls was performed with diets in which SBM was replaced by alternative protein sources when feeding a diet composed of, per kg dry matter (DM), 500 g grass silage, 300 g maize silage and 200 g concentrate. In the concentrate, SBM (control diet) was replaced by faba beans, pumpkin seed cake, or spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) to result on average in 226 g CP/kg concentrate dry matter (DM). A fifth group served as negative control, which received a grain-based concentrate with only 135 g CP/kg DM. Bulls were fed the experimental diets for the entire fattening period starting from an initial body weight (BW) of 164 ± 2.3 kg and 4.3 ± 0.06 months of age. At an average body weight (BW) of 275 ± 5.6 kg and 7.4 ± 0.17 months of age, each animal underwent a 9-day sampling period to determine individual N and energy intake and excretion (7 days of urine and faeces collection) as well as methane emission (2 days in respiration chambers). The diet had no effect on DM and nutrient intake. Apparent fibre digestibility was significantly affected by diet, being numerically lowest with faba beans instead of SBM. Compared to the other groups, the bulls fed no additional protein had the lowest urinary N excretion (25.1 vs. 40.3 g/bull/day; 366 vs. 460 g/kg total faecal and urinary N). Digestive and metabolic energy utilisation were comparable among diets. Methane (CH4) production adjusted to body weight differed significantly among groups, being numerically highest in bulls fed faba beans (547 vs. 513 mg CH4/kg BW/day in the other diets). These results show that none of the tested protein sources, including SBM, was of benefit when feeding a diet containing 500 g/kg DM grass silage complemented with maize silage and concentrate. Feeding such a diet seems to provide an adequate supply with metabolisable protein. Omitting the common protein supplementation therefore mitigated urinary N losses and thus likely N emissions from the manure at unchanged N and energy utilisation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000556721",,"0377-8401||1873-2216",,"10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.115362","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/556721","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Spirulina||Faba beans||Pumpkin seed cake||Soybean||Grass silage||Urinary nitrogen","Methane emission, nitrogen and energy utilisation of beef cattle when replacing or omitting soybean meal in a forage-based diet",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-07T08:39:16Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85133751558",,"000827320200002","Anim.

Here, we investigate the metabolic implications of a major urinary protein knockout in twelve-week-old male and female C57BL/6N mice during ad libitum feeding. Despite both sexes of major urinary protein knockout mice displayed numerically increased body weight and visceral adipose tissue proportions compared to sex-matched wildtype mice, the main genotype-specific metabolic differences were observed exclusively in males. Male major urinary protein knockout mice exhibited plasma and hepatic lipid accumulation accompanied by a hepatic transcriptome indicating an activation of lipogenesis. These findings match the higher major urinary protein expression in male compared to female wildtype mice, suggesting a more distinct reduction in energy requirements in male compared to female major urinary protein knockout mice. The observed sex-specific anabolic phenotype confirms a role of major urinary protein in metabolism and, since major urinary proteins are not expressed in humans, suggests the major urinary protein knockout mouse as a potential alternative model for translational metabolism research which needs to be further elucidated.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000563076",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-022-17195-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563076","en","Macmillan Publishers","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The major urinary protein gene cluster knockout mouse as a novel model for translational metabolism research",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-11T03:58:21Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85135302952",,"000834992200016","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The mean effective global emission factor for N2O was 4.3 ± 0.3% in 2020 (weighted by N inputs), much higher than the surface area-weighted mean (1.1 ± 0.1%). Climate change and spatial redistribution of fertilisation N inputs have driven an increase in global emission factor over the past century, which accounts for 18% of the anthropogenic soil flux in 2020.

However, emerging sanitation technologies afford a hygienically safe and ecologically sustainable solution to this development challenge by providing fertilizers derived from human excreta that could facilitate a socio-technical transition toward a more sustainable food system. To evaluate one such technology, nitrified urine fertilizer (NUF), we conducted participatory action research to assess the potential, from both a biophysical and social perspective, of NUF to serve as a soil fertilizer to support smallholder agricultural production in Swayimane, South Africa. To achieve this objective, we formed a stakeholder group comprised of a cooperative of smallholder farmers, a local NGO (Zimele), and researchers from ETH Zurich and the University of Kwazulu-Natal. Over the course of two growing seasons (2016 and 2017) this stakeholder group assessed the potential of NUF to support smallholder vegetable production (i.e., cabbage). First, we adopted a randomized complete block design incorporating five treatments in season 1 (unfertilized control, nitrified urine, nitrified urine+bone meal, urea, and urea+diammonium phosphate (DAP) and six treatments (unfertilized control, urea, urea+DAP, DAP, nitrified urine, and nitrified urine+DAP) in season 2 to assess cabbage yield and leaf nutrient concentration (sodium, phosphorus, potassium, carbon, nitrogen). Although we observed large variability in yields, the urine-based treatments were as effective as any of the chemical fertilizers. Second, beyond the biophysical analysis, we elicited the challenges and opportunities of the smallholder farmers in our stakeholder group, as well as their attitudes toward the use of NUF as a fertilizer. Through this qualitative work, farmers indicated that their attitudes about the use of NUF as a fertilizer improved and that they would be willing to incorporate this product into their production practices if it was available at scale. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of participatory action research to co-produce knowledge and awareness around an innovative technology. In so doing, we provide evidence that this approach can support a change toward nutrient recycling-based agriculture.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000564597",,"2571-581X",,"10.3389/fsufs.2022.781879","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/564597","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","nitrified urine fertilizer||sustainable agriculture||South Africa||smallholder farming||nutrient recycling","A participatory assessment of nitrified urine fertilizer use in Swayimane, South Africa: Crop production potential, farmer attitudes and smallholder challenges",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-18T03:05:18Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85136830748",,"000837091600001","Front.

Plant genetic diversity (PGD; i.e., within-species diversity) is related to many beneficial effects on the ecosystem functioning of grasslands. The monitoring of PGD in temperate grasslands is complicated by the multiplicity of species present and by a shortage of methods for large-scale assessments. However, the continuous advancement of high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches has improved the prospects of broad, multispecies PGD monitoring. Among them, amplicon sequencing stands out as a robust and cost-effective method. Here, we report a set of 12 multispecies primer pairs that can be used for high-throughput PGD assessments in multiple grassland plant species. The target loci were selected and tested in two phases: a ""discovery phase"" based on a sequence capture assay (611 nuclear loci assessed in 16 grassland plant species), which resulted in the selection of 11 loci; and a ""validation phase"", in which the selected loci were targeted and sequenced using multispecies primers in test populations of Dactylis glomerata L., Lolium perenne L., Festuca pratensis Huds., Trifolium pratense L. and T. repens L. The multispecies amplicons had nucleotide diversities per species from 5.19 x 10(-3) to 1.29 x 10(-2), which is in the range of flowering-related genes but slightly lower than pathogen resistance genes. We conclude that the methodology, the DNA sequence resources, and the primer pairs reported in this study provide the basis for large-scale, multispecies PGD monitoring in grassland plants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000524399",,"1755-098X||1471-8278||1755-0998||1471-8286",,"10.1111/1755-0998.13577","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524399","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","amplicon sequencing||genetic diversity||grasses||grassland||legumes||sequence capture","A multispecies amplicon sequencing approach for genetic diversity assessments in grassland plant species",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-11T04:35:14Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85122284558",,"000738807400001","Mol.

The appropriate quantification of GHG emissions, specifically methane (CH4), has raised questions about the correct reporting of GHG inventories and, perhaps more importantly, how best to mitigate CH4 emissions. This review documents existing methods and methodologies to measure and estimate CH4 emissions from ruminant animals and the manure produced therein over various scales and conditions. Measurements of CH4 have frequently been conducted in research settings using classical methodologies developed for bioenergetic purposes, such as gas exchange techniques (respiration chambers, headboxes). While very precise, these techniques are limited to research settings as they are expensive, labor-intensive, and applicable only to a few animals. Head-stalls, such as the GreenFeed system, have been used to measure expired CH4 for individual animals housed alone or in groups in confinement or grazing. This technique requires frequent animal visitation over the diurnal measurement period and an adequate number of collection days. The tracer gas technique can be used to measure CH4 from individual animals housed outdoors, as there is a need to ensure low background concentrations. Micrometeorological techniques (e.g., open-path lasers) can measure CH4 emissions over larger areas and many animals, but limitations exist, including the need to measure over more extended periods. Measurement of CH4 emissions from manure depends on the type of storage, animal housing, CH4 concentration inside and outside the boundaries of the area of interest, and ventilation rate, which is likely the variable that contributes the greatest to measurement uncertainty. For large-scale areas, aircraft, drones, and satellites have been used in association with the tracer flux method, inverse modeling, imagery, and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), but research is lagging in validating these methods. Bottom-up approaches to estimating CH4 emissions rely on empirical or mechanistic modeling to quantify the contribution of individual sources (enteric and manure). In contrast, top-down approaches estimate the amount of CH4 in the atmosphere using spatial and temporal models to account for transportation from an emitter to an observation point. While these two estimation approaches rarely agree, they help identify knowledge gaps and research requirements in practice.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000558175",,"1525-3163||0021-8812",,"10.1093/jas/skac197","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/558175","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","estimates||greenhouse gas||livestock||measurements||quantification||sustainability","Quantification of methane emitted by ruminants: a review of methods",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-15T04:10:43Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85134360529",,"000821625800009","J.

Partitioning ecosystem T is however challenging, and even more so when it comes to short-statured crops, where many standard methods lead to inaccurate measurements. In this study, we combined biometeorological measurements with a Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Crop (SPA-Crop) model to estimate T and E at a Swiss cropland over two crop seasons with winter cereals. We compared our results with two data-driven approaches: The Transpiration Estimation Algorithm (TEA) and the underlying Water Use Efficiency (uWUE). Despite large differences in the productivity of both years, the T to evapotranspiration (ET) ratio had relatively similar seasonal and diurnal dynamics, and averaged to 0.72 and 0.73. Our measurements combined with a SPA-Crop model provided T estimates similar to the TEA method, while the uWUE method produced systematically lower T even when the soil and leaves were dry. T was strongly related to the leaf area index, but additionally varied due to climatic conditions. The most important climatic drivers controlling T were found to be the photosynthetic photon flux density (R-2 = 0.84 and 0.87), and vapor pressure deficit (R-2 = 0.86 and 0.70). Our results suggest that site-specific studies can help establish T/ET ratios, as well as identify dominant climatic drivers, which could then be used to partition T from reliable ET measurements. Moreover, our results suggest that the TEA method is a suitable tool for ET partitioning in short-statured croplands.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000559721",,"0148-0227||2169-8953||2169-8961",,"10.1029/2021JG006760","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/559721","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Insights for the Partitioning of Ecosystem Evaporation and Transpiration in Short-Statured Croplands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-25T04:09:07Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Reconciling innovative farming practices and networks to enable sustainable development of smart Swiss farming systems","172433","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 73: Gesuch",,,"85135026267",,"000827443400001","J. geophys. res.

However, the relative importance of these direct and indirect processes for the leaching of multiple nutrients is poorly studied. We measured the annual leaching of nitrate, ammonium, phosphate and sulphate at a depth of 10 cm in 150 temperate managed grasslands using a resin method. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we distinguished between various direct and indirect effects of management intensity (i.e. grazing and fertilization) on nutrient leaching. We found that management intensity was positively associated with nitrate, ammonium and phosphate leaching risk both directly (i.e. via increased nutrient inputs) and indirectly, by changing the stoichiometry of soils, plants and microbes. In contrast, sulphate leaching risk was negatively associated with management intensity, presumably due to increased outputs with mowing and grazing. In addition, management intensification shifted plant communities towards an exploitative functional composition (characterized by high tissue turnover rates) and, thus, further promoted the leaching risk of inorganic nitrogen. Plant species richness was associated with lower inorganic nitrogen leaching risk, but most of its effects were mediated by stoichiometry and plant community functional traits. Maintaining and restoring diverse plant communities may therefore mitigate the increased leaching risk that management intensity imposes upon grasslands.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000550161",,"1385-1314||1573-0867",,"10.1007/s10705-022-10209-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/550161","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Annual nutrient leaching||Inorganic nitrogen||Phosphate||Sulphate||Temperate grasslands||Grassland management","Direct and plant community mediated effects of management intensity on annual nutrient leaching risk in temperate grasslands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-01T12:11:49Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85131041459",,"000803773600001","Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst","3","Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems","123","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Mobilization of Cd has been identified through spatiotemporal monitoring in intertidal sediments during the last decades, but no information was yet available as to what extent these biogeochemical dynamics change the Cd isotopic composition. Cores of an Aquic Udifluvent soil from an intertidal mudflat of the Elbe River, Germany, were sub-sampled at 2 cm intervals to a depth of 40 cm corresponding to a sedimentation of about 10 years. Strong redox zonation was found in the cores, with an upper suboxic zone and a lower anoxic zone of significantly different Cd isotopy. Cadmium partitioning and pore water data determined in 1985 and 1988 using a sequential extraction procedure were reassessed to explain the variations in the δ114Cd values determined in this study. The redox conditions in the mudflat soil were found to change from suboxic (Eh 300 mV) to anoxic (Eh –100 mV) at 20 cm. This was caused by semi-diurnal flooding with oxygenated river water (tidal pumping). The δ114Cd values varied systematically with depth and were correlated with the redox profile. The intense tidal water flow caused lighter Cd isotopes to desorb more readily from the parent soil in the upper suboxic zone and to subsequently redepositing in the deeper anoxic (sulfidic) zone, where the lighter Cd mobilized from Fe/Mn oxyhydroxides was found to be scavenged in sulfidic form. Tidal advection of dissolved lighter Cd down to the anoxic zone and sulfidic reprecipitation led to a decrease in δ114Cd value of up to -0.2‰ with signals of ±0.1‰ even on a seasonal timescale. It became clear that apportioning sources using Cd isotopes would be difficult given the sensitivity of the isotope record to such early-diagenetic isotope fractionation reactions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000533368",,"2666-7657",,"10.1016/j.envadv.2022.100182","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/533368","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Mudflat||Biogeochemistry||Cd contamination||Cd mobilization||Metal isotopes","Cadmium isotope fractionation in an intertidal soil induced by tidal pumping",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-02-19T05:53:15Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85124220919",,,,,"Environmental Advances","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Due to the popularity of cassava-maize intercropping and the food security and economic importance of both crops in Nigeria, we investigated options to improve interception of photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), soil moisture retention, and yields of cassava and maize in cassava-maize intercropping systems in 8 on-farm researcher-managed multi-location trials between 2017 and 2019 in different agro-ecologies of southern Nigeria. Treatments were a combination of (1) maize planting density (low density at 20,000 maize plants ha-1 versus high density at 40,000 maize plants ha-1, intercropped with 12,500 cassava plants ha-1); (2) fertilizer application and management targeting either the maize crop (90 kg N, 20 kg P and 37 kg K ha-1) or the cassava crop (75 kg N, 20 kg P and 90 kg K ha-1), compared with control without fertilizer application. Cassava and maize development parameters were highest in the maize fertilizer regime, resulting in the highest IPAR at high maize density. The combined intercrop biomass yield was highest at high maize density in the maize fertilizer regime. Without fertilizer application, RUE was highest at low maize density. However, the application of the maize fertilizer regime at high maize density resulted in the highest RUE, soil moisture content, and maize grain yield. Cassava storage root yield was higher in the cassava fertilizer regime than in the maize fertilizer regime. We conclude that improved IPAR, RUE, soil moisture retention, and grain yield on nutrient-limited soils of southern Nigeria, or in similar environments, can be achieved by intercropping 40,000 maize plants ha-1 with 12,500 cassava plants ha-1 and managing the system with the maize fertilizer regime. However, for higher cassava storage root yield, the system should be managed with the cassava fertilizer regime.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000547544",,"0378-4290||1872-6852",,"10.1016/j.fcr.2022.108550","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/547544","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cassava-maize intercropping||Planting density||Fertilizer management||Photosynthetically active radiation||Soil moisture||Radiation use efficiency","Cassava-maize intercropping systems in southern Nigeria: Radiation use efficiency, soil moisture dynamics, and yields of component crops",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-17T02:57:44Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85129583523",,"000803737000008","Field crops res.",,"Field Crops Research","283","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, significant limitations have remained in our knowledge of the controls and rates of this process, due to technical difficulties in directly quantifying nitrogen (N2) fixation rates. To address this, we developed a novel compound-specific 15N-stable isotope probing method involving analysis of acid hydrolysable soil amino acids (AAs) by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) for the quantification of BNF in soils. By analysing 15N-enriched AAs (as N-acetyl, O-isopropyl derivatives), this new approach aimed to provide greater specificity compared to existing methods, and to contribute previously unobtainable quantitative information on the capture and flow of N2 fixed in soils. Laboratory incubations using 15N2 gas were carried out on surface peat over 15 days to obtain quantitative measures of N2 fixation by the microbial community. Longer incubations with the addition of a glucose energy source significantly increased the level of 15N enrichment, i.e. N fixed. The enhanced detection limits of 15N-AAs by GC-C-IRMS, compared to bulk soil δ15N value determinations, was key to assessments of N2 fixation. Valuable insights into the assimilation pathway of the applied 15N2-substrate were revealed; for peat soils, 15N incorporation into glutamate dominated over other AAs.",,,,"0038-0717||1879-3428",,"10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108654","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551531","en","Elsevier",,,,"Compound-specific amino acid ¹⁵N-stable isotope probing for the quantification of biological nitrogen fixation in soils",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-06-09T06:10:51Z",,,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Soil biol. biochem.",,"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","169","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Over recent decades, the permanent grassland area has declined and land use change continues to threaten its extent. Simultaneously, the management intensity of permanent grasslands increased. We performed a systematic literature review on the multifunctionality of permanent grasslands in Europe, examining the effects of land use and management on 19 grassland ecosystem service indicators. Based on the evidence in 696 out of 70,456 screened papers, published since 1980, we found that both land use change and intensification of management decreased multifunctionality. In particular, preventing conversion of permanent grasslands to croplands secured the delivery of multiple ecosystem services. A lower management intensity was associated with benefits for biodiversity, climate regulation and water purification, but impacted the provision of high-quality animal feed. Increasing the number of species in the sward enhanced multifunctionality of permanent grassland without significant trade-offs such as losses in production. Our review covered many aspects of land use, management and ecosystem services, but we also identified areas with no or only few studies. The most prominent gaps were related to comparisons between permanent and temporary grasslands, and effects of management practices on the provision of cultural values, and on erosion and flood control. We suggest that, despite apparent changes in human dietary preferences, the protection of permanent grasslands in Europe must be prioritised. At the same time, considering the need to reduce ruminant livestock’s contribution to climate change, the time seems ripe to increase support for low-intensity grassland management to optimise the provision of essential ecosystem services from Europe’s permanent grasslands.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000532357",,"0167-8809||1873-2305",,"10.1016/j.agee.2022.107891","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/532357","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Agro-ecology||Ecosystem services||Grassland||Land use change||Systematic Literature review","Permanent grasslands in Europe: Land use change and intensification decrease their multifunctionality",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-02-14T08:22:15Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85124415782",,"000790163200006","Agric. ecosyst. environ.",,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","330","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Agricultural interventions can help boost food security for poor rural communities but in certain cases can exacerbate deforestation, known as the rebound effect. We tested whether coupling agricultural interventions with participatory forest zoning could improve food security and promote forest conservation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Simple agricultural interventions led to a >60% increase in cassava yields and a spill-over effect of improved cassava variety uptake in non-intervention zones. Household surveys conducted at the end of the 8 year project implementation period revealed that households that received agricultural interventions had more favorable attitudes toward forest zoning and conservation. The surveys also showed that farmers in the intervention domain practiced less land-intensive field and fallow management strategies compared to those practiced in the non-intervention domain. However, an 18 year time series analysis of Landsat satellite data revealed that agricultural expansion persisted in areas both with and without intervention assistance, and there is risk of a rebound effect. Approximately 70% of the tree cover loss that occurred outside of the agricultural areas was located within a 3 km buffer zone surrounding the outermost edges of the agricultural areas, which suggested that the majority of tree cover loss was caused by agricultural expansion. Within that 3 km buffer, average annual tree cover loss during the post-intervention period was higher in the intervention domain compared to the non-intervention domain (0.17% yr(-1) compared to 0.11% yr(-1) respectively, p < 0.001), suggesting risk of a rebound effect. The disconnection between household perceptions of zoning adherence and actual behavior indicates the importance of strengthening governance structures for community-based monitoring and enforcement.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000549145",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ac6ad8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/549145","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","sustainable development||agricultural intervention||forest conservation||remote sensing||forest monitoring||Africa||Democratic Republic of Congo","Coupled forest zoning and agricultural intervention yields conflicting outcomes for tropical forest conservation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-26T03:56:05Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000794970100001","Environ.

Predictions based on proxies for CH4 are a viable alternative. Most prediction models are based on multiple linear regressions (MLR) and predictor variables that are not routinely available in commercial farms, such as dry matter intake (DMI) and diet composition. The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict CH4 emissions from across-country heterogeneous data sets has not been reported. The objectives were to compare performances of ML ensemble algorithm random forest (RF) and MLR models in predicting CH4 emissions from proxies in dairy cows, and assess effects of imputing missing data points on prediction accuracy. Data on CH4 emissions and proxies for CH4 from 20 herds were provided by 10 countries. The integrated data set contained 43,519 records from 3,483 cows, with 18.7% missing data points imputed using k-nearest neighbor imputation. Three data sets were created, 3k (no missing records), 21k (missing DMI imputed from milk, fat, protein, body weight), and 41k (missing DMI, milk fat, and protein records imputed). These data sets were used to test scenarios (with or without DMI, imputed vs. nonimputed DMI, milk fat, and protein), and prediction models (RF vs. MLR). Model predictive ability was evaluated within and between herds through 10-fold cross-validation. Prediction accuracy was measured as correlation between observed and predicted CH4, root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). Inclusion of DMI in the model improved within and between-herd prediction accuracy to 0.77 (RMSE = 23.3%) and 0.58 (RMSE = 31.9%) in RF and to 0.50 (RMSE = 0.327) and 0.13 (RMSE = 42.71) in MLR, respectively than when DMI was not included in the predictive model. When missing DMI records were imputed, within and between-herd accuracy increased to 0.84 (RMSE = 18.5%) and 0.63 (RMSE = 29.9%), respectively. In all scenarios, RF models out-performed MLR models. Results suggest routinely measured variables from dairy farms can be used in developing globally robust prediction models for CH4 if coupled with state-of-the-art techniques for imputation and advanced ML algorithms for predictive modeling.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000548437",,"0022-0302||1525-3198",,"10.3168/jds.2021-20158","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/548437","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","enteric methane||machine learning||prediction models||proxies for methane","Integrating heterogeneous across-country data for proxy-based random forest prediction of enteric methane in dairy cattle",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-21T03:03:12Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85127311953",,"000848037000013","J.

The production of biomass via photosynthesis is dependent on the plant response to environmental variables such as temperature, vapour pressure deficit and light intensity. Short-term responses of plant growth to these variables at fine temporal scales of hours are not well investigated, especially under field conditions. The present study explores the relationship between leaf elongation rate (LER) of young wheat leaves in the field in very high temporal resolution (minutes). Turbulent fluxes of CO2 were measured with the eddy covariance technique and used to derive GPP, and environmental variables such as air and soil temperature, short wave radiation and vapour pressure deficit were simultaneously measured.  The analysis revealed the importance of different variables on different temporal scales (hourly, daily). On an hourly scale, GPP and shortwave radiation explain most of the variance of LER, however on a daily scale, air temperature is the main driver. A cross-correlation analysis confirmed that the strongest immediate relationship can be found between LER and GPP and incoming shortwave radiation; variables that are determining photosynthesis. In principal, LER also shows the same diurnal patterns as air temperature and soil temperature, however air and soil temperature lag behind LER. Multivariate growth models show that combinations with GPP or incoming shortwave radiation and air temperature perform best. These results indicate that short term growth processes in young wheat leaves in the field are mainly controlled by incoming shortwave radiation, while the magnitude of growth is controlled by temperature.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000544780",,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.108902","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/544780","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Leaf elongation||Wheat||Cropland||Eddy covariance||Photosynthesis","Relationship of leaf elongation rate of young wheat leaves, gross primary productivity and environmental variables in the field with hourly and daily temporal resolution",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-03T07:18:02Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Reconciling innovative farming practices and networks to enable sustainable development of smart Swiss farming systems","172433","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 73: Gesuch",,,"85129255566",,"000795847100004","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","320","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We compared the dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition of both rivers using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to investigate seasonal and regional differences in DOM composition exported to the ocean. We found that over a 15-month observational period in the Congo River, molecular aromaticity and oxygenation between the wet and dry periods varied slightly, but most of the relative abundance of DOM formulae (∼90%) were present in all samples, suggesting that Congo River DOM quality is stable across different hydrological conditions. In contrast, the multi-year DOM composition in the Amazon River was highly susceptible to changes in hydrology, with clear differences in molecular aromaticity, oxygenation, and heteroatom (N, S, P) content between the wet and dry seasons. Overall, the DOM composition of the Congo River was more terrestrial than Amazon River DOM, which was more characteristic of aquatic DOM. Finally, we compared the relative contribution of island of stability (IOS) formulae between the rivers and found that both rivers export similar amounts of these formulae annually, more than several major rivers combined, and that the Congo is more than twice as efficient in exporting these IOS formulae. With changing precipitation and land use, the quantity and composition of exported DOM will likely reflect the mobilization of additional terrestrial and anthropogenic sources that will also be subjected to downstream land-to-ocean cycling.",,,,"0886-6236||1944-9224",,"10.1029/2022GB007301","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/555988","en","American Geophysical Union",,,,"Organic Molecular Signatures of the Congo River and Comparison to the Amazon",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-07-04T04:41:32Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85132889036",,,"Glob. biogeochem. cycles","6","Global Biogeochemical Cycles","36","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, one major challenge in BSFL waste processing, is that agri-food wastes (e.g. animal manure, agricultural crops and residues) tend to be low in macronutrients and high in lignocellulosic fibre (e.g. cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin), resulting in longer larvae development times and lower larval mass compared to when reared on high-value substrates (e.g. food waste). This study aimed to increase BSFL process performance on four fibre-rich substrates by ammonia substrate pretreatment: brewers spent grain, grass clippings, oat drink-by-product and cow manure. We first conducted experiments to identify optimal aqueous ammonia dose (1 vs 5%, 25% conc.) and pretreatment time (3 vs 7 days) by comparing its effect on the lignocellulosic substrate composition (neutral, acid and lignin detergent fibre) compared to an untreated control. Once we determined the optimal pretreatment condition, we completed controlled feeding experiments with four replicates, using ammonia pretreated and untreated substrates in a climate chamber (9 days, 2.5 larvae/cm2, 28 °C and 44-70% relative humidity). Results demonstrated that for most substrates a dose of 5% achieved improved lignocellulosic degradation, decreasing neutral detergent fibre by 6 to 22%, when compared to the untreated control. A pretreatment time of 3 days performed best for all substrates, except grass clippings, which demonstrated better results at 7 days. Based on our results, aqueous ammonia can result in fibre degradation of BSFL substrates and influence larvae performance. Although not fully evident at this stage of the experiments, ammonia pretreatment of such fibrous wastes shows mixed results of larvae performance depending on the substrates in question. This research works to increase performance of abundant fibrous low-value waste streams for recycling within the food system.",,,,"2352-4588","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/585347||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/585357||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/585459||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589366",,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589884","en","Wageningen Academic Publishers",,,,"Ammonia pretreatment of agri-food wastes to enhance black soldier fly larvae bioprocessing performance",,"Other Conference Item","Metadata only",,,,"2022-12-06T14:27:55Z",,,,,,,"yes","4th International Conference Insects to Feed the World (IFW 2022)","June 12-16, 2022","Quebec City, Canada",,,,"SUStainable INsect CHain","861976||861976","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC","H2020||H2020",,,,,,,,"Journal of Insects as Food and Feed",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02070 - Dep.

Cross-pathogenicity was proven for some of the strains within this species complex. It is thus important to have highly specific and fast diagnostics methods for members of the X. hortorum – X. hydrangeae species complex. A comparative genomic analysis was conducted for representative members within the complex to identify singletons for use as genomic targets for the assays. Seven loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) diagnostics assays were developed for the detection of six clades within the X. hortorum – X. hydrangeae species complex, in addition to one assay specific for the entire species complex. Primer sets were tested on a set of 62 reference strains. The primer sets amplified their respective targets within 15 minutes. Based on the reference set, all assays had a sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency of 100%. The assays were used on a validation set of 60 strains. According to the LAMP results, out of the 60 strains, 39 strains were assigned to one of the clades within the complex, 9 were assigned to the complex but to yet undefined clades within the complex, and 12 strains were previously misclassified as X. hortorum since their genomic DNA did not yield amplification with any of the assays. The seven genome-based assays are promising for use as diagnostic tools for various members within the X. hortorum – X. hydrangeae species complex, and for assigning new and historical isolates to this complex.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557072",,"2673-3218",,"10.3389/fagro.2022.898778","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557072","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","singletons||bacterial leaf spot||diagnostic methods||natural infection||hydrangea","Differentiation of the Xanthomonas hortorum – Xanthomonas hydrangeae Species Complex Using Sensitive and Selective LAMP Assays",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-07-09T11:38:55Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85132809396",,,"Front.

We here describe a protocol for plant HMW DNA extraction from low input material (0.1 g) which is easy to follow and quick (2.5 h).

In the case of recalcitrant species, we show that an additional purification step is sufficient to deliver a clean DNA sample.

New phenotyping tools enable quantifying the temperature response of hundreds of genotypes. Yet, for field-derived data, temperature response modelling bears flaws and pitfalls concerning the interpretation of derived parameters. In this study, climate data from five growing seasons with differing temperature distributions served as starting point for a growth simulation of wheat stem elongation, based on a four-parametric temperature response function (Wang–Engel) including all cardinal temperatures. In a novel approach, we re-extracted dose–responses from the simulation by combining high-resolution (hours) temperature courses with low-resolution (days) height data. The collection of such data is common in field phenotyping platforms. To take advantage of the lack of supra-optimal temperatures during the stem elongation, simpler (linear and asymptotic) models to predict temperature response parameters were investigated. The asymptotic model extracted the base temperature of growth and the maximum absolute growth rate with high precision, whereas simpler, linear models failed to do so. Additionally, the asymptotic model provided a proxy estimate for the optimum temperature. However, when including seasonally changing cardinal temperatures, the prediction accuracy of the asymptotic model was strongly reduced. In a field study with three winter wheat varieties, significant differences were found for all three asymptotic dose–response curve parameters. We conclude that the asymptotic model based on high-resolution temperature courses is suitable to extract meaningful parameters from field-based data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000553784",,"2517-5025",,"10.1093/insilicoplants/diac007","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/553784","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Growth||high-throughput field phenotyping||Stem elongation||Wheat (Triticum aestivum)","Phenomics data processing: extracting dose–response curve parameters from high-resolution temperature courses and repeated field-based wheat height measurements",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-21T15:14:07Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000812694800003",,"1","in silico Plants","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Formation of N2O occurs during biological nitrogen removal, involves multiple microbial pathways, and is typically very dynamic. Consequently, N2O mitigation strategies require an improved understanding of nitrogen transformation pathways and their modulating controls. Analyses of the nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) isotopic composition of N2O and its substrates at natural abundance have been shown to provide valuable information on formation and reduction pathways in laboratory settings, but have rarely been applied to full-scale WWTPs.  Here we show that N-species isotope ratio measurements at natural abundance level, combined with long-term N2O monitoring, allow identification of the N2O production pathways in a full-scale plug-flow WWTP (Hofen, Switzerland). Heterotrophic denitrification appears as the main N2O production pathway under all tested process conditions (0–2 mgO2/l, high and low loading conditions), while nitrifier denitrification was less important, and more variable. N2O production by hydroxylamine oxidation was not observed. Fractional N2O elimination by reduction to dinitrogen (N2) during anoxic conditions was clearly indicated by a concomitant increase in site preference, δ18O(N2O) and δ15N(N2O). N2O reduction increased with decreasing availability of dissolved inorganic N and organic substrates, which represents the link between diurnal N2O emission dynamics and organic substrate fluctuations. Consequently, dosing ammonium-rich reject water under low-organic-substrate conditions is unfavorable, as it is very likely to cause high net N2O emissions.  Our results demonstrate that monitoring of the N2O isotopic composition holds a high potential to disentangle N2O formation mechanisms in engineered systems, such as full-scale WWTP. Our study serves as a starting point for advanced campaigns in the future combining isotopic technologies in WWTP with complementary approaches, such as mathematical modeling of N2O formation or microbial assays to develop efficient N2O mitigation strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000535984",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2022.100130","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/535984","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nitrification||Denitrification||Stable isotopes||Isotopomer analysis||Nitrous oxide||GHG mitigation","Tracing N2O formation in full-scale wastewater treatment with natural abundance isotopes indicates control by organic substrate and process settings",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-08T08:01:19Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85125862820",,"000770058200001",,,"Water Research X","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For this purpose, we sampled temperate grassland soils at various depths along a VBS to grassland transect. Here, we combined sequential P soil extracts with an analysis of δ18OP values. Soil P pool concentrations tended to decrease significantly along the transect from the VBS to the grassland soils; the strength of this relationship varied with P extract, sample depth, and inorganic or organic bonding form. For the δ18OP values of the 1 M HCl-extractable P we observed a significant negative trend along the VBS to grassland transect, indicating a tendency for accelerated rates of biological cycling of P within the VBS soil profile compared with the upslope soils.

A meta-analysis identified strategies to decrease product-based (PB; CH4 per unit meat or milk) and absolute (ABS) enteric CH4 emissions while maintaining or increasing animal productivity (AP; weight gain or milk yield). Next, the potential of different adoption rates of one PB or one ABS strategy to contribute to the 1.5 °C target was estimated. The database included findings from 430 peer-reviewed studies, which reported 98 mitigation strategies that can be classified into three categories: animal and feed management, diet formulation, and rumen manipulation. A random-effects meta-analysis weighted by inverse variance was carried out. Three PB strategies—namely, increasing feeding level, decreasing grass maturity, and decreasing dietary forage-to-concentrate ratio—decreased CH4 per unit meat or milk by on average 12% and increased AP by a median of 17%. Five ABS strategies—namely CH4 inhibitors, tanniferous forages, electron sinks, oils and fats, and oilseeds—decreased daily methane by on average 21%. Globally, only 100% adoption of the most effective PB and ABS strategies can meet the 1.5 °C target by 2030 but not 2050, because mitigation effects are offset by projected increases in CH4 due to increasing milk and meat demand. Notably, by 2030 and 2050, low- and middle-income countries may not meet their contribution to the 1.5 °C target for this same reason, whereas high-income countries could meet their contributions due to only a minor projected increase in enteric CH4 emissions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000546926",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2111294119","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/546926","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","methane||meta-analysis||ruminant||enteric||mitigation","Full adoption of the most effective strategies to mitigate methane emissions by ruminants can help meet the 1.5 °C target by 2030 but not 2050",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-12T13:34:42Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85130001900",,"000841330100003","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","20","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","119","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The microalga Arthrospira plantensis (Sp), rich in bioactive compounds, has been described to exert beneficial health effects. The present study investigated the effects of HED and Sp intake during gestation and lactation in pigs. Twenty-four primiparous crossbred sows were fed either a HED or a control diet. Half of the sows per group were supplemented with 20 g/day of Sp. Despite a higher gross energy intake, consuming the HED did not affect the sows’ reproductive and lactational performance but significantly modified the colostrum fatty acid (FA) composition and tended to decrease the number of weaned piglets. The Sp supplementation did not affect the reproduction and lactation traits, but slightly affected the colostrum FA composition. A trend was observed for an interaction of diet and Sp in terms of offspring sex ratio with a 50% lower male-to-female ratio in the HED group compared to all other animals. These findings suggest that an HED and Sp intake hardly influence reproduction in sows. However, the HED modified the colostrum FA composition, whereas the Sp had only fewer effects, which may potentially affect offspring performance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000545078",,"2076-2615",,"10.3390/ani12091171","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/545078","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Primiparous sow||Dietary fat||Microalga||Offspring sex ratio||Colostrum composition||Pre-weaning mortality","A High-Energy Diet and Spirulina Supplementation during Pre-Gestation, Gestation, and Lactation do Not Affect the Reproductive and Lactational Performance of Primiparous Sows",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-04T12:52:28Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85129359097",,"000794717700001",,"9","Animals","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Green alder shrubs Alnus viridis increasingly overgrow European mountain pastures but hinder natural forest succession. This nitrogen-fixing, autochthonous invasive species has numerous negative effects including the loss of biodiversity and landscape aesthetic, eutrophication of soils and downstream waters, and greenhouse gas emission. Over centuries, A. viridis encroachment was impeded by grazing livestock, particularly goats. However, in modern agriculture, livestock numbers decreased on remote mountain pastures and goat farming became unprofitable. 2. A grazing experiment tested if hardy breeds of the more economically attractive livestock species, cattle and sheep can replace goats as A. viridis antagonists. On a subalpine pasture heavily encroached by A. viridis, space use and debarking (bark foraging) by Dexter cattle, Engadine sheep and Pfauen goats were analysed using GPS tracking and vegetation mapping. 3. Dexter cattle used space least evenly (Camargo evenness: cattle = 0.39; sheep = 0.52; and goats = 0.47) and preferred flat slopes and open pastures. They spent least time foraging in A. viridis stands (relative presence while foraging: cattle = 0.55; sheep = 0.76; and goats = 0.80). Dexter cattle did not debark any A. viridis, but damaged shrubs by trampling. 4. Engadine sheep visited A. viridis stands nearly as often as goats, but preferred flat slopes, short vegetation and shrub edges more clearly than goats. This sheep breed debarked significantly more A. viridis branches (average 244 branches per paddock; 7.4% of all A. viridis branches) than goats (45; 0.8%). Goats preferred mountain-ash shrubs Sorbus aucuparia covering only 2% of the shrub layer. 5. Synthesis and applications. Green alder shrubs, controlled by goats traditionally, overgrow valuable mountain pasture ecosystems today. Cattle, kept instead of goats, may slow down but not hinder shrub encroachment, because they avoid shrub stands and do not debark green alder. However, this study is the first to show that Engadine sheep are even better suited for green alder clearance than goats. Moreover, if management goals include forest re-establishment, Engadine sheep outperform goats, because they debark green alder (which hinders forest regeneration), but do not destroy elderberry—a valuable forest pioneer. Hardy breeds are an important tool to maintain biodiverse, open pastures, restore natural mountain forests and mitigate the negative environmental effects of shrub encroachment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539454",,"0021-8901||1365-2664","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/545271||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539454","10.1111/1365-2664.14156","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/545329","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Alnus viridis||Browsing||Cattle||Debarking||Goat||Hardy breed||Sheep||Shrub control","Thinning the thickets: Foraging of hardy cattle, sheep and goats in green alder shrubs",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-26T04:44:24Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85126313650",,"000769482000001","J.

Phenotypic responses included larval growth dynamics over time, weight at harvest, mortality, biomass production with respective contents of ash, fat, and protein, including amino acid profiles, as well as bioconversion and nitrogen efficiency, reduction of dry matter and relevant fibre fractions, and dry matter loss (emissions). Virtually all larval performance and body composition traits were substantially influenced by diet but also characterised by ample BSF genetic variation and, most importantly, by pronounced interaction effects between the two. Across evaluated phenotypes, variable diet-dependent rankings and the lack of generally superior BSF strains indicate the involvement of trade-offs between traits, as their relationships may even change signs. Conflicting resource allocation in light of overall BSF fitness suggests anticipated breeding programs will require complex and differential selection strategies to account for pinpointed trait maximisation versus multi-purpose resilience.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000544632",,"2075-4450",,"10.3390/insects13050424","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/544632","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","feeding value||genotype-by-environment interaction||genetic differentiation||insect-livestock||insect-microbiota||microsatellite markers||mitochondrial COI||nitrogen-to-protein conversion||phenotypic plasticity","Genotype-by-Diet Interactions for Larval Performance and Body Composition Traits in the Black Soldier Fly, Hermetia illucens",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-02T08:29:50Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85129975911",,"000802755500001",,"5","Insects","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Host range Xanthomonas hortorum affects agricultural crops, and horticultural and wild plants. Tomato, carrot, artichoke, lettuce, pelargonium, ivy, and dandelion were originally described as the main natural hosts of the seven separate pathovars. Artificial inoculation experiments also revealed other hosts. The natural and experimental host ranges are expected to be broader than initially assumed. Additionally, several strains, yet to be assigned to a pathovar within X. hortorum, cause diseases on several other plant species such as peony, sweet wormwood, lavender, and oak-leaf hydrangea.  Epidemiology and control X. hortorum pathovars are mainly disseminated by infected seeds (e.g., X. hortorum pvs carotae and vitians) or cuttings (e.g., X. hortorum pv. pelargonii) and can be further dispersed by wind and rain, or mechanically transferred during planting and cultivation. Global trade of plants, seeds, and other propagating material constitutes a major pathway for their introduction and spread into new geographical areas. The propagules of some pathovars (e.g., X. horturum pv. pelargonii) are spread by insect vectors, while those of others can survive in crop residues and soils, and overwinter until the following growing season (e.g., X. hortorum pvs vitians and carotae). Control measures against X. hortorum pathovars are varied and include exclusion strategies (i.e., by using certification programmes and quarantine regulations) to multiple agricultural practices such as the application of phytosanitary products. Copper-based compounds against X. hortorum are used, but the emergence of copper-tolerant strains represents a major threat for their effective management. With the current lack of efficient chemical or biological disease management strategies, host resistance appears promising, but is not without challenges. The intrastrain genetic variability within the same pathovar poses a challenge for breeding cultivars with durable resistance.

Because of technical constraints, we have little understanding of the extent and dynamics of the respiratory CO2 flux of roots at the total root system scale (RCF). This study aimed to fill this gap and to quantify the daily C budget of entire trees. We used aeroponics as a novel approach to measure directly and simultaneously RCF and the net CO2 flux of the entire shoot (SCF), to estimate their night- and day-time contributions to daily tree CO2 budget and to estimate the relative contribution of different root categories to RCF in large saplings of the tropical tree species Ceiba pentandra (L.) Gaertn. By maintaining root temperature within a narrow range (24-27.5 degrees C), we controlled for its effect on RCF, thus allowing the potential relationship between RCF and SCF to be tested. The carbon gain of the fast-growing saplings was 0.79 +/- 0.10 g C sapling(-1) day(-1), with day-time shoot CO2 uptake outweighing night-time shoot and day- and night-time root CO2 losses by a factor of two. Other than a slight rise in the morning hours, RCF was relatively stable and not coupled to the daily dynamics of SCF. Albeit having lower specific respiration rates compared with fine-roots, the relative contributions of coarse-roots (diameter >2 mm) to RCF were substantial because of their large biomass and were estimated to range from 43 to 63% of RCF at midday of different days during the growing season. The results of this study suggest that (i) the entire root system needs to be monitored for its impact on the tree CO2 budget, (ii) RCF cannot be derived from SCF and (iii) the importance of coarse-root respiration to RCF may be greater than appreciated.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000536806",,"0829-318X||1758-4469",,"10.1093/treephys/tpab169","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/536806","en","Oxford University Press","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Patterns of total root and shoot carbon dioxide fluxes and their impact on daily tree carbon budget in large tropical tree saplings",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-14T09:14:31Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85130002751",,"000764700000001",,"5","Tree Physiology","42","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, anthropogenic activities can largely alter the chemical composition and microbial communities of rivers, consequently affecting their GHG production. To investigate these impacts, we assessed the accumulation of CO2, CH4, and N2O in an urban river system (Cuenca, Ecuador). High variation of dissolved GHG concentrations was found among river tributaries that mainly depended on water quality and land use. By using Prati and Oregon water quality indices, we observed a clear pattern between water quality and the dissolved GHG concentration: the more polluted the sites were, the higher were their dissolved GHG concentrations. When river water quality deteriorated from acceptable to very heavily polluted, the mean value of pCO2 and dissolved CH4 increased by up to ten times while N2O concentrations boosted by 15 times. Furthermore, surrounding land-use types, i.e., urban, roads, and agriculture, could considerably affect the GHG production in the rivers. Particularly, the average pCO2 and dissolved N2O of the sites close to urban areas were almost four times higher than those of the natural sites while this ratio was 25 times in case of CH4, reflecting the finding that urban areas had the worst water quality with almost 70% of their sites being polluted while this proportion of nature areas was only 12.5%. Lastly, we identified dissolved oxygen, ammonium, and flow characteristics as the main important factors to the GHG production by applying statistical analysis and random forests. These results highlighted the impacts of land-use types on the production of GHGs in rivers contaminated by sewage discharges and surface runoff.",,,,"0944-1344||1614-7499",,"10.1007/s11356-021-18081-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529754","en","Springer",,,"Greenhouse gas||Urban river||Water quality||Ecuador||Land use type","Greenhouse gas dynamics in an urbanized river system: influence of water quality and land use",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-01-30T03:41:20Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85123239348",,"000745827700009","Environ Sci Pollut Res","25","Environmental Science and Pollution Research","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These climatic grids do not reflect conditions below vegetation canopies and near the ground surface, where critical ecosystem functions occur and most terrestrial species reside. Here, we provide global maps of soil temperature and bioclimatic variables at a 1-km² resolution for 0–5 and 5–15 cm soil depth. These maps were created by calculating the difference (i.e., offset) between in-situ soil temperature measurements, based on time series from over 1200 1-km² pixels (summarized from 8500 unique temperature sensors) across all the world’s major terrestrial biomes, and coarse-grained air temperature estimates from ERA5-Land (an atmospheric reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). We show that mean annual soil temperature differs markedly from the corresponding gridded air temperature, by up to 10°C (mean = 3.0 ± 2.1°C), with substantial variation across biomes and seasons. Over the year, soils in cold and/or dry biomes are substantially warmer (+3.6 ± 2.3°C) than gridded air temperature, whereas soils in warm and humid environments are on average slightly cooler (-0.7 ± 2.3°C). The observed substantial and biome-specific offsets emphasize that the projected impacts of climate and climate change on near-surface biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are inaccurately assessed when air rather than soil temperature is used, especially in cold environments. The global soil-related bioclimatic variables provided here are an important step forward for any application in ecology and related disciplines. Nevertheless, we highlight the need to fill remaining geographic gaps by collecting more in-situ measurements of microclimate conditions to further enhance the spatiotemporal resolution of global soil temperature products for ecological applications.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523670",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.16060","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523670","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Bioclimatic variables||global maps||microclimate||near-surface temperatures||soil temperature||soil-dwelling organisms||temperature offset||weather stations","Global maps of soil temperature",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-06T14:13:49Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Robust models for assessing the effectiveness of technologies and managements to reduce N2O emissions from grazed pastures (Models4Pastures)||ICOS-CH: Integrated Carbon Observation System in Switzerland||ICOS-CH Phase 2||Reconciling innovative farming practices and networks to enable sustainable development of smart Swiss farming systems||Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies","154245||148992||173691||172433||774124","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||EC","FACCE-JPI||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Forschungsinfrastrukturen||NFP 73: Gesuch||H2020",,,"85123931737",,"000753944300001","Glob.

Plant below-ground organs perform essential functions, including water and nutrient uptake, anchorage, vegetative reproduction and recruitment of mutualistic soil microbiota. Recently, multivariate analyses showed that root traits of species can largely be linked to a ‘conservation’ and a ‘collaboration’ gradient. Here, we tested whether this species-level bidimensional below-ground trait space also exists at the community level in grasslands. Furthermore, we tested whether the position of grassland communities in below-ground trait space relates to environmental variables. 2. For a total of 313 species, we collected data on eight below-ground traits in greenhouse and common garden experiments and supplemented it with data on bud-bank size and specific leaf area from databases. We calculated community weighted means (CWMs) of these 10 traits for 150 temperate grassland plots to investigate below-ground plant-trait dimensionality and its variation along 10 soil and land-use parameters. 3. Using PCA, we found that about 55% of variance in CWMs was explained by two main dimensions, corresponding to a mycorrhizal ‘collaboration’ and a resource ‘conservation’ gradient. Frequently overlooked traits such as rooting depth, bud-bank size and root-branching intensity were largely integrated in this trait space. The two plant-strategy gradients were partially dependent on each other, with communities that do ‘outsourcing’ of resource uptake to mycorrhizal fungi along the collaboration gradient also being more ‘slow’ along the conservation gradient. (i.e. high root tissue density and high root weight ratio). ‘Outsourcing’ communities were also more often deep rooting and associated with soil parameters, such as low moisture and sand content, high topsoil pH, high C:N and low δ15N. ‘Slow’ communities had large bud banks and were associated with low land-use intensity, high topsoil pH and low nitrate but high ammonium concentration in the soil. Surprisingly, we did not find an association of phosphorus availability with the mycorrhizal ‘collaboration’ gradient. 4. Synthesis. The ‘collaboration’ and ‘conservation’ gradients previously identified among species scale up to the community level in grasslands, encompass more traits than previously described, and vary with the environment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000534339",,"0022-0477",,"10.1111/1365-2745.13862","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/534339","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Bud-bank traits||Environmental filtering||Land-use||Mycorrhiza||Nitrogen||Phosporus||Plant economics spectrum||Root traits","Soil conditions drive belowground trait space in temperate agricultural grasslands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-02-25T14:13:43Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85126065709",,"000767237700001","J.

These alterations have different responses according to soil abiotic pre- and post-fire conditions and fire severity, among others, and tend to decrease along vegetation recovery over time. Thus, understanding the effects of fires on microbial soil communities is critical to evaluate ecosystem resilience and restoration strategies in fire-prone ecosystems. We studied the state of community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs) and the prokaryotic community structure of rhizosphere and bulk soils from two fire-affected sclerophyll forests (one surveyed 17 months and the other 33 months after fire occurrence) in the Mediterranean climate zone of central Chile. Increases in catabolic activity (by average well color development of CLPPs), especially in the rhizosphere as compared with the bulk soil, were observed in the most recently affected site only. Legacy of land burning was still clearly shaping soil prokaryote community structure, as shown by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, particularly in the most recent fire-affected site. The qPCR copy numbers and alpha diversity indexes (Shannon and Pielou's evenness) of sequencing data decreased in burned soils at both locations. Beta diversity analyses showed dissimilarity of prokaryote communities at both study sites according to fire occurrence, and NO3- was the common variable explaining community changes for both of them. Acidobacteria and Rokubacteria phyla significantly decreased in burned soils at both locations, while Firmicutes and Actinobacteria increased. These findings provide a better understanding of the resilience of soil prokaryote communities and their physiological conditions in Mediterranean forests of central Chile following different time periods after fire, conditions that likely influence the ecological processes taking place during recovery of fire-affected ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000548476",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2022.824813","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/548476","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","rhizosphere||bacteria||Biolog EcoPlates||ecosystem recovery||wildfires","Microbial Community-Level Physiological Profiles and Genetic Prokaryotic Structure of Burned Soils Under Mediterranean Sclerophyll Forests in Central Chile",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-23T02:44:48Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"INTERACTIONS OF ROOT PHENOTYPES AND ROOT-MICROBIOME IN MAIZE UNDER NITROGEN","839235","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85130169492",,"000795889900001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For a robot to safely navigate or perform manipulation tasks in dense vegetation, it is important to detect and distinguish rigid branches from the surrounding soft foliage. This task is challenging for traditional sensing approaches, such as vision, because the foliage can partially or totally occlude the branches. We present a haptic sensing system capable of detecting contact with the vegetation and locating branches occluded by soft foliage. The system follows a vision-based tactile sensing approach consisting of an array of compliant whiskers, with fiducial markers attached to them, and a camera to track their displacement. When the whiskers are inserted in the vegetation and the array is oscillated, rigid branches cause the whiskers to deflect significantly, while deflections caused by softer foliage are smaller. We developed a sampling strategy and a software pipeline to detect the location of the branches based on the deflection magnitude of the whiskers. Upon indoor and outdoor experiments with artificial and natural vegetation, we demonstrate the ability to locate branches among compliant foliage.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000581867","978-1-6654-0828-8||978-1-6654-0829-5",,,"10.1109/robosoft54090.2022.9762143","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/581867","en","IEEE","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Robotics","Whisker-based Haptic Perception System for Branch Detection in Dense Vegetation",,"Conference Paper","Open access","2022 IEEE 5th International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)",,,"2022-11-20T14:57:06Z",,,,,,,"yes","2022 IEEE 5th International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft)","April 4–8, 2022","Edinburgh, United Kingdom",,,,"CYbER - CanopY Exploration Robots","186865","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Eccellenza",,,,,"000945389700090",,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The climbing growth habit is associated with increased days to flowering (DF), seed iron concentration (SdFe), nitrogen fixation, and yield. However, breeding efforts in climbing beans have been limited and independent from bush type beans. To advance climbing bean breeding, we carried out genome-wide association studies and genomic predictions using 1,869 common bean lines belonging to five breeding panels representing both gene pools and all growth types. The phenotypic data were collected from 17 field trials and were complemented with 16 previously published trials. Overall, 38 significant marker-trait associations were identified for growth habit, 14 for DF, 13 for 100 seed weight, three for SdFe, and one for yield. Except for DF, the results suggest a common genetic basis for traits across all panels and growth types. Seven QTL associated with growth habits were confirmed from earlier studies and four plausible candidate genes for SdFe and 100 seed weight were newly identified. Furthermore, the genomic prediction accuracy for SdFe and yield in climbing beans improved up to 8.8% when bush-type bean lines were included in the training population. In conclusion, a large population from different gene pools and growth types across multiple breeding panels increased the power of genomic analyses and provides a solid and diverse germplasm base for genetic improvement of common bean.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000548904",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2022.830896","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/548904","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","genome-wide association studies (GWAS)||genomic selection||population structure||pleiotropy||growth habit||common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)||climbing and bush type bean","Improving Association Studies and Genomic Predictions for Climbing Beans With Data From Bush Bean Populations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-25T02:53:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85130057596",,,"Front.

The review (i) provides basic principles and methodologies for non-traditional isotope analyses, (ii) compiles isotope fractionation for uptake and translocation for each element and connects them to physiological processes, and (iii) interlinks knowledge from different elements to identify common and contrasting drivers of isotope fractionation. Different biological and physico-chemical processes drive isotope fractionation in plants. During uptake, Ca and Mg fractionate through root apoplast adsorption, Si through diffusion during membrane passage, Fe and Cu through reduction prior to membrane transport in strategy I plants, and Zn, Cu, and Cd through membrane transport. During translocation and utilization, isotopes fractionate through precipitation into insoluble forms, such as phytoliths (Si) or oxalate (Ca), structural binding to cell walls (Ca), and membrane transport and binding to soluble organic ligands (Zn, Cd). These processes can lead to similar (Cu, Fe) and opposing (Ca vs. Mg, Zn vs. Cd) isotope fractionation patterns of chemically similar elements in plants. Isotope fractionation in plants is influenced by biotic factors, such as phenological stages and plant genetics, as well as abiotic factors. Different nutrient supply induced shifts in isotope fractionation patterns for Mg, Cu, and Zn, suggesting that isotope process tracing can be used as a tool to detect and quantify different uptake pathways in response to abiotic stresses. However, the interpretation of isotope fractionation in plants is challenging because many isotope fractionation factors associated with specific processes are unknown and experiments are often exploratory. To overcome these limitations, fundamental geochemical research should expand the database of isotope fractionation factors and disentangle kinetic and equilibrium fractionation. In addition, plant growth studies should further shift toward hypothesis-driven experiments, for example, by integrating contrasting nutrient supplies, using established model plants, genetic approaches, and by combining isotope analyses with complementary speciation techniques. To fully exploit the potential of isotope process tracing in plants, the interdisciplinary expertise of plant and isotope geochemical scientists is required.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000547182",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2022.840941","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/547182","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","stable isotopes||fractionation||plant uptake||translocation||process tracing||multiple-collector-ICP-MS||metals||metalloids","Stable Isotope Fractionation of Metals and Metalloids in Plants: A Review",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-14T03:54:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85129331934",,,"Front.

The molecular size range of this broad NMR signal and its molecular structure remain unclear. The aim of this study was to elucidate the chemical nature of Porg with increasing molecular size in soil extracts combining size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with solution 31P NMR spectroscopy. Gel-filtration SEC was carried out on NaOH-EDTA extracts of four soils (range 238–1135 mg Porg/kgsoil) to collect fractions with molecular sizes of < 5, 5–10, 10–20, 20–50, 50–70, and > 70 kDa. These were then analysed by NMR spectroscopy. Organic P was detected across the entire molecular size continuum from < 5 to > 70 kDa. Concentrations of Porg in the > 10 kDa fraction ranged from 107 to 427 mg P/kgsoil and exhibited on average three to four broad signals in the phosphomonoester region of NMR spectra. These broad signals were most prominent in the 10–20 and 20–50 kDa fractions, accounting for on average 77 % and 74 % of total phosphomonoesters, respectively. Our study demonstrates that the broad signals are present in all investigated molecular size fractions and comprise on average three to four components of varying NMR peak line width (20 to 250 Hz). The stereoisomers myo- and scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphates (IP6) were also present across multiple molecular size ranges but were predominant in the 5–10 kDa fraction. The proportion of IP associated with large molecular size fractions > 10 kDa was on average 23 % (SD = 39 %) of total IP across all soils. These findings suggest that stabilisation of IP in soil includes processes associated with the organic phase.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529373",,"0016-7061||1872-6259",,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.115716","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529373","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Organic phosphorus||High molecular weight||Soil organic matter||Inositol phosphates||Solution NMR spectroscopy||Phytate","The molecular size continuum of soil organic phosphorus and its chemical associations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-28T04:11:12Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Identifying the chemical nature of organic phosphorus in soil extracts with increasing molecular weight","169256","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85123055924",,"000797497600003","Geoderma",,"Geoderma","412","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, in the semi-arid North-West of Burkina Faso, farmers produce yam in continuous rotation on degraded soils with annual rainfall of 610–960 mm. Understanding this local know-how can help improve yam cultivation in other regions and cropping systems in Africa. This study evaluated the productivity of this yam farming system in an interdisciplinary manner involving agronomic and economic analyses. We studied the cropping practices and socio-economic conditions of 67 households in 12 villages. We questioned farmers about their yam management schedule and inputs and we measured the yam fresh tuber yields in their fields. We sampled soils, manure and yam tubers for chemical analyses. Then, we calculated soil surface nutrient balances for N, P, and K. We found that the cropping system was characterized by densely planted ridges and relatively small size of harvested tubers. The farmers coped with degrading soils and increasing market demand by applying in average 16.2 t ha−1 of manure. About 31% of the farmers applied an average of 435 kg ha−1 of NPK fertilizer and another 24% applied an average of 300 kg ha−1 of urea. The average yam yield was 16.2 t ha−1, well above the West African average yield of 10.7 t ha−1.The yam had high value (0.59 USD kg−1) at relatively low production expenditure (0.04 USD kg−1), providing farmers the opportunity to increase and diversify incomes. Our results suggest that the development of this intensified yam production may be limited by farmer's low purchasing power of yam seed tubers, fertilizers and labor.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000547297",,"2673-3218",,"10.3389/fagro.2022.828305","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/547297","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","yam cropping system||climate adaptation||soil organic matter depletion||manure application||soil degradation||nutrient balance||West Africa","Interdisciplinary Assessment of Market Oriented Yam Cultivation in Semi-arid Burkina Faso",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-16T07:35:54Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Biophysical, institutional and economic drivers of sustainable soil use in yam systems for improved food security in West Africa (YAMSYS)","177584","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","r4d - Food Security Fortsetzung",,,"85129480764",,,"Front.

Here, we identify an intramolecular 13C/12C signal at tree-ring glucose C-5 and C-6 and develop experimentally testable theories on its origin. More specifically, we assess the potential of processes within C3 metabolism for signal introduction based (inter alia) on constraints on signal propagation posed by metabolic networks. We propose that the intramolecular signal reports carbon allocation into major metabolic pathways in actively photosynthesizing leaf cells including the anaplerotic, shikimate, and non-mevalonate pathway. We support our theoretical framework by linking it to previously reported whole-molecule 13C/12C increases in cellulose of ozone-treated Betula pendula and a highly significant relationship between the intramolecular signal and tropospheric ozone concentration. Our theory postulates a pronounced preference for leaf cytosolic triose-phosphate isomerase to catalyse the forward reaction in vivo (dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate). In conclusion, intramolecular 13C/12C analysis resolves information about carbon uptake and allocation enabling more comprehensive assessments of carbon metabolism than whole-molecule 13C/12C analysis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529486",,"1460-2431||0022-0957",,"10.1093/jxb/erac028","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529486","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Carbon allocation||carbon stable isotopes||Intramolecular isotope analysis||long time scales||ozone stress||primary carbon metabolism||triose-phosphate isomerase","Intramolecular carbon isotope signals reflect metabolite allocation in plants",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-28T10:02:12Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85125273500",,"000767419300001","J.

Trees take up P mainly from the soil solution, which soil microorganisms can replenish by mineralizing organic P through enzymatic hydrolysis (e.g. using phosphatases). We investigated how bacterial (including phosphatase harboring bacteria) and fungal communities in organic horizons with contrasting nutrient status respond within months to changes in soil N and P concentrations. A field experiment with water-soluble N (NH4NO3) and P (KH2PO4) additions was conducted at a high-P and a low-P beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest site in Germany. Bacterial (16S rRNA), fungal (ITS), and alkaline (phoD) and acid (acpA) phosphatase harboring community structure was investigated by molecular fingerprinting. Bacterial and fungal community structure was mainly related to available P (resin P) in the high-P site but related to more stable P pools (sequentially extracted NaOH/EDTA P) and total P in the low-P site. The increased importance of strategies to access more stable P forms in the low-P site was reflected by a higher relative abundance of some dominant alkaline phosphatase harboring taxa. In the high-P site, increased available P following P addition was the main influencing factor on community structure. By contrast, in the low-P site predominantly N addition induced differences in the microbial communities, which was linked to decreased P concentrations in several soil pools. Increasing N deposition might thus pose greater impacts on microbial communities in low-P compared to high-P sites, by further increasing the already high competition for P. Our findings illustrate that the soil P status in the organic horizon can shape the structure of microbial communities and their roles in the P cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522271",,"0929-1393||1873-0272",,"10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104357","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522271","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nutrient addition||Forest microbial community||phoD||Molecular fingerprinting||Organic soil horizon||Microbial P cycling","Microbial community responses to phosphorus and nitrogen inputs in the organic soil horizons of two contrasting temperate beech forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-24T05:48:30Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Impacts of N/P inputs on organic P dynamics and P status in soils and plants along a nutrient gradient","171170","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85120790119",,"000734887700006","Appl. soil ecol.",,"Applied Soil Ecology","172","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Agricultural adaptations and adjustments would be critical to mitigate the adverse impact of climate change and achieve global food security.  OBJECTIVE Focusing on the projected climatic change projections for Nebraska, our objective is to analyze data from a long-term (31 years; 1986–2016) rainfed agriculture experiment to determine how past years, that had similar conditions to the projected future climate - wetter winter (WW), wetter spring (WS), and dry summer (DS), responded to these conditions and attempt to describe the near-future (upcoming 20–30 years) corn and soybean yield, and income returns in northeast Nebraska.  METHODS First, we used a meteorological drought index, to determine years with projected future climate (6 years with WW, 4 years with WS, and 4 years with DS) and 9 all normal (AN) seasons years during the study period. Second, we performed a linear mixed-model analysis of variance to compare treatment (tillage: no-till, disk-till and plow-till; crop rotation: continuous-corn, corn-soybean; Nitrogen rates: 0–160 kg-N/ha) interaction and their effect on crop yield between projected future climate (WW, WS and DS) years and AN years. Finally, we used partial budgeting to calculate change in income and income risk across imposed management practices.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Results indicate that corn years with WW, WS, and DS seasons showed yield reductions of 9.1%, 10.9%, and 38.6% compared to an average AN season corn yield, which was 11.3 Mg/ha. Compared to the average AN season yield of 3.6 Mg/ha, soybean yields were + 1.4%, −3.3%, and − 31.8% for WW, WS, and DS, respectively. These yield differences did not significantly affect average corn and soybean income return in WW and WS years compared to the AN years (900 $/ha). However, total income returns in DS seasons regardless of pre-season conditions was about 40% of income return in AN seasons from Csingle bondS (900 $/ha) and CC (800 $/ha), respectively. Soybean yield and income returns were more stable than corn, which resulted in the corn-soybean rotation system always being higher in yields and being more profitable.  SIGNIFICANCE Our recommended management practice of disk tillage and corn-soybean rotation with 80 kg-N/ha could result in highest and stable income returns in near-future. Such long-term crop experimental studies can serve as an important complement to crop-model studies to get improved insight into future crop yield and income returns.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000532473",,"0308-521X",,"10.1016/j.agsy.2022.103384","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/532473","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Corn||Soybean||Tillage||Nitrogen Rate||Rotation||Income return","Prospective crop yield and income return based on a retrospective analysis of a long-term rainfed agriculture experiment in Nebraska",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-02-14T13:17:36Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85124376901",,"000793105600001",,,"Agricultural Systems","198","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Traditionally, in West Africa, yams are grown without any external inputs, leading to low tuber yields. The rapid decrease of tuber yield observed after the first yam cropping season has been ascribed to nutrient depletion and/or to the accumulation of yam-specific pests and diseases. This has led farmers to grow yam on new surfaces under fallow each year. Using a transdisciplinary approach, we identified different yam-based rotations and fertilization regimes that could stabilize yam production in rotational cropping systems and improve water yam (D. alata) productivity. These innovations were tested in researcher-managed field trials established along an environmental gradient crossing four yam growing zones spanning from the Humid Forest (Liliyo in Côte d’Ivoire) to the Derived Savanna/Forest Transition (Tiéningboué in Côte d’Ivoire), the Southern Guinean Savanna (Midebdo in Burkina Faso), and the Northern Guinean Savanna (Léo in Burkina Faso) between 2016 and 2018. The fertilization factor implemented at each site included a control with no fertilization (NON), sole mineral fertilization as NPK (MIN), combined organic and mineral fertilization (MINORG) and sole organic fertilization as manure (ORG), while the rotation factor included water yam in rotation with cereal (YamCer), legume (YamLeg), and white yam (YamYam). The average water yam tuber yields were 32.8, 20.3, 2.7, and 2.5 t fresh matter ha−1 in 2016, and 16.4, 10.7, 8.9, and 5.2 t fresh matter ha−1 in 2018 in Liliyo, Tiéningboué, Midebdo, and Léo, respectively. The most important determinants of tuber yields were the total amount of rainfall recorded during the yam growing period and between tuber initiation and maximum canopy development, and the soil carbon stocks in the 0–30-cm layer. We confirmed in this study that soil surface coverage measured between 70 and 98 days after planting was an early indicator of tuber yield. Fertilization impacted positively the soil surface cover but had a weak impact on tuber yields. Rotation had no impact on either the soil surface cover or tuber yields. This lack of observable impacts was partly due to the very large variability of tuber yields, to the variable rainfall, and to an anthracnose attack in two sites in 2018. The impacts of fertilization and rotation on yam yields should be studied over longer periods. This is, to our knowledge, the first publication showing the relative impacts of site-specific properties (rainfall and soil carbon stocks) versus management practices on water yam yield along an environmental gradient going across the West African yam belt.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542562",,"2073-4395",,"10.3390/agronomy12040792","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542562","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","soil carbon||rainfall distribution||soil surface coverage||fresh tuber yield||water yam||West Africa","Water Yam (Dioscorea alata L.)

However, fully realizing this potential will require improved understanding of the specific ways in which microbes influence plant ecology, which are both more complex and less well studied than the direct effects of microbes on host-plant physiology. Microbial effects on mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between plants and insects are of particular interest in this regard. This study examines the effects of two strains of Pseudomonas rhizobacteria on the direct and indirect (predator-mediated) resistance of tomato plants to a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera littoralis) and associated changes in levels of defense compounds. We observed no significant effects of rhizobacteria inoculation on caterpillar weight, suggesting that rhizobacteria did not influence direct resistance. However, the generalist predator Podisus maculiventris avoided plants inoculated with one of our rhizobacteria strains, Pseudomonas simiae. Consistent with these results, we found that inoculation with P. simiae influenced plant volatile emissions, but not levels of defense-related compounds. These findings show that rhizobacteria can negatively affect the attraction of generalist predators, while highlighting the complexity and context dependence of microbial effects on plant–insect interactions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542349",,"2223-7747",,"10.3390/plants11070920","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542349","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","direct resistance||Indirect resistance||Pseudomonas||Spodoptera littoralis||Podisus maculiventris||Tomato plants||Plant volatiles","Negative Effects of Rhizobacteria Association on Plant Recruitment of Generalist Predators",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-14T02:55:43Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85127409008",,"000781618000001",,"7","Plants","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The practice of growing trees and crops on the same land is mainly applied in (sub)tropical climate and rarer in temperate areas where farmers fear decreased understorey crop yields due to competition with trees. However, whether competition is stronger below- (soil moisture, nutrients) or aboveground (light) in a temperate silvoarable agroforestry system (AFS) is not clear. The effects of different treatments of light, water and nutrient availability on crop production in two temperate AFS in Central Switzerland were investigated, where summer barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was grown as understorey crop under 90%, 40% and 0% shade nets, with and without irrigation and/or fertilisation in a fully factorial design. Yield was reduced by 26% under heavy shade; yield reductions under moderate shade were not significant. Fertilisation and irrigation increased crop yield by 13% and 6-9%, respectively, independent from shade. Individual seed mass was significantly increased by fertilisation from an average of 0.041 g (+/- 0.008 SD) in unfertilised treatments to an average of 0.048 g (+/- 0.010) in fertilised treatments. Fertilisation had the biggest impact on total seed number (p < 0.001) with on average 36 (+/- 26) seeds per individual in unfertilised plots and 61 (+/- 33) in fertilised plots. This study demonstrates that moderate shade (as can be expected in modern AFS) was not a major limiting factor for barley yield in these two AFS in Switzerland, indicating that AFS with appropriate management combined with suitable selection of understorey crops are an option for agricultural production in temperate regions without significant yield losses.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000544181",,"0167-4366||1572-9680",,"10.1007/s10457-022-00740-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/544181","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Temperate agroforestry||Silvoarable||Shade||Understorey growth||Yield||Barley","Moderate shading did not affect barley yield in temperate silvoarable agroforestry systems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-28T02:51:19Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85128328891",,"000784027200001","Agrofor. syst.","4","Agroforestry Systems","96","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In Switzerland, the development of climate change scenarios is strongly linked to the climate adaptation strategy of the Confederation. The current climate scenarios for Switzerland CH2018 - released in form of six user-oriented products - were the result of an intensive collaboration between academia and administration under the umbrella of the National Centre for Climate Services (NCCS), accounting for user needs and stakeholder dialogues from the beginning. A rigorous scientific concept ensured consistency throughout the various analysis steps of the EURO-CORDEX projections and a common procedure on how to extract robust results and deal with associated uncertainties. The main results show that Switzerland's climate will face dry summers, heavy precipitation, more hot days and snow-scarce winters. Approximately half of these changes could be alleviated by mid-century through strong global mitigation efforts. A comprehensive communication concept ensured that the results were rolled out and distilled in specific user-oriented communication measures to increase their uptake and to make them actionable. A narrative approach with four fictitious persons was used to communicate the key messages to the general public. Three years after the release, the climate scenarios have proven to be an indispensable information basis for users in climate adaptation and for downstream applications. Potential for extensions and updates has been identified since then and will shape the concept and planning of the next scenario generation in Switzerland.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543991",,"2405-8807",,"10.1016/j.cliser.2022.100288","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543991","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate scenarios||Climate Services||Switzerland||EURO-CORDEX||User-oriented communication||National projections","Climate Scenarios for Switzerland CH2018 – Approach and Implications",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-27T03:23:08Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85128409930",,"000795942500005",,,"Climate Services","26","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Intercropping could improve soil quality, the stability of yields and climate resilience. Whether direct emissions of greenhouse gases from soil are reduced as well, depends on the specific measures of diversification. Here, we determined the greenhouse gas emissions from soils of two diversification experiments in the Pannonian climate of Hungary. Firstly, in an asparagus field, oat and field pea was introduced as intercrop between the asparagus berms. Secondly, grass and aromatic herbs were intercropped in a vineyard between the grape rows. The results show that especially for nitrous oxide, average treatment emissions can increase with additional legumes (+252% with intercropped field peas) but decrease with aromatic herbs (−66%). No significant changes were found for methane exchange. This shows that, while other ecosystem services can be increased by intercropping, changes in soil greenhouse gas emissions by intercropping are highly context dependent.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000544548",,"2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2022.857625","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/544548","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","diversification in farming systems||intercropping||nitrous oxide emissions||non-linear gas fluxes||vineyard||asparagus field||soil","Soil Nitrous Oxide Emission and Methane Exchange From Diversified Cropping Systems in Pannonian Region",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-01T03:01:46Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Crop diversification and low-input farming across Europe: from practitioners engagement and ecosystems services to increased revenues and chain organisation","728003","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,"85128546042",,"000791123500001","Front.

Drivers of food insecurity are becoming increasingly embedded in sociocultural and economic processes that transcendent multiple spatial and temporal scales. This is due to the increasingly globalized interconnections of places and people. Understanding this complexity is essential to devise locally relevant and effective adaptation strategies to tackle existing vulnerabilities causing food insecurity. This article analytically addresses the complexity in cross-scale dynamics by combining a case study from northern Vanuatu with a conceptual analysis of the broader socioeconomic dynamics within the telecoupling framework. Our aim is to identify drivers of vulnerability that span multiple temporal and spatial scales and contribute to food insecurity in a given location while exploring the relevance and applicability of the framework for the holistic assessment of vulnerability to food insecurity. The transdisciplinary approach used in this work involved local community members and local agriculture extension officers at all stages of the study process. For this, we used complementary research methods, such as workshops, participant observations, and in-depth interviews. The results showed that potential vulnerability to food insecurity in northern Vanuatu is likely to be related to individual choices aimed at maximizing income, enabled by economic development and driven by socio-cultural changes. These choices and their consequences are perceived in many cases to be responsible for lower subsistence food production and the overuse of natural food resources. However, economic changes in particular can also enable additional livelihoods that complement existing (subsistence-based) strategies, leading to a reduction in one-sided dependencies and thus to an overall increase in the resilience of local livelihoods. We find the telecoupling approach to be a useful tool to holistically capture a local vulnerability context. However, we also encountered challenges in describing telecouplings that operate over longer time scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543429",,"2571-581X",,"10.3389/fsufs.2022.818586","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543429","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Food insecurity||livelihood vulnerability||telecoupling||Vanuatu||climate change||drivers of vulnerability||subsistence-based livelihoods","Vulnerability to Food Insecurity in a Telecoupled World: Insights From Vanuatu",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-23T03:52:57Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85128227287",,"000781771900001","Front.

The aim of this paper was to evaluate whether TC gives overall welfare improvement when compared to permanent crating or free farrowing. This review shows that when pens with TC allow the sows to turn during the majority of time in the farrowing unit, it is the pen design and period of confinement in a crate within it that influence the extent to which different functional and motivated behaviors can be fulfilled. This review also indicates that there are at least short-term benefits to sows when confinement is reduced, as shown by reported increases in motivated behaviors such as exploration and interactions with piglets when not permanently crated. It remains unclear whether there are any longer-term beneficial effects (until or beyond weaning) due to the paucity of studies. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether the observed short-term benefits translate to other welfare indicators. Research findings indicate no reduction in the frequency of stereotypies or body lesions and do not provide a clear answer regarding sow stress response when released from confinement. Compared to free farrowing, TC appears beneficial for reducing piglet mortality. The impact of the time of onset of TC on the farrowing process and piglet mortality have been inconsistent. While confinement before farrowing prevents nest building behavior, consequences of this for sow physiology have been ambiguous. Confining the sow briefly after farrowing may be the best compromise, allowing the sow to perform motivated nest-building behavior, but the risks of crushing during the unconfined farrowing period may increase. Subsequent crate reopening seems to increase piglet mortality but only if done earlier than 3–5 days after farrowing. The review also provides methodological considerations, a proposal for consistent and accurate terminology when describing systems and highlights gaps of knowledge. In conclusion, TC is a step forward to better pig welfare compared to the farrowing crate, as it allows some freedom of movement for sows without impairing piglet welfare. However, more comprehensive research is needed to draw sound conclusions as to whether TC is a viable transition from permanent crating to free farrowing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542589",,"2297-1769",,"10.3389/fvets.2022.811810","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542589","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","temporary crating||free farrowing||permanent crating||lactation||sows||piglets||welfare","Review of Temporary Crating of Farrowing and Lactating Sows",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-19T03:01:07Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85127980452",,"000778173900001","Front.

Spatially targeted policy instruments can increase the provision of ecosystem services by exploiting how they respond to spatial differences in environmental characteristics such as altitude, slope, or soil quality. However, most policy instruments focus on individual farms, where spatial differences are small. Here we assess the economic value of three grassland ecosystem services (i.e., forage provision, carbon sequestration, and habitat maintenance) and its variability in a Swiss region of 791 km2 that consists of 19,000 farmland parcels when managed at the regional and farm scale, respectively. Our spatially explicit bio-economic simulation approach combines biophysical information on grassland ecosystem services and their economic values. We find that in our case study region, spatial targeting on a regional scale management increases the economic value of ecosystem services by 45% compared to targeting at farm scale. We also find that the heterogeneity of economic values coming from prices and willingness to pay estimates is higher than the economic gains from spatial targeting that make use of the spatial difference in environmental characteristics. This implies that heterogeneity in prices and/or societal demand of these three ecosystem services is more important for grassland management than spatial heterogeneity in our case study region. The here applied framework allows for an ex-ante assessment of economic gains from spatial targeting and thus provides basic information for the implementation of incentive mechanisms addressing the nexus of food production and ecosystem service provision in grasslands.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000536578",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-022-08198-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/536578","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Economic value of three grassland ecosystem services when managed at the regional and farm scale",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-10T15:52:42Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85126078693",,"000776266700064","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02120 - Dep.

Specific root phenotypes can be associated with better plant growth under low nutrient and water availability. Therefore, root ideotypes have been proposed as breeding targets for more stress-resilient and resource-efficient crops. For example, root phenotypes that correspond to the Topsoil Foraging ideotype are associated with better plant growth under suboptimal phosphorus availability, and root phenotypes that correspond to the Steep, Cheap and Deep ideotype are linked to better performance under suboptimal availability of nitrogen and water. We propose that natural variation in root phenotypes translates into a diversity of different niches for microbial associations in the rhizosphere, rhizoplane and root cortex, and that microbial traits could have synergistic effects with the beneficial effect of specific root phenotypes. Oxygen and water content, carbon rhizodeposition, nutrient availability, and root surface area are all factors that are modified by root anatomy and architecture and determine the structure and function of the associated microbial communities. Recent research results indicate that root characteristics that may modify microbial communities associated with maize include aerenchyma, rooting angle, root hairs, and lateral root branching density. Therefore, the selection of root phenotypes linked to better plant growth under specific edaphic conditions should be accompanied by investigating and selecting microbial partners better adapted to each set of conditions created by the corresponding root phenotype. Microbial traits such as nitrogen transformation, phosphorus solubilization, and water retention could have synergistic effects when correctly matched with promising plant root ideotypes for improved nutrient and water capture. We propose that elucidation of the interactive effects of root phenotypes and microbial functions on plant nutrient and water uptake offers new opportunities to increase crop yields and agroecosystem sustainability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542333",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2022.827369","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542333","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","root anatomy and architecture||soil resource acquisition||endosphere and rhizosphere||microbial habitat||agriculture","Improving Soil Resource Uptake by Plants Through Capitalizing on Synergies Between Root Architecture and Anatomy and Root-Associated Microorganisms",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-14T02:54:44Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"INTERACTIONS OF ROOT PHENOTYPES AND ROOT-MICROBIOME IN MAIZE UNDER NITROGEN","839235","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85127445320",,"000776535700001","Front.

Only ejaculates that fulfill minimum quality requirements are processed and eventually used for artificial inseminations. We examined 70,990 ejaculates from 1343 Brown Swiss bulls to identify bulls from which all ejaculates were rejected due to low semen quality. This procedure identified a bull that produced 12 ejaculates with an aberrantly small number of sperm (0.2 ± 0.2 × 109 sperm per mL) which were mostly immotile due to multiple morphological abnormalities. RESULTS: The genome of this bull was sequenced at a 12× coverage to investigate a possible genetic cause. Comparing the sequence variant genotypes of this bull with those from 397 fertile bulls revealed a 1-bp deletion in the coding sequence of the QRICH2 gene which encodes the glutamine rich 2 protein, as a compelling candidate causal variant. This 1-bp deletion causes a frameshift in translation and a premature termination codon (ENSBTAP00000018337.1:p.Cys1644AlafsTer52). The analysis of testis transcriptomes from 76 bulls showed that the transcript with the premature termination codon is subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The 1-bp deletion resides in a 675-kb haplotype that includes 181 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the Illumina BovineHD Bead chip. This haplotype segregates at a frequency of 5% in the Brown Swiss cattle population. Our analysis also identified another bull that carried the 1-bp deletion in the homozygous state. Semen analyses from the second bull confirmed low sperm concentration and immotile sperm with multiple morphological abnormalities that primarily affect the sperm flagellum and, to a lesser extent, the sperm head. CONCLUSIONS: A recessive loss-of-function allele of the bovine QRICH2 gene likely causes low sperm concentration and immotile sperm with multiple morphological abnormalities. Routine sperm analyses unambiguously identify homozygous bulls for this allele. A direct gene test can be implemented to monitor the frequency of the undesired allele in cattle populations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000537542",,"0999-193X||1297-9686",,"10.1186/s12711-022-00710-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/537542","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A 1-bp deletion in bovine QRICH2 causes low sperm count and immotile sperm with multiple morphological abnormalities",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-17T04:28:01Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85125980375",,"000765792600002","Genet. sel. evol.","1","Genetics Selection Evolution","54","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Milk microRNAs (miRNAs) encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been proposed as potential biomarkers of different mammary gland conditions, including subclinical mastitis. However, little is known about the robustness of EVs analysis regarding sampling time-point and natural infections. To estimate the reliability of EVs measurements in raw bovine milk, we first evaluated changes in EVs size and concentration using Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensing (TRPS) during three consecutive days of sampling. Then, we analysed daily differences in miRNA cargo using small RNA-seq. Finally, we compared milk EVs differences from naturally infected udder quarters with their healthy adjacent quarters and quarters from uninfected udders, respectively. RESULTS: We found that the milk EV miRNA cargo was very stable over the course of three days regardless of the health status of the quarter, and that infected quarters did not induce relevant changes in milk EVs of adjacent healthy quarters. Chronic subclinical mastitis induced changes in milk EV miRNA cargo, but neither in EVs size nor concentration. We observed that the changes in immunoregulatory miRNAs in quarters with chronic subclinical mastitis were cow-individual, however, the most upregulated miRNA was bta-miR-223-3p across all individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the miRNA profile and particle size characteristics remained constant throughout consecutive days, suggesting that miRNAs packed in EVs are physiological state-specific. In addition, infected quarters were solely affected while adjacent healthy quarters remained unaffected. Finally, the cow-individual miRNA changes pointed towards infection-specific alterations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000537543",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-022-08377-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/537543","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Extracellular vesicles||Milk||microRNA||Subclinical mastitis||Small RNA-seq","Determining extracellular vesicles properties and miRNA cargo variability in bovine milk from healthy cows and cows undergoing subclinical mastitis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-17T04:28:01Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85125978371",,"000765808500005",,,"MC genomics","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Physical pressure on the soil decreases macropores and thereby limits oxygen diffusion. The associated shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions can reduce nitrification and promote denitrification processes, leading to nitrogen (N) losses and N depletion that affect plant productivity. High soil moisture content during trafficking can exacerbate the negative effects of soil compaction. However, the extent to which soil moisture amplifies the effects of compaction on the soil microbiome and its control over N cycling is not well understood. Using a controlled greenhouse experiment with two different crops (pea and wheat), we compared the effects of compaction at three different soil moisture levels on soil physicochemical properties, microbial diversity, and the abundance of specific N species and quantification of associated microbial functional groups in the N cycle. Soil compaction increased bulk density from 15% (light compaction) to 25% (severe compaction). Compaction delayed germination in both crops and reduced yield by up to 60% for pea and 40% for wheat. Compaction further induced crop-specific shifts in microbial community structures. After compaction, the relative abundance of denitrifiers increased along with increased nitrate (NO3–) consumption and elevated nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations in the soil pores. Conversely, the relative abundance of nitrifiers remained stable under compaction, but potentially decelerated nitrification rates, resulting in ammonium (NH4+) accumulation in the soil. This study showed that soil compaction effects are proportional to the initial soil moisture content, which could serve as a good indicator of compaction severity on agricultural fields. However, the impact of soil compaction on crop performance and on microbial communities and functions associated with the N cycle were not necessarily aligned. These findings demonstrate that not only the soil physical properties but also various biological indicators need to be considered in order to provide more precise recommendations for developing sustainable farming systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000541790",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2021.822487","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/541790","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","soil compaction||nitrogen cycling||soil microbiome||amoA genes||nirS and nirK genes||nosZ clade I and II genes||pea (Pisum sativum)||wheat (Triticum dicoccum)","Mixed Effects of Soil Compaction on the Nitrogen Cycle Under Pea and Wheat",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-10T05:50:19Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Resistance and long-term resilience of the forest soil microbiome to mechanical disturbance","172942","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85127296459",,"000773076000001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Moreover, 29 non-transcription activator-like effector (TALE) and 21 TALE type III effector classes were found, and clade- or strain-specific effectors were identified.

Although the power factor can be improved by maintaining a turbulent boundary layer over the wing, this is challenging to achieve at Reynolds numbers below 50,000. We present a design strategy combining high airfoil camber and a cavity carved into the suction side of the airfoil to generate a turbulent, attached flow. The camber of a low-Reynolds-number AG14 airfoil is increased from 2 to 7%; whereas the cavity position, length, and depth are derived based on spatial linear stability theory of the separated shear layer over the cavity. Lift and power factors of the modified airfoils are characterized computationally using XFOIL. The higher camber cavity airfoils show a 100% gain in power factor over a smooth AG14 at Reynolds numbers of 30,000 and 10,000. Wind-tunnel testing of wings with the cavity airfoils showed power factor improvements of 30 and 80% at Reynolds numbers of 30,000 and 10,000, and hot-wire measurements confirmed that the cavity triggers a turbulent boundary layer.

Historical land use may have considerably influenced ecosystems and their properties for decades and centuries.  Objectives We analysed the effects of present and historical landscape structure on plant and arthropod species richness in temperate grasslands, using data from comprehensive plant and arthropod assessments across three regions in Germany and maps of current and historical land cover from three time periods between 1820 and 2016.  Methods We calculated local, grassland class and landscape scale metrics for 150 grassland plots. Class and landscape scale metrics were calculated in buffer zones of 100 to 2000 m around the plots. We considered effects on total species richness as well as on the richness of species subsets determined by taxonomy and functional traits related to habitat use, dispersal and feeding.  Results Overall, models containing a combination of present and historical landscape metrics showed the best fit for several functional groups. Comparing three historical time periods, data from the 1820/50s was among the most frequent significant time periods in our models (29.7% of all significant variables).  Conclusions Our results suggest that the historical landscape structure is an important predictor of current species richness across different taxa and functional groups. This needs to be considered to better identify priority sites for conservation and to design biodiversity-friendly land use practices that will affect landscape structure in the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526399",,"0921-2973||1572-9761",,"10.1007/s10980-021-01392-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526399","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Species richness||Landscape metrics||GLM||Land-use intensity||Historical landscape structure||Landscape configuration||Landscape composition","Present and historical landscape structure shapes current species richness in Central European grasslands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-18T07:19:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85122705873",,"000741232900001","Landsc. ecol.","3","Landscape Ecology","37","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In forests experiencing dieback, declining trees may exhibit altered climate memory of growth, indicative of physiological impairment. Thus, we evaluated climate-growth responses of trees in four drought-disturbed forests dominated either by gymnosperms (Abies alba, Pinus sylvestris) or angiosperms (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus humilis) in Northern Spain, where we compared responses of declining (heavily defoliated) and non-declining (slightly or not defoliated) trees. To disentangle the effects of forest dieback and past climate on tree growth, we applied the stochastic antecedent modeling (SAM) framework to annual tree-ring widths to quantify climatic memory. Declining trees had lower recent growth than non-declining conspecifics. All species responded positively to precipitation and temperature, independent of their vigor class, except for declining silver fir (A. alba) and European beech (F. sylvatica) individuals, which showed a negative effect of warmer temperatures on growth. Declining trees of these two species were also more sensitive to recent temperature and precipitation conditions, whilst climatic conditions further into the past were more important for non-declining trees. Silver fir and European beech from both vigor classes were also coupled to climate conditions during markedly different seasons, with dry summer conditions particularly affecting declining trees. Declining and non-declining Scots pine (P. sylvetris) and pubescent oak (Q. humilis) trees did not show different responses to past climate. While drought-triggered dieback differentially impacted silver fir and European beech individuals, Scots pine and pubescent oak trees suffered from a chronic process of loss in tree growth and vigor. Our results highlight the differences in climate sensitivity and climate memory of tree growth in forests experiencing ongoing dieback.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523755",,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108787","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523755","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Antecedent climate effects||Climatic memory||Drought stress||Forest dieback||Tree growth","Altered climate memory characterizes tree growth during forest dieback",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-06T19:47:36Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85121911473",,"000819806600004","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","314","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Our aim was to identify the number and nature of components in soil extracts of different MW using solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and spectral deconvolution fitting. Three surface soils were collected from native sites, which were extracted for Po using 0.25 M NaOH + 0.05 M Na2–EDTA (unfractionated), followed by size separation using ultrafiltration, resulting in four MW fractions (>10 kDa, <10 kDa, <10 kDa and >3 kDa, and <3 kDa). The NMR analyses revealed a diversity of Po species in all MW fractions across the three soils. In particular, the phosphomonoester region of the >10-kDa fraction comprised up to 10 components of varying linewidth (0.5–18.6 Hz) and a broad signal (228 Hz). This broad signal was also present in the <3-kDa fraction, albeit at a lower concentration (average was 29% of that in the unfractionated extracts). Furthermore, solution 31P NMR spectra on the <3-kDa fraction revealed a diversity of sharp signals (up to 28) in the phosphomonoester region. Overall, our findings show that soil phosphomonoesters in large MW fractions comprise multiple components of varying linewidth.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523814",,"0361-5995||1435-0661",,"10.1002/saj2.20347","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523814","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Soil phosphomonoesters in large molecular weight material comprise multiple components",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-07T08:45:21Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85122477187",,"000739752800001","Soil Sci.

Soil conservation systems are thus being promoted and/or adopted worldwide. In this on-farm study conducted in Switzerland, we compared the effect of three cropping systems – conventional with tillage, conventional without tillage (i.e. no-till) and organic farming with tillage – on soil quality. Samples from 60 winter wheat fields belonging to these three systems were analysed for soil carbon concentration, soil aggregate distribution and soil biological properties (microbial carbon and mycorrhizal biomarkers), at three different depths (0–5 cm, 5–20 cm and 20–50 cm). Information about cropping practices was collected through surveys. The main differences in soil properties between systems occurred for the surface layer (0–5 cm depth), with increased soil organic carbon concentration and stock under no-till compared to the conventionally tilled fields. No-till and organic fields showed a higher mean aggregate size and proportion of macroaggregates in the surface layer compared to tilled conventional fields, with a greater amount of carbon in the large macroaggregates. However, large within-system variability was also observed, which tended to override differences between systems. Across systems, clay content, microbial carbon, and the mycorrhizal PFLA biomarkers were the major drivers of soil organic carbon concentration, clay to carbon ratio and carbon accumulation in the large macroaggregate fraction. Aggregation at 0–5 cm was mostly related to tillage depth, while climate variables and especially clay content played a major role for deeper layers. Our results demonstrate that within the constraints set by soil texture and climate, organic agriculture and no-till can contribute to improved soil carbon and aggregation properties. Thus, we advocate for the identification of the main drivers of soil quality in order to inform management and improve soil functioning in agricultural fields in the long term.",,,,"0016-7061||1872-6259",,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115632","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/520168","en","Elsevier",,,"No-till||Organic farming||Soil biological properties||Tillage||Cropping practices","Pedoclimatic factors and management determine soil organic carbon and aggregation in farmer fields at a regional scale",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-12-11T04:38:00Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85120476533",,,"Geoderma",,"Geoderma","409","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Improving reproductive ability can be difficult because of antagonistic relationships with other economically relevant traits. In cattle, thorough investigation of female fertility revealed unfavorable genetic correlations with various production phenotypes. However, the correlation between male reproductive ability and production traits remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the genetic relationships among and between male fertility characteristics and economically relevant traits in a population of Brown Swiss cattle. We performed GWAS with imputed genotypes at nearly 12 million sequence variants for semen quality (sperm head and tail anomalies, motility, concentration, and volume), male fertility, and 57 production phenotypes. Allele substitution effects were then correlated on a trait-by-trait basis to estimate genetic correlations. Correlations between male reproductive characteristics and traits of economic value were small and ranged from −0.0681 to 0.0787. Among the semen quality parameters, sperm motility was negatively correlated with anomalies (head: r = −0.7083 ± 0.0002; tail: r = −0.7739 ± 0.0002) and volume (r = −0.1266 ± 0.0003), whereas volume was negatively correlated with concentration (r = −0.3503 ± 0.0002). Sire nonreturn rate was negatively correlated with sperm anomalies (head: r = −0.1640 ± 0.0002; tail: r = −0.1580 ± 0.0002) and positively correlated with motility (r = 0.1598 ± 0.0002). A meta-analysis of male reproductive traits identified 2 quantitative trait loci: a previously described region on chromosome 6 showed pleiotropic effects and a novel region on chromosome 11 was associated with sperm head anomalies. In conclusion, our results suggest that selection for economically important dairy and production phenotypes has little impact on semen quality and fertility of Brown Swiss bulls.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000524534",,,,"10.3168/jdsc.2021-0164","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524534","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Bull fertility and semen quality are not correlated with dairy and production traits in Brown Swiss cattle",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-11T09:54:49Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2","JDS Communications","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We modified the process-based Soil-Plant-Atmosphere (SPA) model to represent different gradients of foliar N allocation to Vcmax and Jmax in the canopy, and inversely calibrated the model via Bayesian inference using eddy covariance measurements of NEE and evapotranspiration from a mixed-deciduous forest. Inversely calibrated N allocation resulted in highest Vcmax at the top and highest Jmax at the bottom of the canopy, which is similar to N allocation gradients from measured foliar traits. These vertical gradients resulted in the best fit of simulated CO2 fluxes to measured NEE compared to alternative N allocation schemes, due to a higher, more realistic foliar CO2 uptake in the lower canopy. Canopy gradients of Vcmax and Jmax are thus important drivers of NEE and need to be considered to improve simulations of ecosystem-level CO2 fluxes of forests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523782",,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108771","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523782","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Bayesian inference||Canopy gradients||Nitrogen||Carboxylation||Electron transport||Soil-plant-atmosphere model","Accounting for foliar gradients in Vcmax and Jmax improves estimates of net CO2 exchange of forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-07T06:27:39Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85122007759",,"000819806600001","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","314","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As a conceptual framework we combined a concept of “stages of knowledge utilization” with a spiral model that co-creates three forms of knowledge – systems knowledge, target knowledge, and transformation knowledge, and which spans from joint problem definition to concrete sustainability transformations. We analysed questionnaires from 94 academic and non-academic actors using cross-tabulation, chi-squared tests, and qualitative content analysis. The early involvement of non-academic actors from key groups such as local enterprises was positively related to the utilization of research knowledge, as was their involvement in diverse roles. However, only little of the research knowledge generated has so far resulted in changes in policy and practice, partly because sustainability transformations are larger societal processes. Utilization of research knowledge for sustainability transformations cannot be achieved without employing a transdisciplinary approach that brings together academic and non-academic actors in a setting that enables discussions on an even footing and the empowering of actors who are often not heard. In such settings, researchers are also part of the change rather than mere observers, an additional factor that came up in our participatory results validation activities and that requires further research. For more influence on policies and practice, research for development requires active participation of non-academic actors from the outset, when the project contents are defined.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522877",,"1462-9011||1873-6416",,"10.1016/j.envsci.2021.12.017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522877","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Transdisciplinarity||Sustainability||Co-creation||Transformation||Knowledge utilization","Transdisciplinary co-creation increases the utilization of knowledge from sustainable development research",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-04T07:18:20Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85122133686",,"000787577400011","Environ.

The Paris Agreement aims to limiting global temperature increases to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Increasing levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), in the atmosphere are the primary cause of climate change. Approximately half of the carbon emissions to the atmosphere is sequestered by ocean and land sinks, leading to ocean acidification but also slowing the rate of global warming. However, there are significant uncertainties in the future global warming scenarios due to uncertainties in the size, nature and stability of these sinks. Quantifying and monitoring the size and timing of natural sinks and the impact of climate change on ecosystems are important information to guide policy-makers’ decisions and strategies on reductions in emissions. Continuous, long-term observations are required to quantify GHG emissions, sinks, and their impacts on Earth systems. The Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) was designed as the European in situ observation and information system to support science and society in their efforts to mitigate climate change. It provides standardized and open data currently from over 140 measurement stations across 12 European countries. The stations observe GHG concentrations in the atmosphere and carbon and GHG fluxes between the atmosphere, land surface and the oceans. This article describes how ICOS fulfills its mission to harmonize these observations, ensure the related long-term financial commitments, provide easy access to well-documented and reproducible high-quality data and related protocols and tools for scientific studies, and deliver information and GHG-related products to stakeholders in society and policy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000510462",,"0003-0007||1520-0477",,"10.1175/bams-d-19-0364.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510462","en","American Meteorological Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The Integrated Carbon Observation System in Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-18T13:38:38Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Readiness of ICOS for Necessities of integrated Global Observations||ICOS-CH: Integrated Carbon Observation System in Switzerland||ICOS-CH Phase 2","730944||148992||173691","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF||SNF","H2020||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,"85119510369",,"000796851500002","BAMS","3","Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society","103","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A 15-year time series of eddy covariance carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements on a medium-intensively managed grassland at 1000 m above sea level in Switzerland was analysed to assess how CO2 fluxes respond to environmental drivers as well as grazing and cutting events. Further, the effects of management, recent warming trends and anomalous weather conditions on the annual C sequestration potential were assessed. To this end, C budgets including atmospheric and management-related C fluxes (fertilization, cutting/grazing) were estimated. Generally, the main environmental drivers of CO2 fluxes were light and temperature. The removal of the aboveground canopy by management significantly reduced photosynthesis and induced a saturation in the photosynthetic response to light at lower intensities compared to periods without management. Ecosystem respiration remained largely unaffected by management. With a net ecosystem exchange of −357 (± 76) g C m−2 year−1 and a net biome production of −154 (± 80) g C m−2 year−1 (including management C fluxes), the grassland on average acted as a net C sink. Recent climate warming favors spring CO2 assimilation due to earlier starting vegetation periods. However, the warming also resulted in an increased ecosystem respiration. Further, anomalous and especially unfavorable weather conditions for photosynthesis and regrowth following harvest events induced several periods of an anomalously increased net CO2 release. In the year 2015, such release anomalies contributed to an annual net C loss. Under future climatic conditions, the C sequestration potential at the mountain site will depend on the extent to which spring photosynthesis is offset by such climate-management interactions and a warming-induced increase in ecosystem respiration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505102",,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108801","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505102","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","CO2 fluxes||Switzerland||Mountain grasslands||Management effects||Carbon budget||Long-term climate trends","Carbon dioxide fluxes of a mountain grassland: drivers, anomalies and annual budgets",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-10T07:38:22Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Robust models for assessing the effectiveness of technologies and managements to reduce N2O emissions from grazed pastures (Models4Pastures)||Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies","154245||774124","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","FACCE-JPI||H2020",,,"85122540849",,"000819806900001","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","314","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02330 - Dep.

Our aim here was to investigate the modelling of AWC and SWR with visible–near-infrared spectra (vis–NIR) and the machine-learning method cubist. We used soils from 54 locations across Australian agricultural regions, from three depths: 0–15 cm, 15–30 cm and 30–60 cm. The volumetric water content of the samples and their vis–NIR spectra were measured at seven matric potentials from −1 kPa to −1500 kPa. We modelled the following: (i) AWC directly with the average spectra of the samples measured at different water contents, (ii) water contents at field capacity and permanent wilting point and calculated AWC from those estimates, (iii) AWC with spectra of air-dried soils, and (iv) parameters of the Kosugi and van Genuchten SWR models, then reconstructed the SWR curves to calculate AWC. We compared the estimates with those from a local pedotransfer function (PTF) and an established Australian PTF. The accuracy of the spectroscopic approaches varied but was generally better than the PTFs. The spectroscopic methods are also more practical because they do not require additional soil properties for the modelling. The root-mean squared-error (RMSE) of the spectroscopic methods ranged from 0.033 cm3 cm−3 to 0.059 cm3 cm−3. The RMSEs of the PTFs were 0.050 cm3 cm−3 for the local and 0.077 cm3 cm−3 for the general PTF. Spectroscopy with machine learning provides a rapid and versatile method for estimating the AWC and SWR characteristics of diverse agricultural soils.  Highlights - Soil available water capacity can be estimated with vis-NIR specta. - Parameters of water retention models can be estimated with vis-NIR spectra. - vis-NIR spectroscopy performed better than pedotransfer functions. - The results apply to a diverse range of soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000546105",,"1351-0754||1365-2389",,"10.1111/ejss.13220","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/546105","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","available soil water||machine learning||soil water retention||visible–near-infrared spectroscopy||water retention models","Modelling soil water retention and water-holding capacity with visible-near-infrared spectra and machine learning",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-10T02:56:00Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85128863148",,"000787185400008","Eur.

This article investigates whether changes in domestic policy strategies of leading member states in European climate policy preceded the observed changes in EU policy. Disaggregating strategic change into changes in different elements (goals, objectives, instrumental logic), allows us to go beyond analyzing the relative prioritization of different goals, and to analyze how policy requirements for reaching those goals were dynamically redefined over time. To this end, we introduce a new method, which based on insights from social network analysis, enables us to systematically trace those strategic chances. We find that shifts in national strategies of the investigated member states preceded the shift in EU policy. In particular, countries reframed their understanding of supply security, and pushed for the internal electricity market also as a security measure to balance fluctuating renewables. Hence, the increasing focus on markets and market integration in the European 2030 package echoed the increasingly central role of the internal market for electricity supply security in national strategies. These findings also highlight that countries dynamically redefined their goals relative to the different phases of the energy transition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000532260",,"0032-2687||1573-0891",,"10.1007/s11077-022-09447-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/532260","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate and energy policy||Policy strategy||European Union||Decarbonization||Renewable energy","The European 2030 climate and energy package: do domestic strategy adaptations precede EU policy change?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-02-12T04:11:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The transition to a renewable electricity system and its interactions with other policy aims","715132","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85124201320",,"000751202700001","Policy Sci","1","Policy Sciences","55","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02120 - Dep.

In the current study, we evaluated the differences between five S. aureus mastitis isolates regarding their EV production. We found that different mastitis-related S. aureus strains differ in their behaviour of shedding EVs, with M5512VL producing the largest amount of EVs containing alpha-haemolysin, a strong cytotoxic agent. We stimulated primary cultured bovine mammary epithelial cells (pbMECs) with EVs from the S. aureus strain M5512VL. After 24 h of incubation, we observed a moderate increase in gene expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) but, surprisingly, a lack of an associated pronounced pro-inflammatory response.

Using a winter wheat N fertilization dataset from six site-years, we linked dynamic nitrate data measured in the soil solution to standard soil and crop analyses data and multispectral imagery acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle. Wheat N uptake was determined as remotely estimated N uptake (REN) from the spectral data with a power regression model (mean absolute error = 17 kg N ha−1). The nitrate-N in the soil solution (NSS), extracted by means of suction cups, was measured with an ion-selective electrode. The REN proved to be suitable for monitoring the accumulation of N in the plants along the season. The NSS was characterized by low values and found of limited use as a direct indicator for potentially plant-available N. The N balances resulted in N surplus in the range of 43–100 kg N ha−1 over the six site-years. The most important contribution to the N balances was the soil N supply (67–143 kg N ha−1; mineralization and atmospheric input). Including this factor in the fertilization strategy was investigated post-season by calculating the ‘adjusted N fertilization norm’, reflecting the current best fertilization practice in Switzerland. The approach suggested lower N fertilization rates in the fields with higher N surplus. However, such static empirical strategies do not allow to react to in-season changes. Sensor-based monitoring could help to overcome this shortcoming.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000531016",,"1161-0301||1873-7331",,"10.1016/j.eja.2022.126462","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/531016","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Soil N dynamics||N uptake||Nitrate-N in soil solution||Crop sensing||N balance","Linking soil N dynamics and plant N uptake by means of sensor support",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-02-07T07:38:51Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85123837438",,"000784342100002","Eur.

Quantifying the θcrit across biomes and climates is challenging because observations of surface energy fluxes and SM remain sparse. Here, we used the latest database of eddy covariance measurements to estimate θcrit across Europe by evaluating evaporative fraction (EF)-SM relationships and investigating the covariance between vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and gross primary production (GPP) during SM dry-down periods. We found that the θcrit and soil matric potential threshold in Europe are 16.5% and −0.7 MPa, respectively. Surface energy partitioning characteristics varied among different vegetation types; EF in savannas had the highest sensitivities to SM in water-limited stage, and the lowest in forests. The sign of the covariance between daily VPD and GPP consistently changed from positive to negative during dry-down across all sites when EF shifted from relatively high to low values. This sign of the covariance changed after longer period of SM decline in forests than in grasslands and savannas. Estimated θcrit from the VPD–GPP covariance method match well with the EF–SM method, showing this covariance method can be used to detect the θcrit. We further found that soil texture dominates the spatial variability of θcrit while shortwave radiation and VPD are the major drivers in determining the spatial pattern of EF sensitivities. Our results highlight for the first time that the sign change of the covariance between daily VPD and GPP can be used as an indicator of how ecosystems transition from energy to SM limitation. We also characterized the corresponding θcrit and its drivers across diverse ecosystems in Europe, an essential variable to improve the representation of water stress in land surface models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522368",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.16050","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522368","en","Wiley","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","critical soil moisture threshold||drought||Europe||evaporative fraction||gross primary production||surface energy partitioning||vapor pressure deficit","Uncovering the critical soil moisture thresholds of plant water stress for European ecosystems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-27T14:49:47Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85122157145",,"000735992200001","Glob.

Different phasing methods are available but their accuracy must be evaluated for samples with different properties (population structure, marker density, etc.). We herein took advantage of whole-genome sequence data available for a Holstein cattle pedigree containing 264 individuals, including 98 trios, to evaluate several population-based phasing methods. This data represents a typical example of a livestock population, with low effective population size, high levels of relatedness and long-range linkage disequilibrium. RESULTS: After stringent filtering of our sequence data, we evaluated several population-based phasing programs including one or more versions of AlphaPhase, ShapeIT, Beagle, Eagle and FImpute. To that end we used 98 individuals having both parents sequenced for validation. Their haplotypes reconstructed based on Mendelian segregation rules were considered the gold standard to assess the performance of population-based methods in two scenarios. In the first one, only these 98 individuals were phased, while in the second one, all the 264 sequenced individuals were phased simultaneously, ignoring the pedigree relationships. We assessed phasing accuracy based on switch error counts (SEC) and rates (SER), lengths of correctly phased haplotypes and the probability that there is no phasing error between a pair of SNPs as a function of their distance. For most evaluated metrics or scenarios, the best software was either ShapeIT4.1 or Beagle5.2, both methods resulting in particularly high phasing accuracies. For instance, ShapeIT4.1 achieved a median SEC of 50 per individual and a mean haplotype block length of 24.1 Mb (scenario 2). These statistics are remarkable since the methods were evaluated with a map of 8,400,000 SNPs, and this corresponds to only one switch error every 40,000 phased informative markers. When more relatives were included in the data (scenario 2), FImpute3.0 reconstructed extremely long segments without errors. CONCLUSIONS: We report extremely high phasing accuracies in a typical livestock sample. ShapeIT4.1 and Beagle5.2 proved to be the most accurate, particularly for phasing long segments and in the first scenario. Nevertheless, most tools achieved high accuracy at short distances and would be suitable for applications requiring only local haplotypes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000534140",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-022-08354-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/534140","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Haplotype||Phasing||Sequencing data||Cattle","Benchmarking phasing software with a whole-genome sequenced cattle pedigree",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-02-25T04:35:38Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85124804730",,"000755141100001",,"1","MC genomics","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The individual global recombination rate (GRR), measured as the number of crossovers (CO) per gametes, is a complex trait that has been shown to be heritable. The sex chromosomes play an important role in reproduction and fertility related traits. Therefore, variants present on the X-chromosome might have a high contribution to the genetic variation of GRR that is related to meiosis and to reproduction. RESULTS: We herein used genotyping data from 58,474 New Zealand dairy cattle to estimate the contribution of the X-chromosome to male and female GRR levels. Based on the pedigree-based relationships, we first estimated that the X-chromosome accounted for 30% of the total additive genetic variance for male GRR. This percentage was equal to 19.9% when the estimation relied on a SNP-BLUP approach assuming each SNP has a small contribution. We then carried out a haplotype-based association study to map X-linked QTL, and subsequently fine-mapped the identified QTL with imputed sequence variants. With this approach we identified three QTL with large effect accounting for 7.7% of the additive genetic variance of male GRR. The associated effects were equal to + 0.79, - 1.16 and + 1.18 CO for the alternate alleles. In females, the estimated contribution of the X-chromosome to GRR was null and no significant association with X-linked loci was found. Interestingly, two of the male GRR QTL were associated with candidate genes preferentially expressed in testis, in agreement with a male-specific effect. Finally, the most significant QTL was associated with PPP4R3C, further supporting the important role of protein phosphatase in double-strand break repair by homologous recombination. CONCLUSIONS: Our study illustrates the important role the X-chromosome can have on traits such as individual recombination rate, associated with testis in males. We also show that contribution of the X-chromosome to such a trait might be sex dependent.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000533331",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-022-08328-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/533331","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"High male specific contribution of the X-chromosome to individual global recombination rate in dairy cattle",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-02-19T05:50:11Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85124448040",,"000753896000001",,"1","MC genomics","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Our deep learning network was able to identify and classify individual flowers. The novel method allowed generating spatially explicit maps of flower abundance that met or exceeded the accuracy of the manual-count-data extrapolation method while being less labor intensive. The results were very good for some types of flowers, with precision and recall being close to or higher than 90%. Other flowers were detected poorly due to reasons such as lack of enough training data, appearance changes due to phenology, or flowers being too small to be reliably distinguishable on the aerial images. The method was able to give precise estimates of the abundance of many flowering plant species. In the future, the collection of more training data will allow better predictions for the flowers that are not well predicted yet.

In spite of their diversity, only few species have been characterized to date which makes Acidobacteria one of the most poorly understood phyla among the domain Bacteria. We used a culture-independent niche modeling approach to elucidate ecological adaptations and their evolution for 4,154 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Acidobacteria across 150 different, comprehensively characterized grassland soils in Germany. Using the relative abundances of their 16S rRNA gene transcripts, the responses of active OTUs along gradients of 41 environmental variables were modeled using hierarchical logistic regression (HOF), which allowed to determine values for optimum activity for each variable (niche optima). By linking 16S rRNA transcripts to the phylogeny of full 16S rRNA gene sequences, we could trace the evolution of the different ecological adaptations during the diversification of Acidobacteria. This approach revealed a pronounced ecological diversification even among acidobacterial sister clades. Although the evolution of habitat adaptation was mainly cladogenic, it was disrupted by recurrent events of convergent evolution that resulted in frequent habitat switching within individual clades. Our findings indicate that the high diversity of soil acidobacterial communities is largely sustained by differential habitat adaptation even at the level of closely related species. A comparison of niche optima of individual OTUs with the phenotypic properties of their cultivated representatives showed that our niche modeling approach (1) correctly predicts those physiological properties that have been determined for cultivated species of Acidobacteria but (2) also provides ample information on ecological adaptations that cannot be inferred from standard taxonomic descriptions of bacterial isolates. These novel information on specific adaptations of not-yet-cultivated Acidobacteria can therefore guide future cultivation trials and likely will increase their cultivation success.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000532362",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2022.715637","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/532362","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","evolution||ecological diversity||adaptation||acidobacteria||optimum niche modeling||16S rRNA gene transcripts||physiological traits","The Evolution of Ecological Diversity in Acidobacteria",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-02-14T08:29:12Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85124881028",,"000759866500001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The nutrient composition and in vitro fermentation profile of bamboo displayed low fermentation potential, i.e. high lignin and silica levels together with a gas production (Hohenheim gas test) at 12 h of only 36% of that of lucerne and grass. Although silica levels were more abundant in the leftovers of (almost) all groups, guinea pigs did not select against lignin on bamboo. Dry matter (DM) intake was highest and DM digestibility lowest on the bamboo forage. Total short-chain fatty acid levels in caecal content were highest for lucerne and lowest for grass and bamboo. Bamboo-fed guinea pigs had a lower body weight gain than the grass and lucerne group. The forage hydration state did not substantially affect digestion, but dry forage led to a numerically higher total wet gut fill. Although guinea pigs increased DM intake on the bamboo diet, the negative effects on fermentation of lignin and silica in bamboo seemed overriding.

Growth of all species peaked in the early part of the growth season and commenced shortly before the summer solstice, but with species-specific seasonal patterns. Day length set a window of opportunity for radial growth. Within this window, the probability of daily growth was constrained particularly by air and soil moisture, resulting in intermittent growth to occur only on 29 to 77 days (30% to 80%) within the growth period. The number of days with growth largely determined annual growth, whereas the growth period length contributed less.

Sustainable and local production in regions with marginal climates requires cold-adapted varieties that create high yield and protein content in a short vegetation period. Drone-based high-throughput field phenotyping methods allow monitoring the success and the developmental speed of genotypes in such target environments. This study exemplifies that such frequent and precise analyses of remotely sensed canopy growth traits can be used to derive the optimal genotype, a so-called ideotype, for a given mega-environment. For the case example of Switzerland, a country with a temperate oceanic climate, the results indicate that image-derived traits allow predicting yield and protein content from the dynamics of vegetative growth. Genotypes with early canopy cover produce high yield, whereas genotypes that show a prolonged duration until they have reached their final maximum of leaf area index are characterized by a high protein content. Analyses of early performance trial stage material indicate that there are genotypes that combine both features of growth dynamics. Whether these genotypes are then indeed successful in breeding programs remains to be investigated, since this also depends on disease resistance and other traits of those genotypes. Yet, overall, this study provides strong indications of the high value of high-throughput field phenotyping in the context of physiological and breeding-related analyses of crops.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523753",,"0034-4257",,"10.1016/j.rse.2021.112797","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523753","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Physiological plant breeding||Ideotype||High-throughput field phenotyping (HTFP)||Unmanned aerial system (UAS)||Drone (UAV)","High-throughput field phenotyping of soybean: Spotting an ideotype",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-06T19:47:26Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85119436093",,"000759691900002","Remote Sens.

Here, we follow up on the hypothesis that long-term orientation increases environmental policy performance. To this end, we use three time preference indices (including a newly constructed index with a wide spatial coverage based on Google search data). Our results show that countries with higher long-term orientation have higher environmental policy performance. This relationship is in most cases because of the positive association of long-term orientation and environmental policy performance with economic development and other factors. Only the analysis with increased spatial coverage (especially to African and Asian countries) using Google long-term orientation shows some results indicating positive relationships when considering economic development and other factors. Still, also in this analysis, the positive relationships are largely because of economic development and other factors. Expanding the spatial coverage when measuring time preference might add insights into the time preference-environmental policy performance relationship. Moreover, the results show that researchers need to control for important factors, especially economic development, when analyzing time preference and environmental policy performance or related questions, such as environmental behavior and culture, as these factors can completely, or at least largely, drive the results.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000517420",,"1462-9011||1873-6416","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517420||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518964","10.1016/j.envsci.2021.11.017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526720","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Environmental policy||Time preference||Economic preferences||Digital trace data||Climate change||Biodiversity||Public policy","Global relationships between time preference and environmental policy performance",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-29T07:40:19Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85119916526",,"000820089800001","Environ.

Of the assessments that do exist, most are of larger rivers or are model-based and lack validation with measured data. Understanding the mechanisms of sediment export dynamics in forested headwaters is important for assessing downstream effects and as a baseline for net impacts of land-use change. To that end, we quantified annual total suspended sediment (TSS) yields in forested headwater catchments of two major forest types in central Africa (tropical lowland forest and subtropical Miombo woodland) and analyzed turbidity-discharge hysteresis over one hydrological year. We measured TSS yields of 0.24 ± 0.09 t ha−1 yr−1 in the Miombo woodland and 0.25 ± 0.05 t ha−1 yr−1 in the lowland forest catchment. The Miombo woodland experienced similar TSS yields as the lowland forest despite a shorter, five-month, rainy season and lower annual precipitation. In the Miombo forest, sparser vegetation cover, seasonal fires that remove understory vegetation and high rainfall intensity during the rainy season therefore resulted in similar TSS yields. As a result of these differences in vegetation and rainfall, approximately 68% of TSS was exported during storm events in the Miombo woodland and 30% in the lowland forest. Both sites showed mainly clockwise hysteresis (positive hysteresis index) patterns of sediment export. In the Miombo woodland, the hysteresis index (i.e., the magnitude and direction of hysteresis) increased with the ongoing rainy season, indicating source limitation already after one month of rain. In the lowland forest, the predominant clockwise hysteresis was more likely caused by the increasing contribution of baseflow during the falling limb of an event, whereas during the rising limb there is a quick flushing of surface material available in the forest. These findings based on hysteresis analysis were further supported by C:N ratio and δ13C analyses of particulate organic matter (POM). POM C:N ratios increased and δ13C signatures decreased with increased discharge in the lowland forest, indicating the mobilization of topsoil sediments during rain events. In contrast, the Miombo exhibited no shifts in C:N ratios nor in the δ13C signature. Despite the pristine nature of these forests and their assumed negligible sediment yields, our results demonstrate that erosion is a significant loss process in tropical forests and call for future research to examine its role in forest functioning and biogeochemical cycling. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, these interactions may also be influenced by the presence of other symbiotic microorganisms, including co-evolved plant mutualists. Here, we explore how rhizobia colonization influences plant virus effects on host chemistry, vector behavior, and virus transmission using a system consisting of Medicago truncatula, Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), its aphid vector Acyrthosiphon pisum, and the rhizobial symbiont Sinorhizobium. We hypothesized that virus effects and outcomes for virus transmission would differ when plants were co-colonized by rhizobia, which are known to alter both defense gene expression and nutritional status of their hosts. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that aphid dispersal following virus acquisition was greatest from AMV-infected plants with rhizobia, and that this translated into increased rates of transmission in mesocosm experiments. These effects are likely mediated by rhizobial and viral effects on plant defense responses and primary metabolites. AMV infection also suppressed volatiles across both rhizobia treatments, which contrasts with previous reports of viruses enhancing host volatiles. However, aphids did not exhibit odor-based preferences, suggesting volatiles may not be important mediators of host choice or targets for manipulation by AMV. Collectively, this study provides evidence that putative virus manipulations of hosts and vectors depend on the pre-existing physiological condition of the host-in this case, presence of a co-evolved intracellular root symbiont.",,,,,,"10.1007/s11829-021-09878-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/527374","en","Springer",,,"Aphids||Plant volatiles||Phytohormones||Virus manipulation","Transmission-enhancing effects of a plant virus depend on host association with beneficial bacteria",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-01-21T04:31:06Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85123108273",,"000742569600001",,"1","Arthropod-Plant Interactions","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we simulated browsing in a common garden experiment to study growth and physiological traits, measured from bulk needles, using a randomized block design with two levels of browsing severity and seedlings originating from 19 populations across Switzerland. Genetic factors explained most variation in growth (on average, 51.5%) and physiological traits (10.2%) under control conditions, while heavy browsing considerably reduced the genetic effects on growth (to 30%), but doubled those on physiological traits related to carbon storage. While browsing reduced seedling height, it also lowered seedling water-use efficiency (decreased δ13C) and increased their δ15N. Different populations reacted differently to browsing stress, and for seedling height, starch concentration and δ15N, population differences appeared to be the result of natural selection. First, we found that populations originating from the warmest regions recovered the fastest from browsing stress, and they did so by mobilizing starch from their needles, which suggests a genetic underpinning for a growth-storage trade-off across populations. Second, we found that seedlings originating from mountain populations growing on steep slopes had a higher δ15N in the common garden than those originating from flat areas, indicating that they have been selected to grow on N-poor, potentially drained, soils. This finding was corroborated by the fact that nitrogen concentration in adult needles was lower on steep slopes than on flat ground, strongly indicating that steep slopes are the most N-poor environments. These results suggest that adaptation to climate and soil nitrogen availability, as well as ungulate browsing pressure, co-determine the regeneration and range limit of silver fir.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516111",,"0829-318X||1758-4469",,"10.1093/treephys/tpab105","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516111","en","Oxford University Press","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Herbivory||Mountain forests||Mycorrhiza||Nitrogen||Non-structural carbohydrates||Simulated browsing||Stable isotopes||Water-use efficiency","Recovery of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) seedlings from ungulate browsing mirrors soil nitrogen availability",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-19T11:30:42Z","2022-09-15",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85124576307",,"000810029400006",,"2","Tree Physiology","42","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, farmers plant and harvest cassava at the onset of rains which creates glut and results in unattractive root prices. Thus, farmers need to understand how cassava varieties respond to different planting dates and crop ages at harvest to be able to use opportunities in income generation that may arise from flexible planting and harvest dates resulting from price and dry matter (DM) variabilities. Thus, this study was conducted to identify the best time to plant and harvest cassava for different varieties (TME419 and TMS581) and to determine the effect of fertilizer on root DM yields in three locations (Idi-Ose, Moniya and Ido) in Nigeria, over two years. The overall objective was to provide information to guide farmers on how to schedule planting and harvesting in Nigeria. The trials were conducted using a factorial split-split plot design. Effects of early, mid and late planting dates combined with harvest at 9, 11 and 13 months after planting (MAP) were tested. Fertilizer treatments included a control (F0) and applications of 75 kg N ha−1, 20 kg P ha−1 combined with 90 (F1), 135 (F2) and 180 (F3) kg K ha−1. A root DM yield increase of 44.8% was observed when crop age increased from 9 to 11 MAP, and an increase of 13.1% when crop age increased from 11 to 13 MAP, indicating that delaying harvests does increase root DM yield across all planting dates. In contrast, root DM yield differences between planting dates were marginal, an increase of 8.1% was observed from early to mid-planting date and of 9.5% from early to late planting dates. Fertilizer treatments significantly interacted with location and the largest responses were observed at Ido. Fertilizer increased cassava root DM yields when compared with control at Ido by 15.38%, 23.1% and 16.7% in F1, F2 and F3, respectively. Responses were inconsistent at Moniya and Idi-Ose. With information on the effect of crop age and fertilizer, farmers could benefit from targeting seasons with shortage of cassava roots and high cassava prices, which would benefit processing industries securing year-round root supply.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522584",,"1161-0301||1873-7331",,"10.1016/j.eja.2021.126448","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522584","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cassava||Fertilizer||Root yield and field experiments","Understanding changes in cassava root dry matter yield by different planting dates, crop ages at harvest, fertilizer application and varieties",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-02T04:07:56Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85121643428",,"000740709500007","Eur.

In turn, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration may stimulate photosynthesis, potentially increasing plant litter inputs belowground and transferring carbon from the atmosphere into terrestrial ecosystems. Key questions remain about the magnitude and rate of these interacting and opposing environmental change drivers. Here, we assess the incorporation and degradation of plant- and microbe-derived OM in an ombrotrophic peatland after 4 years of whole-ecosystem warming (+0, +2.25, +4.5, +6.75 and +9 degrees C) and two years of elevated CO2 manipulation (500 ppm above ambient). We show that OM molecular composition was substantially altered in the aerobic acrotelm, highlighting the sensitivity of acrotelm carbon to rising temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentration. While warming accelerated OM decomposition under ambient CO2, new carbon incorporation into peat increased in warming x elevated CO2 treatments for both plant- and microbe-derived OM. Using the isotopic signature of the applied CO2 enrichment as a label for recently photosynthesized OM, our data demonstrate that new plant inputs have been rapidly incorporated into peat carbon. Our results suggest that under current hydrological conditions, rising temperatures and atmospheric CO2 levels will likely offset each other in boreal peatlands.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515110",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15955","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515110","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","boreal peatland||decomposition||elevated CO2||lipid biomarker||organic matter||stable carbon isotope","Warming and elevated CO2 promote rapid incorporation and degradation of plant-derived organic matter in an ombrotrophic peatland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-15T03:54:40Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"When trees die: Understanding how plants and microbes interact and influence soil biogeochemical processes","180030","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,"85118569727",,"000715489800001","Glob.

However, sweet potato cultivation removes large amounts of nutrients from the soil. Hence, soil fertility replenishment is vital to secure long-term food production. The lack of access to fertilizers hinders the ability of farmers to supply and replenish soil nutrients, intensifying food insecurity. This study aimed at identifying locally available organic residues and agricultural practices with potential application in soil fertility management to prevent soil degradation in southern Mozambique. We conducted a survey to gather information on the farmers’ demographics and farming systems of 107 orange-fleshed sweet potato farmers. Results show that more than 70% of farmers use agroecological practices such as intercropping and crop rotation, and more than 90% indicated having residual crop biomass after harvest. Most cultivated crops, such as lettuce, beans, etc., are harvested in July-August, before the start of orange-fleshed sweet potato cultivation. Thus, there is potential for the application of crop residues as an organic amendment for orange-fleshed sweet potato cultivation. Nevertheless, farmers need support to adopt soil fertility management based on locally accessible resources, therefore ensuring extension services focused on the long-term benefits of sustainable practices are vital.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000593646",,"1991-637X",,"10.5897/ajar2021.15868","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/593646","en","Academic Journals","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Crop residue||organic agriculture||smallholder||survey","Identifying available resources and agricultural practices useful in soil fertility management to support orange-fleshed sweet potato cultivation on smallholder farms in Mozambique",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-19T15:06:38Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","African Journal of Agricultural Research","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, northern peatlands are projected to remain a net sink of CO2 and climate neutral for the next three centuries. A shift to a net CO2 source and a substantial increase in CH4 emissions are projected under RCP8.5, which could exacerbate global warming by 0.21°C (range, 0.09–0.49°C) by the year 2300. The true warming impact of peatlands might be higher owing to processes not simulated by the models and direct anthropogenic disturbance.

Long-term temporal trends towards earlier leaf unfolding are observed across Northern Hemisphere forests. Phenological dates also vary between years, whereby end-of-season (EOS) dates correlate positively with start-of-season (SOS) dates and negatively with growing season total net CO2 assimilation (Anet). These associations have been interpreted as the effect of a constrained leaf longevity or of premature carbon (C) sink saturation - with far-reaching consequences for long-term phenology projections under climate change and rising CO2. Here, we use multi-decadal ground and remote-sensing observations to show that the relationships between Anet and EOS are opposite at the interannual and the decadal time scales. A decadal trend towards later EOS persists in parallel with a trend towards increasing Anet - in spite of the negative Anet-EOS relationship at the interannual scale. This indicates that acclimation of phenology has enabled plants to transcend a constrained leaf longevity or premature C sink saturation over the course of several decades, leading to a more effective use of available light and a sustained extension of the vegetation CO2 uptake season over time.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529849",,,,"10.1101/2022.01.17.476561","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529849","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Acclimation of phenology relieves leaf longevity constraints in deciduous forests",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2022-01-30T21:12:18Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"next-generation Modelling of the biosphere - Including New Data streams and optimality approaches||Forest growth and carbon balance in a warming world: Predicting the growing season lengths of temperate forests","181115||193646","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Eccellenza||Ambizione",,"106690760",,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We estimate a terrestrial CH4 uptake (in kg CH4-C ha−1 yr−1) for montane (−4.28) and lowland forests (−3.52) and a massive CH4 release from swamp forests (non-inundated 2.68; inundated 341). All investigated forest types were a N2O source (except for inundated swamp forest) with 0.93, 1.56, 3.5, and −0.19 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1 for montane, lowland, non-inundated swamp, and inundated swamp forests, respectively.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529375",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-022-27978-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529375","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Low N2O and variable CH4 fluxes from tropical forest soils of the Congo Basin",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-28T04:11:24Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85123192066",,"000744540800008","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While various microorganisms involved in carrying out biogeochemical processes have been identified, little is known about the actual contribution of microbial processes, such as organic P hydrolysis and microbial P turnover, to P cycling. We thus focused on processes driven by microbes and how they affect the size and cycling of organic and inorganic soil P pools along a soil chronosequence in the Chamser Kangri glacier forefield (Western Himalayas). The rapid retreat of the glacier allowed us to study the early stages of soil formation under a cold arid climate. Biological P transformations were studied with the help of the isotopic composition of oxygen (O) in phosphate (δ18OP) coupled to sequential P fractionation performed on soil samples (0-5gcm depth) from four sites of different age spanning 0 to 100-150 years. The P bound to Ca, i.e., 1gM HCl-extractable P, still represented 95g% of the total P stock after approximately 100 years of soil development. Its isotopic composition was similar to the parent material at the most developed site. Primary phosphate minerals, possibly apatite, mostly comprised this pool. The δ18OP of the available P and the NaOH-extractable inorganic P instead differed from that of the parent material, suggesting that these pools underwent biological turnover. The δ18OP of the available P was mostly controlled by the microbial P, suggesting fast exchanges occurred between these two pools possibly fostered by repeated freezing-thawing and drying-rewetting cycles. The release of P from organic P becomes increasingly important with soil age, constituting one-third of the P flux to available P at the oldest site. Accordingly, the lighter isotopic composition of the P bound to Fe and Al oxides at the oldest site indicated that this pool contained phosphate released by organic P mineralization. Compared to previous studies on early pedogenesis under alpine or cold climate, our findings suggest a much slower decrease of the P-bearing primary minerals during the first 100 years of soil development under extreme conditions. However, they provide evidence that, by driving short-term P dynamics, microbes play an important role in controlling the redistribution of primary P into inorganic and organic soil P pools.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528131",,"2199-3971||2199-398X",,"10.5194/soil-8-1-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528131","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Phosphorus dynamics during early soil development in a cold desert: insights from oxygen isotopes in phosphate",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-25T04:14:46Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85123011561",,"000746432700001",,"1","Soil","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These water inputs are often not considered in ecohydrological studies, because water amounts of NRW events are rather small and therefore difficult to measure. Here we present a novel micro-lysimeter (ML) system and its application which allows us to quantify very small water inputs from NRW during rain-free periods with an unprecedented high accuracy of ±0.25 g, which corresponds to ±0.005 mm water input. This is possible with an improved ML design paired with individual ML calibrations in combination with high-frequency measurements at 3.3 Hz and an efficient low-pass filtering to reduce noise level. With a set of ancillary sensors, the ML system furthermore allows differentiation between different types of NRW inputs, i.e. dew, hoar frost, fog, rime, and the combinations among these, but also additional events when condensation on leaves is less probable, such as water vapour adsorption events. In addition, our ML system design allows one to minimize deviations from natural conditions in terms of canopy and soil temperatures, plant growth, and soil moisture. This is found to be a crucial aspect for obtaining realistic NRW measurements in short-statured grasslands. Soil temperatures were higher in the ML compared to the control, and thus further studies should focus on improving the thermal soil regime of ML. Our ML system has proven to be useful for high-accuracy, long-term measurements of NRW on short-statured vegetation-like grasslands. Measurements with the ML system at a field site in Switzerland showed that NRW input occurred frequently, with 127 events over 12 months with a total NRW input of 15.9 mm. Drainage-water flow of the ML was not measured, and therefore the NRW inputs might be conservative estimates. High average monthly NRW inputs were measured during summer months, suggesting a high ecohydrological relevance of NRW inputs for temperate grasslands.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000524466",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-26-91-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524466","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Technical note: High-accuracy weighing micro-lysimeter system for long-term measurements of non-rainfall water inputs to grasslands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-11T07:54:15Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The importance of fog and dew for Swiss grasslands today and in the future (Acronym: IFDewS)","175733","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85123415421",,"000743983700001","Hydrol.

So far, the possibilities of deep learning approaches for this purpose have not been explored adequately, partly due to a lack of publicly available, appropriate datasets. This study presents a workflow based on DeepLab v3+ and on a diverse annotated dataset of 190 RGB (350 x 350 pixels) images. Images of winter wheat plants of 76 different genotypes and developmental stages have been acquired throughout multiple years at high resolution in outdoor conditions using nadir view, encompassing a wide range of imaging conditions. Inconsistencies of human annotators in complex images have been quantified, and metadata information of camera settings has been included. The proposed approach achieves an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.77 and 0.90 for plants and soil, respectively. This outperforms the benchmarked machine learning methods which use Support Vector Classifier and/or Random Forrest. The results show that a small but carefully chosen and annotated set of images can provide a good basis for a powerful segmentation pipeline. Compared to earlier methods based on machine learning, the proposed method achieves better performance on the selected dataset in spite of using a deep learning approach with limited data. Increasing the amount of publicly available data with high human agreement on annotations and further development of deep neural network architectures will provide high potential for robust field-based plant segmentation in the near future.

Improper milking stall dimensions might limit cow comfort, could lead to stress responses during milking and thus could negatively affect cow welfare. A crossover study was conducted in an experimental milking parlor that was converted from a herringbone (HB) to a side-by-side (SBS) parlor. The milking stall dimensions were modified in length and width and for HB also in depth (perpendicular distance between rump rail and breast rail). The stall dimensions applied during the experiments ranged from much smaller than common in European dairy farming to much larger. Treatments were applied for 2 wk per milking parlor type. In each milking parlor type, a total of 30 cows, kept in 2 groups were observed during milking for behavioral and physiological stress responses and for milking performance. In addition, milk cortisol levels and somatic cell counts were measured at the end of the 2-wk period. Outcome variables were selected based on a principal component analysis and analyzed using mixed effects models reflecting the experimental design. The results showed that the first cow per milking batch required more time (on average >40 s) to enter very small HB stalls than to enter small, large and very large stalls (<30 s). Also, cows yielded more milk per milking in very small and very large HB stalls than in the small and large milking stall dimensions [very small: 15.8 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI), 14.2–17.4 kg); small: 14.3 kg (95% CI, 12.8–15.9 kg); large: 14.6 kg (95% CI, 13.1–16.1 kg); very large: 16.1 kg (95% CI, 14.6–17.6 kg)]. The other behavioral, physiological and milk flow parameters as well as udder health were not affected by stall dimensions. For the SBS parlor, effects of milking stall dimensions were not detectable in any of the parameters. Despite the strong avoidance behavior to enter the milking parlor (measured as latency), no acute stress responses were found during milking. However, the study cannot exclude long-term effects of narrow stall dimensions on stress levels and possibly udder health, which should be investigated in future studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522353",,"0022-0302||1525-3198",,"10.3168/jds.2021-20349","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522353","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","cow body dimension||dairy cow||herringbone||milking stall dimension||side-by-side","Effects of small milking stalls on stress responses in dairy cows during milking in group milking parlors",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-26T03:55:37Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85118721731",,"000734332000016","J.

We set up a detailed analytical protocol and applied the method to plant extracts of leaves from species with different photosynthetic pathways (i.e., C3, C4 and CAM). δ2Hne of commercial sugars and starch from different classes and sources, ranging from −157.8 to +6.4‰, were reproducibly analysed with precision between 0.2‰ and 7.7‰.

However, the quest to explain why diverse cropping systems are more productive than monocultures remains a central goal in agricultural science. In a mesocosm experiment, we constructed monocultures, two- and four-species mixtures from eight crop species with or without fertilizer and both in temperate Switzerland and dry, Mediterranean Spain. We measured physical factors and plant traits and related these in structural equation models to selection and complementarity effects to explain seed yield differences between monocultures and mixtures. Increased crop diversity increased seed yield in Switzerland. This positive biodiversity effect was driven to almost the same extent by selection and complementarity effects, which increased with plant height and specific leaf area (SLA), respectively. Also, ecological processes driving seed yield increases from monocultures to mixtures differed from those responsible for seed yield increases through the diversification of mixtures from two to four species. Whereas selection effects were mainly driven by one species, complementarity effects were linked to larger leaf area per unit leaf weight. Seed yield increases due to mixture diversification were driven only by complementarity effects and were not mediated through the measured traits, suggesting that ecological processes beyond those measured in this study were responsible for positive diversity effects on yield beyond two-species mixtures. By understanding the drivers of positive biodiversity-productivity relationships, we can improve our ability to predict species combinations that enhance ecosystem functioning and can promote sustainable agricultural production.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519138",,"1051-0761||1939-5582",,"10.1002/eap.2479","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519138","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","agroecology||biodiversity effects||biodiversity–productivity||complementarity effects||crop mixtures||intercropping||plant traits||selection effects","Using plant traits to understand the contribution of biodiversity effects to annual crop community productivity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-07T09:28:02Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Ecology and evolution in practice: A plant–plant interaction-based approach to the evolution of biodiversity effects on productivity","170645","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,"85120548117",,"000720719600001","Ecol.

While arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are known to improve plant access to soil nutrients, the potential of AMF to mediate nutrient uptake of tree-derived nitrogen (N) by crops from beyond the crops’ rooting zones is unclear. We hypothesized that AMF quantitatively contribute to the crop uptake of tree-derived N. We set up root- and AMF-exclusion and control plots around faidherbia trees (Faidherbia albida) and used the 15N natural abundance technique to determine the magnitude of AMF-mediated uptake of tree-derived N by maize from beyond its rooting zone in smallholder fields. We further tested whether AMF-mediated N uptake decreases with distance from tree. We show that within one cropping season, maize obtained approximately 35 kg ha–1 biologically fixed N from faidherbia. One-third of tree-derived N in maize leaves was attributed to AMF-mediated N uptake from beyond the maize rooting zone and two-thirds to N from tree leaf litter, regardless of distance from tree. As hypothesized, maize grown close (1 m) to faidherbia obtained significantly more tree-derived N than that at farther distances (4 and 5 m).

In this study, Fe (hydr)oxide‐coated filter papers (Fh papers), isotopic exchange kinetics (IEK) and chemical extractions were used to assess the sizes of fast and slowly desorbing P pools in the soils of six long‐term Swedish field experiments. The P desorption data from the Fh‐paper extraction of soil (20 days of continual P removal) were fitted with the Lookman two‐compartment desorption model, which estimates the pools of fast (Q1) and slowly (Q2) desorbing P, and their desorption rates k1 and k2. The amounts of isotope‐exchangeable P (E) were calculated (E1min to E>3 months) and compared with Q1 and Q2. The strongest relationship was found between E1 min and Q1 (r2 = .87, p < .01). There was also an inverse relationship between the IEK parameter n (the rate of exchange) and k1 (r2 = .52, p < .01) and k2 (r2 = .52, p < .01), suggesting that a soil with a high value of n desorbs less P per time unit. The relationships between these results show that they deliver similar information, but both methods are hard to implement in routine analysis. However, Olsen‐extractable P was similar in magnitude to Q1 (P‐Olsen = 1.1 × Q1 + 2.3, r2 = .96), n and k1 were related to P‐Olsen/P‐CaCl2, while k2 was related to P‐oxalate/P‐Olsen. Therefore, these extractions can be used to estimate the sizes and desorption rates of the different P pools, which could be important for assessments of plant availability and leaching.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000451937",,"0266-0032||1475-2743",,"10.1111/sum.12674","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/451937","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Fertiliser||Long term trials||Modelling||Phosphate||Soil analysis||Soil improvement||Soil use and management","Phosphorus desorption and isotope exchange kinetics in agricultural soils",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-19T07:04:15Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85096721307",,"000589920600001","Soil use manage.","1","Soil Use and Management","38","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These span from ecological services like biodiversity and soil stability to economic services like food production or even income from tourism. Land use change, induced through advances in agriculture, many of which are not applicable in these areas, led to widespread land abandonment and the spread of shrubs. The goal of this doctoral thesis was to evaluate in a whole system approach consequences of shrub encroachment on seasonal pastures and assess management options and their impacts on use of this land for meat production. First, a vegetation survey of randomly sampled pasture-shrub gradients showed that the dominant shrub species predicts the shape of species richness response best. Environmental factors believed to be the main predictors until now were gradually eliminated in the process of the analysis. It was established that Alnus viridis (green alder) shrub forests elicit a linear decline in species richness with increasing cover, while Pinus mugo and other shrub species showed a hump-shaped response with the highest species richness at 19% and 42% shrub cover, respectively. It can be assumed that the linear decline is driven by nitrogen leaching into pastures and nutrient rich litter deposition from the A. viridis shrubs. Further, in a grazing experiment with high and low stocking rates, Dexter cattle, Engadine sheep and Pfauen goats equipped with GPS trackers on pastures encroached with A. viridis demonstrated that Engadine sheep were best suited for halting or decreasing shrub cover. Dexter cattle were only doing minor damage to shrubs through trampling and did not penetrate the shrubs as deep as the goats or sheep. Pfauen goats while using the pasture the most even of all species and thus spending more time in the encroached parts of the pasture, mostly browsed and debarked Sorbus aucuparia. This is unfortunate because A. viridis stands tend to inhibit the succession towards forest and S. aucuparia is one of the few tree species being able to establish itself. Thus, while debarking by goats was generally more intense than that by Engadine sheep, browsing preferences of goats are less suited to combat encroachment with A viridis than that of Engadine sheep. Finally, a grazing experiment with Dexter cattle and Engadine sheep but with different levels of A. viridis cover allowed for a detailed study of effects on meat and carcass quality of the two species. There were no negative impacts of high shrub cover on any of the growth, carcass or meat quality measures, showing that meat production is viable even with A. viridis covers above 60%. Again, Engadine sheep turned out to be better suited as conformation scores increased with shrub cover. High yields and crude protein content obtained from exclusion cages showed that the forage of the A. viridis understory seems to be undervalued. Fatty acid profiles found in meat and fat of both species were beneficial to human health with large proportions of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The assumption to find higher amounts of unsaturated fatty acids in meat and fat due to higher intake of 14 tannins with higher shrub cover could not be confirmed. One reason could be the higher biohydrogenation of fatty acids due to the high crude protein content of shrub understory. In conclusion, the thesis showed the need for intervention on pastures encroached with green alder, the suitability of Engadine sheep in counteracting the encroachment and the ability of Dexter cattle and Engadine sheep to utilise enough of the available resources to successfully implement meat production systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000537944",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/537944","en","ETH Zurich",,,,"MANAGEMENT OF SHRUB-ENCROACHED SUBALPINE PASTURES – INTEGRATING CONSERVATION AND MEAT PRODUCTION GOALS USING HARDY SHEEP AND CATTLE BREEDS",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2022-03-20T11:31:15Z","2025-03-20",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"28195",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

NRW, as an additional water source besides rainfall, is expected to become more important for regions suffering from longer and more frequent dry spells, as they are predicted with climate change. This also affects the midlatitudes, where regionally more frequent droughts and dry spells are expected during the warm season. Stable isotopes of water are an efficient and naturally available tracer to investigate hydrological processes. Differences in saturation vapor pressure and diffusivity of different water molecules inducing so-called isotopic fractionation during phase changes can be linked to the key processes in the hydrological cycle. Therefore, stable isotopes can be used for analyzing soil–plant–atmosphere interactions associated with NRW input related to dew and fog. My doctoral thesis aimed to investigate the effect of dew and fog on Swiss grasslands through event-based field campaigns at three temperate grassland sites (CH-CHA, CH-RHB, CH-FRU) and one alpine grassland site (CH-AWS) in 2018–2021. I explored the role of dew and fog in local water cycling, and the effect of dew and fog on plant water status and net ecosystem exchange (NEE). This was done by measuring the isotopic composition (δ18O and δ2H) in all relevant compartments of the hydrological cycle: (1) atmospheric water vapor, (2) NRW droplets on foliage, (3) leaf water, (4) root xylem water, and (5) soil water, combined with (6) eddy-covariance (EC) flux measurements of water vapor, (7) meteorological and (8) physiological measurements. The primary aim of this thesis is to emphasize the ecological importance of dew and fog for temperate and alpine grasslands during summer dry spells. The functions of NRW inputs have been rarely investigated in the past, because rainfall gain tends to exceed annual evapotranspiration loss in these regions during normal years. However, the fact that NRW inputs may play a key role at the event timescale in overcoming a dry spell without irreversible eco-hydrological damage has recently attracted more attention towards this important moisture source for plants in temperate regions. After a general introduction in Chapter 1, I illustrate in Chapter 2, the role of dew and fog in local water cycling through analyzing the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor, and NRW droplets on foliage, complemented by EC and meteorological variables during three dew and fog events in summer 2018 at the CH-CHA site located in the bottom of a broad valley. The environmental conditions relevant for the formation of dew and fog are discussed. Deuterium excess (d = δ2H – 8δ18O) derived from δ18O and δ2H was employed to analyze the main drivers of diel water vapor isotope variability. Furthermore, a simple two-end-member mixing model based on an isotope mass balance was employed to partition the input pathways of NRW droplets on foliage into condensation from ambient water vapor and soil water distillation. The results in Chapter 2 showed that dew droplets on foliage were mixed with 9–42 % of condensate from soil vapor diffusion, and 52–91 % of condensate from atmospheric water vapor. The water vapor d was found to be strongly linked with local surface relative humidity, highlighting the dominant role of local moisture as a source for ambient water vapor in the synoptic context of the studied dry spells with very limited impact from large-scale advection. Chapter 2 underlines the importance of NRW inputs to temperate grasslands during dry spells and reveals the complexity of the local water cycle in such conditions. In Chapter 3, I focused on the complexity of water vapor isotopes in the near-surface atmosphere as affected by the temporal evolution of radiation fog and cloud coverage at the CH-CHA site, Water vapor isotopes were combined with EC and meteorological measurements, as well as COSMO-1 model (Consortium for Small-scale Modeling) output. Five events were selected: (1) event 1 with shallow radiation fog occurring around sunrise; (2) event 2 with the transition of fog from shallow radiation fog to deep radiation fog; (3) event 3 with the transition of fog from shallow radiation fog, and further to deep radiation fog, which persisted after sunrise with a low-level cloud cover aloft; (4) event 4 with midnight fog dissipation due to low-level clouds aloft; and (5) event 5 with low to mid-level frontal cloud coverage but without fog in the context of a cold frontal passage. The results in Chapter 3 showed that shallow radiation fog and deep radiation fog are associated with different characteristic signatures in the variability of the water vapor isotope signals depending on the relative strength of mixing, condensation, and deposition processes. Furthermore, Chapter 3 highlights the importance of cloud coverage on the temporal evolution of the isotope signals of fog events. The results reveal the highly variable isotopic composition in the near-surface atmosphere affected by land–atmosphere interactions relating to radiation fog evolution and cloud coverage. In Chapter 4, I investigated the effect of dew and fog on plants of a temperate grassland at the CH-CHA site through analyzing the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor, NRW droplets on foliage, leaf water, root xylem water, and soil water, complemented by the changes of leaf water potential (LWP) and leaf relative water content (RWC), EC and meteorological measurements. The controls of radiative cooling and leaf wetting on nighttime stomatal opening were investigated. The physical prerequisite of dew and fog formation, with cooler leaf surface allowing for warmer atmospheric water vapor condensing on foliage, controlled the directions of water exchange from the atmosphere to the leaf. Leaf conductance computed from an isotopic mass balance model indicates nighttime stomatal opening, and minor influence of root water flux on leaf conductance during dew and fog formation. The results in Chapter 4 underline the ecological relevance of radiative cooling and leaf wetting for land–atmosphere interactions in natural temperate grasslands which is hardly considered in laboratory experiments, thereby complementing previous chamber experiment studies. In Chapter 5, I concentrated on the effect of dew water on plant water status and gross primary production (GPP) of ecosystem, and in an alpine grassland site CH-AWS during the June 2019 heatwave. GPP partitioned from net ecosystem CO2 flux was analyzed during no-rain period of the heatwave from 25 to 30 June 2019. To allow for natural drought treatment, at the end of the heatwave periods (28–30 June), the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor, NRW droplets on foliage, root xylem water, soil water, leaf water and leaf sugar, as well as leaf water potential (LWP) was measured. A chamber-tracer experiment in a custom-made canopy chamber was carried out on 28–29 June by amending isotopically depleted water on plant surfaces for leaf water and sugar isotopic analysis. The results indicate the suppression of CO2 uptake by heat-drought stress, and the promotion of dew water on CO2 uptake in the early morning hours. The effect of dew water on LWP varied by species and is related to species-specific dependences on soil water. In the chamber-tracer experiment, the leaf water isotopes were found to be depleted by the tracer, which could not be successfully transferred to leaf sugar, suggesting that the effect of dew water on GPP was not directly via influencing photosynthesis, but via indirectly benefiting CO2 uptake of plants suffering from drought and heat stress by suppressing atmospheric evaporative demand. Chapter 5 underlines the effect of dew on GPP of alpine grassland during the June 2019 heatwave. As synthesized in the conclusions in Chapter 6, this doctoral thesis used stable isotopes of water combined with site-based EC and meteorological measurements, regional-scale COSMO-1 model output at km resolution, and event-based physiological measurements to investigate the role of dew and fog in grassland–atmosphere water and carbon exchange. The results of this doctoral thesis contribute to advance our understanding on the complex ecologically relevant processes associated with the occurrences of dew and fog during droughts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000535428",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/535428","en","ETH Zurich",,,"Dew and fog processes||Stable isotopes of water||Land atmosphere interactions||Plant water use||Ecosystem carbon and water fluxes||Ecohydrology||Plant physiology","Effect of dew and fog on Swiss grasslands using stable isotopes of water",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2022-03-04T14:43:21Z","2024-03-10",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The importance of fog and dew for Swiss grasslands today and in the future (Acronym: IFDewS)","175733","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT","28146",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, our knowledge about the processes leading to fog formation, growth and dissipation is still fragmentary, and their adequate representation in numerical weather prediction and climate models remains challenging. Water vapor isotopes are widely used to investigate processes associated with Earth’s water cycle dynamics and can provide process-based insights into fog evolution. However, the mechanisms controlling the water vapor isotope variability in the near-surface atmosphere during radiation fog evolution have hardly been investigated. In this study, we use water vapor isotopes (δ2Hv and dv) combined with meteorological and eddy covariance measurements, as well as vertical profiles from a high-resolution numerical weather prediction model (COSMO-1), to study the processes that influence radiation fog evolution. Variability in surface humidity and isotope signals is strongly tied to the different stages of radiation fog evolution (shallow, transitional, and deep fog stages) and affected by condensation, turbulent entrainment, fog droplet deposition at the surface, and evaporation processes. Strong isotopic fluctuations during radiation fog are linked to fog lifting to stratus clouds during nighttime that lead to fog dissipation at ground level. Our results reveal highly correlated atmospheric specific humidity (qa) and isotope signals during dew formation, whilst during fog periods, δ2Hv and dv show larger temporal variability than qa due to their sensitivity to fog dynamics. Particularly, during fog growth, entrainment of air from the fog-top caused increasing dv, which was otherwise constant during condensation. Furthermore, the δ2Hv variability during the transition into deep fog likely indicated the alternation of condensation-induced decrease and entrainment-induced increase of δ2Hv. Compared to the temporal isotope variability associated with large-scale cold frontal clouds, radiation fog evolution is found to be associated with isotope variability of a similar amplitude.",,,,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/537318","en","Elsevier",,,,"Identifying key stages of radiation fog evolution using water vapor isotopes",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-03-15T15:37:39Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The importance of fog and dew for Swiss grasslands today and in the future (Acronym: IFDewS)","175733","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,,"Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Monitoring P pollution in natural environments using stable isotopes has been difficult because P has only one stable isotope (31P) making the use of P stable isotope tracing not an option. Radioactive P isotopes (32P and 33P) have been used but its drawbacks are the short half-life, health risks and safety procedures required to apply them in agricultural catchments. Phosphorus in organic and inorganic P forms is strongly bonded to oxygen (O), which has three stable isotopes, providing a system to track P cycling in agricultural catchments and environment using the stable isotopes of O in phosphate (δ18O-PO4). In recent years, various studies have indicated that the analysis of the stable isotopic composition of oxygen (O) bound to P (δ18Op) to better understand P cycling in the environment, has become a promising tracer (surrogate) to investigate soil P transformation, plant P uptake and to trace the sources of P from the soil to water bodies and the environment.

However, little is known about the impact of cropping systems (CS) on crop phenology and how this relates to differences in yield.  OBJECTIVES We assessed the applicability of PhenoCams to track crop phenology, how four CS, i.e., organic vs. conventional farming with either intensive or conservation (no/reduced) tillage affect the phenology of a pea-barley mixture and winter wheat, how crop phenology is related to harvest characteristics, e.g., grain yield and total N uptake, and explains CS effects on these characteristics.  METHODS We used time-lapse cameras (PhenoCams) to track vegetation changes in the two crops and extracted the green chromatic coordinate (GCC) to estimate different phenological metrics, i.e., dates with major changes in GCC (PhenoTimePoints), the duration between those (PhenoPhases), and the rate of increasing or decreasing GCC (PhenoSlopes). We assessed how phenological metrics were affected by different CS, and related phenological metrics to harvest characteristics.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS CS significantly affected phenological metrics of both crops, with less pronounced effects in the unfertilized pea-barley mixture compared to the fertilized winter wheat, and stronger effects for early-season than for late-season PhenoTimePoints. For winter wheat, organic compared to conventional farming caused an initial growth lag (up to 7 days) and a shorter duration (approximately 10 days) of the period of stable GCC. Winter wheat in reduced/no-tillage systems showed a tendency of delayed phenology (up to 5 days) compared to intensive tillage. While phenological metrics explained harvest characteristics of winter wheat well, they were almost unrelated to those of pea-barley, most likely because pea-barley yields were similar among CS. For winter wheat, effects of CS on harvest characteristics could be well explained by phenological metrics (max. R2 = 0.9). Thus, we demonstrated that delayed phenology acted as an important factor causing lower yield in organic compared to conventional farming.  SIGNIFICANCE PhenoCams are valuable tool for high-resolution temporal monitoring of crop phenology. As different CS have been proposed as a tool for climate change adaptation, we suggest that the effects of CS on crop phenology need to be considered as they may impact yield via changes in crop phenology, particularly in organic agriculture.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515227",,"0308-521X",,"10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103306","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515227","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Crop phenology||Cropping systems||Organic farming||Conservation tillage||Food production","Using PhenoCams to track crop phenology and explain the effects of different cropping systems on yield",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-15T10:48:59Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85119037645",,"000724279200003",,,"Agricultural Systems","195","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This is especially true when more bioavailable P pools, like soluble reactive P (SRP) in water samples, are extracted and analysed. Brucite precipitation of water samples should be directly done in the field, fresh soil and sediment samples have to be extracted within 7 days (if microbial P is targeted, on the day of sampling), and plant samples have to be extracted within a few hours of sampling or be frozen.

Understanding how these processes interact and the timescales over which they influence tree growth is critical to assess forest vulnerability to climate change. Yet, few studies address this issue, likely because integrated long-term records of both growth and forest management are uncommon. We applied the stochastic antecedent modelling (SAM) framework to annual tree-ring widths from mixed forests to recover the ecological memory of tree growth. We quantified the effects of antecedent temperature and precipitation up to 4 years preceding the year of ring formation and integrated management effects with records of harvesting intensity from historical forest management archives. The SAM approach uncovered important time periods most influential to growth, typically the warmer and drier months or seasons, but variation among species and sites emerged. Silver fir responded primarily to past climate conditions (25–50 months prior to the year of ring formation), while European beech and Scots pine responded mostly to climate conditions during the year of ring formation and the previous year, although these responses varied among sites. Past management and climate interacted in such a way that harvesting promoted growth in young silver fir under wet and warm conditions and in old European beech under drier and cooler conditions. Our study shows that the ecological memory associated with climate legacies and historical forest management is species-specific and context-dependent, suggesting that both aspects are needed to properly evaluate forest functioning under climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493178",,"1432-9840||1435-0629",,"10.1007/s10021-021-00650-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493178","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Abies alba||Ecological memory||Fagus sylvatica||Forest management||Legacy effects||Pinus sylvestris||Spanish Pyrenees||Tree growth","Disentangling the Legacies of Climate and Management on Tree Growth",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-06T04:03:09Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85124278609",,"000664405600001",,"1","Ecosystems","25","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) was originally described as solitarily living forest-dwelling species. In recent decades, it has expanded its range into urban and agricultural areas forming large aggregations in open habitats. Captive environments are thought to mimic some challenges encountered in rapidly changing habitats, however, to date no study has assessed how roe deer social structure changes in captive conditions. In this study, we explored the social network of a small group of captive and unrelated roe deer over the course of a ten-month period using camera traps. We found that the roe deer established a temporally stable and non-random social network with the buck as the most central and dominant individual. In addition, we analysed affiliative interactions, which have not been described in roe deer yet. We found that the affiliation network consisted not only of preferential associations between the buck and other females, but also between females, whereby a young female played a central role. The seasonal changes in roe deer’ gregariousness observed in the wild were also observed in the captive population with an increase in association strength and social interactions in autumn. These results suggest that roe deer kept in a group setting in captivity seem to flexibly adjust their social behaviour; thus, supporting the assumption that roe deer show a high social flexibility that facilitates adaptations to various habitats.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000520162",,"0168-1591||1872-9045",,"10.1016/j.applanim.2021.105526","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/520162","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Roe deer||Social flexibility||Captivity||Social network analysis||Affiliation||Social bonds","Exploring the social network of European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in captivity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-11T04:37:35Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85120450341",,"000788745100016","Appl. anim. behav. sci.",,"Applied Animal Behaviour Science","246","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The vitamin D status of the pregnant female is known to play a role in parturition problems. The present experiment investigated the effect of Solanum glaucophyllum in the diet of sows on farrowing duration and progeny survival and growth. Solanum glaucophyllum was distributed in a feed supplement to gestating sows from one week before farrowing until weaning of the piglets. Control sows received the same feed supplement but without S. glaucophyllum. Sows at an earlier gestation stage and piglets did not receive S. glaucophyllum. From 108 farrowing events and litters, on average 14.3 total born and 12.7 liveborn piglets were observed. Solanum glaucophyllum had no positive effect on the farrowing duration (222 vs. 219 min for experimental vs. control sows, respectively), average piglet expulsion interval (17.2 vs. 17.3 min), piglet vitality at birth, piglets death during nursing (2.03 vs. 1.74 piglets/litter) and piglets average daily gains (both 274 g). The proportion of stillborn piglets was even higher in sows receiving S. glaucophyllum than in control ones. Nevertheless, further studies on hyperprolific sows having no access to direct sunlight and with diets clearly deficient in either vitamin D or calcium are needed to show whether S. glaucophyllum is effective in parturient sows or not.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539511",,"1230-1388",,"10.22358/jafs/146610/2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539511","en","The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, Polish Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol||Cholecalciferol||Parturition||Stillborn||Swine||Vitality","Effect of supplementing sows with Solanum glaucophyllum, a natural source of calcitriol, on farrowing performance, piglet survival and litter performance",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-03-28T05:45:39Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000807699700002","J.

The handling of these technologies requires a specific skill set. Therefore, the question arises of when and how farm managers learn about digital technologies. Aiming to analyse the current situation, the present research investigated the role that digital technologies play in vocational training for future farm managers. Taking the example of farm management information systems (FMIS), the present study also analysed various predictors of adoption, including the effect of training. To investigate these research questions, an online survey among teachers and students of the farm management vocational programme across Switzerland was conducted in the spring of 2021. In total, 150 individuals participated, 41 of whom were teachers. Participants answered questions about the learning content in the farm management programme and their perception of digital technologies in general. Students further reported whether they already had a farm they would be managing in the future and how they perceived FMIS. The results indicate that both teachers and students are convinced that digital technologies play an important role in agriculture and will gain more importance in the future. A substantial part of 43% of the students who participated indicated that they had learned neither about digital technologies during their basic agricultural training nor the subsequent farm management programme. In terms of FMIS, 51% of the student sample indicated that they had never heard about FMIS during their agricultural training. While having learned about FMIS was not a significant predictor for adoption, gender, perceived ease of use, and intention to use more digital technologies in the future significantly predicted the adoption of FMIS. The paper concludes that, to support the adoption of digital technologies and FMIS specifically, training for future farm managers should focus on how to operate an FMIS to increase the perceived ease of use of this technology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522351",,"0743-0167",,"10.1016/j.jrurstud.2021.12.008","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522351","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Farm management information system||Education||Training||Digital technology||Adoption||Environmental concerns","Adoption and perception of farm management information systems by future Swiss farm managers – An online study",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-26T03:55:29Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85121438038",,"000749488500004",,,"Journal of Rural Studies","89","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we outline the construction of an ecosystem for the collaborative development and exchange of image recognition algorithms designed to support the identification of objects. Such an ecosystem will facilitate sharing taxonomic expertise among institutions by offering image datasets that are correctly identified by their in-house taxonomic experts.

In forest ecosystems, trees and microorganisms take up phosphate from the soil solution, which represents a small proportion of total P in soil. To meet P demands, the soil solution must be replenished with P from less labile soil P pools by abiotic (desorption and dissolution) and biotic (solubilization and mineralization) processes. Soil microorganisms contribute to inorganic P solubilization through the release of organic acids and to organic P mineralization through the release of enzymes (e.g. phosphatases). Besides, they synthesize organic P forms. Upon microbial cell death, the microbially synthesized P species return to the soil and can potentially get mineralized or stabilized. Understanding the role of microorganisms in soil P cycling is thus crucial to assess the resilience of forest ecosystems to the increasing imbalance between N and P concentrations. The objective of this thesis was to study the effects of P and N additions on P cycling in the organic (O) soil horizon of temperate beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests developed on silicate bedrock. Although not extensively studied, the O horizon is crucial for microbial processes and beech nutrition, particularly under low P availability. Inputs of P and N were hypothesized to affect microbial activity, microbial community composition and the processes microorganisms modulate. Consequently, the proportions of inorganic and organic P pools and forms were expected to change. The effects of P and N inputs were assumed to depend on the initial nutrient status of the soils, which is defined by the underlying parent material. To gain a holistic view, several experimental (field and incubation experiments) and methodological approaches (chemical extractions, spectroscopy, isotopic tracing, enzyme assays, and molecular fingerprinting) were combined.  In chapter 1, bacterial (16S rRNA), fungal (ITS), and alkaline (phoD) and acid (acpA) phosphatase harbouring bacterial community responses to changes in soil N and P concentrations in the O horizon were investigated. A field experiment with water-soluble N and P additions was conducted at two beech forest sites with contrasting P stocks (low-P site Lüss (LUE) and high-P site Bad-Brückenau (BBR)). In BBR, microbial community structure changed in response to the increase in resin P induced by the P addition. In LUE, microbial community structure changed in response to decreasing P concentrations in several soil P pools induced by the N addition. Furthermore, the increased importance of strategies to access organic P forms in sites with low P supply from minerals was reflected by a higher relative abundance of some dominant phoD harbouring taxa in LUE than in BBR. In chapter 2, the fate of the 33P-labelled P fertilizer was traced into soil P pools and the impact of enzyme-mediated P cycling processes was determined by the level of incorporation of 18O from 18O-enriched water into phosphate in the field. During a dry summer, a field experiment with water-soluble N and P additions was conducted at a guarded beech forest site in Jülich (JUE). Approximately 40% of P fertilizer was recovered in the studied soil layer, the majority being in inorganic P pools independent of N addition. However, the incorporation of 18O into resin P was mainly stimulated by N addition. In chapter 3, the organic soil horizons from two beech forest sites with contrasting P stocks (low-P site LUE and high-P site Vessertal (VES)) were subjected to four nutrient addition treatments (control without addition, P addition, combined carbon (C) and N addition, combined CNP addition) in an incubation experiment of 103 days. Enzyme-mediated P cycling processes were assessed by studying the oxygen (O) incorporation from 18O-enriched water into phosphate. Phosphorus fluxes into sequentially extracted P pools were traced by labelling the added water-soluble P with 33P. Furthermore, the chemical nature of P in NaOH/EDTA extracts was studied with solution 31P NMR spectroscopy. In the LUE O horizon, half of the added P was recovered in the microbial and organic P pools, while 31P NMR revealed increases in the P classes polyphosphates, phosphonates, and phosphodiesters following inorganic P addition. In contrast, in the VES O horizon, added P was mainly recovered in inorganic P pools. Overall, P and N additions were shown to influence the soil microbial communities and the biological processes they modulate, the P fluxes between soil P pools, and the forms of P present in O horizons of temperate beech forests. On the short-term (days) and under unfavourable environmental conditions for microorganisms, abiotic processes dominated the response to inorganic P addition. In contrast, on a longer-term (months), the P stock, as influenced by the underlying parent material, determined the response to P additions. Abiotic processes dominated in high-P and biotic processes in low-P sites. In the O horizons of low-P sites, microorganisms are strongly interacting with soil organic P, as they mineralize and produce organic P forms. These microbial P cycling processes can be negatively affected by N deposition and extreme environmental conditions (e.g. drought or heat waves). In low-P sites, N addition can induce decreases in soil P pool concentrations, which affects microbial communities (Chapter 1), and can reduce microbial organic P synthesis (Chapter 3). Dry conditions can reduce the influence of biotic processes on P fluxes (Chapter 2). High N deposition and extreme environmental conditions thus represent a greater threat to low-P O horizons with high competition for P than to high-P O horizons.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542793",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542793","en","ETH Zurich",,,"PHOSPHORUS CYCLE (GEOCHEMISTRY)||PHOSPHATASES (ENZYMES)||Beech forest||18O||33P||Nitrogen deposition||T-RFLP||Soil||FERTILIZER APPLICATION (PLANT NUTRITION AND FERTILIZATION)||31P NMR||phoD||Field experiment||Soil incubation","Effects of phosphorus and nitrogen inputs on phosphorus cycling in organic soil horizons of beech forests",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2022-04-19T16:39:36Z","2024-04-20",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Impacts of N/P inputs on organic P dynamics and P status in soils and plants along a nutrient gradient","171170","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT","28095",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Their combination might be even more efficient, as they have different modes of action on rumen pathways. This study aimed to screen in vitro the mitigating properties of variously combining tannins with EO in a total of 48 treatments: 12 single additives, 10 mg of EO or 20 mg of tannins/g diet, to establish their basal efficiency; 36 combinations of 20 mg of tannins/g + 10–15 mg of EO. Quebracho (Q) and chestnut (C) tannins defined C, Q and C/Q groups of mixtures with EO blends, formulated with oregano, thyme and clove EO, citrus peel, carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, α-pinene, and bornyl acetate. Supplements were added to a control diet, which was also incubated alone as a basis for comparisons with supplemented treatments, in a total of six runs. Effects on rumen pH, protozoal count, and proportions of individual volatile fatty acids (VFA) were limited. The tannins extracts seemed to cause most of the mitigating effects by suppressing ammonia by up to 31% and methane yield by up to 15%, with the highest reductions obtained with tannins-based supplements. However, this occurred by contemporary affecting the feeding value of the substrate, as indicated by reductions in total VFA and in vitro organic matter digestibility. Overall, six mixtures of C and Q groups were the most efficient and they need further studies to understand the mechanisms of actions and the synergistic effects occurring among compounds.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000578055",,"1594-4077||1828-051X",,"10.1080/1828051x.2022.2130832","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/578055","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Oregano||Thyme||Rumen||Supplement","In vitro screening of the ruminal methane and ammonia mitigating potential of mixtures of either chestnut or quebracho tannins with blends of essential oils as feed additives",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-27T07:53:41Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000875990400001","Ital.J.Anim.Sci.","1","Italian Journal of Animal Science","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Whilst many certifications now include climate resilience in their standards, their ability to deliver this for smallholders remains untested. We take the case of the 2015-16 drought-shock to cocoa production in Ghana to examine whether certification can enhance smallholder climate resilience. We used a novel transdisciplinary methodology combining participatory outcome definition with household surveys, biophysical measurements, satellite data and counterfactual analysis. Utilising our climate resilience framework, we find that certification has a strong effect on the adoption of basic management, e.g. fertilization, but a weak influence on more complex resilience strategies, e.g. agroforest diversification. Beyond certification, we identify strong regional patterns in resilience. These findings suggest that certification has some potential to enhance climate resilience but greater focus on facilitating diversification and adapting to subnational contexts is required for improved effectiveness.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000567746",,"1747-4248||1747-423X",,"10.1080/1747423X.2022.2097455","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/567746","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sustainability certification||resilience||smallholder||food system governance||climate change||rural livelihoods","Can sustainability certification enhance the climate resilience of smallholder farmers?

Here, we report callus induction from different perennial ryegrass genotypes and explants, such as shoot tips, seeds, and anthers, which were transformed with several plasmids for functional genomics. beta-glucuronidase (GUS) histochemical staining showed the LmdsRNAbp promoter sequence was active in stigmas, spikelets, anthers, and leaves. We also transformed calli with plasmids allowing gene silencing and gene knock-out using RNA interference and CRISPR/Cas9, respectively, for which genotypic and phenotypic investigations are ongoing. Using 19 different constructs, 262 transgenic events were regenerated. Moreover, the protocol regenerated a doubled haploid transgenic event from anther-derived calli. This work provides a proof-of-concept method for expanding the range of genotypes amenable to transformation, thus, serving research and breeding initiatives to improve this important grass crop for forage and recreation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000566181",,"2223-7747",,"10.3390/plants11152054","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566181","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)||Agrobacterium-mediated transformation||genome editing||functional genomics||doubled haploid (DH)||tissue culture","Callus Induction from Diverse Explants and Genotypes Enables Robust Transformation of Perennial Ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-25T02:53:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85136944745",,"000839395600001",,"15","Plants","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) could have a great potential, but the comparative protein value to soybean is not well known. The main objective of this study was to facilitate this comparison by using experimental diets clearly limited in calculated supply of sulphurous amino acids and lysine. Fifty laying hens (Lohmann Brown Classic), aged 40 weeks, were fed one of five diets for 7 weeks (n=10). Two diets were based on soybean cake and oil (SS, SS-) as protein and energy sources, and three diets contained partially defatted BSFL meal and fat from two different origins (AA-, AB-, BB-). Different from SS, all other diets were designed to be deficient in methionine and lysine in relation to requirements by >20%. The realised supply with total sulphurous amino acids and lysine was indeed superior with SS even though this diet was analysed to be more deficient in methionine than the BSFL-based diets. Despite the calculated deficiency in limiting amino acids, laying performance of the hens of all groups was similar and ranged between 93 and 97%. Similarly, egg mass, daily feed intake and feed efficiency were not influenced by the BSFL-based diets. The yolks of group BB- were more intensely coloured compared to the others indicating a difference between BSFL origins. Yolks of SS-, but not of the BSFL-based diets, had lower contents of dry matter and ether extract than those of SS. Including BSFL into the diet did not influence the odour of the eggs tested in scrambled form. The results show that soybean-based feeds for laying hens may be completely replaced by BSFL-based feeds and suggest that the recommendations for amino acid supply of laying hens might need revision.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000544586",,"2352-4588",,"10.3920/jiff2021.0178","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/544586","en","Wageningen Academic Publishers","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Hermetia illucens||soybean||layer diet||larval meal||odour","Feeding value of black soldier fly larvae compared to soybean in methionine- and lysine-deficient laying hen diets",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-02T06:46:25Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000852683500005",,"9","Journal of Insects as Food and Feed","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The high rate of biomass accumulation during this secondary succession relies on the availability of essential nutrients, such as nitrogen (N). Nitrogen primarily limits many young secondary forests in the tropics. However, recent studies have shown that forests of the Congo basin are subject to high inputs of atmospheric N deposition, potentially alleviating this N limitation in early succession. Methods To address this hypothesis, we assessed the N status along a successional gradient of secondary forests in the Congo basin. In a set-up of 18 plots implemented along six successional stages, we quantified year-round N deposition, N leaching, N2O emission and the N flux of litterfall and fine root assimilation. Additionally, we determined the N content and C:N stoichiometry for canopy leaves, fine roots, and litter, as well as delta N-15 of canopy leaves. Results We confirmed that these forests receive high amounts of atmospheric N deposition, with an increasing deposition as forest succession proceeds. Additionally, we noted lower C:N ratios, and higher N leaching losses, N2O emission, and foliar delta N-15 in older secondary forest (60 years). In contrast, higher foliar, litter and root C:N ratios, and lower foliar delta N-15, N leaching, and N2O emission in young (< 20 years) secondary forest were observed. Conclusions Altogether, we show that despite high N deposition, this early forest succession still shows conservative N cycling characteristics, which are likely indicating N limitation early on in secondary forest succession. As secondary succession advances, the N cycle gradually becomes more open.",,,,"0032-079X||1573-5036",,"10.1007/s11104-022-05473-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/547283","en","Springer",,,"Congo basin||Nitrogen cycle||Secondary succession||Tropical forests biogeochemistry","Conservative N cycling despite high atmospheric deposition in early successional African tropical lowland forests",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-05-16T07:22:32Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85129532179",,"000791645100002","Plant Soil","1","Plant and Soil","477","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Due to the increasing global demand for more sustainably produced animal protein, there is an intensive search for feeds to replace soybeans. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) appear to have great potential for replacing soybeans in poultry diets. The main objective of this study was to determine if the nutritional value of BSFL is superior to soybeans when feeding organic broilers, since smaller amounts of BSFL could replace the soybean content in the feed, thus saving even more resources.  2. Eighty Hubbard S757, a slow growing organic broiler type, were fattened for 63 days, spending the last 49 days on one of five diets. Two soybean cake- and soybean oil-based diets (SS, SS-) were compared with three diets based on partially defatted BSFL meal and BSFL fat from two origins (AA-, AB-, BB-). Different from diet SS, diets SS-, AA-, AB-, and BB- were designed with approximately 20% less lysine and methionine. Growth (n = 16), metabolisability, body nitrogen retention, carcass, and meat quality (n = 8) were evaluated.  3. Broilers of the insect-based feeding groups, AA- and AB-, grew similarly well compared to those of group SS. They also retained more nitrogen in the body than those fed BB- and SS-. Breast meat yield was higher with AA- and AB- than with BB- and SS-, but still lower than with SS. Dietary variations in physicochemical meat quality were of low practical relevance. Diet BB- resulted in a more yellow skin and meat. The fatty acid profile of the breast meat lipids reflected the high lauric acid proportion of the BSFL lipids, resulting in up to 80 times higher proportions than when feeding the soybean-based diets.  4. The results indicate that high-quality BSFL, depending on their origin, may indeed be superior to soybean protein, but that the meat lipids from BSFL-fed broilers can contain significant amounts of lauric acid, which, from a human nutrition perspective, could have a negative impact on meat quality.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000540614",,"0007-1668||1466-1799||1746-6202",,"10.1080/00071668.2022.2053067","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/540614","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Hermetia illucens||Insect feeding||Soybean replacement||Fatty acid||Lauric acid","Black soldier fly larvae meal and fat as a replacement for soybeans in organic broiler diets: Effects on performance, body N retention, carcass, and meat quality",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-02T13:06:20Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000817273700001","Br.

Compared to human intervention, aerial robots can access tree canopies, but their limited flight time and noise continue to stall widespread application. To address this challenge, we present a perching mechanism which allows small drones to rest on overhanging branches and extend their mission while remaining silent. We developed an origami spine with two folding flaps containing a layer of high-friction material. When the spine engages with a branch, the flaps open and conform to irregular branch surfaces generating sufficient friction to support the weight of a drone. With HEDGEHOG, a drone integrating multiple spines on a protective cage, we demonstrated its application in a controlled indoor as well as in a forest environment. We modelled the perching strategy and measured the effects of materials and geometric parameters on the drone's perching performance. By leveraging interactions with nature, our drone can perch on tree branches with diameters up to 86 mm and inclined up to +-15 and potentially remain in the canopy for extended periods of time to acquire data or monitor returning wildlife.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000517991",,"2377-3766",,"10.1109/lra.2021.3130378","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517991","en","IEEE","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Aerial systems||Mechanism design||Perching drone||Origami technology","HEDGEHOG: Drone Perching on Tree Branches with High-Friction Origami Spines",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-01T12:23:39Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"CYbER - CanopY Exploration Robots","186865","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Eccellenza",,,"85120583482",,"000728137700010",,"1","IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The reduction in fitness components of inbred offspring is the consequence of increased homozygosity of deleterious recessive alleles. The sessile nature of flowering plants (angiosperms) does not allow them to move around like animals to choose a mating partner. Consequently, other mechanisms have evolved within flowering plants to avoid self-pollination or self-related pollination. One widespread mechanism that evolved multiple times independently within flowering plants is self-incompatibility (SI). SI prevents self-fertilization and promotes genetic diversity by allowing a flower's pistil to recognize and reject self or self-related pollen. In most self-incompatible plant species that have been studied, the SI systems are genetically governed by a single multi-allelic locus, the S-locus. The S-locus contains at least two protein-coding genes inherited as a unit. One of the genes is expressed in the pistil (female determinant), whereas the other is expressed in the pollen (male determinant). The interaction on a protein level between male and female determinants is responsible for self/nonself recognition. If both male and female determinants express the same SI specificity, the fertilization will be halted. The outcrossing nature due to a highly effective SI system is a common phenomenon in grasses (Poaceae). Whereas the major cultivated crops of the grass family such as corn, wheat, and rice are self-compatible, many forage grasses, including the most cultivated forage grass species in Western Europe, Lolium perenne L. (perennial ryegrass) are self-incompatible. The SI system hampers the production of homozygous plant material, limiting the number of possible breeding techniques, which is partially responsible for the low genetic gain of fundamental traits such as dry matter yield in forage grasses. The SI system in grasses is of a gametophytic nature and is governed by two independent and multi-allelic loci: S and Z. Similar to a one-locus SI system, the fertilization will be halted if the pollen expresses the same SI specificity at S and Z as the pistil. In L. perenne, the S- and Z-locus have been mapped to chromosomes 1 and 2, but neither of the two loci has been unequivocally characterized at the sequence level. Only at the S-locus in L. perenne could one male determinant (LpSDUF247) be identified as a gene encoding a protein belonging to the protein family DUF247. The identification of the SI determinant and the unraveling of the underlying mechanism responsible for the self/nonself recognition in grasses has the potential to accelerate and optimize breeding procedures in both self-incompatible and self-compatible grass species.  This thesis aims at elucidating the genetic basis governing the SI system in grasses at both loci, S and Z. Further, this thesis objective is to deepen the understanding of the evolution of the two-locus SI system and to unravel its associated physiological and biochemical responses.  Chapter 1 begins with a general introduction focused on the state-of-the-art of the SI system found in grasses. Further, it elaborates on the importance of the grass family, focussing on grasslands where self-incompatible forage grasses play an important role. It also presents other systems that evolved to reduce inbreeding, including a description of three well-documented one-locus SI systems found in flowering plants. Chapter 2 reports a fine-mapping approach of the Z-locus and reanalyzes the already published fine-mapped S-locus of L. perenne. A comparative genomics approach combined with an expression pattern analysis of the S- and Z-locus genes revealed the genes governing the SI system in grasses. Two putative male and one putative female SI determinants at each locus are responsible for the initial self-recognition of the grasses' SI system. At S, the putative male determinants are SDUF247-I and SDUF247-II, whereas the corresponding Z-locus putative male determinants are ZDUF247-I and ZDUF247-II. All four putative male determinants encode for proteins that belong to the same protein family (DUF247) and are predicted to be membrane-bound proteins. The putative female determinants at S and Z have similar gene structure and sequence and are predicted to encode for secreted proteins with no known membership to a protein family. The putative female determinant is referred to as stigma S (sS) at the S-locus and as stigma Z (sZ) at the Z-locus. Chapter 3 reports a protocol for a robust Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of L. perenne. Callus was induced from multiple L. perenne genotypes and explants. The presented transformation protocol allowed for GUS reporter-aided analyses of promoter activities, knock-in, knock-down, and knock-out approaches for the functional studies of genes of interest. The putative male SI determinants, the LpSI-DUF247s (LpSDUF247-I, LpSDUF247-II, LpZDUF247-I, and LpZDUF247-II) were targeted in a hairpin-based RNA interference (RNAi) approach to induce a loss-of-function phenotype. A total of 149 independent hairpin-based RNAi transgenic plants were generated, and the T-DNA integration was confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing.  Chapter 4 reports the phenotyping of the hairpin-based RNAi transgenic plants using a semi-in vivo self-pollination assay. The intended downregulation of the LpSI-DUF247s did not change the compatibility phenotype of the transgenic plants. Further, a GFP-tagged male determinant's successful transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana L. is reported. The fluorescence signal detected suggests a plasma membrane-bound localization in line with the in silico prediction.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000584856",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/584856","en","ETH Zurich",,,"Self-incompatibility (SI)||Poaceae||Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)","Closing in on the genes governing the two locus self-incompatibility system in grasses",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2022-12-05T10:16:54Z","2025-12-05",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"28486",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Thus, exploring farm resilience in various contexts may help understand its prerequisites and build context and scale-specific strategies. Using an adaptive cycle framework through a survey-based assessment of the resilience of farmers in Uganda and Switzerland, we assessed farmers’ resilience across a set of 13 behaviour-based indicators. Farm resilience appeared to be differently constructed in each context. While in Uganda, farmers maintain a high degree of resilience through local community interconnections and agroecological practices, Swiss farmers rely more on institutional support, high access to information and new technologies. Additionally, the self-perceived resilience proved to be strongly and positively correlated to the overall farm resilience, further supporting the potential for more participatory approaches. In a complex field where methodologies are numerous and contexts vary dramatically, flexible yet consistent tools based on participatory approaches may pave the way to context-specific recommendations to stakeholders to strengthen farming system resilience under different context found around the world.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000517288",,"0743-0167",,"10.1016/j.jrurstud.2021.10.020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517288","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Farming system resilience agroecology Switzerland Uganda","Raising up to the climate challenge - Understanding and assessing farmers’ strategies to build their resilience.

While numerous studies have focused on other dimensions of resilience in social–ecological systems, literature on buffer capacity is scanty. Methods Two agroindustrial cropping systems were surveyed based on wheat in Kenya, and soybean in Bolivia. The study was carried out in 2017–2018 using mixed methods; interviews, questionnaires, and observation. Two groups of indicators were used (livelihood capitals and functional and response diversity indicators). The five livelihood capitals, and functional and response diversity indicators (number of crops rotated, landscape heterogeneity, and percentage of arable land under natural vegetation) were used. Resilience indicators were assessed using a five-point Likert scale. Results Both systems had high scores on physical, financial and human capitals, while the functional and response diversity scores were low. Both systems are found to be vulnerable to economic and climate change related shocks hence need to develop more diversified patterns to increase ecological resilience. Conclusion The two cropping systems overall capacity to withstand shocks—particularly related mainly to climate change and variability and economic shocks was extremely low for soybean system and low for wheat. The two systems were found to have low scores of functional and response diversity especially with regard to landscape heterogeneity, crop and breed diversity and percentage of vegetation cover on arable land.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000586911",,,,"10.1186/s40066-022-00356-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/586911","en","Biomed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bufer capacity||Resilience||Agroindustry||Monoculture||Kenya||Bolivia","Can monocultures be resilient?

However, feeding herbage-based diets to ruminants may also have disadvantages, as these diets often contain more dietary crude protein (CP) than ruminal microbes can utilize, leading to higher nitrogen (N) excretion via urine and ammonia (NH3) emissions into the atmosphere. Moreover, herbage-based diets have a higher fiber content than grain-rich diets, increasing the potential for the production of enteric and manure-derived methane (CH4) emissions. Some tannin-rich diets have been demonstrated to be able to simultaneously mitigate N and CH4 emissions in ruminants and may therefore be helpful in systems based on herbage-based diets. The aim of the present doctoral thesis was to evaluate, using a multistage approach, tannin-rich herbage-based diets for reducing NH3 and CH4 emissions from dairy cow systems. The tannin sources used, alone, or in combination, were the tanniferous legume sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) and the extract of Acacia mearnsii (Acacia). The methodological approach consisted, as a first step, of two in vivo experiments with dairy cows to evaluate at the individual animal level the potential of sainfoin and Acacia on either NH3 emissions or CH4 emissions, respectively. The in vivo experiments were combined with two in vitro experiments for measurements of NH3 and CH4 emissions from the excreta collected from the dairy cows. In the second step of the project, the potential of sainfoin and Acacia was quantified on a practical scale in a naturally ventilated housing system.  In the first experiment, six silage-based diets, formulated by combining three silages (ryegrass (12% CP), sainfoin (17% CP), and red clover (20% CP)) with two concentrate types (control and condensed tannin (CT)-rich Acacia extract), were evaluated in an N balance experiment coupled with NH3 volatilization measurements from fresh slurry using a dynamic flux chamber. The experiment involved six dairy cows allocated in a 6 × 6 Latin square. In addition to N partitioning, ruminal volatile fatty acids (VFA) and microbiota were analyzed. Acacia supplementation reduced nutrient intake, digestibility of organic matter (OM) and N, and energy corrected milk (ECM) yield, shifted N excretion from the urine to feces, and reduced ammonia volatilization from slurry across all silage types. Acacia also reduced the ruminal acetate proportion, but did not affect the microbiota. Among the silage types, few significant effects on ruminal VFA and microbiota were found in the ryegrass-based diets compared to sainfoin and clover. The sainfoin-based diet reduced nutrient digestibility compared with the ryegrass- and clover-based diets, and reduced milk protein content. Acacia was effective in mitigating urinary urea N and NH3 volatilization (-37%), but this came at performance costs. In the second experiment, the same six silage-based diets as in the first experiment were evaluated in a 3 × 6 Latin square involving 30 dairy cows. Ruminal CH4 emissions were analyzed with the GreenFeed system, and the CH4 emissions from the slurry were analyzed over a 30-day incubation period using a dynamic chamber (with slurry from experiment 1). Acacia supplementation caused a decrease in dry matter intake (DMI), but only together with ryegrass silage. Although CH4 production was reduced, the CT sources were not effective in reducing CH4 yield (per kg of DMI) or emission intensity (per kg of milk yield). Acacia reduced milk production and DMI when supplemented with ryegrass, and both sainfoin and Acacia reduced milk protein content. Additionally, Acacia supplementation reduced acetate: propionate and affected the ruminal archaea community. The CH4 emissions from slurry were reduced by Acacia only together with the ryegrass-based diet. Feeding sainfoin silage resulted in the lowest CH4 emissions from the slurry. In conclusion, the tannin sources were effective to a certain degree in reducing methanogenesis from the rumen and from the slurry, but the mitigation was associated with performance losses, which reduced their overall usefulness in dairy cow nutrition. The third experiment aimed at quantifying the effects on NH3 and CH4 emissions of tannin-rich diets on a practical scale in a natural ventilated housing. Two herds of 20 lactating cows were allocated in two spatially separated compartments equipped with cubicles and solid floors. A dual tracer ratio method was used to quantify the system emissions (enteric plus slurry derived). In a crossover design, one herd was first fed a grass silage-based diet as a reference diet, while the other herd was first fed in succession a grass silage-based diet, a sainfoin-silage-based diet, a sainfoin-silage-based diet supplemented with 2% of Acacia CT-rich extract, and a grass silage-based diet again. Then, the treatments were exchanged while the cows remained in their respective compartments. Diets were balanced with concentrates to have similar CP content. NH3 emissions were reduced by sainfoin and sainfoin + Acacia by 19.1% and 33.2%, respectively. CH4 production also decreased by 6.5% and 15.0%, respectively. Milk urea was reduced by 41.0% and 48.5%, respectively. In addition, the ECM was lowered by 10.5% and 19.7%, respectively. Both types of emissions were enhanced by air temperature. Overall, the sainfoin-silage-based diet alone and in combination with Acacia was highly effective in reducing NH3 and CH4 emission, but this was associated with a reduction of ECM yield. In conclusion, applying various measuring techniques to quantify the emissions and the multistage approach showed that sainfoin and Acacia mearnsii can reduce the NH3 and CH4 emissions from dairy cow systems. A drawback is that the tannin sources also showed clear detrimental effects on milk production and composition. This raises uncertainty about the value of their implementation in dairy farming. As the tannin sources showed good potential to reduce NH3 and CH4 emissions from the slurry, further research may focus on the effect of adding the tannins directly to the slurry, and to study long-term C and N dynamics in the tannin-rich slurry that might reduce emissions or affect the fertilizing potential of the slurry","application/pfd","10.3929/ethz-b-000587584",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587584","en","ETH Zurich",,,"Dairy cows||Ammonia emission||Methane emission||Ruminal fermentation","Utility of tannin-rich diets to mitigate ammonia and methane emissions from dairy cow systems: A multistage approach at animal and housing level",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2022-12-16T07:36:11Z","2024-12-16",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"28565",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Much of what is known about the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning interactions in grassland is at the level of species richness, i.e., the between-species diversity. However, plant genetic diversity (PGD), i.e., the within- species diversity, also plays a role in these interactions. We recently developed a PGD assessment method that is based on multispecies amplicon sequencing. This method greatly reduces analysis costs, potentially enabling large-scale applications. In this study, we aim to establish this method to monitor PGD changes under experimental field conditions. We set up a field experiment in Langenthal (BE, Switzerland), where 60 meadow plots were oversown. The experimental treatments are combinations of the following variables: time of overseeding (October 2021 or March 2022), seed mixture (Schweizer 431U and 440U), seeding intensity (20 or 40 kg/ha), and management (mowing or grazing). The plots were set up in randomized order in triplicates, including controls without overseeding. Multispecies plant samples were taken before overseeding and at three different times over the course of the growing season of 2022. Those samples will be used for multispecies amplicon sequencing, aiming to assess sequence differentiation at the community- and species-levels among the treatments. The outcome of this work will provide new insights on the efficacy of overseeding and its effect on grassland PGD. This will also help in establishing a cost-effective pipeline for large-scale, multispecies PGD monitoring in grasslands.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588778","en",,,,,"Efficient monitoring of plant genetic diversity in multispecies meadows",,"Conference Poster","Metadata only",,,,"2022-12-22T07:43:35Z",,,,,,,"yes","Zurich-Basel Plant Science Center Symposium 2022","December 7, 2022","Zurich, Switzerland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Next to the nutrient-rich insect biomass used as animal feed, the residues from the process are promising plant fertilizers. Besides a high nutrient content, the residues contain a diverse microbial community and application to soil can potentially promote soil fertility and agricultural production through the introduction of beneficial microbes. This research assessed the application of the residues on plant-associated bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere of a grass-clover mix in a 42-day greenhouse pot study. Potted soil was amended with BSFL residues (BR+) or conventional compost (CC+) produced by Rwandan waste management companies in parallel to residues and compost sterilized (BR-, CC-) by high-energy electron beam (HEEB) as abiotic controls. The fertilizers were applied at a rate of 150 kg N ha−1. Soil bacterial and fungal communities in both fertilizer and soil were assessed by high-throughput sequencing of ribosomal markers at different times after fertilizer application. Additionally, indicators for soil fertility such as basal respiration, plant yield and soil physicochemical properties were analyzed. Results showed that the application of BSFL residues influenced the soil microbial communities, and especially fungi, stronger than CC fertilizers. These effects on the microbial community structure could partly be attributed to a potential introduction of microbes to the soil by BSFL residues (e.g., members of genus Bacillus) since untreated and sterilized BSFL residues promoted different microbial communities. With respect to the abiotic effects, we emphasize a potential driving role of particular classes of organic matter like fiber and chitin. Indeed, especially taxa associated with decomposition of organic matter (e.g., members of the fungal genus Mortierella) were promoted by the application of BSFL residues. Soil fertility with respect to plant yield (+17% increase compared to unamended control) and basal respiration (+16% increase compared to unamended control) tended to be improved with the addition of BSFL residues. Findings underline the versatile opportunities for soil fertility arising from the application of BSFL residues in plant production and point to further research on quantification of the described effects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576130",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2022.994091","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576130","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Residues from black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae rearing influence the plant-associated soil microbiome in the short term",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-10-17T03:08:37Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85139518737",,"000874146800001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02070 - Dep.

Its increasing abundance is caused mainly by anthropogenic sources, such as application of fertilizers in agriculture or emissions from industry. To understand the N2O global budget, its sources and sinks need to be well-described and quantified. In this project, a new method for N2O source appointment was de-veloped that can help with this task. The method is based on analysis of the eight most abundant isotopic mol-ecules of N2O, using quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS). The applicability of the method towards the N2O biogeochemical cycle was demonstrated on a prominent N2O source (bacterial denitrification) and the most important N2O sink (UV photolysis) on samples prepared in laboratory experiments. An extension of the QCLAS method to natural samples can be achieved by hyphenation with a preconcentration technique that increases concentration of the analyte and standardizes the sample matrix. This article provides an overview of currently applied preconcentration techniques in the field of greenhouse-gas analysis and a description of the preconcentration device TREX that will be employed in future projects with the developed QCLAS method.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000572549",,"0009-4293",,"10.2533/chimia.2022.656","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572549","en","Swiss Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Clumped isotopes||Isotope analysis||Laser spectroscopy||Nitrous oxide||Preconcentration","Stable Isotope Analysis of Greenhouse Gases Requires Analyte Preconcentration",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-24T05:09:40Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85141266009",,"000853330600006","Chimia","7-8","Chimia","76","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Monitoring the effects of agricultural land uses is critical to guide sustainable intensification (SI). There are various indicators of sustainable land use (SLU), but conventional methods to quantify their metrics are complex and difficult to deploy for rapid and large-scale assessments. Considering that SLU indicators are dependent on agricultural practices, which can be rapidly identified and quantified, we propose a framework for SLU assessment that includes indirect quantifications of prioritized indicators (crop productivity, soil organic carbon (SOC), acidification, erosion, nutrient balance) using agricultural practices; and a SLU index derived from the integration of these indicators. The application of the framework to a case study, consisting of 1319 farm plots in Tanzania, reveals that SOC and N balance were the main contributors to the SLU gap. Only 2.2% of the plots qualified as being used sustainably. The framework proved to be sensitive to practices commonly used by farmers, thus providing an opportunity to identify practices needed to revert land degradation. Further application of the framework as a decision-support tool can enhance the efficiency of SI investments, by targeting practices which effectively enhance food production and preserve land.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494839",,"1473-5903||1747-762X",,"10.1080/14735903.2021.1926150","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494839","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Acidification||erosion||partial N balance||crop productivity||soil carbon||sustainable land use index","Assessment of sustainable land use: linking land management practices to sustainable land use indicators",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T10:25:50Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85106227584",,"000653057700001",,"3","International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The short-term mineralization kinetics of organic inputs is well-known and accounted for in soil organic matter models. Thus, clearly, the long-term predictions based on these models do not overlook short-term mineralization. We point out that many agronomic practices can significantly contribute to SOC sequestration. If conducted responsibly whilst fully recognising the caveats, SOC sequestration can lead to a win-win situation where agriculture can both contribute to the mitigation of climate change and adapt to it, whilst at the same time delivering other co-benefits such as reduced soil erosion and enhanced biodiversity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000548479",,"1351-0754||1365-2389",,"10.1111/ejss.13242","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/548479","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","carbon sequestration||climate change||mineralization||soil","A well-established fact: Rapid mineralization of organic inputs is an important factor for soil carbon sequestration",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-05-23T02:44:48Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000793651900001","Eur.

Furthermore, increasing temperatures are projected, which could lower water availability due to a higher evapotranspiration. Hence, plants could become more water stressed which in turn could lower productivity and thereby pose a major threat for food security. Grasslands are a widespread agricultural ecosystem in Switzerland, providing the basis for livestock production and provide an important habitat for many animal and plant species. These agricultural ecosystems could suffer greatly from prolonged dry periods. Non-rainfall water (NRW) inputs such as dew, hoar frost, fog, rime and water vapour adsorption could reduce this water stress and thus avoid productivity losses. Hence, the goal of this thesis was to assess the importance of NRW inputs to Swiss grasslands. In Chapter 2, we developed and tested an instrument based on micro-lysimeter (ML) with ancillary sensors to quantify the amount and frequency of NRW inputs of grasslands. The ML had an unprecedented high accuracy of ±0.005 mm, which allowed to measure even small NRW events. Furthermore, the combination between micro-lysimeters and ancillary sensors allowed to differentiate among different types of NRW inputs, i.e., dew, hoar frost, fog, rime, and the combinations thereof, and also potential water vapour adsorption events could be measured. The ML system could simulate natural conditions in terms of canopy temperatures very well. However, soil temperatures in the ML pots were elevated compared to the control. Thus, the ML system provides rather conservative estimates for dew formation on soils. In Chapter 2, we also show the application of the ML system at a field site. Over 12 months, we measured 127 NRW events, which correspond to a NRW input ca. every third day, summing up to 15.9 mm. This suggests a high ecohydrological relevance of NRW inputs for this temperate grassland ecosystem. In Chapter 3, we present NRW measurements at nine sites over a spatial and elevational gradient. On average, the water input of a single NRW event was 0.14±0.10 mm. NRW inputs were highly variable across sites. During a comparison period of ca. two months, the frequency of NRW events ranged between sites from 5 to 29 events. In analogy, the cumulative NRW input ranged from 0.12 to 7 mm. Furthermore, we present measurements of night-time evapotranspiration (ETnight). II Compared to the amounts of average NRW inputs, the average water loss by ETnight (0.24±0.16 mm) was 0.1 mm period-1 higher than the average NRW input. During the comparison period, the average water loss per ETnight period was even double than that of the average NRW input. However, at five out of nine sites, cumulative NRW inputs were higher than cumulative water losses by ETnight periods. NRW inputs and ETnight were highly site dependent, and were not influenced by elevation. Prevailing meteorological conditions at a site were decisive in determining if water is more likely gained or lost during a night. NRW inputs and ETnight, furthermore, were shown to influence net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in the early morning hours after sunrise. After ETnight periods, respiration was on average higher than after NRW events. This suggests a beneficial effect of NRW inputs by lowering respiratory losses. In general, NRW inputs and its counterpart ETnight were found to occur at all sites, suggesting a high relevance for water availability of temperate grassland ecosystems during no-rainfall periods. NRW inputs of dew and radiation fog often occur in combination during clear and calm nights. The input pathways for these events can be (1) a downward pathway, during which atmospheric water vapour is condensing, or (2) an upward pathway, during which soil water is evaporated, and afterwards condensing on the plant surface (termed as distillation). These input pathways have hardly been studied, especially during combined dew and radiation fog events. In Chapter 4, we use stable isotopes of water to investigate the two different input pathways into a temperate grassland ecosystem. Our results showed that distillation contributed 9 %–42 % of the water that condensed on plant surfaces. The moisture transfer during a distillation process can make water available to plants from parts of the soil that otherwise would have remained inaccessible. Our results provide an insight in the highly dynamic water fluxes during NRW inputs and show the ecohydrological relevance of the water redistribution process of distillation. In conclusion, we developed, tested, and deployed a micro-lysimeter system with ancillary sensors that was able to determine different NRW inputs with high accuracy. However, further research should focus to improve such an instrument in terms of simulating natural soil temperature and moisture conditions. NRW inputs were a frequent water input to temperate grassland ecosystems. ETnight resulted in water losses and partly counteracted NRW inputs. The frequency and amount of NRW input events and ETnight periods were highly site dependent. The contribution of distillation in the NRW inputs was found to be up to 42%, depending on atmospheric saturation conditions. In brief, this thesis has shown that NRW inputs can be important ecohydrological factors for temperate grassland ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000549818",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/549818","en","ETH Zurich",,,"Dew and fog processes||Lysimeter||micro-lysimeter||Grassland","Quantification of dew and fog water inputs to temperate grasslands",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2022-05-31T07:59:47Z","2024-05-31",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The importance of fog and dew for Swiss grasslands today and in the future (Acronym: IFDewS)","175733","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT","28382",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In mammals, male reproduction is complex and needs many physiological processes to be successful for reaching sexual maturity, spermatogenesis, sperm maturation, finding and mating a female in heat, and ejaculation of the sperm and the seminal plasma. In the female reproductive tract, the viable and fertile sperm need to be able to reach the place of fertilization. Changes in sperm physiology like hyperactivation, capacitation, and acrosome reaction are required to occur at the correct place and in coordination with the female mate. All those processes are influenced and controlled to a certain extent by genetic variants. Reproduction is as well crucial for livestock farming. Because of the wide-spread use of artificial insemination, records of sperm quality and insemination success are available for many bulls. Linking this phenotypic information with SNP array and whole-genome genotypes enables to quantify heritability and map trait associated loci and candidate causal variants. This thesis investigated genetic variation affecting male fertility traits in Brown Swiss (BSW) dairy cattle using comprehensive semen quality and insemination success records.  Chapter 2 reports on a recessive quantitative trait locus (QTL) for sperm motility, sperm head and tail morphology, and insemination success that is located within a 2.38 Mb segment of extended homozygosity on bovine chromosome 6. Haplotype-based genome-wide association testing between high density level SNP array data (607,511 SNPs) and various semen quality phenotypes from 794 BSW bulls revealed strong association at the QTL region. Homozygosity for the top QTL haplotype reduces insemination success by 0.99 phenotypic standard deviations. Whole-genome sequencing data of 42 BSW bulls showed that a synonymous variant (BTA6:58373887C>T, rs474302732) in WDR19 was compatible with the inheritance of the top haplotype. Although annotated as a synonymous variant, the investigation of transcriptome data revealed that it activates a cryptic splice site leading to the truncation of three evolutionarily conserved amino acids from the protein. WD repeat-containing protein 19 is part of the intraflagellar transport complex that is essential for the formation and physiological function of motile cilia and flagella. Impaired function of this protein is likely causal for the impaired motility and lower fertility in the homozygous state. Surprisingly, the variant has a high frequency of 24% in the BSW population, leading to an expected proportion of 5.8% of all bulls carrying the variant in homozygous state assuming random mating at this locus. Even subtle reductions in sperm quality due to genetic aetiology can reduce insemination success.  Chapter 3 revealed four additional recessive QTL for insemination success in Brown Swiss cattle located on BTA1, 18, 25, and 26. By conditioning the haplotype-based genome wide association study on the known QTL on BTA6, the additional signals were stronger and only then met the significance threshold in case of the QTL on BTA18 and 25. The top associated haplotypes segregate at rather high frequency (0.18, 0.34, 0.09, and 0.26) in the BSW population. They reduce the insemination success by 0.80, 0.28, 1.09, and 0.52 phenotypic standard deviations, for BTA1, BTA18, BTA25, and BTA26, respectively. Possible reasons for the reduced insemination success were investigated using comprehensive sperm quality data. However, only the QTL on BTA1 is associated with an increased proportion of sperm with an abnormal head shape, possibly explaining the mechanism of reduced insemination success in homozygous bulls. We screened for candidate variants using whole-genome sequence variants of 125 bulls with insemination success phenotypes and imputed sequence variants for all bulls with phenotypes. A missense variant in SPATA16 (spermatogenesis associated protein 16) was strongly associated with this QTL. But non-coding variants were stronger associated, suggesting that regulatory variants are more likely to be causal for the QTL variation. None of the other QTL showed an association with any of the analysed sperm quality traits. Coding candidate variants compatible with the top haplotypes were located in ENSBTAG00000006717 (encoding ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 3-like protein) and VWA3A (encoding von Willebrand factor A domain-containing protein 3A) on BTA25 and in ENSBTAG00000019919 (bovine ortholog of CFAP46 encoding cilia and flagella associated protein 46) on BTA26. Likewise, non-coding variants were stronger associated, e.g., a variant downstream SYCE1 (synaptonemal complex central element protein 1) on BTA26. In summary, this chapter showed that recessive QTL explain a considerable fraction of quantitative variation of male fertility in BSW bulls.  Chapter 4 reports on a recessive loss-of-function variant in QRICH2 leading to male infertility in vivo because of immotile sperm with abnormal flagellum and head morphology. In sperm quality data of 70,990 ejaculates from 1343 BS collected at the Swiss artificial insemination centre Swissgenetics, we recognized 7 bulls that never produced ejaculates suitable for artificial inseminations and that had severely impaired semen quality. Among those, one bull presented severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. Whole-genome sequence screening and comparison with 397 fertile bulls revealed a 1-bp deletion in QRICH2 (glutamine rich 2) causing a frameshift and a premature stop codon (BTA19:55436705TC>T, ENSBTAT00000018337.1:c.4929del) that was homozygous only in this infertile bull. Through mapping the 1-bp deletion to a SNP array genotype derived haplotype segregating at a frequency of 5% in the BSW population, we identified a second bull that was homozygous for the 1-bp deletion. Confirming the disorder of the first bull, this bull produced immotile sperm with multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella and head at low sperm concentration. The most frequent abnormality observed in the ejaculates of this bull were shortened, abnormally shaped flagella. Transmission electron microscopy imaging revealed that the ultrastructure of the sperm flagella was affected, often resulting in incomplete microtubule structures and a generally disorganized assembly of the sperm flagella. Bulls homozygous for the 1-bp deletion can now be identified early on through customized genotyping.  This thesis leveraged comprehensive genotype and phenotype data to study the effects of genetic variation on male fertility traits in cattle. Different approaches were applied to detect 5 QTL affecting insemination success and one loss-of-function variant leading to severely disturbed sperm quality. All six QTL/variants are recessively inherited which implies that the fertility is only impaired in homozygous bulls. As heterozygous carrier bulls and females are not affected, such recessive alleles can segregate undetected for a long time in the population. Monitoring known alleles and putting constraints on future inbreeding are possible approaches to counteract the negative effects on male fertility. Reduced sperm quality and a higher proportion of ejaculates per bull not meeting the requirements for artificial insemination can be indicative of a genetic defect and the detected reduction of sperm quality might just be the tip of the iceberg of the overall effect. The effect of QTL reducing sperm quality and insemination success is likely underestimated using records from artificial insemination bulls as ejaculates and bulls not meeting the minimum quality requirements are excluded from breeding. Minimum quality requirements and the exclusion of bulls with low sperm quality are thus as well useful when dealing with genetic aetiology of impaired sperm quality.||Die männliche Fruchtbarkeit ist ein wichtiger Faktor für die erfolgreiche Fortpflanzung, welche für das Überleben einer sich sexuell reproduzierenden Linie oder Spezies nötig ist. Die männliche Fruchtbarkeit bei Säugetieren ist komplex und viele physiologische Prozesse müssen funktionieren, damit die sexuelle Reife erreicht wird, die Spermatogenese und Spermienreifung stattfinden, um ein paarungsbereites weibliches Tier zu finden und sich zu paaren, und zur Ejakulation von Spermien und Seminalplasma. Die lebenden und befruchtungsfähigen Spermien müssen im weiblichen Genitaltrakt den Ort der Befruchtung erreichen können. Veränderungen in der Spermienphysiologie wie Hyperaktivierung, Kapazitation und Akrosomenreaktion müssen am korrekten Ort und in Koordination mit dem weiblichen Partner erfolgen. Diese Prozesse sind zu einem gewissen Grad durch genetische Varianten beeinflusst und kontrolliert. Die männliche Fruchtbarkeit ist auch für die Rinderzucht von entscheidender Bedeutung. Durch den weit verbreiteten Einsatz von künstlicher Besamung werden Spermienqualität und Besamungserfolg für viele Stiere regelmässig erfasst. Die Verknüpfung dieser phänotypischen Information mit genomweiten Genotypen ermöglicht es, die Heritabilität männlicher Fruchtbarkeitsmerkmale zu quantifizieren und merkmals-assoziierte Genomregionen zu kartieren. In dieser Arbeit wurden umfassende Aufzeichnungen über Spermienqualität und Besamungserfolg untersucht, um genetische Varianten aufzuspüren, die mit Fruchtbarkeitsmerkmalen von Brown Swiss (BSW) Stieren in Verbindung stehen.  Kapitel 2 berichtet von einem quantitativen Merkmalslokus (QTL) für Spermienmotilität, Spermienkopf und –schwanzmorphologie und Besamungserfolg, welcher in einem 2.38 Mb langem Segment von ausgedehnter Homozygotie auf dem bovinen Chromosom 6 liegt. Haplotypen-basiertes genomweites Assoziationstesten zwischen SNP array Genotypen in hoher Dichte (607’511 SNPs) und diversen Spermienqualitätsmerkmalen von 794 BSW Stieren offenbarte eine starke Assoziation in der QTL Region. Homozygotie für den top QTL Haplotypen reduziert den Besamungserfolg um 0.99 phänotypische Standardabweichungen. Sequenzierung am ganzen Genom von 42 BSW Stieren zeigte, dass eine synonyme Variante (BTA6:58373887C>T, rs474302732) in WDR19 mit der Vererbung des Tophaplotypen kompatibel war. Obwohl diese Variante als synonym annotiert war, zeigte die Untersuchung von Transkriptomdaten, dass diese eine kryptische Spleissstelle aktiviert, welche das Protein um drei evolutionär konservierte Aminosäuren verkürzt. Das WD-repeat-containing protein 19 ist Teil des intraflagellaren Transportkomplexes, welcher für die Bildung und physiologische Funktion von motilen Zilien und Flagellen essentiell ist. Die beeinträchtigte Funktion dieses Proteins ist wahrscheinlich kausal für die beeinträchtigte Motilität und reduzierte Fruchtbarkeit in homozygotem Zustand. Überraschenderweise hat die Variante mit 24% eine hohe Frequenz in der BSW Population, was dazu führt, dass unter Annahme von zufälliger Paarung 5.8% aller Stiere an diesem Lokus homozygot sind. Sogar subtile Reduktionen in der Spermienqualität genetischen Ursprungs können den Besamungserfolg reduzieren.  Kapitel 3 deckte vier weitere rezessive QTL für den Besamungserfolg bei Brown Swiss Rindern auf BTA1,18, 25 und 26 auf. Durch Konditionierung der haplotypen-basierten genomweiten Assoziationsstudie mit dem bekannten QTL auf BTA6 waren die zusätzlichen Signale stärker und waren im Fall der QTL auf BTA18 und 25 erst signifikant. Die top assoziierten Haplotypen segregieren ebenfalls in hoher Frequenz (0.18, 0.34, 0.09 und 0.26) in der BSW Population. Sie reduzieren den Besamungserfolg um 0.80, 0.28, 1.09 und 0.52 phänotypische Standardabweichungen für BTA1, BTA18, BTA25 und BTA26. Mögliche Gründe für den reduzierten Besamungserfolge wurden in umfassenden Spermienqualitätsdaten untersucht. Allerdings war nur der QTL auf BTA1 mit einem erhöhten Anteil von abnormaler Spermienkopfform assoziiert, was möglicherweise den Mechanismus des reduzierten Besamungserfolgs bei homozygoten Stieren erklärt. Wir filterten nach Kandidatenvarianten in 125 am ganzen Genom sequenzierten Stieren und in imputiertierten Sequenzvarianten aller Stiere mit Phänotypen. Eine missense Variante in SPATA16 (spermatogenesis associated protein 16) war stark mit diesem QTL assoziiert. Allerdings waren nicht-kodierende Varianten stärker assoziiert, was suggeriert, dass regulatorische Varianten eher kausal sind für die QTL Variation. Keiner der anderen QTL zeigte eine Assoziation mit den analysierten Spermienqualitätsmerkmalen. Kodierende Kandidatenvarianten lagen in ENSBTAG00000006717 (kodierend für ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 3-like protein) und VWA3A (kodierend für von Willebrand factor A domain-containing protein 3A) auf BTA25 und in ENSBTAG00000019919 (bovines Ortholog von CFAP46 encoding cilia and flagella associated protein 46) auf BTA26. Nicht-kodierende Varianten waren ebenfalls stärker assoziiert, z.B. eine Variante downstream von SYCE1 (synaptonemal complex central element protein 1) auf BTA26. Rezessive Vererbung spielt eine wichtige Rolle in der Erklärung von quantitativer Variation männlicher Fruchtbarkeit bei BSW Stieren.  Kapitel 4 berichtet von einer rezessiven loss-of-function Variante in QRICH2, welche zu immotilen Spermien mit abnormaler Flagellum- und Kopfmorphologie und männlicher Unfruchtbarkeit in vivo führt. In Spermienqualitätsdaten von 70’990 Ejakulaten von 1343 BSW Stieren der Schweizer Besamungsstation Swissgenetics, fanden wir 7 Stiere, welche nie für die künstliche Besamung geeignete Ejakulate produzierten und bei welchen die Spermienqualität schwer beeinträchtigt war. Unter diesen Stieren zeigte ein Stier eine schwere Oligoasthenoteratozoospermie. Der Vergleich der Sequenzvarianten zwischen dem betroffenen Stier und 397 fruchtbaren Stieren ergab eine 1-bp-Deletion in QRICH2 (glutamine rich 2), welche den Leserahmen verschiebt und dadurch ein vorzeitiges Stoppcodon verursacht (BTA19:55436705TC>T, ENSBTAT00000018337.1:c.4929del). Diese Variante war ausschliesslich in diesem unfruchtbaren Stier im homozygoten Zustand vorhanden. Wir kartierten diese 1-bp-Deletion auf einen SNP array Haplotypen, der mit einer Frequenz von 5% in der BSW Population segregiert, und identifizierten einen zweiten Stier, der für die 1-bp-Deletion homozygot war. Der zweite Stier bestätigte die Fruchtbarkeitsstörung des ersten Stieres, indem er immotile Spermien mit vielfachen morphologischen Anomalien des Spermienflagellums und –kopfes in einer tiefen Konzentration produzierte. Die am häufigsten beobachteten Anomalien waren verkürzte, abnormal geformte Flagellen. Transmissionselektronenmikroskopieaufnahmen enthüllten, dass die Ultrastruktur der Spermienflagellen beeinträchtigt war, was oft zu unvollständiger Struktur der Mikrotubuli und einem generell unorganisierten Aufbau der Spermienflagellen führte. Stiere, die homozygot für die 1-bp-Deletion sind, können nun mit direkten Gentests frühzeitig identifiziert werden.  Diese Arbeit untersuchte die Effekte von genetischer Variation auf männliche Fruchtbarkeitsmerkmale beim Rind mit Hilfe von umfassenden Genotyp- und Phänotypdaten. Verschiedene Ansätze wurden verwendet um 5 QTL, welche den Besamungserfolg beeinträchtigen, und eine loss-of-function Variante, welche zu schwer beeinträchtigter Spermienqualität führt, aufzuspüren. Alle sechs QTL/Varianten werden rezessiv vererbt, was bedeutet, dass die Fruchtbarkeit nur in homozygoten Stieren beeinträchtigt ist. Da heterozygote Stiere und weibliche Tiere nicht betroffen sind, können solche rezessiven Allele lange unentdeckt in der Population segregieren. Die Überwachung von bekannten Allelen und die Begrenzung von zukünftiger Inzucht sind mögliche Ansätze, wie solch negativen Effekten auf die männliche Fruchtbarkeit entgegengewirkt werden kann. Reduzierte Spermienqualität und ein höherer Anteil von Ejakulaten pro Stier, welche die Anforderungen für die künstliche Besamung nicht erfüllen, können auf einen genetischen Defekt hinweisen und die bemerkte Reduktion in der Spermienqualität ist möglicherweise nur die Spitze des Eisbergs des gesamten Effekts. Der Effekt der QTL, welche die Spermienqualität und den Besamungserfolg reduzieren, wird wahrscheinlich unterschätzt, wenn ausschliesslich Daten von Stieren, welche in der künstlichen Besamung eingesetzt werden, herangezogen werden, da Ejakulate und Stiere, welche die Minimalqualitätsanforderungen nicht erfüllen, von der Zucht ausgeschlossen werden. Minimalqualitätsanforderungen und der Ausschluss von Stieren mit tiefer Spermienqualität sind deshalb auch nützlich im Umgang mit beeinträchtigter Spermienqualität durch eine genetische Ursache.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000549843",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/549843","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Genetics||Genome-wide association study||Whole-genome sequencing||SNP array||SNP||Alternative splicing||Deletion||Loss-of-function||Cattle||Bull||Fertility||Male fertility||Bull fertility||Reproduction||Sperm||Sperm motility||Sperm morphology||Sperm quality||Sperm disorder||multiple morphological abnormalities sperm","Genetic Characterization of Impaired Sperm Quality and Insemination Success in Brown Swiss Bulls",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,"2022-05-31T09:13:37Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"28344",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, methods of analysis of δ18Op are still in their preliminary stages and have proven challenging to implement for new practitioners. In order to achieve progress in developing the application of δ18Op signatures as a tracing tool, there is a need to eliminate the methodological challenges involved in accurately determining δ18Op. This protocol article describes the various steps needed to concentrate and isolate orthophosphate in freshwater samples into an adequately pure Ag3PO4 analyte, without isotopic alteration during processing. The protocol compiles the disperse experiences from previous studies, combined with our own experience.

Some Xanthomonas species, such as Xanthomonas hortorum, are mostly known to affect ornamental plants (Latin etymology: hortorum - “garden”). At the start of this thesis, and even though X. hortorum was reported on new hosts and in new countries with an increased frequency, knowledge regarding this species was scarce. Therefore, the general aim of this thesis was to use genomics tools to fill the knowledge gap regarding X. hortorum in terms of genomic diversity, taxonomy, and molecular diagnostics. This thesis revisited the phylogeny of the species, first by formally and validly describing Xanthomonas hydrangeae, the closest phylogenetic relative of X. hortorum, thereby defining the X. hortorum – X. hydrangeae species complex. The phylogeny was updated during the course of the thesis, reflecting the very dynamic nature of bacterial taxonomy and the wide host range of members within this species complex. The genomics information was used to develop seven isothermal diagnostic assays, detecting multilevel taxa within the species complex. The dual applicability of the assays as diagnostics and differentiation tools was also demonstrated. These assays can 1) be used directly on symptomatic plant material for diagnostics and 2) assign the causal agents to the species complex and, if possible, to lower taxonomic levels. The results of the assays revealed that the host range of X. hortorum may be more diverse than described to date. A comparative genomics analysis showed conserved genomic features including the type III secretion system as one of the potentially major pathogenicity factors. The study further suggested that the diversity of members within the species complex is mostly related to their type III effectome and their plasmid content. This thesis also gathered evidence related to the expansive host range of X. hortorum, suggesting that the pathovar concept may not be applicable to the species anymore given the many disadvantages of this infraspecific classification. A move towards a relational genomic classification (e.g., not related to the host) is discussed, and the drawbacks of such classification are put into perspective, notably within the scope of plant health regulation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557807",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557807","en","ETH Zurich",,,"Plant pathology||Molecular diagnostics||Bacterial taxonomy||Genomics diversity||Plant health","The genomic diversity, taxonomy, and molecular diagnostics of the Xanthomonas hortorum – Xanthomonas hydrangeae species complex",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences",,"2022-07-13T08:37:52Z","2025-07-13",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"28321",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using a full factorial N×P fertilization and irrigation experiment, we investigated the leaching of dissolved organic and inorganic P (DOP and DIP) and N (DON and DIN) from organic layers (litter, Oe/Oa horizons) and mineral A horizons at two European beech sites of contrasting P status. Leachates showed the highest DIP and DIN concentrations in summer and lowest in winter, while dissolved organic forms remained rather constant throughout seasons. During the dry and hot summer of 2018, DOC:DOP and DOC:DON ratios in leachates were particularly narrow, suggesting a release of microbial P due to cell lysis by drying and rewetting. This effect was stronger at the low-P site. The estimated annual mean fluxes from the Oe/Oa horizons in the non-fertilized treatment were 60 and 30 mgm-2 yr-1 for dissolved total P and 730 and 650 mgm-2 yr-1 for dissolved total N at the high-P and the low-P site, respectively. Fluxes of P were highest in the organic layers and decreased towards the A horizon likely due to sorption by minerals. Fertilization effects were additive at the high-P but antagonistic at the low-P site: at the high-P site, fertilization with +N, +P, and +N+P increased total P fluxes from the Oe/Oa horizon by +33 %, +51 %, and +75 %, while the respective increases were +198 %, +156 %, and +10 % at the low-P site. The positive N effect on DIP leaching possibly results from a removed N limitation of phosphatase activity at the low-P site. Fluxes of DOP remained unaffected by fertilization. Fluxes of DIN and DON from the Oe/Oa horizons increased upon +N and +N+P but not upon +P fertilization. In conclusion, the estimated P fluxes from the A horizons were comparable in magnitude to reported atmospheric P inputs, suggesting that these systems do not deplete in P due to leaching. However, a particularly high sensitivity of DIP leaching to hotter and drier conditions suggests accelerated P losses under the expected more extreme future climate conditions. Increases in P leaching due to fertilization and drying–rewetting were higher in the low-P system, implying that the low-P system is more susceptible to environmental future changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000540617",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-19-1527-2022","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/540617","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Leaching of inorganic and organic phosphorus and nitrogen in contrasting beech forest soils – seasonal patterns and effects of fertilization",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-04-03T03:05:43Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85127193781",,"000772193400001",,"5","Biogeosciences","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Herbivorous insects were grouped into morphospecies and were identified using molecular and morphological approaches. This dataset reveals the diversity of tree-associated taxa, as it contains 12,721 fungal Amplicon Sequence Variants and 208 herbivorous insect morphospecies, sampled across broad geographic and climatic gradients and for many tree species.

As NH3 emissions are mostly generated by agriculture, a particular conflict of interest exists in areas where agricultural production systems are located nearby sensitive ecosystems, as often is the case in Switzer- land. Therefore, this study aimed at quantifying and evaluating total N inputs to a mire in the Swiss Alpine foothills during 2007–2019, focusing on NH3 dry deposition. Three surface–vegetation–atmosphere transfer models were used to estimate dry deposition of NH3 based on micrometeorological data in combination with monthly passive sampler NH3 concentration measurements. NH3-N dry deposition summed up to 1.5–5.2 kg N ha–1 a–1, while total N loads were 11.5–14.2 kg N ha–1 a–1, well beyond the critical N loads for raised bogs (5–10 kg N ha–1 a–1), and also higher than the lower limits for oligotrophic fens and mountain hay meadows (10 kg N ha–1 a–1). Hence, the mire studied is most likely negatively affected by eutrophication, which could ul- timately lead to biodiversity loss and ecosystem instability. This is particularly remarkable as the monthly NH3 concentrations at the study site (0.4–4.7 μg m–3) are comparatively low for Switzerland.","text/plain||text/csv","10.3929/ethz-b-000545743",,"0167-8809||1873-2305",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/545743","en","ETH Zurich, Institute of Agricultural Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","nitrogen deposition||Ammonium emissions||eutrophication||Mire||Switzerland","Agricultural ammonia dry deposition and total nitrogen deposition to a Swiss mire",,"Dataset","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2022-05-07T15:01:11Z",,"10 years","2032-05-09T05:41:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agric. ecosyst. environ.",,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Each farm was assigned to one class in terms of: (1) main livestock species/category; (2) stocking rate on total farmland; (3) PG share; (4) biogeographic region (BGR). We carried out a Multi Correspondence Analysis (MCA) on the resulting classification, which explained 20% of the variance. The five BGR separated well in the first two MCA dimensions. Alpine farms were predominantly related to beef cattle, with relatively low stocking rates, and intermediate to high PG shares. Atlantic farms also revealed high PG shares, but were linked to higher stocking rates and ‘Mixed bovine’ and ‘Dairy cow’ farming. The dominance of farms without livestock in the Boreal BGR resulted in generally very low stocking rates and showed a limited importance of PG. Continental farms were not clearly related to one specific livestock category or a stocking rate, but consistently showed a share of 10-30% PG per farm.

We conducted an online survey among grassland stakeholders asking them to characterise what they consider as ‘low’, ‘intermediate’ and ‘high’-intensity management in terms of cutting frequency, grazing intensity, and nitrogen fertilization. The answers of the 125 respondents revealed high variability in the thresholds between management intensity levels. Professional background (‘agriculture’ vs ‘ecology/conservation’) explained only a small percentage of the variability.

Based on the evidence in 696 out of 70,456 screened papers, we found that both land use change and intensification decreased multifunctionality. A lower management intensity was associated with benefits for biodiversity, climate regulation and water purification, but had a negative effect on the provision of high-quality animal feed.

We used the framework of the multi-actor research project SUPER-G to assess a selection of experiments recently conducted, completed (since 2011), and planned at 31 European experimental research stations, farms, or networks. We further provide an overview of the ES measured at these experiments. Results show that on average two ES were assessed per experiment.

Regarding the future, stakeholders assumed particularly climate regulation (carbon storage), soil fertility, and groundwater protection to increase in relevance. The majority (84%) of respondents stated that grassland ES are insufficiently recognized by society. Almost three quarters of the stakeholders associated grassland management intensification with a loss of ES multifunctionality, and 60% expected higher ES multifunctionality of organic compared to conventional grassland.

We investigated this by measuring forage yield increase per day and feed value in 25 pairs of organic and non-organic fertilized meadows (mown) and pastures (grazed) in the canton of Solothurn (Switzerland). Lower forage yield and feed value in organic pastures were related to lower phosphorus (P) in topsoil compared to non-organic pastures. However, in meadows, organic management had no effect on forage yield and feed value as soil P was hardly affected by organic management. From these findings we conclude that forage provision does not considerably differ between organic and non-organic meadows, but in pastures we see potential indications of nutrient limitation under organic management.

Global change and human activity can affect communication by increasing fluctuations in species composition and phenology, altering signal profiles and intensity, and introducing noise. So far, most studies on cross-species communication have focused on a few specific species isolated from ecological communities. Scaling up investigations of cross-species communication to the community level is currently hampered by a lack of conceptual and practical methodologies. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary framework based on information theory to investigate mechanisms shaping cross-species communication at the community level. We use plants and insects, the cornerstones of most ecosystems, as a showcase and focus on chemical communication as the key communication channel. We first introduce some basic concepts of information theory, then we illustrate information patterns in plant-insect chemical communication, followed by a further exploration of how to integrate information theory into ecological and evolutionary processes to form testable mechanistic hypotheses.

Even before a mosquito acquires a pathogen by feeding on an infected host, its behaviour can be influenced by indirect effects of infection on host traits, such as the olfactory cues that mediate vector attraction. Following acquisition, pathogens may also exert direct influence on relevant aspects of mosquito behaviour, including feeding frequency and persistence, patterns of activity and movement, and the perception of and response to host-derived cues. There is evidence that both direct and indirect (host-mediated) effects of pathogens on vector behaviour are frequently conducive to transmission.

Forests provide invaluable services and goods for humans, including wood material, prevention of floods, and a clean supply of water and air, while at the same time being home to the majority of terrestrial biodiversity. Thus, to maintain the services furnished by these ecosystems and conserve their diversity, our forest management practices need to be adapted to future climate. However, to better predict how forests will respond to warming and droughts, and determine which management options should be initiated, we urgently need to better understand how extremes climate impact forest functions.  Forests managers started to account for adverse climate-induced changes in forests by, for instance, promoting natural forest dynamics, including favoring mixed-species forests over monocultures. Indeed, recent work highlighted that mixed forests can be more resistant to extreme climatic events such as hot droughts compared to single-species forests. Nevertheless, some studies have also suggested that mixing species does not always improve the resistance of forests to drought, thereby complicating management-oriented decisions. In this context, a starting point is to better understand the underlying mechanisms taking place in mixed vs. monospecific forests, and their impacts on tree functions. As introduced in Chapter 1, this thesis aims to bring insights on the role of tree species interactions during warmer and drier conditions. More specifically, this includes better understanding the dynamics of carbon cycling in forests exposed to hot droughts, and how tree species interactions modulate these impacts.  In Chapter 2, I conducted a field experiment in six sites along a climatic gradient where I quantified the variability of 16 leaf and wood physiological, morphological and anatomical traits in beech trees growing in monocultures and mixtures with either fir or oak trees. My work highlighted that beech-oak mixtures increase soil moisture stress for beech trees, especially when conditions become warmer and drier. On the contrary, beech clearly benefits from being in mixture with a conifer in cooler and wetter sites, thereby showing the strong context-dependency of species mixture effects. To better understand the mechanisms behind physiological responses in beech-oak forests under varying environmental conditions, I then used a fully controlled mesocosm experiment with different climatic and tree species interaction treatments. Beech and oak trees in monocultures and mixtures were exposed to chronic warming and drought acting alone or combined during three years. The impact of these different conditions on the photosynthetic properties of trees is presented in Chapter 3. My work showed that the combined effects of high temperature and drought strongly reduce photosynthetic properties of both species, and that species interactions can mitigate these negative impacts to some extent.  In Chapter 4, I then focused on the phenological cycle and growth dynamics of trees in the same mesocosm experiment as in Chapter 3. My results demonstrated that warming extends the growing season of both species, even in the presence of drought. However, a longer growing season does not compensate for strong reductions in growth and photosynthesis rates during dry periods. Moreover, as already observed in Chapters 2 and 3, species interaction effects are highly context-dependent as oak benefits from the interaction with beech and experiences less dramatic drought impacts in mixtures compared to monocultures, while beech suffers from the same conditions. Overall, my work revealed that hot droughts will severely alter the ability of trees to take up carbon from the atmosphere in central Europe, with major consequences for all the goods and services provided by these ecosystems. However, species interactions are significant modulators of forests carbon dynamics, with impacts that can be as strong as climate extremes. Depending on the species identity and environment, mixing species can be either beneficial or detrimental. Hence, incorporating the role of species interactions in climate change ecology research is of outmost importance to improve forest dynamics predictions and climate-smart management options.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000602023",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/602023","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Impact of warmer and drier climate and tree species interactions on the carbon relations in European forests",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2023-03-07T09:40:39Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"28784",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Nevertheless, these SDIR events could provide the much-needed short-term water supply during dry spells to the terrestrial ecosystem, especially trees. An efficient use of these SDIR events could provide the trees with a buffer to withstand longer drought conditions, which will become more frequent and intense with the upcoming changes in climate.  This study aims to quantify the tree water use (TWU) recovery in terms of sapflow recovery following SDIR events across multiple global forest sites (35 sites) spanning over 250 site-years. SDIR events are identified probabilistically as rainfall periods (1-2 days with daily rainfall < 75th percentile) occurring after an extreme dry spell (> 90th percentile of dry spell duration) during the growing season. For each tree, TWU recovery (RTWU) is estimated based on percentage increase in sapflow rate after the SDIR event (Sa), compared to before the SDIR event (Sb), and standardized by seasonal maximum sapflow (Smax). The inter-species RTWU and intra-species RTWU relationship with tree allometry (height and diameter) is used to explain the recovery rates. The main hypothesis tested here is that the intra-species differences in RTWU are positively related to tree size due to better root development in larger trees. The understanding of RTWU provides a new axis to understand and predict tree recovery after drought events.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000595540",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu22-10902","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/595540","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Tree water-use recovery after drought-intermittent rainfall events",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2023-01-29T06:36:17Z",,,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2022","May 23-27, 2022","Vienna, Austria",,,,"Forest Vulnerability to Extreme and Repeated Climatic Stress (FEVER)","ETH-27 19-1","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The main damage from its infection occurs late in the season, right before ripening of the seeds, and has a negative impact on forage quality and seed yield. A detailed understanding of the inheritance of plant resistance against stem rust is needed to enable efficient breeding strategies. In this study, a nested association mapping (NAM) population, which combines the advantage of linkage analysis and association mapping, was established. The NAM population consists of 728 F2 plants. These were derived by crossing an individual genotype of the cultivar Rabiosa (common founder) with 23 diverse founders, followed by open pollination among their respective F1 progeny. Genotyping data were produced by using genotyping-by-sequencing, resulting in more than 70,000 SNP markers. For the common founder Rabiosa, a high quality genome assembly was recently published. The NAM population was phenotyped for stem rust resistance at seed harvest in three different environments with two replicates each. Stem rust infection was scored on a 1 to 9 scale, where 1 indicates the absence of symptoms (resistant) and 9 indicates strong infection (susceptible). A genome-wide association analysis identified two major QTL for stem rust resistance on chromosomes 6 and 7. Blocks of linkage disequilibrium, which are significantly associated to stem rust resistance, were used to narrow down the region of potential causal genes linked to the corresponding peak. Eight possible candidate genes were identified on chromosome 6 and ten on chromosome 7. Together with the knowledge of known stem rust resistance genes, we identified receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinases on both chromosomes as putative resistance genes against stem rust in L. multiflorum. Although further investigations are needed to find the causal gene, markers to efficiently introgress stem rust resistance can directly be provided to the breeders.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588780","en",,,,,"Identification of QTL conferring resistance to stem rust in Italian ryegrass",,"Conference Poster","Metadata only",,,,"2022-12-22T07:50:11Z",,,,,,,"yes","Zurich-Basel Plant Science Center Symposium 2022","December 7, 2022","Zurch, Switzerland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Following this insight we present a robot with multimodal mobility obtained by combining aerial and tethered locomotion. After the robot is deployed at the top of the tree, it can descend with the tether and maneuver around leaves and branches with its thrusters. The tether increases robustness and safety and allows for resting as well as emergency retrieval of the system. The aerial locomotion grants the system the ability to move in a conical 3D space constrained by the tether. We modelled the static system and validated the impact of design parameters on it. A simple control architecture for teleoperation is discussed and its performance is analyzed. The proposed multimodal mobility is demonstrated in preliminary outdoor tests, which show how our robot can move within the canopy while continuously monitoring the environment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000581729","978-1-6654-7927-1||978-1-6654-7928-8",,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/581729||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/603869","10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981121","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/606025","en","IEEE","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Multimodal aerial-tethered robot for tree canopy exploration",,"Conference Paper","Open access","2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)",,,"2022-11-18T16:30:31Z",,,,,,,"yes","35th IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2022)","October 23–27, 2022","Kyoto, Japan",,,,"CYbER - CanopY Exploration Robots","186865","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Eccellenza",,,,,"000908368204041",,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The agricultural revolution led to the development of a large number of crops in various regions of the world, which still form the basis of modern-day food production systems. This chapter presents examples for the use of biodiversity to increase ecosystem services in managed ecosystems, in particular the sustainable provision of production services in agro-and forestry ecosystems. Breeding for high monoculture yields in crops has focused on particular varieties that combine all traits necessary for high performance under particular environmental conditions and management regimes. Opportunities to manage species diversity in agro-ecosystems arise both in grasslands and with arable crops. There are many ways in which farm-scale diversity may provide ecological and economic benefits. Forest ecosystem services are not as heavily linked to a single product as, for example, crop production in agricultural systems, but monoculture plantations are also very common in silviculture.",,,"978-1-78945-072-9||978-1-119-90291-1",,,"10.1002/9781119902911.ch10","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/606983","en","ISTE",,,,"Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in Managed Ecosystems",,"Book Chapter","Metadata only","The Ecological and Societal Consequences of Biodiversity Loss",,,"2023-04-07T06:03:07Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85151177892",,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the number of inventoried accessions is usually large, and preservation and detailed description of all of them is laborious and expensive. Core collections represent a compact form to preserve the genetic diversity of crop species. In addition to mere preservation, a detailed description of the phenotypic diversity within core collections allows identifying accession-specific traits to be used efficiently in breeding programs. Replication of core collections at different locations can unravel genotype-by-environment interactions, which are relevant to understanding how climatic differences affect relevant traits. Especially in apple breeding, where genetic diversity in the few commercially successful varieties is low, broadening the genetic base is a crucial element to adapt cultivars to new challenges such as environmental changes or the occurrence of new pests and diseases as well as abiotic stress. To describe Swiss apple genetic resources and support apple breeding, the Swiss Federal Office for Agriculture initiated the establishment of a Swiss Apple Core Collection. It consists of 330 old Swiss apple varieties and accessions as well as 27 references. Three trees per genotype were planted at three climatically different locations each. The description of a broad range of traits, with the help of the latest phenotyping technologies, made it possible to identify variations for traits that will become important in the future. Priority was given to a detailed description of fruit quality features and tree performance. In a second project phase, attention will be given to diseases and abiotic stress tolerance. Combining high quality phenotypic information with genome-wide sequence data will allow identifying loci of interest and developing molecular markers associated with these. Including these traits in apple breeding programs will further enhance the development of diverse, resilient apple cultivars.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589591","en","International Society for Horticultural Science",,,"Automated phenotyping||Genetic resources||Core collection||Repository","Exploiting the Swiss Apple Core Collection for breeding tomorrow's apple cultivars   ",,"Conference Paper","Metadata only","XXXI International Horticultural Congress (IHC2022): International Symposium on Conservation and Sustainable Use of Horticultural Genetic Resources",,,"2023-01-02T09:19:31Z",,,,,,,"yes","31st International Horticultural Congress (IHC 2022)","August 14-20, 2022","Angers, France",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acta Horticulturae",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Improving the management of crops by means of smart farming can help to intensify plant production in a sustainable way. Commonly, smart farming encompasses techniques of data acquisition, data analysis and evaluation, and precision application technologies. Remote sensing plays a key role in smart farming. Remote sensing applications help to monitor crops in the field. Another way to monitor plants and their environment is to utilize environmental sensors. Calibrated plant growth models or phytopathology models can interpret this data. Together, these tools can support the decision making of a farmer. The proof of concept of the benefits of these technologies has long been accomplished. And yet, in Switzerland the adaption rate of these technologies is still relatively low. Key aspects that are relevant to determine the economic benefit of investing in smart farming technologies, are e.g. the field size and the field heterogeneity. This thesis therefore focused on the monitoring of crop traits with smart farming methods, such as remote sensing applications or measurements of environmental variables. A particular emphasis was placed on the effects of scales. The first study presented in Chapter 2 reveals the importance of various environmental variables for crop growth on different temporal scales. The study was conducted in Oensingen and aimed to investigate the relationship between highly resolved in-situ growth measurements of winter wheat, meteorological variables and CO2 fluxes. Leaf growth was taken as a proxy for vegetative biomass development because it can be assessed non-destructively. The study shows that on an hourly scale, gross primary production (GPP) and shortwave radiation explain most of the variance of leaf elongation rate (LER), however on a daily scale, air temperature is the main driver. The strongest immediate relationship was found between LER and GPP and incoming shortwave radiation; these are variables that are determining photosynthesis. In principle, LER also shows the same diurnal patterns as air temperature and soil temperature, however air and soil temperature were lagging behind LER. Multivariate growth models show that combinations with GPP or incoming shortwave radiation and air temperature perform best. These results indicate that short term growth processes in young wheat leaves in the field are mainly controlled by incoming shortwave radiation, while the magnitude of growth is controlled by temperature. These results could be used to update crop growth models. The results further stress the dependence of plants on their environment and importance of measuring environmental variables. The second study, which is shown in Chapter 3, aims to investigate the effect of the selected spatial scales on apparent field heterogeneity. This study was conducted in Eschikon, Switzerland, and encompassed data captured from 17 fields, with multiple crop species monitored at 36 dates across two seasons. In the study, very high spatial resolution orthomosaics of 0.5 m ground sampling distance (GSD) were compared to spatially lower-resolved orthomosaics of 5 m, 10 m and 20 m GSD. The findings experimentally confirm the theoretical assumption that management of fields with higher heterogeneity would profit from higher spatially resolved information. Furthermore, the study reveals that compared to the baseline, relative differences by means of the relative root mean square error varies between 0.0 and 0.3 for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and between 0.0 and 0.23 for the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) with decreasing GSD. The effects are most pronounced in maize and least pronounced in low intensity grassland. The study further shows how in-field heterogeneity varies throughout the season, across vegetation indices and crop species, which emphasises the importance of monitoring schemes that are adapted for each species. The third study, which is presented in Chapter 4, aims to analyse how remote sensing data can be used as a decision support tool in agriculture. Therefore, the study follows the full workflow from remote sensing data to application maps that are in line with farm traffic orientation. The study focusses on analysing the impact of spatial scale and classification algorithms on the subsequent fertilizer recommendation. The study reveals that the precision of fertilisation recommendation decreases from 1.8% at 0.5 m in the best case to 12.8% root-mean-square error (RMSE) at 20 m GSD in the worst case compared to the baseline of 0.5 m GSD with no aggregation into classes. In general, classifications with four classes provide higher accuracy than classifications with three classes. When the actual management width of 11.7 to 14.7 m is taken into account, the RMSE is comparable between the different GSDs. Moreover, the effects are more pronounced in the beginning of the season (March, April), when most management measures for wheat happen, compared to the situation in May. Finally, the analysis shows that up to 40% of the field area cannot be covered by a GSD of 20 m due to the comparably small field sizes, which highlights the need for higher resolution data even in situations in which a decreased GSD has a minor effect. Overall, these studies show the importance of monitoring schemes that are adapted to local circumstances. While satellite imagery might be beneficial in terms of lower cost, a lower resolved image might miss out a large part of the field. Considering the recent advances of alternative farming methods such as strip cropping or spot farming, only highly resolved images can offer the information that is needed to monitor these crops cultivated in such cropping systems adequately.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000602455",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/602455","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","smart farming||Remote sensing||UAV||field heterogeneity||Nitrogen management","From Leaf to Landscape Spatio-temporal monitoring of crops to improve decision support",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,"2023-03-09T13:48:27Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"28954",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
