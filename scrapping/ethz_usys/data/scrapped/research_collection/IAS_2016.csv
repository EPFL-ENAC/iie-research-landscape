Short‐term biodiversity experiments have documented positive effects of plant species richness on many ecosystem functions, and longer‐term studies indicate, for some ecosystem functions, that biodiversity effects can become stronger over time. Theoretically, a biodiversity effect can strengthen over time by an increasing performance of high‐diversity communities, by a decreasing performance of low‐diversity communities, or a combination of both processes. Which of these two mechanisms prevail, and whether the increase in the biodiversity effect over time is a general property of many functions remains currently unclear. These questions are an important knowledge gap as a continuing decline in the performance of low‐diversity communities would indicate an ecosystem‐service debt resulting from delayed effects of species loss on ecosystem functioning. Conversely, an increased performance of high‐diversity communities over time would indicate that the benefits of biodiversity are generally underestimated in short‐term studies. Analyzing 50 ecosystem variables over 11 years in the world's largest grassland biodiversity experiment, we show that overall plant diversity effects strengthened over time. Strengthening biodiversity effects were independent of the considered compartment (above‐ or belowground), organizational level (ecosystem variables associated with the abiotic habitat, primary producers, or higher trophic levels such as herbivores and pollinators), and variable type (measurements of pools or rates). We found evidence that biodiversity effects strengthened because of both a progressive decrease in functioning in species‐poor and a progressive increase in functioning in species‐rich communities. Our findings provide evidence that negative feedback effects at low biodiversity are as important for biodiversity effects as complementarity among species at high biodiversity. Finally, our results indicate that a current loss of species will result in a future impairment of ecosystem functioning, potentially decades beyond the moment of species extinction.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000123919",,"2150-8925",,"10.1002/ecs2.1619","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/123919","en","ESA","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Biodiversity ecosystem functioning (BEF)||Ecosystem processes||Grassland||Mechanism||Plant productivity||Plant species richness||Temporal effects||Trophic interactions","Effects of biodiversity strengthen over time as ecosystem functioning declines at low and increases at high biodiversity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T17:11:18Z",,"pub:186358",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654f4318b740732","006204548",,,"000390136700016",,"12","Ecosphere","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

DH techniques in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), an important forage species, have advanced to a sufficiently successful and promising stage to merit an exploration of what their further developments may bring. The exploitation of both in vitro and in vivo haploid and DH methods to (1) purge deleterious alleles from germplasm intended for breeding; (2) develop mapping populations for genetic and genomic studies; (3) simplify haplotype mapping; (4) fix transgenes and mutations for functional gene validation and molecular breeding; and (5) hybrid cultivar development are discussed.

Inadvertent matings between unnoticed carriers of deleterious alleles may result in the manifestation of fatal phenotypes in their progeny. Breeding consultants and farmers reported on Vorderwald calves with a congenital skin disease. The clinical findings in affected calves were compatible with epidermolysis bullosa. Results  Pedigree analysis indicated autosomal recessive inheritance of epidermolysis bullosa in Vorderwald cattle. We genotyped two diseased and 41 healthy animals at 41,436 single nucleotide polymorphisms and performed whole-genome haplotype-based association testing, which allowed us to map the locus responsible for the skin disease to the distal end of bovine chromosome 22 (P = 8.0 × 10−14). The analysis of whole-genome re-sequencing data of one diseased calf, three obligate mutation carriers and 1682 healthy animals from various bovine breeds revealed a nonsense mutation (rs876174537, p.Arg1588X) in the COL7A1 gene that segregates with the disease. The same mutation was previously detected in three calves with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa from the Rotes Höhenvieh cattle breed. We show that diseased animals from Vorderwald and Rotes Höhenvieh cattle are identical by descent for an 8.72 Mb haplotype encompassing rs876174537 indicating they inherited the deleterious allele from a recent common ancestor.  Conclusions Autosomal recessive epidermolysis bullosa in Vorderwald and Rotes Höhenvieh cattle is caused by a nonsense mutation in the COL7A1 gene. Our findings demonstrate that deleterious alleles may segregate across cattle populations without apparent admixture. The identification of the causal mutation now enables the reliable detection of carrier animals. Genome-based mating strategies can avoid inadvertent matings of carrier animals thereby preventing the birth of homozygous calves that suffer from a painful skin disease.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000161492",,"1471-2156",,"10.1186/s12863-016-0458-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/161492","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Epidermolysis bullosa||COL7A1||Nonsense mutation||Skin disease||Autosomal recessive","A nonsense mutation in the COL7A1 gene causes epidermolysis bullosa in Vorderwald cattle",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2017-06-19T12:13:04Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"BMC Genet",,"BMC Genetics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Interviews with farmers, policymakers and members of civil society organizations about the challenges and opportunities that agroforestry faces, as well as field visits to agroforestry projects revealed a wide range of agroforestry initiatives in Bolivia that provide ecosystem services, food and income to local families. All interviewees attributed a high potential to agroforestry, for example, to promote biodiversity, water conservation, food sovereignty and adaptation to climate change impacts. However, agroforestry initiatives lacked support because government incentives were channelled to cattle rearing and large-scale monocultures rather than diversified farming systems, and agroforestry initiatives tended to be small and isolated. A nationwide policy is needed which is coordinated with civil society organizations and individual farmers and strategically and efficiently supports agroforestry initiatives – especially in the most vulnerable first years of establishment – through extension services and access to materials, markets, knowledge and financial resources.",,,,"0376-8929||1469-4387",,"10.1017/s0376892916000138","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516355","en","Cambridge University Press",,,"agroforestry||Bolivia||diversified farming systems||food security||food sovereignty","Agroforestry in Bolivia: opportunities and challenges in the context of food security and food sovereignty",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-11-22T13:26:41Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Environ.

Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies, Acer pseudoplatanus and Fraxinus excelsior) respond in their water relations to summer soil drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer soil drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree water status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lägeren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil moisture. This implies that the water supply of all tree species was affected by declining soil moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the soil. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining soil moisture with the strongest decline in P. abies (92%), followed by F. sylvatica (53%) and A. pseudoplatanus (48%). F. excelsior did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining soil moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their water status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120415",,"0829-318X||1758-4469",,"10.1093/treephys/tpw062","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120415","en","Oxford University Press","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T12:31:57Z",,"pub:182485",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654b44cdcd38079","000035127","85014272005",,"000393273800007",,"12","Tree Physiology","36","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Consequently, there is a threat of land abandonment. Additionally, due to lower productivity of mountain farms, their products often bear a higher environmental burden than those from other areas. An optimal division of labor between mountain farms and farms in more favorable regions based on comparative advantages could help maintain attractive landscapes and reduce environmental impacts of agricultural production. An established Swiss contract rearing system, in which dairy farms from the agriculturally favorable lowlands collaborate with heifer rearing farms in the mountains, represents a promising approach for such a division of labor. In this system, the intensive phase of dairy production is performed in the lowlands, while the less intensive phase is performed in the mountains. Here, we analyzed a sample of 16 farms to compare the contract rearing system to a situation in which both, mountain and lowland farms produce milk and rear their own restocking animals. We performed a life cycle assessment to quantify environmental impacts of the dairy production systems, assessing environmental impacts both per kg of milk and per hectare of agricultural area. This assessment was supplemented with analysis of the workload of the farms, since increased work efficiency is one reason that farmers engage in contract rearing. Workload was calculated with a workload budgeting tool. We found that collaboration reduced environmental impacts as well as the workload per kg of milk. Collaboration had no effect on environmental impacts per hectare of agricultural area or the workload on lowland farms, while on mountain farms the environmental impacts and workload were reduced. In particular, reduction in environmental impacts of mountain farms is expected to foster the high nature value of this farmland and the provisioning of important ecosystem services. This case study of a contract rearing system thus illustrates how collaboration based on comparative advantages can benefit both environmental impacts of agricultural products and the high nature value of agriculturally less favorable farmland.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000122260",,"2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2016.00074","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/122260","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Collaboration between mountain and lowland farms decreases environmental impacts of dairy production: The Case of Swiss contract rearing",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T15:30:10Z",,"pub:184546",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654d74efa359183","010261182",,,,"Front.

They can be used for various applications in-cluding the construction of high-density genetic maps, analysis of genetic variability, genome-wide association studies, and map-based cloning. Here we report on transcriptome sequencing in the two forage grasses, meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), and identification of various classes of SNPs. Using the Orthology Guided Assembly (OGA) strategy, we assembled and annotated a total of 18,952 and 19,036 transcripts for Italian ryegrass and meadow fescue, respectively. In addition, we used transcriptome sequence data of perennial ryegrass (L. perenne L.) from a previous study to identify 16,613 transcripts shared across all three species. Large numbers of intraspecific SNPs were identified in all three species: 248,000 in meadow fescue, 715,000 in Italian ryegrass, and 529,000 in perennial ryegrass. Moreover, we identified almost 25,000 interspecific SNPs located in 5343 genes that can dis-tinguish meadow fescue from Italian ryegrass and 15,000 SNPs located in 3976 genes that discriminate meadow fescue from both Lolium species. All identified SNPs were positioned in silico on the seven linkage groups (LGs) of L. perenne using the Geno-meZipper approach. With the identification and positioning of interspecific SNPs, our study provides a valuable resource for the grass research and breeding community and will enable detailed characterization of genomic composition and gene expression analysis in prospective Festuca x Lolium hybrids.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000119874",,"1940-3372",,"10.3835/plantgenome2016.02.0017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/119874","en","Crop Science Society of America","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Orthology Guided Transcriptome Assembly of Italian Ryegrass and Meadow Fescue for Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Discovery",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T11:36:03Z",,"pub:181920",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654aa11e9020400",,"84990923810",,"000393120000011",,"3","The Plant Genome","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Thus, farmers developed a collaborative dairy production scheme, where they take advantage of the specific environment of the two regions. In this contract rearing system, the young stock is reared on a mountain farm and the more intensive milk production is performed in the lowlands. This system is an example for the principle of comparative advantage, where each region focuses on the activity where it has the lowest opportunity costs. We hypothesised that the same principle can also be applied in an environmental context, to reduce the environmental impacts of agricultural production. Based on the life cycle assessments of average dairy farms, we could show that the absolute environmental impact was higher on mountain farms for both, the production of one heifer for restocking and the production of one kg milk. However, they had a comparative environmental advantage for rearing, as the young stock was better suitable for their local conditions than the dairy cows. Therefore, milk produced in collaboration between lowland and mountain farms had an up to 4.5% lower non-renewable energy demand and used up to 30.9% less potassium and up to 5.2% less phosphorus resources compared to non-collaborative production. Further consequences of collaboration were a reduced workload and income on mountain farms, and a potentially increased income on lowland farms. We conclude that the principle of comparative environmental advantage is appropriate as a screening method to identify suitable production systems for less favoured regions. However, the total effects of a possible division of labour among regions need to be assessed in a more holistic way where possible side-effects on other aspects are considered as well.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000119514",,"0308-521X",,"10.1016/j.agsy.2016.07.015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/119514","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Comparative advantage||Life cycle assessment||System expansion||Regional optimisation||Contract rearing||Less favoured areas","Environmental and socioeconomic benefits of a division of labour between lowland and mountain farms in milk production systems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T11:06:25Z",,"pub:181529",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654a2bb4b783375","000000318","84981173446",,"000386983400001",,,"Agricultural Systems","149","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Carbon isotope composition of above- and belowground carbon fluxes at natural abundance provides a methodological approach to study the coupling between photosynthesis and soil respiration (SR) under conditions (such as drought) that influence photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination. In turn, the direct supply of root respiration with recent photoassimilates will impact on the carbon isotope composition of soil-respired CO2. We independently measured shoot and soil CO2 fluxes of beech saplings (Fagus sylvatica L.) and their respective δ13C continuously with laser spectroscopy at natural abundance. We quantified the speed of recovery of drought stressed trees after re-watering and traced photosynthetic carbon isotope signal in the carbon isotope composition of soil-respired CO2. Stomatal conductance responded strongly to the moderate drought (-65%), induced by reduced soil moisture content as well as increased vapor pressure deficit. Simultaneously, carbon isotope discrimination decreased by 8‰, which in turn caused a significant increase in δ13C of recent metabolites (1.5–2.5‰) and in δ13C of SR (1–1.5‰). Generally, shoot and soil CO2 fluxes and their δ13C were in alignment during drought and subsequent stress release, clearly demonstrating a permanent dependence of root respiration on recently fixed photoassimilates, rather than on older reserves. After re-watering, the drought signal persisted longer in δ13C of the water soluble fraction that integrates multiple metabolites (soluble sugars, amino acids, organic acids) than in the neutral fraction which represents most recently assimilated sugars or in the δ13C of SR. Nevertheless, full recovery of all aboveground physiological variables was reached within 4 days – and within 7 days for SR – indicating high resilience of (young) beech against moderate drought.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000123148",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2016.01710","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/123148","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Carbon allocation||Soil CO2 efflux||Drought||Beech (Fagus sylvatica)||Laser spectroscopy||Resilience","Strong Coupling of Shoot Assimilation and Soil Respiration during Drought and Recovery Periods in Beech As Indicated by Natural Abundance delta C-13 Measurements",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T16:45:38Z",,"pub:185524",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654e76ba9413211","010181292",,,"000387911500001","Front.

The resulting species loss can have severe effects on ecosystem functions and services, thereby increasing ecosystem vulnerability to climate change. We explored whether land-use intensification (i.e. fertilization intensity), plant diversity and other potentially confounding environmental factors may be significantly related to water use (i.e. drought stress) of grassland plants. Drought stress was assessed using δ13C abundances in aboveground plant biomass of 150 grassland plots across a gradient of land-use intensity. Under water shortage, plants are forced to increasingly take up the heavier 13C due to closing stomata leading to an enrichment of 13C in biomass. Plants were sampled at the community level and for single species, which belong to three different functional groups (one grass, one herb, two legumes).  Results show that plant diversity was significantly related to the δ13C signal in community, grass and legume biomass indicating that drought stress was lower under higher diversity, although this relation was not significant for the herb species under study. Fertilization, in turn, mostly increased drought stress as indicated by more positive δ13C values. This effect was mostly indirect by decreasing plant diversity. In line with these results, we found similar patterns in the δ13C signal of the organic matter in the topsoil, indicating a long history of these processes.  Our study provided strong indication for a positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship with reduced drought stress at higher plant diversity. However, it also underlined a negative reinforcing situation: as land-use intensification decreases plant diversity in grasslands, this might subsequently increases drought sensitivity. Vice-versa, enhancing plant diversity in species-poor agricultural grasslands may moderate negative effects of future climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507533",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.05.008","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507533","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning||Global change||Climate change||Plant functional groups||Carbon isotopes||δ13C","Plant diversity moderates drought stress in grasslands: Implications from a large real-world study on 13C natural abundances",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-09-29T07:57:09Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sci.

Alto Beni, located in the Bolivian Yungas at the interface between two altitudinal zones, is a critical area in this respect. Unsustainable land use practices are leading to soil erosion, shallow landslides, as well as forest and biodiversity loss. Settlers from the Altiplano see themselves confronted with an ecosystem that does not support the agricultural systems they were once used to. Soil degradation and government incentives have promoted migration further into the rainforest, creating pressure on local indigenous groups and biodiversity. The best-suited land use system for the fragile soils and ecosystems in Alto Beni is diversified agroforestry, which is often combined with a cash crop such as cocoa or coffee. Many farmers practising such a system have organic certification and achieve a premium price for their cash crops. However, cocoa farmers in Alto Beni face many challenges. Prolonged droughts, heavy rains, floods, increased heat, and plant diseases are mentioned most by cocoa farmers. In this study we compile results from a research project on the resilience of organic and nonorganic cocoa farms to external risk factors and discuss them in the context of climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and migration. Cocoa farmers who belong to a cooperative and had organic certification achieved higher resilience indicators than others, because they tended to cultivate cocoa in diversified agroforestry systems. Cooperatives fostered agroforestry through capacity-building, knowledge exchange, extension services, and awareness-raising. They also provided social insurances and enhanced mutual support among their members. Challenges within established cooperatives such as lack of technical support to farmers and knowledge exchange within and between organizations can hamper resilience building. Finally, the inclusion of new farmers into cocoa cooperatives seems critical to reducing outmigration and the reproduction of non-sustainable practices in other fragile areas. Multiple challenges remain to be addressed, however, including the enhancement of solidarity economy networks and their extension sectors other than export crops.",,,"978-3-319-33878-1||978-3-319-33880-4",,,"10.1007/978-3-319-33880-4_14","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507663","en","Springer",,,"Farm resilience||Climate change||Bolivia-Organic certification-Cocoa","Building Farm Resilience in a Changing Climate: Challenges, Potentials, and Ways Forward for Smallholder Cocoa Production in Bolivia",,"Book Chapter","Metadata only","Identifying Emerging Issues in Disaster Risk Reduction, Migration, Climate Change and Sustainable Development",,"2021-09-29T16:10:01Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study we compared organic and conventional wheat cropping systems with respect to DTPA (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid)-extractable Zn as a proxy for plant available Zn, yield, and grain Zn concentration. We analyzed soil and wheat grain samples from 30 organic and 30 conventional farms in Madhya Pradesh (central India), and conducted farmer interviews to elucidate sociological and management variables. Total and DTPA-extractable soil Zn concentrations and grain yield (3400 kg ha-1) did not differ between the two farming systems, but with 32 and 28 mg kg-1 respectively, grain Zn concentrations were higher on organic than conventional farms (t = -2.2, p = 0.03). Furthermore, multiple linear regression analyses revealed that (a) total soil zinc and sulfur concentrations were the best predictors of DTPA-extractable soil Zn, (b) Olsen phosphate taken as a proxy for available soil phosphorus, exchangeable soil potassium, harvest date, training of farmers in nutrient management, and soil silt content were the best predictors of yield, and (c) yield, Olsen phosphate, grain nitrogen, farmyard manure availability, and the type of cropping system were the best predictors of grain Zn concentration. Results suggested that organic wheat contained more Zn despite same yield level due to higher nutrient efficiency. Higher nutrient efficiency was also seen in organic wheat for P, N and S. The study thus suggests that appropriate farm management can lead to competitive yield and improved Zn concentration in wheat grains on organic farms.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120165",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0160729","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120165","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Organic wheat farming improves grain zinc concentration",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T12:07:02Z",,"pub:182218",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654af7eaa691908","006206116","84984804809",,"000381577000028","PLoS ONE","8","PLoS ONE","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02070 - Dep.

Applied to soil, biochar can sequester carbon and have beneficial effects on nitrogen (N) cycling, thereby enhancing crop yields and reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. There is little understanding of the underlying mechanisms, but many experiments indicated increased yields and manifold changes in N transformation, suggesting an increase in N use efficiency. Biochar's effects can be positive in extensively managed tropical agriculture, however less is known about its use in temperate soils with intensive fertilisation. We tested the effect of slow pyrolysis wood chip biochar on N use efficiency, crop yields and N2O emissions in a lysimeter system with two soil types (sandy loamy Cambisol and silty loamy Luvisol) in a winter wheat—cover crop—sorghum rotation. 15N-labelled ammonium nitrate fertiliser (170 kg N ha−1 in 3 doses, 10% 15N) was applied to the first crop to monitor its fate in three ecosystem components (plants, soil, leachate). Green rye was sown as cover crop to keep the first year's fertiliser N for the second year's sorghum crop (fertilised with 110 kg N ha−1 in two doses and natural abundance 15N). We observed no effects of biochar on N fertiliser use efficiency, yield or N uptake for any crop. Biochar reduced leaching by 43 ± 19% but only towards the end of the experiment with leaching losses being generally low. For both soils N2O emissions were reduced by 15 ± 4% with biochar compared to the control treatments. Our results indicate that application of the chosen biochar induces environmental benefits in terms of N2O emission and N leaching but does not substantially affect the overall N cycle and hence crop performance in the analyzed temperate crop rotation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120003",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/11/8/084013","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120003","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Biochar||Nitrous oxide||Nitrogen use efficiency||Leaching||Lysimer||15N tracer","N use efficiencies and N2O emissions in two contrasting, biochar amended soils under winter wheat-cover crop-sorghum rotation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T11:55:59Z",,"pub:182052",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654ac3a64287456","005253059","84985910567",,"000381828300014","Environ.

Several traits differentiate the two pools, like cold tolerance, early vigor, and flowering time. A comparative investigation of their genomic architecture relevant for quantitative trait expression has not been reported so far. Understanding the genomic differences between germplasm pools may contribute to a better understanding of the complementarity in heterotic patterns exploited in hybrid breeding and of mechanisms involved in adaptation to different environments. Results  We perform whole-genome screens for signatures of selection specific to temperate Dent and Flint maize by comparing high-density genotyping data of 70 American and European Dent and 66 European Flint inbred lines. We find 2.2 % and 1.4 % of the genes are under selective pressure, respectively, and identify candidate genes associated with agronomic traits known to differ between the two pools. Taking flowering time as an example for the differentiation between Dent and Flint, we investigate candidate genes involved in the flowering network by phenotypic analyses in a Dent–Flint introgression library and find that the Flint haplotypes of the candidates promote earlier flowering. Within the flowering network, the majority of Flint candidates are associated with endogenous pathways in contrast to Dent candidate genes, which are mainly involved in response to environmental factors like light and photoperiod. The diversity patterns of the candidates in a unique panel of more than 900 individuals from 38 European landraces indicate a major contribution of landraces from France, Germany, and Spain to the candidate gene diversity of the Flint elite lines.  Conclusions  In this study, we report the investigation of pool-specific differences between temperate Dent and Flint on a genome-wide scale. The identified candidate genes represent a promising source for the functional investigation of pool-specific haplotypes in different genetic backgrounds and for the evaluation of their potential for future crop improvement like the adaptation to specific environments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000161496",,"1474-760X",,"10.1186/s13059-016-1009-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/161496","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Maize||Flint||Dent||Selection||Population genetics||Genomics||Genome-wide screen||Landraces","A comprehensive study of the genomic differentiation between temperate Dent and Flint maize",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2017-06-19T12:13:57Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000379319600001","Genome Biol",,"Genome Biology","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although within-site heterogeneity in soil and plant properties has been shown to be relevant for plant community stability, spatiotemporal variability in these factors is still understudied in temperate grasslands. Our study aimed to detect if soil characteristics and plant diversity could explain observed small-scale spatial and temporal variability in grassland productivity, biomass nutrient concentrations, and nutrient limitation. Therefore, we sampled 360 plots of 20 cm × 20 cm each at six consecutive dates in an unfertilized grassland in Southern Germany. Nutrient limitation was estimated using nutrient ratios in plant biomass. Absolute values of, and spatial variability in, productivity, biomass nutrient concentrations, and nutrient limitation were strongly associated with sampling date. In April, spatial heterogeneity was high and most plots showed phosphorous deficiency, while later in the season nitrogen was the major limiting nutrient. Additionally, a small significant positive association between plant diversity and biomass phosphorus concentrations was observed, but should be tested in more detail. We discuss how low biological activity e.g., of soil microbial organisms might have influenced observed heterogeneity of plant nutrition in early spring in combination with reduced active acquisition of soil resources by plants. These early-season conditions are particularly relevant for future studies as they differ substantially from more thoroughly studied later season conditions. Our study underlines the importance of considering small spatial scales and temporal variability to better elucidate mechanisms of ecosystem functioning and plant community assembly.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507535",,"1385-0237||1573-5052",,"10.1007/s11258-016-0607-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507535","en","Springer","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Nitrogen||Phosphorus||Biodiversity exploratories project||Nutrient concentrations||Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning||Growth limitation","Temporal and small-scale spatial variation in grassland productivity, biomass quality, and nutrient limitation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-09-29T07:59:23Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Plant ecol.","7","Plant Ecology","217","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using life cycle assessment (LCA), we tested different allocation procedures and system expansion through avoided burden to compare the environmental impact of milk from either specialised or mixed dairy production systems (product level). In a second approach, we compared the whole farming systems with additive system expansion, where the functional unit comprised milk, live animals sold for meat production and crops (farm level). On the product level, milk from the mixed farm had higher non-renewable cumulative energy demand, terrestrial ecotoxicity and phosphorus use, but lower aquatic eutrophication N, independently of the allocation method. For all other impact categories, differences were not significant. On the farm level, results were partially reversed. The mixed system had a lower energy demand and potassium use, while phosphorus use was higher. All other differences were not significant on farm level. The different rankings on product and on farm level were caused by the way manure was attributed to the farming activities. In order to avoid allocation, manure management was sub-divided into storage and application processes. Storage was attributed to dairy production, application to dairy production only if applied on grassland or feed crops, and to cash crops when applied to produce these crops. Manure applied on cash crop areas was thus out of the scope of the product approach, and mineral fertilisers that could be saved within the cash crop production were thus not attributed to milk production. We conclude that only system expansion was able to cope with the complexity of mixed farming systems in LCA. Based on our results with modelled farms, mixed farming showed the potential to reduce environmental impacts compared to specialised farming. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of the system regarding farm management and interactions between cropping and livestock activities, only an assessment with real farm data could reveal the actual benefits of such systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000114032",,"0959-6526",,"10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.02.074","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114032","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Allocation||Crop||Life cycle assessment||Livestock||Multifunctionality||System expansion","Comparing the environmental performance of mixed and specialised dairy farms: The role of the system level analysed",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T02:26:51Z",,"pub:175802",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365435ac7dd57808","000889004","84959535704",,"000375816800008","J Cleaner Prod.",,"Journal of Cleaner Production","124","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Six ruminally cannulated multiparous dairy cows (milk yield = 40 kg/d; 36 d in milk) were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design. All animals were fed basal diets containing 20% pelleted SF (223 g of CT/kg of dry matter), BT (30.3 g of CT/kg of dry matter), or alfalfa (AL) and concentrate to meet their predicted nutrient requirements. Each experimental period consisted of a 21-d adaptation period in a tiestall, followed by a 7-d collection period in metabolic crates, where feces and urine were collected quantitatively. During the 7-d period, milk yield was recorded daily and milk samples were taken at each milking. Blood, ruminal fluid, and papillae were sampled on d 2 and 5. The relative abundance of selected bacterial strains in ruminal fluid and the gene expression of transporter genes in the papillae were determined with quantitative PCR. Total volatile fatty acids and the abundance of the cellulolytic bacteria Prevotella spp. and Ruminococcus flavefaciens decreased with SF compared with AL. The relative gene expression of the monocarboxylate transporter 1 was increased with BT compared with AL and SF. Total yields of milk, milk fat, and milk protein were similar among treatments. The proportion of 18:3n-3 in milk fat was greater and those of 22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 were lower with SF than with BT. The contents of urea N in blood (2.71, 3.45, and 3.90 mmol/L for SF, AL, and BT, respectively), milk (79.8, 100.1, and 110.9 mg/kg for SF, AL, and BT, respectively), and urine were lower with SF than with AL and BT, and a trend toward a lower ruminal ammonia content occurred with SF compared with BT. Intake and excretion of N with milk were similar among treatments, but urine N was lower with SF than with AL. The N excretion to N intake relation showed a shift in a part of urine N (17.5, 20.8, and 19.5% for SF, AL, and BT, respectively) to fecal N (45.2, 41.3, and 38.5% for SF, AL, and BT respectively) with SF compared with AL and BT. In conclusion, SF and BT differed in their effects on fermentation and milk fatty acid profile and SF also showed potential to decrease metabolic and environmental loads. The main reason for the different efficiency was likely a higher CT content of SF compared with BT.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000116804",,"0022-0302||1525-3198",,"10.3168/jds.2015-9911","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/116804","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","condensed tannin||ruminal fermentation||microbial community||nitrogen loss","Effect of exchanging Onobrychis viciifolia and Lotus corniculatus for Medicago sativa on ruminal fermentation and nitrogen turnover in dairy cows",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T06:34:08Z",,"pub:178691",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936546ca2ffb38820","000032582","84961154800",,"000375876600028","J.

The latter has been hypothesized to result from different respiratory substrates and decarboxylation reactions in various metabolic pathways, which are poorly understood so far. To provide a better insight into the underlying metabolic processes of δ13CLEDR, we fed position-specific 13C-labeled malate and pyruvate via the xylem stream to leaves of species with high and low δ13CLEDR values (Halimium halimifolium and Oxalis triangularis, respectively). During respective label application, we determined label-derived leaf 13CO2 respiration using laser spectroscopy and the 13C allocation to metabolic fractions during light–dark transitions. Our results clearly show that both carboxyl groups (C-1 and C-4 position) of malate similarly influence respiration and metabolic fractions in both species, indicating possible isotope randomization of the carboxyl groups of malate by the fumarase reaction. While C-2 position of pyruvate was only weakly respired, the species-specific difference in natural δ13CLEDR patterns were best reflected by the 13CO2 respiration patterns of the C-1 position of pyruvate. Furthermore, 13C label from malate and pyruvate were mainly allocated to amino and organic acid fractions in both species and only little to sugar and lipid fractions. In summary, our results suggest that respiration of both carboxyl groups of malate (via fumarase) by tricarboxylic acid cycle reactions or by NAD-malic enzyme influences δ13CLEDR. The latter supplies the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction, which in turn determines natural δ13CLEDR pattern by releasing the C-1 position of pyruvate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117304",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2016.00739","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117304","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Fumarase||LEDR||Malic acid||Malic enzyme||Pyruvic acid||Respiration||Stable carbon isotopes||TCA cycle","Metabolic fate of the carboxyl groups of malate and pyruvate and their influence δ13C on C of leaf-respired CO2 during light enhanced dark respiration",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T07:22:15Z",,"pub:179206",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654764e1d255784","010181292","84973161053",,"000376955300001","Front.

A scan for homozygous haplotype deficiency revealed a short segment on bovine chromosome 19 (Braunvieh haplotype 2, BH2) that was associated with high juvenile mortality in Braunvieh cattle. However, the molecular genetic underpinnings and the pathophysiology of BH2 remain to be elucidated.  Results The frequency of BH2 was 6.5 % in 8,446 Braunvieh animals from the national bovine genome databases. Both perinatal and juvenile mortality of BH2 homozygous calves were higher than the average in Braunvieh cattle resulting in a depletion of BH2 homozygous adult animals (P = 9.3x10−12). The analysis of whole-genome sequence data from 54 Braunvieh animals uncovered a missense mutation in TUBD1 (rs383232842, p.H210R) that was compatible with recessive inheritance of BH2. The availability of sequence data of 236 animals from diverse bovine populations revealed that the missense mutation also segregated at a low frequency (1.7 %) in the Fleckvieh breed. A validation study in 37,314 Fleckvieh animals confirmed high juvenile mortality of homozygous calves (P = 2.2x10−15). Our findings show that the putative disease allele is located on an ancestral haplotype that segregates in Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle. To unravel the pathophysiology of BH2, six homozygous animals were examined at the animal clinic. Clinical and pathological findings revealed that homozygous calves suffered from chronic airway disease possibly resulting from defective cilia in the respiratory tract.  Conclusions A missense mutation in TUBD1 is associated with high perinatal and juvenile mortality in Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle. The mutation is located on a common haplotype likely originating from an ancient ancestor of Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that deleterious alleles may segregate across closed cattle breeds without recent admixture. Homozygous calves suffer from chronic airway disease resulting in poor growth performance and high juvenile mortality. The respiratory manifestations resemble key features of diseases resulting from impaired function of airway cilia.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000161499",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-016-2742-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/161499","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Braunvieh haplotype 2||Juvenile mortality||Tubulin delta 1||Primary ciliary dyskinesia||Ciliopathy||Chronic respiratory disease","A missense mutation in TUBD1 is associated with high juvenile mortality in Braunvieh and Fleckvieh cattle",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2017-06-19T12:14:55Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"BMC Genomics",,"BMC Genomics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Sustainability assessment is framed within a post-normal science perspective, advocating the integration of public deliberation and scientific research. The assessment spans 39 local, intermediate and global supply chain case studies across different commodities and countries. Assessment criteria cover environmental, economic, social, health and ethical sustainability dimensions. A closer view of the food system demonstrates a highly dynamic local–global continuum where actors, while adapting to a changing environment, establish multiple relations and animate several chain configurations. The evidence suggests caution when comparing “local” and “global” chains, especially when using the outcomes of the comparison in decision-making. Supply chains are analytical constructs that necessarily—and arbitrarily—are confined by system boundaries, isolating a set of elements from an interconnected whole. Even consolidated approaches, such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), assess only a part of sustainability attributes, and the interpretation may be controversial. Many sustainability attributes are not yet measurable and “hard” methodologies need to be complemented by “soft” methodologies which are at least able to identify critical issues and trade-offs. Aware of these limitations, our research shows that comparing local and global chains, with the necessary caution, can help overcome a priori positions that so far have characterized the debate between “localists” and “globalists”. At firm level, comparison between “local” and “global” chains could be useful to identify best practices, benchmarks, critical points, and errors to avoid. As sustainability is not a status to achieve, but a never-ending process, comparison and deliberation can be the basis of a “reflexive governance” of food chains.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117066",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su8050449","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117066","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Local||Global||Food supply chain||Sustainability||Assessment||Reflexive governance||Post-normal science","Are local food chains more sustainable than global food chains?

However, evidence is still lacking to fully support this assumption. The goal of this study is to compare local and global food chains in five dimensions of sustainability (environmental, economic, social, ethical and health), covering all stages of the chain. In particular, four cheese supply chains are compared in detail: a local (L’Etivaz) and global (Le Gruyère) case in Switzerland and a local (Single Gloucester) and global (Cheddar) case in the UK. A multi-dimensional perspective is adopted to compare their sustainability performance. Eight attributes of performance (affordability, creation and distribution of added value, information and communication, consumer behaviour, resource use, biodiversity, nutrition and animal welfare) are used to frame the comparative analysis. The results suggest that local cheese performs better in the field of added value creation and distribution, animal welfare and biodiversity. Global chains, by contrast, perform better in terms of affordability and efficiency and some environmental indicators. This analysis needed to be expressed in qualitative terms rather than quantified indicators and it has been especially useful to identify the critical issues and trade-offs that hinder sustainability at different scales. Cheese supply chains in Switzerland and the UK also often present hybrid arrangements in term of local and global scales. Comparison is therefore most meaningful when presented on a local (farmhouse)/global (creamery) continuum","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117385",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su8050419","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117385","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Attributes||Food chains||Global||Indicators||Local||Multidimensional performance||Sustainability","Comparing the sustainability of local and global food chains: A case study of cheese products in Switzerland and the UK",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T07:33:20Z",,"pub:179287",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654781947180018","010201556","84971326439",,,,"5","Sustainability","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Replacing mineral phosphorus (P) fertilizer with P-rich secondary resources is one way to manage P more efficiently, but the importance of physicochemical and microbial soil processes induced by secondary resources for plant P uptake is still poorly understood. Using radioactive-labeling techniques, the fertilization effects of dairy manure, fish sludge, meat bone meal, and wood ash were studied as P uptake by barley after 44 days and compared with those of water-soluble mineral P (MinP) and an unfertilized control (NoP) in a pot experiment with an agricultural soil containing little available P at two soil pH levels, approximately pH 5.3 (unlimed soil) and pH 6.2 (limed soil). In a parallel incubation experiment, the effects of the secondary resources on physicochemical and microbial soil processes were studied. The results showed that the relative agronomic efficiency compared with MinP decreased in the order: manure ≥fish sludge ≥wood ash ≥meat bone meal. The solubility of inorganic P in secondary resources was the main driver for P uptake by barley (Hordeum vulgare). The effects of secondary resources on physicochemical and microbial soil processes were of little overall importance. Application of organic carbon with manure resulted in microbial P immobilization and decreased uptake by barley of P derived from the soil. On both soils, P uptake by barley was best explained by a positive linear relationship with the H2O + NaHCO3-soluble inorganic P fraction in fertilizers or by a linear negative relationship with the HCl-soluble inorganic P fraction in fertilizers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000116233",,"2296-861X",,"10.3389/fnut.2016.00012","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/116233","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Waste products||Fish sludge||Meat bone meal||Wood ash||Animal manure||Isotope techniques","Drivers of Phosphorus Uptake by Barley Following Secondary Resource Application",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T05:50:12Z",,"pub:178090",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654630dd1b46414","010261241",,,,"Front.

Before budburst in spring, the leader shoots and 50% of all lateral shoots of half of the investigated 5-year old Abies alba saplings were clipped to simulate browsing. At harvest, different fine-root classes were separated, and starch as an important storage compartment was analysed for concentrations. The phenology had a strong effect on the allocation of the 13C-label from shoots to roots. In spring, shoots did not supply the fine-roots with high amounts of the 13C-label, because the fine-roots contained less than 1% of the applied 13C. In summer and autumn, however, shoots allocated relatively high amounts of the 13C-label to the fine roots. The incorporation of the 13C-label as structural C or as starch into the roots is strongly dependent on the root type and the root diameter. In newly formed fine roots, 3–5% of the applied 13C was incorporated, whereas 1–3% in the ≤0.5 mm root class and 1–1.5% in the >0.5–1.0 mm root class were recorded. Highest 13C-enrichment in the starch was recorded in the newly formed fine roots in autumn. The clipping treatment had a significant positive effect on the amount of allocated 13C-label to the fine roots after the spring labelling, with high relative 13C-contents observed in the ≤0.5 mm and the >0.5–1.0 mm fine-root classes of clipped trees. No effects of the clipping were observed after summer and autumn labelling in the 13C-allocation patterns. Overall, our data imply that the season of C assimilation and, thus, the phenology of trees is the main determinant of the C allocation from shoots to roots and is clearly more important than browsing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000116693",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0154687","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/116693","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Carbon Allocation into Different Fine-Root Classes of Young Abies alba Trees Is Affected More by Phenology than by Simulated Browsing",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T06:24:25Z",,"pub:178574",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936546a6ade258387","006206116",,,"000375211700123","PLoS ONE","4","PLoS ONE","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The assay was used to genotype a mapping population that we have also phenotyped for winter survival to complement the heading date trait previously mapped in this population. A positive correlation was observed between strong vernalization requirement and winter survival, and some QTL for winter survival and heading date overlapped on the genetic map. Candidate genes were located in clusters along the genetic map, some of which co-localized with QTL for winter survival and heading date.

In monospecific mesocosms grown under controlled conditions, the δ13C of C pools and fluxes and leaf ecophysiological parameters of seven herbaceous species belonging to three functional groups (crops, forage grasses and legumes) were investigated at three ontogenetic stages of their vegetative cycle (young foliage, maximum growth rate, early senescence). Ontogeny-related changes in δ13C of leaf- and soil-respired CO2 and 13C/12C fractionation in respiration (ΔR) were species-dependent and up to 7‰, a magnitude similar to that commonly measured in response to environmental factors. At plant and soil levels, changes in δ13C of respired CO2 and ΔR with ontogeny were related to changes in plant physiological status, likely through ontogeny-driven changes in the C sink to source strength ratio in the aboveground plant compartment. Our data further showed that lower ΔR values (i.e. respired CO2 relatively less depleted in 13C) were observed with decreasing net assimilation. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for ontogenetic stage and plant community composition in ecological studies using stable carbon isotopes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000114927",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0151583","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114927","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Effects of ontogeny on δ13C of plant- and soil-respired CO2 and on respiratory carbon fractionation in C3 herbaceous species",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T03:59:11Z",,"pub:176736",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654493c6a430315","006206116","84962090705",,"000372708000035","PLoS ONE","3","PLoS ONE","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although the causal mutation has not been identified yet, an indirect genetic test based on six microsatellite markers and consequent exclusion of Weaver carriers from breeding have led to the complete absence of new cases for over two decades. Evaluation of disease status by imputation of 41 diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a common haplotype published in 2013 identified several suspected carriers in the current breeding population, which suggests a higher frequency of the Weaver allele than anticipated. In order to prevent the reemergence of the disease, this study aimed at mapping the gene that underlies Weaver syndrome and thus at providing the basis for direct genetic testing and monitoring of today’s Braunvieh/Brown Swiss herds.  Results Combined linkage/linkage disequilibrium mapping on Bos taurus chromosome (BTA) 4 based on Illumina Bovine SNP50 genotypes of 43 Weaver-affected, 31 Weaver carrier and 86 Weaver-free animals resulted in a maximum likelihood ratio test statistic value at position 49,812,384 bp. The confidence interval (0.853 Mb) determined by the 2-LOD drop-off method was contained within a 1.72-Mb segment of extended homozygosity. Exploitation of whole-genome sequence data from two official Weaver carriers and 1145 other bulls that were sequenced in Run4 of the 1000 bull genomes project showed that only a non-synonymous SNP (rs800397662) within the PNPLA8 gene at position 49,878,773 bp was concordant with the Weaver carrier status. Targeted SNP genotyping confirmed this SNP as a candidate causal mutation for Weaver syndrome. Genotyping for the candidate causal mutation in a random sample of 2334 current Braunvieh animals suggested a frequency of the Weaver allele of 0.26 %.  Conclusions Through combined use of exhaustive sequencing data and SNP genotyping results, we were able to provide evidence that supports the non-synonymous mutation at position 49,878,773 bp as the most likely causal mutation for Weaver syndrome. Further studies are needed to uncover the exact mechanisms that underlie this syndrome.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000161502",,"0999-193X||1297-9686",,"10.1186/s12711-016-0201-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/161502","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Confirmation of a non-synonymous SNP in PNPLA8 as a candidate causal mutation for Weaver syndrome in Brown Swiss cattle",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::590 - Zoological sciences","2017-06-19T12:15:43Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Genet. sel. evol.",,"Genetics Selection Evolution","48","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We estimated the carbon dioxide (CO2) abatements and emissions associated to the concurrent production of bioenergy and biochar through biomass gasification in an organic walnut farm and processing facility in California, USA. We accounted for (i) avoided-CO2 emissions from displaced grid electricity by bioenergy; (ii) CO2 emissions from farm machinery used for soil amendment of biochar; (iii) CO2 sequestered in the soil through stable biochar-C; and (iv) direct CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil. The objective of these assessments was to pinpoint where the largest C offsets can be expected in the bioenergy-biochar chain. We found that energy production from gasification resulted in 91.8% of total C offsets, followed by stable biochar-C (8.2% of total C sinks), offsetting a total of 107.7 kg CO2-C eq Mg-1 feedstock. At the field scale, we monitored gas fluxes from soils for 29 months (180 individual observations) following field management and precipitation events in addition to weekly measurements within three growing seasons and two tree dormancy periods. We compared four treatments: control, biochar, compost, and biochar combined with compost. Biochar alone or in combination with compost did not alter total N2O and CO2 emissions from soils, indicating that under the conditions of this study, biochar-prompted C offsets may not be expected from the mitigation of direct soil GHG emissions. However, this study revealed a case where a large environmental benefit was given by the waste-to-bioenergy treatment, addressing farm level challenges such as waste management, renewable energy generation, and C sequestration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000114612",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0150837","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114612","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Carbon Abatement and Emissions Associated with the Gasification of Walnut Shells for Bioenergy and Biochar Production",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T03:21:20Z",,"pub:176410",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654424652638955","006206116","84962608023",,"000371993000069","PLoS ONE","3","PLoS ONE","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While a number of strategies for empirical models with eddy-covariance flux data have been applied, a systematic intercomparison of these methods has been missing so far. In this study, we performed a cross-validation experiment for predicting carbon dioxide, latent heat, sensible heat and net radiation fluxes across different ecosystem types with 11 machine learning (ML) methods from four different classes (kernel methods, neural networks, tree methods, and regression splines). We applied two complementary setups: (1) 8-day average fluxes based on remotely sensed data and (2) daily mean fluxes based on meteorological data and a mean seasonal cycle of remotely sensed variables. The patterns of predictions from different ML and experimental setups were highly consistent. There were systematic differences in performance among the fluxes, with the following ascending order: net ecosystem exchange (R2<0.5), ecosystem respiration (R2>0.6), gross primary production (R2>0.7), latent heat (R2>0.7), sensible heat (R2>0.7), and net radiation (R2>0.8). The ML methods predicted the across-site variability and the mean seasonal cycle of the observed fluxes very well (R2>0.7), while the 8-day deviations from the mean seasonal cycle were not well predicted (R2<0.5). Fluxes were better predicted at forested and temperate climate sites than at sites in extreme climates or less represented by training data (e.g., the tropics). The evaluated large ensemble of ML-based models will be the basis of new global flux products","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000118483",,"1810-6277||1810-6285",,"10.5194/bg-2015-661","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/118483","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Machine learning||Carbon fluxes||Energy fluxes||FLUXNET||Remote sensing||FLUXCOM","Predicting carbon dioxide and energy fluxes across global FLUXNET sites with regression algorithms",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T09:18:02Z",,"pub:180441",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936548dd628b65111",,,,,"Biogeosci. discuss.",,"Biogeosciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we characterize the DOM composition and optical properties of the six largest Arctic rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean to examine the ability of optical measurements to provide meaningful insights into terrigenous carbon export patterns and biogeochemical cycling. The chemical composition of aquatic DOM varied with season, spring months were typified by highest lignin phenol and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations with greater hydrophobic acid content, and lower proportions of hydrophilic compounds, relative to summer and winter months. Chromophoric DOM (CDOM) spectral slope (S_275–295) tracked seasonal shifts in DOM composition across river basins. Fluorescence and parallel factor analysis identified seven components across the six Arctic rivers. The ratios of “terrestrial humic-like” vs. “marine humic-like” fluorescent components co-varied with lignin monomer ratios over summer and winter months, suggesting fluorescence may provide information on the age and degradation state of riverine DOM. CDOM absorbance (a_350) proved a sensitive proxy for lignin phenol concentrations across all six river basins and over the hydrograph, enabling for the first time the development of a single pan-arctic relationship between a_350 and terrigenous DOC (R^2 = 0.93). Combining this lignin proxy with high-resolution monitoring of a_350, pan-arctic estimates of annual lignin flux were calculated to range from 156 to 185 Gg, resulting in shorter and more constrained estimates of terrigenous DOM residence times in the Arctic Ocean (spanning 7 months to 2½ years). Furthermore, multiple linear regression models incorporating both absorbance and fluorescence variables proved capable of explaining much of the variability in lignin composition across rivers and seasons. Our findings suggest that synoptic, high-resolution optical measurements can provide improved understanding of northern high-latitude organic matter cycling and flux, and prove an important technique for capturing future climate-driven changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000122688",,"2296-6463",,"10.3389/feart.2016.00025","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/122688","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Carbon cycle||Arctic||Lignin||Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)||Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC)||DOC||Climate change||Hydrology","Pan-Arctic Trends in Terrestrial Dissolved Organic Matter from Optical Measurements",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T16:06:23Z",,"pub:185015",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654df48c9f76462","010260787","84994589785",,"000393075000001","Front.

However, very few studies have explicitly considered the effects of agricultural management practices on the soil C:N:P ratio. The aim of this study was to assess how different input types and rates would affect the C:N:P molar ratios of bulk soil, organic matter and microbial biomass in cropped soils in the long term. Thus, we analysed the C, N, and P inputs and budgets as well as soil properties in three long-term experiments established on different soil types: the Saria soil fertility trial (Burkina Faso), the Wagga Wagga rotation/stubble management/soil preparation trial (Australia), and the DOK (bio-Dynamic, bio-Organic, and “Konventionell”) cropping system trial (Switzerland). In each of these trials, there was a large range of C, N, and P inputs which had a strong impact on element concentrations in soils. However, although C:N:P ratios of the inputs were highly variable, they had only weak effects on soil C:N:P ratios. At Saria, a positive correlation was found between the N:P ratio of inputs and microbial biomass, while no relation was observed between the nutrient ratios of inputs and soil organic matter. At Wagga Wagga, the C:P ratio of inputs was significantly correlated to total soil C:P, N:P, and C:N ratios, but had no impact on the elemental composition of microbial biomass. In the DOK trial, a positive correlation was found between the C budget and the C to organic P ratio in soils, while the nutrient ratios of inputs were not related to those in the microbial biomass. We argue that these responses are due to differences in soil properties among sites. At Saria, the soil is dominated by quartz and some kaolinite, has a coarse texture, a fragile structure, and a low nutrient content. Thus, microorganisms feed on inputs (plant residues, manure). In contrast, the soil at Wagga Wagga contains illite and haematite, is richer in clay and nutrients, and has a stable structure. Thus, organic matter is protected from mineralization and can therefore accumulate, allowing microorganisms to feed on soil nutrients and to keep a constant C:N:P ratio. The DOK soil represents an intermediate situation, with high nutrient concentrations, but a rather fragile soil structure, where organic matter does not accumulate. We conclude that the study of C, N, and P ratios is important to understand the functioning of cropped soils in the long term, but that it must be coupled with a precise assessment of element inputs and budgets in the system and a good understanding of the ability of soils to stabilize C, N, and P compounds.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000118478",,"2199-3971||2199-398X",,"10.5194/soil-2-83-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/118478","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Soil properties and not inputs control carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus ratios in cropped soils in the long-term",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T09:18:02Z",,"pub:180434",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936548dbf56635044",,,,,,"1","Soil","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Sequence variants identified from the sequenced genome of key ancestors can be imputed into animals that have been genotyped using medium- and high-density genotyping arrays. Association analysis with imputed sequences, particularly when applied to multiple traits simultaneously, is a very powerful approach to detect candidate causal variants that underlie complex phenotypes.  Results We used whole-genome sequence data from 157 key ancestors of the German Fleckvieh cattle population to impute 20,561,798 sequence variants into 10,363 animals that had (partly imputed) genotypes based on 634,109 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Rare variants were more frequent among the sequence-derived than the array-derived genotypes. Association studies with imputed sequence variants were performed using seven correlated udder conformation traits as response variables. The calculation of an approximate multi-trait test statistic enabled us to detect 12 quantitative trait loci (QTL) (P < 2.97 × 10−9) that affect different morphological features of the mammary gland. Among the tested variants, the most significant associations were found for imputed sequence variants at 11 QTL, whereas the top association signal was observed for an array-derived variant at a QTL on bovine chromosome 14. Seven QTL were associated with multiple phenotypes. Most QTL were located in non-coding regions of the genome but in close proximity of candidate genes that could be involved in mammary gland morphology (SP5, GC, NPFFR2, CRIM1, RXFP2, TBX5, RBM19 and ADAM12).  Conclusions Using imputed sequence variants in association analyses allows the detection of QTL at maximum resolution. Multi-trait approaches can reveal QTL that are not detected in single-trait association studies. Most QTL for udder conformation traits were located in non-coding regions of the genome, which suggests that mutations in regulatory sequences are the major determinants of variation in mammary gland morphology in cattle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000161500",,"0999-193X||1297-9686",,"10.1186/s12711-016-0190-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/161500","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A multi-trait meta-analysis with imputed sequence variants reveals twelve QTL for mammary gland morphology in Fleckvieh cattle",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::590 - Zoological sciences","2017-06-19T12:15:23Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Genet. sel. evol.",,"Genetics Selection Evolution","48","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Therefore, to understand future global climate change influence to regional ecosystem productivity, Earth systems models need to focus on improvements towards topographic downscaling of changes in regional atmospheric circulation patterns and to lagged responses in vegetation dynamics to non-growing season climate anomalies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000114050",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/11/2/024013","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114050","en","Institute of Physics Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Foehn||Atmospheric circulation||Alpine ecology||Ecosystem carbon uptake||Climatic change and variability","Montane ecosystem productivity responds more to global circulation patterns than climatic trends",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T02:35:32Z",,"pub:175820",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654361ccf360303","005253059","84959421972",,"000371488300015","Environ.

Both types of compounds are involved in antioxidant and lipid metabolism of mammals. Three experimental diet types were used which consisted approximately by half either of purple rice, white rice or corn. Diets were fed to 3×10 pigs growing from about 30 to 100 kg. Meat samples were investigated either as raw or cured loin chops or as smoked bacon produced from the belly. Various physicochemical traits were assessed and data were evaluated by analysis of variance. Traits describing water-holding capacity (drip, thaw, and cooking losses) and tenderness (sensory grading, shear force) of the meat were mostly not significantly affected by the diet type. However, purple rice feeding of pigs resulted in lower fat and cholesterol contents of loin and smoked bacon compared to white rice, but not compared to corn feeding except of the fat content of the loin. The shelf life of the raw loin chops was improved by purple rice as well. In detail, the occurrence of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances after 9 days of chilled storage was three to four times higher in the white rice and corn diets than with purple rice. The n-6:n-3 ratio in the raw loin chops was 9:1 with purple rice and clearly higher with 12:1 with the other diets, meat lipids. Level and kind of effect of purple rice found in raw meat was not always recovered in the cured loin chops and the smoked bacon. Still the impression of flavor and color, as well as overall acceptability were best in the smoked bacon from the purple-rice fed pigs, whereas this effect did not occur in the cured loin chops. These findings suggest that purple rice has a certain, useful, bioactivity in pigs concerning meat quality, but some of these effects are of low practical relevance. Further studies have to show ways how transiency and low recovery in meat products of some of the effects can be counteracted.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000114453",,"1011-2367||1976-5517",,"10.5713/ajas.15.0396","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114453","en","AAAP","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","Pig||Rice||Loin||Bacon||Anthocyanin||Antioxidant Properties","Effects of Feeding Purple Rice (Oryza sativa L.

How to achieve sustainable intensification of food production systems in tropical regions that are challenged by ongoing climate change, loss of natural resources and biodiversity is a matter of debate. Here we highlight the major knowledge gaps in agricultural research and policy that must be addressed to develop adequate governance and regulatory frameworks for sustainable agricultural intensification. They include quantification of the (i) value of (public/private) goods generated by ecosystem services, (ii) costs to conserve the natural resources and biodiversity that maintain ecosystem services, and (iii) true costs of different types of agriculture (in environmental, social, and health dimensions) as well as (iv) required adaptations that will make alternative farming strategies feasible at a global scale. We discuss the synergies and potential of agro-ecology and organic agriculture to transform our food systems and highlight the importance of controlling demand for food through societal (behavioral) and political (structural) changes in agricultural value chains. Finally, we review the sustainability standards and participatory guarantee systems in developed and developing countries, respectively, and argue that exemplars from developed countries could be role models in adapting governance and regulatory frameworks for developing countries.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000125275",,"2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2016.00005","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/125275","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sustainable intensification||Tropical agro-ecosystems||Organic agriculture||Agro-ecology||Biodiversity conservation||Ecosystem services||Green Revolution||Policy frameworks","Sustainable Intensification of Tropical Agro-Ecosystems: Need and Potentials",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T18:02:07Z",,"pub:187862",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936550d2a73e18216","010261182",,,,"Front.

We designed a system to continuously measure CH4 and N2O fluxes at the field scale on two adjacent pastures that differed with respect to management. At the core of this system was a closed-cell Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, which measured the mole fractions of CH4, N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) at two heights at each site. In parallel, CO2 fluxes were measured using eddy-covariance instrumentation. We applied two different micrometeorological ratio methods to infer the CH4 and N2O fluxes from their respective mole fractions and the CO2 fluxes. The first is a variant of the flux-gradient method, where it is assumed that the turbulent diffusivities of CH4 and N2O equal that of CO2. This method was reliable when the CO2 mole-fraction difference between heights was at least 4 times greater than the FTIR's resolution of differences. For the second method, the temporal increases of mole fractions in the stable nocturnal boundary layer, which are correlated for concurrently emitted gases, are used to infer the unknown fluxes of CH4 and N2O from the known flux of CO2. This method was sensitive to “contamination” from trace gas sources other than the pasture of interest and therefore required careful filtering. With both methods combined, estimates of mean daily CH4 and N2O fluxes were obtained for 56% of days at one site and 73% at the other. Both methods indicated both sites as net sources of CH4 and N2O. Mean emission rates for 1 year at the unfertilised, winter-grazed site were 8.9 (±0.79)nmolCH4m−2s−1 and 0.38 (±0.018)nmolN2Om−2s−1. During the same year, mean emission rates at the irrigated, fertilised and rotationally grazed site were 8.9 (±0.79)nmolCH4m−2s−1 and 0.58 (±0.020)nmolN2Om−2s−1. At this site, the N2O emissions amounted to 1.21 (±0.15)% of the nitrogen inputs from animal excreta and fertiliser application.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000114308",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-13-1309-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114308","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Combining two complementary micrometeorological methods to measure CH4 and N2O fluxes over pasture",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T02:53:50Z",,"pub:176086",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936543bf193459551","006289717","84960157714",,"000372082200029",,"4","Biogeosciences","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, we measured the canopy height growth of maize (Zea mays), soybean (Glycine max) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) under field conditions by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). We tested the hypotheses whether such measurements are capable to elucidate (1) differences in architecture that exist between genotypes; (2) genotypic differences between canopy height growth during the season and (3) short-term growth fluctuations (within 24 h), which could e.g. indicate responses to rapidly fluctuating environmental conditions. The canopies were scanned with a commercially available 3D laser scanner and canopy height growth over time was analyzed with a novel and simple approach using spherical targets with fixed positions during the whole season. This way, a high precision of the measurement was obtained allowing for comparison of canopy parameters (e.g. canopy height growth) at subsequent time points.  Results Three filtering approaches for canopy height calculation from TLS were evaluated and the most suitable approach was used for the subsequent analyses. For wheat, high coefficients of determination (R2) of the linear regression between manually measured and TLS-derived canopy height were achieved. The temporal resolution that can be achieved with our approach depends on the scanned crop. For maize, a temporal resolution of several hours can be achieved, whereas soybean is ideally scanned only once per day, after leaves have reached their most horizontal orientation. Additionally, we could show for maize that plant architectural traits are potentially detectable with our method.  Conclusions The TLS approach presented here allows for measuring canopy height growth of different crops under field conditions with a high temporal resolution, depending on crop species. This method will enable advances in automated phenotyping for breeding and precision agriculture applications. In future studies, the TLS method can be readily applied to detect the effects of plant stresses such as drought, limited nutrient availability or compacted soil on different genotypes or on spatial variance in fields.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000113298",,"1746-4811",,"10.1186/s13007-016-0109-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/113298","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Laser scanning||Scan point cloud||Canopy height growth||Maize||Soybean||Wheat","Terrestrial 3D laser scanning to track the increase in canopy height of both monocot and dicot crop species under field conditions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T01:23:11Z",,"pub:174981",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365424d8ad966540",,"84956689620",,"000368909200001","Plant methods",,"Plant Methods","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The presence or absence of water-logged conditions can lead to significant shifts in ecosystem structure and carbon cycle processes. In this study, we compared growing season CO2 fluxes of a wet tussock tundra ecosystem from an area affected by decadal drainage to an undisturbed area on the Kolyma floodplain in northeastern Siberia. For this comparison we found the sink strength for CO2 in recent years (2013–2015) to be systematically reduced within the drained area, with a minor increase in photosynthetic uptake due to a higher abundance of shrubs outweighed by a more pronounced increase in respiration due to warmer near-surface soil layers. Still, in comparison to the strong reduction of fluxes immediately following the drainage disturbance in 2005, recent CO2 exchange with the atmosphere over this disturbed part of the tundra indicate a higher carbon turnover, and a seasonal amplitude that is comparable again to that within the control section. This indicates that the local permafrost ecosystem is capable of adapting to significantly different hydrologic conditions without losing its capacity to act as a net sink for CO2 over the growing season. The comparison of undisturbed CO2 flux rates from 2013–2015 to the period of 2002–2004 indicates that CO2 exchange with the atmosphere was intensified, with increased component fluxes (ecosystem respiration and gross primary production) over the past decade. Net changes in CO2 fluxes are dominated by a major increase in photosynthetic uptake, resulting in a stronger CO2 sink in 2013–2015. Application of a MODIS-based classification scheme to separate the growing season into four sub-seasons improved the interpretation of interannual variability by illustrating the systematic shifts in CO2 uptake patterns that have occurred in this ecosystem over the past 10 years and highlighting the important role of the late growing season for net CO2 flux budgets.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000121181",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-13-5315-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/121181","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Impacts of a decadal drainage disturbance on surface-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide in a permafrost ecosystem",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T13:45:00Z",,"pub:183272",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654c1b00a257528","006289717","84989205102",,"000383966400001",,"18","Biogeosciences","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Semen samples of breeding bulls are collected and closely examined immediately after collection at artificial insemination centers. Only ejaculates without anomalous findings are retained for artificial insemination. Although morphological aberrations of the spermatozoa are a frequent reason for discarding ejaculates, the genetic determinants underlying poor semen quality are scarcely understood.  Results A tail stump sperm defect was observed in three bulls of the Swedish Red cattle breed. The spermatozoa of affected bulls were immotile because of severely disorganized tails indicating disturbed spermatogenesis. We genotyped three affected bulls and 18 unaffected male half-sibs at 46,035 SNPs and performed homozygosity mapping to map the fertility disorder to an 8.42 Mb interval on bovine chromosome 13. The analysis of whole-genome re-sequencing data of an affected bull and 300 unaffected animals from eleven cattle breeds other than Swedish Red revealed a 1 bp deletion (Chr13: 24,301,425 bp, ss1815612719) in the eleventh exon of the armadillo repeat containing 3-encoding gene (ARMC3) that was compatible with the supposed recessive mode of inheritance. The deletion is expected to alter the reading frame and to induce premature translation termination (p.A451fs26). The mutated protein is shortened by 401 amino acids (46 %) and lacks domains that are likely essential for normal protein function.  Conclusions We report the phenotypic and genetic characterization of a sterilizing tail stump sperm defect in the Swedish Red cattle breed. Exploiting high-density genotypes and massive re-sequencing data enabled us to identify the most likely causal mutation for the fertility disorder in bovine ARMC3. Our results provide the basis for monitoring the mutated variant in the Swedish Red cattle population and for the early identification of infertile animals.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000161497",,"1471-2156",,"10.1186/s12863-016-0356-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/161497","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ARMC3||Tail stump sperm defect||Swedish Red cattle||MMAF||Flagellum||Male infertility||Spermatogenesis","A frameshift mutation in ARMC3 is associated with a tail stump sperm defect in Swedish Red (Bos taurus) cattle",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2017-06-19T12:14:21Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"BMC Genet",,"BMC Genetics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While this enables greater gross primary production (GPP) and livestock grazing intensity, the consequences for the net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB) of the pastures are poorly known. Here, we determined the NECB over one year for an irrigated, fertilised and rotationally grazed dairy pasture and a neighbouring unirrigated, unfertilised, winter-grazed pasture. Primary terms in the NECB calculation were: net ecosystem production (NEP), biomass carbon removed by grazing cows and carbon (C) input from their excreta. Annual NEP was measured using the eddy-covariance method. Carbon removal was estimated with plate-meter measurements calibrated against biomass collections, pre- and post-grazing. Excreta deposition was calculated from animal feed intake. The intensively managed pasture gained C (NECB = 103±42g Cm−2yr−1) but would have been subject to a non-significant C loss if cattle excreta had not been returned to the pasture. The unirrigated pasture was C-neutral (NECB = −13±23g Cm−2yr−1). While annual GPP of the former was almost twice that of the latter (2679 vs. 1372g Cm−2yr−1), ecosystem respiration differed by only 68% between the two pastures (2271 vs. 1352g Cm−2yr−1). The ratio of GPP to the total annual water input of the irrigated pasture was 37% greater than that of the unirrigated pasture, i.e. the former used the water input more efficiently than the latter to produce biomass. The NECB results agree qualitatively with those from many other eddy-covariance studies of grazed grasslands, but they seem to be at odds with long-term carbon-stock studies of other New Zealand pastures.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117996",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-13-2927-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117996","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Carbon budgets for an irrigated intensively grazed dairy pasture and an unirrigated winter-grazed pasture",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T08:30:55Z",,"pub:179934",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654844601c17128","006289717","84977613756",,"000378354900005",,"10","Biogeosciences","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Persistent respiration activities during drought periods are responsible for a significant carbon loss, which may turn the ecosystem from a sink into a source of carbon. There are still gaps in our knowledge regarding the characteristic changes taking place in the respiration of the different components of the ecosystem in response to drought events.  In the present study, we combined a physical separation of soil respiration components with continuous measurements of soil CO2 efflux and its isotopic (13C) signals at a dry grassland site in Hungary. The physical separation of soil respiration components was performed by means of inox meshes and tubes inserted into the soil. The root-excluded and root- and mycorrhiza-excluded treatments served to measure the isotopic signals of the rhizospheric, mycorrhizal fungi and heterotrophic components, respectively.  In the dry grassland investigated in the study the three components of the soil CO2 efflux decreased at different rates under drought conditions. During drought the contribution made by the heterotrophic components was the highest (54±8%; mean ±SE). Rhizospheric component was the most sensitive to soil drying with its relative contribution to the total soil respiration dropping from 66±7 (non-stressed) to 35±17% (mean ±SE) under drought conditions. According to our results the heterotrophic component of soil respiration is the major contributor to the respiration activities during drought events in the dry grassland ecosystem studied.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120958",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-13-5171-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120958","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Autotrophic component of soil respiration is repressed by drought more than the heterotrophic one in dry grasslands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T13:15:15Z",,"pub:183041",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654bd7f7d997111","006289717","84988695238",,"000383965400001",,"18","Biogeosciences","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It can be quantified by the net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB) describing the change of soil C as the sum of all relevant import and export fluxes. NECB was investigated here in detail for an intensively grazed dairy pasture in Switzerland. Two budget approaches with different system boundaries were applied: NECBtot for system boundaries including the grazing cows and NECBpast for system boundaries excluding the cows. CO2 and CH4 exchange induced by soil/vegetation processes as well as direct emissions by the animals were derived from eddy covariance measurements. Other C fluxes were either measured (milk yield, concentrate feeding) or derived based on animal performance data (intake, excreta). For the investigated year, both approaches resulted in a small near-neutral C budget: NECBtot −27±62 and NECBpast 23±76gCm−2yr−1. The considerable uncertainties, depending on the approach, were mainly due to errors in the CO2 exchange or in the animal-related fluxes. The comparison of the NECB results with the annual exchange of other GHG revealed CH4 emissions from the cows to be the major contributor in terms of CO2 equivalents, but with much lower uncertainty compared to NECB. Although only 1year of data limit the representativeness of the carbon budget results, they demonstrate the important contribution of the non-CO2 fluxes depending on the chosen system boundaries and the effect of their propagated uncertainty in an exemplary way. The simultaneous application and comparison of both NECB approaches provides a useful consistency check for the carbon budget determination and can help to identify and eliminate systematic errors.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000116805",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-13-2959-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/116805","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Determination of the carbon budget of a pasture: effect of system boundaries and flux uncertainties",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T06:34:08Z",,"pub:178692",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936546ca8e5f59080","006289717","84971277086",,"000378354900007",,"10","Biogeosciences","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we present the genome sequence of six strains of the cucurbit bacterial wilt pathogen Erwinia tracheiphila (Enterobacteriaceae) isolated from infected squash plants in New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Michigan. These genomes exhibit a high proportion of recent horizontal gene acquisitions, invasion and remarkable amplification of mobile genetic elements, and pseudogenization of approximately 20% of the coding sequences. These genome attributes indicate that E. tracheiphila recently emerged as a host-restricted pathogen. Furthermore, chromosomal rearrangements associated with phage and transposable element proliferation contribute to substantial differences in gene content and genetic architecture between the six E. tracheiphila strains and other Erwinia species. Together, these data lead us to hypothesize that E. tracheiphila has undergone recent evolution through both genome decay (pseudogenization) and genome expansion (horizontal gene transfer and mobile element amplification). Despite evidence of dramatic genomic changes, the six strains are genetically monomorphic, suggesting a recent population bottleneck and emergence into E. tracheiphila’s current ecological niche.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000115851",,"1759-6653",,"10.1093/gbe/evw016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/115851","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Cucurbita||Cucumis||Erwinia||mobile DNA||transposase||insertion sequence||pseudogene||host specialization||vector||monomorphic||phage||pumpkin||squash||cucumber","Horizontal Gene Acquisitions, Mobile Element Proliferation, and Genome Decay in the Host-Restricted Plant Pathogen Erwinia Tracheiphila",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T05:15:17Z",,"pub:177688",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936545b370a466718","010180519","85014811764",,"000373839200016","Genome Biol Evol","3","Genome Biology and Evolution","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Knowledge of the temperature response of leaf extension, particularly variations close to the thermal limit of growth, helps define physiological growth constraints and breeding-related genotypic differences among cultivars. Here, we present a novel method, called ‘Leaf Length Tracker’ (LLT), suitable for measuring leaf elongation rates (LERs) of cereals and other grasses with high precision and high temporal resolution under field conditions. The method is based on image sequence analysis, using a marker tracking approach to calculate LERs. We applied the LLT to several varieties of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), summer barley (Hordeum vulgare), and ryegrass (Lolium perenne), grown in the field and in growth cabinets under controlled conditions. LLT is easy to use and we demonstrate its reliability and precision under changing weather conditions that include temperature, wind, and rain. We found that leaf growth stopped at a base temperature of 0°C for all studied species and we detected significant genotype-specific differences in LER with rising temperature. The data obtained were statistically robust and were reproducible in the tested environments. Using LLT, we were able to detect subtle differences (sub-millimeter) in leaf growth patterns. This method will allow the collection of leaf growth data in a wide range of future field experiments on different graminoid species or varieties under varying environmental or treatment conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000115003",,"1460-2431||0022-0957",,"10.1093/jxb/erw003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/115003","en","Oxford University Press","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Field conditions||Leaf elongation||Low temperature||Marker tracking||Monocotyledons||Phenotyping||Plant growth","Leaf Length Tracker: A novel approach to analyse leaf elongation close to the thermal limit of growth in the field",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T03:59:11Z",,"pub:176813",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936544aae33169329","000049325","84962911036",,"000372981800026","J.

A feeding experiment was conducted with 24 Holstein cows to evaluate whether diets containing CT from different forage legumes can increase polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially n-3 fatty acid content in milk and cheese, without affecting negatively their physicochemical and sensorial properties. Cows were assigned to 4 treatment groups (n = 6) for 52 d, divided into 2 periods: a control period (CoP) and an experimental period (ExP). During the CoP, cows received a basal diet composed of hay, corn silage, ExtruLin (Trinova Handel & Marketing AG, Wangen, Switzerland), concentrate, and alfalfa (AF) in a ratio of 45:25:5:7:18. In the ExP, in 3 of the 4 groups AF was replaced by either sainfoin (SF; 19% CT in dry matter) or 1 of 2 cultivars of birdsfoot trefoil [Polom (BP), 3% CT; Bull (BB), 5% CT]. At the end of each period, milk was collected on 3 consecutive days and analyzed for milk gross composition and fatty acid profile and was processed to Gruyère-type cheese. A trained panel assessed the sensory quality of raw milk and cheese using discriminative and descriptive tests. This experimental design consisting of AF in both the CoP and ExP allowed us to quantify effects due to lactation stage and experimental diets. In both the CoP and ExP, dry matter intake and milk yield did not differ among treatment groups. From the CoP to the ExP, milk urea content was reduced by 23% with SF, remained unchanged with BP, and tended to increase with AF and BB. The odor of the raw BB milk was judged to be different from AF milk. With SF, switching from the CoP to the ExP resulted in a 17% increase of the 18:3n-3 proportion in milk and cheese lipids. In BP cheese, the increase was 3%, whereas it tended to decrease in BB cheese. Additionally, the 20:5n-3 and 22:5n-3 proportions tended to increase in SF cheese from the CoP to the ExP. Compared with the AF cheeses, cheeses from cows fed CT-containing legumes were judged harder and tended to be less adhesive to the palate. In addition, SF and BP cheeses had less rind. In conclusion, feeding SF compared with BB and BP increased the content of 18:3n-3 in the milk and the cheese without a negative effect on flavor of the cheese. Despite a similar CT content, the 2 birdsfoot trefoil cultivars had opposite effects on milk urea and 18:3n-3 deposition, suggesting that, besides the content, the chemical structure may have had an important effect on the CT efficacy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000106885",,"0022-0302||1525-3198",,"10.3168/jds.2015-9952","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/106885","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/","condensed tannins||milk||cheese||quality","Ability of 3 tanniferous forage legumes to modify quality of milk and Gruyère-type cheese",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T21:10:47Z",,"pub:167301",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653b01b8cd48458","000032582","84952717620",,"000367214700021","J.

While a number of strategies for empirical models with eddy-covariance flux data have been applied, a systematic intercomparison of these methods has been missing so far. In this study, we performed a cross-validation experiment for predicting carbon dioxide, latent heat, sensible heat and net radiation fluxes across different ecosystem types with 11 machine learning (ML) methods from four different classes (kernel methods, neural networks, tree methods, and regression splines). We applied two complementary setups: (1) 8-day average fluxes based on remotely sensed data and (2) daily mean fluxes based on meteorological data and a mean seasonal cycle of remotely sensed variables. The patterns of predictions from different ML and experimental setups were highly consistent. There were systematic differences in performance among the fluxes, with the following ascending order: net ecosystem exchange (R2<0.5), ecosystem respiration (R2>0.6), gross primary production (R2>0.7), latent heat (R2>0.7), sensible heat (R2>0.7), and net radiation (R2>0.8). The ML methods predicted the across-site variability and the mean seasonal cycle of the observed fluxes very well (R2>0.7), while the 8-day deviations from the mean seasonal cycle were not well predicted (R2<0.5). Fluxes were better predicted at forested and temperate climate sites than at sites in extreme climates or less represented by training data (e.g., the tropics). The evaluated large ensemble of ML-based models will be the basis of new global flux products.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000118885",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-13-4291-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/118885","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Predicting carbon dioxide and energy fluxes across global FLUXNET sites with regression algorithms",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T09:56:48Z",,"pub:180871",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365495cf60723753","006289717","84980351826",,"000381212300015",,"14","Biogeosciences","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

BFEs have been shown to be dependent on environmental conditions and the composition of the beneficiary community. In alpine cushion systems, BFEs are more negative with more abundant, diverse and phylogenetically aggregated communities of beneficiary species. We tested the hypothesis that the functional composition of the beneficiary communities correlates with the direction and strength of BFE received by alpine cushion benefactors and specifically that a more negative BFE would occur with increasing density of graminoids and a more positive BFE would occur with increasing density of forbs and legumes. Additionally, we predicted that the negative BFE of graminoids would increase with increasing summer aridity. We used a data base of alpine cushion communities from 30 sites throughout the world to assess the overall relationship between the composition of beneficiary communities and the total flower density of cushion benefactors, and its variation with increasing drought. Additionally, in order to assess more precisely the role of the functional composition of the beneficiary communities on BFE in a very dry site with cushion benefactors exhibiting contrasting functional compositions of beneficiary communities, we also designed a field study in the Qilian Shan mountain range (China). At this site with a highly continental climate, we compared the number of flowers and fruits of different phenotypes of the alpine cushion species Thylacospermum caespitosum hosting numerous graminoids, numerous forbs or very few beneficiary species. In the intercontinental study, we found a negative relationship between graminoids and cushion benefactor flower density but no effect of other functional groups. The negative BFE of graminoids increased with increasing summer drought. In the dry Qilian Shan range, we found both a negative effect of graminoids on total flower density and a positive effect of forbs on flower density and fruit set. Our study indicates that the context dependence of BFE may be partially explained by the composition of beneficiary communities and in particular the negative effect of graminoids. © 2016 British Ecological Society.",,,,"0269-8463||1365-2435",,"10.1111/1365-2435.12507","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/222331","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,,"Alpine communities||Beneficiary feedback effect||Community feedbacks||Competition||Cushion plants||Drought||Facilitation||Functional composition||Graminoids||alpine environment||aridity||drought||environmental conditions||facilitation||fruit set||grass||herb||legume||phylogenetics||species diversity||China||Qilian Mountains","Beneficiary feedback effects on alpine cushion benefactors become more negative with increasing cover of graminoids and in dry conditions",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2017-12-18T15:47:06Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Funct.

However, increasing intensity of food production in agricultural systems has driven reductions in farmland biodiversity. A major challenge is to enable biodiversity conservation whilst addressing the problem of food security. Here we describe how facilitative plant-plant interactions in crop systems could be used to help strike this balance. An obvious example is that of intercropping systems, where combinations of crop species can - under some circumstances - deliver reduced inputs of agrochemicals (fertilizers, pesticides) per unit yield, with potential knock-on benefits for biodiversity conservation. Other facilitative processes can also play a role in biodiversity conservation. Increased intraspecific crop genetic diversity can help protect crops from pests and diseases. Although overlooked in facilitation research, we argue that the mechanisms operate in a manner which is directly analogous to associational defence against herbivores, a process well recognized in the facilitation literature. As with intercropping, the benefits to nature conservation arise from reduced pesticide use per unit harvested crop. Crops may have facilitative effects on some arable weed species, particularly those that are currently considered rare in intensive farming systems. Work is in its early stages to understand the underlying mechanisms, but it appears that crops might create niche space to which some weed species are adapted. Increasing plant species diversity through niche space creation may then have cascading benefits for other components of farmland biodiversity. Our new understanding of facilitative processes arising from work on crop systems has lessons for the study of facilitative interactions in natural and semi-natural communities. We argue that, although easier to identify and quantify in crop systems, some of these facilitative processes have to date been overlooked in studies of non-crop systems and certainly deserve further consideration. Finally, we discuss what steps may be needed to move from our understanding of the role of facilitation to the development of new agricultural practice. In some cases the challenge may be one of the encouraging uptake of existing practices, and in others more research is needed to understand how new ecological understanding might deliver more sustainable agricultural practice. © 2016 British Ecological Society.",,,,"0269-8463||1365-2435",,"10.1111/1365-2435.12496","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/222330","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,,"Agriculture||Biodiversity conservation||Crops||Facilitation||Genetic diversity||Niche construction||Review||agricultural ecosystem||agrochemical||alternative agriculture||biodiversity||crop production||facilitation||food production||food security||genetic variation||intercropping||literature review||nature conservation||niche||species diversity||weed","Facilitation and sustainable agriculture: A mechanistic approach to reconciling crop production and conservation",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2017-12-18T15:47:01Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Funct.

Here, we present a regional-scale inverse modelling study to quantify the emissions of methane (CH4) from Switzerland, making use of the newly established CarboCount-CH measurement network and a high-resolution Lagrangian transport model. In our reference inversion, prior emissions were taken from the ""bottom-up"" Swiss Greenhouse Gas Inventory (SGHGI) as published by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment in 2014 for the year 2012. Overall we estimate national CH4 emissions to be 196 ± 18 Gg yr−1 for the year 2013 (1σ uncertainty). This result is in close agreement with the recently revised SGHGI estimate of 206 ± 33 Gg yr−1 as reported in 2015 for the year 2012. Results from sensitivity inversions using alternative prior emissions, uncertainty covariance settings, large-scale background mole fractions, two different inverse algorithms (Bayesian and extended Kalman filter), and two different transport models confirm the robustness and independent character of our estimate. According to the latest SGHGI estimate the main CH4 source categories in Switzerland are agriculture (78 %), waste handling (15 %) and natural gas distribution and combustion (6 %). The spatial distribution and seasonal variability of our posterior emissions suggest an overestimation of agricultural CH4 emissions by 10 to 20 % in the most recent SGHGI, which is likely due to an overestimation of emissions from manure handling. Urban areas do not appear as emission hotspots in our posterior results, suggesting that leakages from natural gas distribution are only a minor source of CH4 in Switzerland. This is consistent with rather low emissions of 8.4 Gg yr−1 reported by the SGHGI but inconsistent with the much higher value of 32 Gg yr−1 implied by the EDGARv4.2 inventory for this sector. Increased CH4 emissions (up to 30 % compared to the prior) were deduced for the north-eastern parts of Switzerland. This feature was common to most sensitivity inversions, which is a strong indicator that it is a real feature and not an artefact of the transport model and the inversion system. However, it was not possible to assign an unambiguous source process to the region. The observations of the CarboCount-CH network provided invaluable and independent information for the validation of the national bottom-up inventory. Similar systems need to be sustained to provide independent monitoring of future climate agreements.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000116872",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-3683-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/116872","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Validation of the Swiss methane emission inventory by atmospheric observations and inverse modelling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T06:43:36Z",,"pub:178761",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936546e1169864573","004294181",,,"000374702300002","Atmos. chem. phys.","6","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is therefore convenient to have a practical statistical method for the accurate classification of individuals into carriers and non-carriers. In this paper, we compared – through cross-validation– five classification models (Lasso-penalized logistic regression –Lasso, Support Vector Machines with either linear or radial kernel –SVML and SVMR, k-nearest neighbors –KNN, and multi-allelic gene prediction –MAG), for the identification of carriers of the TUBD1 recessive mutation on BTA19 (Bos taurus autosome 19), known to be associated with high calf mortality. A population of 3116 Fleckvieh and 392 Brown Swiss animals genotyped with the 54K SNP-chip was available for the analysis.  Results In general, the use of SNP genotypes proved to be very effective for the identification of mutation carriers. The best predictive models were Lasso, SVML and MAG, with an average error rate, respectively, of 0.2 %, 0.4 % and 0.6 % in Fleckvieh, and 1.2 %, 0.9 % and 1.7 % in Brown Swiss. For the three models, the false positive rate was, respectively, 0.1 %, 0.1 % and 0.2 % in Fleckvieh, and 3.0 %, 2.4 % and 1.6 % in Brown Swiss; the false negative rate was 4.4 %, 7.6 %1.0 % in Fleckvieh, and 0.0 %, 0.1% and 0.8 % in Brown Swiss. MAG appeared to be more robust to sample size reduction: with 25 % of the data, the average error rate was 0.7 % and 2.2 % in Fleckvieh and Brown Swiss, compared to 2.1 % and 5.5 % with Lasso, and 2.6 % and 12.0 % with SVML.  Conclusions The use of SNP genotypes is a very effective and efficient technique for the identification of mutation carriers in cattle populations. Very few misclassifications were observed, overall and both in the carriers and non-carriers classes. This indicates that this is a very reliable approach for potential applications in cattle breeding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000161494",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-016-3218-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/161494","en","Biomed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","SNP genotypes||Recessive mutations||Carrier identification||Lasso-penalised logistic regression||Support vector machines||KNN||MAG||Haplotypes||Cattle","Use of SNP genotypes to identify carriers of harmful recessive mutations in cattle populations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2017-06-19T12:13:35Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"BMC Genomics",,"BMC Genomics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Accompanying skeletal aberrations may compromise the general condition and locomotion of affected individuals. Several paternal half-sibs with a low birth weight and a small size were born in 2013 in the Fleckvieh cattle population.  Results Affected calves were strikingly underweight at birth in spite of a normal gestation length and had craniofacial abnormalities such as elongated narrow heads and brachygnathia inferior. In spite of a normal general condition, their growth remained restricted during rearing. We genotyped 27 affected and 10,454 unaffected animals at 44,672 single nucleotide polymorphisms and performed association tests followed by homozygosity mapping, which allowed us to map the locus responsible for growth failure to a 1.85-Mb segment on bovine chromosome 3. Analysis of whole-genome re-sequencing data from one affected and 289 unaffected animals revealed a 1-bp deletion (g.15079217delC, rs723240647) in the coding region of the GON4L gene that segregated with the dwarfism-associated haplotype. We showed that the deletion induces intron retention and premature termination of translation, which can lead to a severely truncated protein that lacks domains that are likely essential to normal protein function. The widespread use of an undetected carrier bull for artificial insemination has resulted in a tenfold increase in the frequency of the deleterious allele in the female population.  Conclusions A frameshift mutation in GON4L is associated with autosomal recessive proportionate dwarfism in Fleckvieh cattle. The mutation has segregated in the population for more than 50 years without being recognized as a genetic disorder. However, the widespread use of an undetected carrier bull for artificial insemination caused a sudden accumulation of homozygous calves with dwarfism. Our findings provide the basis for genome-based mating strategies to avoid the inadvertent mating of carrier animals and thereby prevent the birth of homozygous calves with impaired growth.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000161498",,"0999-193X||1297-9686",,"10.1186/s12711-016-0207-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/161498","en","EDP Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A frameshift mutation in GON4L is associated with proportionate dwarfism in Fleckvieh cattle",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-19T12:14:38Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Genet. sel. evol.",,"Genetics Selection Evolution","48","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, so far it is unclear to what extent genetic variations in root system responses to spatially varying soil resources can be utilized for breeding applications. Among others, one limiting factor is the absence of phenotyping platforms allowing the analysis of such interactions.  Results We developed a system that is able to (a) monitor root and shoot growth synchronously, (b) investigate their dynamic responses and (c) analyse the effect of heterogeneous N distribution to parts of the root system in a split-nutrient setup with a throughput (200 individual maize plants at once) sufficient for mapping of quantitative trait loci or for screens of multiple environmental factors. In a test trial, 24 maize genotypes were grown under split nitrogen conditions and the response of shoot and root growth was investigated. An almost double elongation rate of crown and lateral roots was observed under high N for all genotypes. The intensity of genotype-specific responses varied strongly. For example, elongation of crown roots differed almost two times between the fastest and slowest growing genotype. A stronger selective root placement in the high-N compartment was related to an increased shoot development indicating that early vigour might be related to a more intense foraging behaviour.  Conclusion To our knowledge, RADIX is the only system currently existing which allows studying the differential response of crown roots to split-nutrient application to quantify foraging behaviour in genome mapping or selection experiments. In doing so, changes in root and shoot development and the connection to plant performance can be investigated.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120106",,"1746-4811",,"10.1186/s13007-016-0140-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120106","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Abiotic stress||Corn||Maize||Rhizotron||Root foraging||Split root||Root-shoot interaction||Quantitative trait loci||Imaging","RADIX: rhizoslide platform allowing high throughput digital image analysis of root system expansion",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T12:07:02Z",,"pub:182158",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654ae478a188781",,"84985001695",,"000382354000001","Plant methods",,"Plant Methods","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
