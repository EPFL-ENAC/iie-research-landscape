To do this, we critically examined and compared the social and scientific values that shaped the production of three national climate scenarios in the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK. A comparative analysis of documentary materials and expert interviews linked to the climate scenarios was performed. Our findings reveal a new typology of use-inspired research in climate science for decision-making: (i) innovators, where the advancement of science is the main objective; (ii) consolidators, where knowledge exchanges and networks are prioritised; and (iii) collaborators, where the needs of users are put first and foremost. These different values over what constitutes ‘good’ science for decision-making are mirrored in the way users were involved in the production process: (i) elicitation, where scientists have privileged decision-making power; (ii) representation, where multiple organisations mediate on behalf of individual users; and (iii) participation, where a multitude of users interact with scientists in an equal partnership. These differences help explain why climate knowledge gains its credibility and legitimacy differently even when the information itself might not be judged as salient and usable. If the push to deliberately co-produce climate knowledge is not sensitive to the national civic epistemology at play in each country, scientist–user interactions may fail to deliver more ‘usable’ climate information.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000130748",,"1436-3798||1436-378X",,"10.1007/s10113-017-1155-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/130748","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate scenarios||Adaptation||Decision-making||Co-production||Civic epistemology","The social and scientific values that shape national climate scenarios: a comparison of the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-06-12T21:01:11Z",,,,"pub:193779",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936556e348df33266","003869201","85018257377",,"000415136200012","Reg Environ Change","8","Regional Environmental Change","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

But the problem frame also rests on a set of factual and value-based assumptions, and is inappropriate to guide decision-making when these assumptions are violated. The climate change mitigation challenge – reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from the energy sector, to limit global warming to less than 1.5 or 2 °C – violates these assumptions. Climate change requires us not to reduce, but to completely prohibit greenhouse gas emissions. Before any such prohibition is feasible, it is first essential to develop a clean energy system that can meet our basic needs. The main barriers to this are not economic, but rather are associated with evolving knowledge, networks, and institutions. Framing climate change in evolutionary terms can help us to appraise policy options more effectively, and ultimate identify those that get us where we need to go.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000192697",,"2214-6296","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/192697||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/213943","10.1016/j.erss.2017.05.023","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/214800","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate policy||Tragedy of the commons||Global commons problem||Technological transitions","Beyond the tragedy of the commons: Reframing effective climate change governance",,"Other Journal Item","Open access",,,,"2017-10-06T05:25:52Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,"Desertection - Social challenges of trans-Mediterranean renewable power cooperation","313553","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,"85019963198",,"000417468600001",,,"Energy Research & Social Science","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Several studies analyzed whether such standards deliver on their promise to improve the livelihoods of poor farmers, with mixed results. Here, we ask whether the design of standards could be improved such that farm households benefit more. An assessment of what particular features of standards hamper or facilitate participation requires a better understanding of farmers’ preferences. Our contribution is twofold: First, based on a choice experiment we analyze how farmers evaluate actual and hypothetical features of standards. Data were collected from small-scale coffee producers in Uganda. Second, this is the first quantitative study on standards employing a gendered research design. A gender focus is important, because coffee and other certified export crops are often controlled by men. The choice experiment included features of standards aimed at reducing gender inequality and was conducted separately with male and female members of farm households. Results indicate that farmers have positive attitudes toward sustainability standards in general. While they dislike bans of productivity-enhancing inputs, agricultural training and special female support are appreciated. Many also see requirements that have to be met for certification as a welcome nudge to invest in better farm management and quality upgrading. Female farmers have a higher preference for standards than male farmers. Also within households, significant preference heterogeneity between women and men is found.",,,,"0305-750X",,"10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.05.021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539553","en","Elsevier",,,"Choice experiment||Farmer preferences||Sustainability standards||Gender||Mixed logit models","Toward Improving the Design of Sustainability Standards - A Gendered Analysis of Farmers’ Preferences",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-03-28T07:44:28Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"World Development","99","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this opinion dynamics exercise, we address the topic of nuclear waste repositories in Switzerland and suggest a more realistic investigation of public opinion using agent-based modeling in combination with empirical data and sociopsychological theory. Empirical data obtained from an online questionnaire (N = 841) is used for the initialization of the model, whose agents directly represent the participants. We use social judgment theory (SJT) to describe how opinions can be adapted during social interactions, including through mechanisms of contrast and assimilation. Furthermore, we focus on the definition of “opinion” itself, claiming that working with disaggregated opinions (i.e., arguments) can play a determining role if one aims to capture real-world mechanisms of opinion dynamics. Simulation results show different patterns for the three different argument categories used for this specific topic (i.e., risk, benefit, and process), suggesting a mutual influence between an individual’s initial knowledge and evaluations and an individual’s social dynamics and opinion changes. The importance of content-related and empirical information, as well as the theory and mechanisms used in the social simulation, are discussed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000211875",,"1460-7425",,"10.18564/jasss.3492","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/211875","en","University of Surrey, Department of Sociology","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Agent-Based Model||Arguments||Opinion Dynamics||Social Judgment","Opinion communication on contested topics: How empirics and arguments can improve social simulation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-11-22T08:45:24Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85033235400",,"000416164100005","JASSS","4","Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While questions on the warning system technology and the distribution of information, including the alarm for evacuation, could be resolved with the support of experts, controversies arose on the financial and legal responsibilities that ensure long-term and effective monitoring for the protection of the landslide-prone community. This paper examines how responsibilities can be shared among the residents, experts, and public authorities during the design and operation of landslide warning systems. In particular, we discuss the outcome and implications of three stakeholder workshops where participants deliberated on warning-system options that, in turn, were based on a discourse analysis of extensive stakeholder interviews. The results of the case study show that an end-user orientation requires the consideration of stakeholder worldviews, interests, and conflicts. Paradoxically, the public did not fully support their own involvement in the maintenance and control of the warning system, but the authorities promoted shared responsibility. Deliberative planning does not then necessarily lead to responsibility sharing, but it proved effective as a platform for information and for shared ownership in the warning system","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000211503",,"2079-9276",,"10.3390/resources6040054","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/211503","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","warning system||landslide risk||technical-policy option||responsibility sharing||Public participation||stakeholder perspectives||warning communication and decision making","A participatory process to develop a landslide warning system: paradoxes of responsibility sharing in a case study in Upper Austria",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-11-21T14:25:46Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85037058343",,,,"4","Resources","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

One important component of these transformations is the overall reduction in energy demand. It is generally acknowledged that the domestic sector represents a large share of total energy consumption in many countries. Increased energy efficiency is one factor that reduces energy demand, but behavioral approaches (known as “sufficiency”) and their respective interventions also play important roles. In this paper, we address citizens’ heterogeneity regarding both their current behaviors and their willingness to realize their sufficiency potentials—that is, to reduce their energy consumption through behavioral change. We collaborated with three Swiss cities for this study. A survey conducted in the three cities yielded thematic sets of energy-consumption behavior that various groups of participants rated differently. Using this data, we identified four groups of participants with different patterns of both current behaviors and sufficiency potentials. The paper discusses intervention types and addresses citizens’ heterogeneity and behaviors from a city-based perspective.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000198622",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0185963","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/198622","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Navigating behavioral energy sufficiency.

However, only a small share of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects under the Kyoto Protocol and only 30% of public climate finance is invested in urban areas. One of the main reasons is that most urban climate change mitigation projects rather provide development than climate benefits, so the question is whether alternative mechanisms can mobilize urban mitigation projects. In this paper, we analyze a set of three case studies — representative urban waste and transportation projects in Indonesia, Kenya, Sri Lanka — to compare the market and economic value of climate and development co-benefits. For the projects, we monetize the co-benefits accruing to the local community. We find that under current market conditions, climate benefits have little effect on projects’ financial viability, and can be effectively ignored. By contrast, we find, the monetization of development co-benefits significantly improves financial viability, based on calculated net present values and internal rates of return. Our results highlight the importance of local, national and international financing and policies that monetize such development co-benefits.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000192613",,"2210-6707","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/213915||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/192613","10.1016/j.scs.2017.06.003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/223910","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Co-benefits||Climate mitigation policies||Low carbon investment||Financial modelling||Cities","Valuing co-benefits to make low-carbon investments in cities bankable: the case of waste and transportation projects",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-10-06T05:20:19Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85021051345",,"000415896000007",,,"Sustainable Cities and Society","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Mittels einer Online-Umfrage bei den Teil¬nehmenden der BEST-Tage 2015 und 2016 wurde erstmals eine Evaluation dieser Veranstaltung durchgeführt. Insgesamt 74 Studierende beteiligten sich an der Umfrage. Es wurde analysiert, ob die BEST-Tage und ihre einzelnen Teile die jeweils angestrebten Ziele erreichen und zudem sollten mögliche Probleme und Möglichkeiten für eine Verbesserung der Durchführung der BEST-Tage identifi¬ziert werden.  Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die BEST-Tage für die Teilnehmenden interessant waren, ihnen Spass gemacht haben und ermöglichten, Kontakte zu knüpfen und Mitstudent(inn)en kennen zu lernen. Auch die vier einzelnen Teile der BEST-Tage wurden im Hinblick auf die Erreichung ihrer jeweiligen Ziele positiv beurteilt. Das New Commons Game (NCG) bzw. „Fischerei-Spiel“ machte den Teilnehmenden Spass und förderte auf spielerische Art und Weise das Verständnis des Konzepts der Nachhaltigkeit und der dynamischen Pro¬zesse in Mensch-Umweltsystemen. Komplementär dazu vermittelten die Exkurs¬ionen zur Prä¬sentation von Forschungsprojekten einen Einblick in die Themenfelder und Forschungs¬aktivitäten am Departement Umweltsystemwissenschaften. Bei den Diskussionsrunden zu Motiva¬tionen und Erwartungen für das Studium wurde immerhin von der Hälfte der Antwortenden eher bejaht oder bejaht, dass diese für die Klärung der Frage, ob der Studiengang der richtige ist, hilfreich waren.

Yet whether TVE buildings actually save lives depends critically on whether people trust and evacuate to them, a question that has not previously been researched. We examine the case of the city of Banda Aceh, Indonesia, where a M8.6 earthquake on 11-April-2012 caused a spontaneous mass evacuation but no tsunami. Our survey of residents living near TVE buildings (n = 202) shows that they clearly prefer horizontal evacuation: in the 2012 earthquake, only 26% evacuated to a TVE building, while 74% evacuated horizontally; if a similar earthquake happened in the future, only 32% intend to evacuate to a TVE building, while 68% intend to evacuate horizontally. To investigate the reasons for this, we extend protection motivation theory to examine people's choices among protective actions under social influence. Those who prefer to evacuate horizontally do not trust the safety of the TVE building and think they can reach a safe inland destination in time, while those who prefer to evacuate to a TVE building think they cannot reach a safe inland destination in time. Encouragement from friends and family influences people's evacuation destinations but official information and training do not. These findings suggest that more attention to the social context is crucial for the effectiveness of TVE buildings. Our extension of protection motivation theory to include choices among protective actions under social influence can be broadly useful in research on self-protective behavior in natural hazards, public health, and other contexts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000192557",,"2212-4209","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/213932||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/192557","10.1016/j.ijdrr.2017.06.016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/242329","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Tsunami||Evacuation||Protection motivation theory||Trust||Social influence||Social norms","Trust and distrust of tsunami vertical evacuation buildings: Extending protection motivation theory to examine choices under social influence",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-10-06T05:15:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85026662667",,"000413936100047",,,"International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It describes stakeholder perspectives on the technical, social, economic, legal and institutional characteristics of a warning system. The perspectives differ on issues such as responsibility allocation in decisions regarding warnings, technologies used for monitoring and forecasting, costs and financial aspects, open data policies and the role of the residents. Drawing on the theory of plural rationality and based on a desk study and interviews, stakeholder perspectives and discourses on the warning system problem and its solution were elicited. The perspectives formed the basis for the specification of three technical policy options for a warning system in Gschliefgraben: a minimal-cost and cost-effective system; a technical-expert system; and a resident-centered system. The case demonstrates the importance of accounting for a plurality of values and preferences and of giving voice to competing discourses in communities contemplating warning systems or other public good policies. This paper concludes that understanding the different and often conflicting perspectives and technical policy options is the starting point for formulating an agreed compromise for an effective warning system. We describe the compromise solution in an accompanying paper included in this Special Issue.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000211538",,"2079-9276",,"10.3390/resources6030037","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/211538","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","warning system||landslide risk||technical policy option||stakeholder perspectives||warning communication and decision making","Warning system options for landslide risk: a case study in Upper Austria",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-11-21T14:36:10Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Resources","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Adequately accounting for stakeholders’ values and interests is key to understanding whether stakeholders’ perspectives pose a risk to energy policy implementation. We present results from a case study on the implementation of a renewable energy project in Switzerland, where we applied Q methodology. Three perspectives were identified, namely: 1) promotion for local development and production of energy (‘Local pro-producers’); 2) promotion for a national level ‘greener’ environmental agenda (‘National greens’); and 3) regional government empowerment for implementing energy policies (‘Cantonal leverage’). These three perspectives reflect different sets of values and priorities for local, cantonal and national interests, revealing disagreements with the energy policy at different levels of government. The key basis for disagreement rests on which objectives of the policy to prioritize, i.e. energy efficiency, sustainable development, electricity reduction or production. Despite this disagreement, stakeholders largely agree on the importance of an inclusive and democratic decision process. These findings support calls for the explicit and systematic consideration for deep-seated values and perspectives amongst stakeholders on an evidentiary basis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190434",,"0301-4215","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/213946||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190434","10.1016/j.enpol.2017.05.033","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/226245","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Decision-making||Energy policy||Stakeholders||Perspectives||Public acceptance||Q methodology","Do stakeholders' perspectives on renewable energy infrastructure pose a risk to energy policy implementation?

In addition, in the Brazilian Amazon, new private agreements were initiated in 2006 and 2009 to limit the purchase of soy and cattle linked with deforestation. One concern is that such policies, because they are spatially heterogeneous or focus on a subset of relevant actors, might generate negative spillovers in the form of leakage of agricultural activities and deforestation to less-regulated areas, and/or a redistribution of non-compliant product sales to non-participants. In this study, we use panel data on soy and beef production and trade in agricultural frontiers of South America to examine how changes in deforestation regulations in South America have altered soy and cattle expansion and exports in this region, and to understand how these changes, if they have occurred, influence the overall effectiveness of deforestation regulations. We find no evidence of a change in soy or pasture area expansion patterns due to changes in regulations, except within the Amazon biome where pasture expansion slowed in response to more stringent regulations and coincided with pasture intensification. We do find, however, a decrease in beef imports from biomes with more stringent deforestation regulations. While this decrease may indicate the existence of leakage to countries outside the study area, it is likely offset by pasture intensification, continued opportunities for deforestation, and increasing domestic consumption from these biomes. These results point to the potential role of substitution effects between local and international consumer markets, and between different actors, in diminishing the overall effectiveness of deforestation regulations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000359718",,"0305-750X",,"10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.05.034","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/359718","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Soy||Cattle||Deforestation regulations||Leakage||South America||Amazon","The Restructuring of South American Soy and Beef Production and Trade Under Changing Environmental Regulations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-21T13:57:31Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"188","World Development","121","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Based on simulations with a spatial partial equilibrium model, we analyze the changes in consumption, prices, and social welfare up to 2022 induced by the infrastructure expansions planned for this period, for the current market, as well as for three hypothetical scenarios: a halt of Russian gas deliveries to the EU during the winter period (RU-); a simultaneous doubling of available LNG (LNG+); and for Brexit, in which the United Kingdom market is isolated from the EU. In the case of the current market, the new infrastructure leads to a slight decrease of wholesale prices. Moreover, the potential of suppliers to exert market power decreases significantly, particularly in the Baltic states and Finland which are the most exposed countries today, and consumer surplus increases by 17.4% in the EU. In the RU- scenario, consumer surplus decreases across Europe, with the largest losses occurring in the Baltic states, as well as in Finland, Poland and Romania. In the LNG+ scenario, the gains in consumer surplus are primarily found in Western Europe. However, the planned infrastructure expansions distribute the gains and losses in consumer surplus more evenly over all EU member states, with the exception of Romania. In the Brexit scenario, consumer surplus decreases by up to 5.1% in the United Kingdom, 19.2% in Ireland, and 3.6% in the other EU countries. Our results allow us to distinguish three categories of projects: (i) Change in gas availability, leading to a general increase or decrease of social welfare all over the EU. The only project increasing social welfare in all scenarios in most countries is the Trans-Anatolian Gas Pipeline (TANAP); (ii) existing gas sources made available to additional countries. This leads to an increase of social welfare in the newly connected countries, while social welfare drops slightly everywhere else; (iii) projects with a marginal effect on the market. Most notably, the recently announced Turkish Stream falls into this category. Our results indicate that if all proposed infrastructure projects are realized, the EU's single market will become a reality in 2019 when Finland is interconnected to the EU markets. However, we also find that social welfare can only be increased significantly for the EU as a whole if new gas sources become accessible. At the same time, efficiency gains, albeit decreasing social welfare, help to improve the situation of consumers and decrease the dependency of the EU as a whole on external suppliers.",,,,"0140-9883||1873-6181",,"10.1016/j.eneco.2017.07.002","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/192449","en","Elsevier",,,"Natural gas||Computational market equilibrium||European market outlook||Social welfare analysis||Linear complementarity program||Market power","European Union gas market development",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"C6 - Mathematical Methods; Programming Models; Mathematical and Simulation Modeling::C61 - Optimization Techniques; Programming Models; Dynamic Analysis||C7 - Game Theory and Bargaining Theory::C72 - Noncooperative Games||F1 - Trade::F15 - Economic Integration||L1 - Market Structure, Firm Strategy, and Market Performance::L13 - Oligopoly and Other Imperfect Markets||D4 - Market Structure, Pricing, and Design::D43 - Oligopoly and Other Forms of Market Imperfection||Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics::Q4 - Energy||Q4 - Energy::Q47 - Energy Forecasting","2017-10-06T05:05:32Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85027445735",,"000412033900043","Energy econ.",,"Energy Economics","66","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A growing body of literature has analyzed the welfare effects, with mixed results. Yet, there are important knowledge gaps. First, most existing studies have looked at the effects of one standard in one country. When comparing between studies it is unclear whether dissimilar outcomes are the result of different standards or different local conditions. Second, most studies have used cross-section data, so that selectivity issues remain a challenge. Third, existing work has primarily analyzed effects in terms of purely economic indicators, such as prices and income, ignoring other dimensions of household welfare. We address these shortcomings using panel data from small-scale coffee producers in Uganda and comparing the effects of two of the most popular sustainability standards, namely Organic and Fairtrade. Welfare effects are analyzed in terms of household expenditures, child education, and nutrition. Results show that Organic and Fairtrade both have positive effects on total consumption expenditures. However, notable differences are observed in terms of the other outcomes. Organic contributes to improved nutrition but has no effect on education. For Fairtrade it is exactly the other way around. We explore the mechanisms behind these differences.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539552",,"0306-9192||1873-5657",,"10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.07.010","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539552","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Certification||Education||Food standards||Nutrition||Panel data||Welfare","Trading off nutrition and education?

Given that such strategies may be inconsistent with strategies to limit climate change to below 2 °C, we address the question of whether such use of gas is necessary or cost effective. We conduct a techno-economic case study of Switzerland, using a cost optimization model. We explore a range of electricity costs, comparing scenarios in which gas is used as a source of base-load power, a source of balancing capacity, and not used at all. Costs at the high end of the range show that a complete decarbonization increases system-wide costs by 3% compared to a gas bridging scenario, and 13–46% compared to a carbon-intensive scenario, depending on the relative shares of solar and wind. Costs at the low end of the range show that system-wide costs are equal or lower for both completely decarbonized and gas bridging scenarios. In conclusion, gas delivers little to no cost savings as a bridging fuel in a system that switches to wind and solar.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190235",,"1996-1073","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190235||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/211656||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/213933","10.3390/en10070861","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/214922","en","MDPI AG","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Concentrating solar power||cost projections||Decarbonization||Switzerland||Wind offshore","Do we need gas as a bridging fuel?

A 100 member initial condition ensemble of the global circulation model HadAM3P is compared with both the multi-model ensemble from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5) and the CMIP5 atmosphere-only counterparts (AMIP5). The use of HadAM3P allows for huge ensembles to be computed relatively fast, thereby providing unique insights into the dynamics of extremes. The analysis focuses on mid Northern Latitudes (primarily Europe) during winter, and is compared with ERA-Interim reanalysis. The tri-modal Atlantic eddy-driven jet distribution is remarkably well captured in HadAM3P, but not so in the CMIP5 or AMIP5 multi-model mean, although individual models fare better. The well known underestimation of blocking in the Atlantic region is apparent in CMIP5 and AMIP5, and also, to a lesser extent, in HadAM3P. Pacific blocking features are well produced in all modeling initiatives. Blocking duration is biased towards models reproducing too many short-lived events in all three modelling systems. Associated storm tracks are too zonal over the Atlantic in the CMIP5 and AMIP5 ensembles, but better simulated in HadAM3P with the exception of being too weak over Western Europe. In all cases, the CMIP5 and AMIP5 performances were almost identical, suggesting that the biases in atmospheric modes considered here are not strongly coupled to SSTs, and perhaps other model characteristics such as resolution are more important. For event attribution studies, it is recommended that rather than taking statistics over the entire CMIP5 or AMIP5 available models, only models capable of producing the relevant dynamical phenomena be employed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000218359",,"0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-016-3308-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/218359","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Event attribution||Dynamics||Mid-latitudes||Extreme","Assessing mid-latitude dynamics in extreme event attribution systems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-12-06T13:33:35Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Clim Dyn","11-12","Climate Dynamics","48","ETH Zürich||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, we characterize the degree to which federal policies in three major global food production regions that span a range of socioeconomic contexts, Brazil, New Zealand, and the United States, incentivize or disincentivize the use of integrated crop and livestock practices (ICLS). Our analysis indicates that Brazil and New Zealand have the most favorable policy environment for ICLS, while the United States provides the least favorable environment. The balance of policy incentives and disincentives across our three cases studies mirrors current patterns of ICLS usage. Brazil and New Zealand have both undergone a trend toward mixed crop livestock systems in recent years, while the United States has transitioned rapidly toward continuous crop and livestock production. If transitions to ICLS are desired, particularly in the United States, it will be necessary to change agricultural, trade, environmental, biofuels, and food safety policies that currently buffer farmers from risk, provide too few incentives for pollution reduction, and restrict the presence of animals in crop areas. It will also be necessary to invest more in research and development in all countries to identify the most profitable ICLS technologies in each region.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000359713",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su9030473","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/359713","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sustainable agriculture||Agroecology||United States||New Zealand||Brazil","Policies for Reintegrating Crop and Livestock Systems: A Comparative Analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-21T13:52:53Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Sustainability","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Social learning, an ongoing adaptive process of knowledge generation, reflection and synthesis, may enhance people’s awareness about climate change and its impacts, with positive outcomes for their adaptive capacity. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of factors promoting social learning in climate change adaptation initiatives in South Africa. An online survey was used to obtain the views of decision makers in government and non-governmental organisations about the presence of personal factors and organisational factors that promote social learning. Descriptive analysis was used to assess these issues. The findings provide some evidence of social learning in climate change adaptation projects in South Africa, with the majority of respondents indicating that personal social learning indicators were present. Mechanisms for improved conflict resolution were, however, less prevalent. The organisational and governance-related barriers to implementation also presented significant challenges. Some of the main organisational barriers were short timeframes for implementing projects, inadequate financial resources, political interference, shortcomings in governance systems and lack of knowledge and expertise in organisations. There is a need for organisations to promote social learning by ensuring that their organisational environment and governance structures are conducive for their employees to embrace social learning. This will help contribute to the overall success of climate change adaptation initiatives.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000213942",,"1996-1421||2072-845X",,"10.4102/jamba.v9i1.292","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/213942","en","AOSIS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","adaptation||climate change||social learning||South Africa","The use of and obstacles to social learning in climate change adaptation initiatives in South Africa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-11-27T10:53:30Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","Jàmbá: Journal of Disaster Risk Studies","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Ideally, all of this new supply is carbon-neutral. The potentials for renewables in SSA suffice for any conceivable demand, but the wind power and photovoltaic resources are intermittent and difficult to integrate in the weak electricity grids. Here, we investigate the potential for supplying SSA demand centers with dispatchable electricity from concentrating solar power (CSP) stations equipped with thermal storage. We show that, given anticipated cost reductions from technological improvements, power from CSP could be competitive with coal power in Southern Africa by 2025; but in most SSA countries, power from CSP may not be competitive. We also show that variations in risk across countries influences the cost of power from CSP more than variations in solar resources. If policies to de-risk CSP investment to financing cost levels found in industrialized countries were successfully implemented, power from CSP could become cheaper than coal power by 2025 in all SSA countries. Policies to increase institutional capacity and cooperation among SSA countries could reduce costs further. With dedicated policy measures, therefore, CSP could become an economically attractive electricity option for all SSA countries.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000190784",,"0301-4215","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/205820||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/199918||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/190784||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/213949","10.1016/j.enpol.2016.12.008","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/227451","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Renewable electricity trade||Sub-Saharan Africa||Geographic analysis||Transmission||Concentrating solar power","Impact of political and economic barriers for concentrating solar power in Sub-Saharan Africa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-10-06T02:28:15Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,"Desertection - Social challenges of trans-Mediterranean renewable power cooperation","313553","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,"85004008380",,"000397357200007","Energy Policy","102","Energy Policy","102","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The Shuhi have grown paddy rice since times immemorial at an unusually high altitude (ca. 2,300 m above sea level). This article aims to explain this conundrum not merely through the ecology (as is common among Tibetan area specialists), but by researching the cultivation and consumption of rice as a historically-evolved cultural practice. According to a recently formulated agro-archaeological hypothesis regarding the macro-region of Eurasia, it is possible to identify two supra-regional culture complexes distinguished by their respective culinary technologies: rice-boiling versus wheat-grinding-and-baking. The hypothesis posits that the fault line between the two supra-regional cultural complexes is precisely along this river gorges corridor. In this article we provide support for this hypothesis arguing that Shuhi ritual and kinship practices have much affinity with those of other rice-boiling peoples in Southeast Asia, whereas certain of their current religious practices are shared with the wheat-grinding Tibetans. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488876",,"0004-4717||2235-5871",,"10.1515/asia-2016-0023","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488876","en","De Gruyter","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","House||Hearth||Rice||Boiling||Culinary technology||Southwest China","Condensing Life Substances within the House: The Rice-Boiling Shuhi of Southwest China",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-08T15:03:39Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","Asiatische Studien - Études Asiatiques","71","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We undertook a systematic review of the scientific literature to illuminate this relationship and found a limited scientific basis for policymaking. Our results indicate that knowledge on the sustainable development impacts of bioenergy production is concentrated in a few well-studied countries, focuses on environmental and economic impacts, and mostly relates to dedicated agricultural biomass plantations. The scope and methodological approaches in studies differ widely and only a small share of the studies sufficiently reports on context and/or baseline conditions, which makes it difficult to get a general understanding of the attribution of impacts. Nevertheless, we identified regional patterns of positive or negative impacts for all categories – environmental, economic, institutional, social and technological. In general, economic and technological impacts were more frequently reported as positive, while social and environmental impacts were more frequently reported as negative (with the exception of impacts on direct substitution of GHG emission from fossil fuel). More focused and transparent research is needed to validate these patterns and develop a strong science underpinning for establishing policies and governance agreements that prevent/mitigate negative and promote positive impacts from bioenergy production.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000115182",,"1757-1693||1757-1707","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/199896||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/115182","10.1111/gcbb.12338","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/206678","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Agriculture||Bioenergy||Food Security||Forestry||Mitigation||Sustainable development","Bioenergy production and sustainable development: Science base for policymaking remains limited",,"Review Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,"2017-06-12T04:17:33Z",,,,"pub:177000",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936544e93eac37645",,"84962628854",,"000402740900005","Glob.

However, despite the need for such collaboration being expressed more frequently and intensely, it remains unclear to what degree such collaboration actually takes place, what trends and developments there are and which actors are involved. Previous studies, often based on bibliometric analysis of large bodies of literature, partly observed an increase in interdisciplinary collaboration in general, but in particular, the collaboration among distant fields was less explored. Other more qualitative studies found that interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly between natural and social scientists was not well developed, and obstacles abounded. To shed some light on the actual status and developments of this collaboration, we performed an analysis based on a sample of articles on groundwater research. We first identified journals and articles therein that potentially combined natural and social science aspects of groundwater research. Next, we analysed the disciplinary composition of their authors’ teams, cited references, titles and keywords, making use of our detailed personal expertise in groundwater research and its interdisciplinary aspects. We combined several indicators developed from this analysis into a final classification of the degree of multidisciplinarity of each article. Covering the period between 1990 and 2014, we found that the overall percentage of multidisciplinary articles was in the low single-digit range, with only slight increases over the past decades. The interdisciplinarity of individuals plays a major role compared to interdisciplinarity involving two or more researchers. If collaboration with natural sciences takes place, social science is represented most often by economists. As a side result, we found that journals publishing multidisciplinary research had lower impact factors on average, and multidisciplinary papers were cited much less than mono-disciplinary ones.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000240994",,"1932-6203","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/220305||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128398","10.1371/journal.pone.0170754","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/240994","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Interdisciplinary Collaboration between Natural and Social Sciences – Status and Trends Exemplified in Groundwater Research",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-06-12T19:44:21Z",,,,"pub:191308",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936554037fe459095","006206116","85010904858",,"000396211400039","PLoS ONE","1","PLoS ONE","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The narrower purpose is to show practical use of scientific knowledge in DRM actions in Europe. The report shall provide reviews of the scientific evidence base and its practical use in various areas of disaster risk management, in a format that is intended to be accessible to the well-informed practitioner. The reviews of the scientific evidence base are summaries of (1) recent advances/outcomes of EU research projects, (2) relevant national work and (3) relevant international work.The final scope of the report is naturally divided into three distinct parts: understanding risk, communicating risk and managing risk. The report is one of the most visible objectives of DRMKC aiming to bridge science and policy as well as operation communities. It is the first in a series and therefore comprehensive in scope but selective in topic. It will fill the gap in preparation for Sendai framework for DRR and show possibilities to strengthen society’s resilience by using science and technology.",,,"978-92-79-60679-3||978-92-79-60678-6","1831-9424||1018-5593",,"10.2788/842809","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/297819","en","Publications Office of the European Union",,,,"Science for disaster risk management 2017: knowing better and losing less",,"Report","Metadata only",,,,"2018-10-22T11:26:19Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/science-disaster-risk-management-2017-knowing-better-and-losing-less",,,,"Science for Disaster Risk Management","EUR 28034","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We address this question by exploring knowledge integration within four thematic synthesis processes of the Swiss National Research Programme 61 Sustainable Water Management (NRP 61). Drawing on literature from inter- and transdisciplinary research, we developed an analytical framework to map different methods and procedures of knowledge integration. We use this framework to characterize the variety of methods and procedures that were combined in the four processes to produce thematic synthesis reports. We suggest that the variety of combinations observed reflects the different objectives and questions that guided the processes of knowledge integration as well as the different roles that leaders assumed in these processes. Although the framework was developed in the course of NRP 61, we consider it as a basis for designing ex ante new synthesis processes by defining and sequencing different synthesis stages and by identifying, for each stage, the contributions of specific scientific and societal actors, the purpose of their contributions, and the methods and procedures supporting their contributions. Used in a formative evaluation process, the framework supports reflection on and adaptation of synthesis processes and also facilitates the generation of new knowledge for designing future processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000130324",,"1708-3087",,"10.5751/ES-08955-220127","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/130324","en","Resilience Alliance Publications","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Knowledge integration||Methods||Procedures||Sustainable water management||Synthesis","Methods and procedures of transdisciplinary knowledge integration: Empirical insights from four thematic synthesis processes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-06-12T20:47:14Z",,,,"pub:193330",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593655662c28d82008","005571158","85016746154",,"000399397700018",,"1","Ecology and Society","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Confidence in climate projections relies on the adequacy of climate models for those projections. The question of how to argue for the adequacy of models for climate projections has not gotten sufficient attention in the climate modeling community. The most common way to evaluate a climate model is to assess in a quantitative way degrees of ‘model fit’; that is, how well model results fit observation-based data (empirical accuracy) and agree with other models or model versions (robustness). However, such assessments are largely silent about what those degrees of fit imply for a model's adequacy for projecting future climate. We provide a conceptual framework for discussing the evaluation of the adequacy of models for climate projections. Drawing on literature from philosophy of science and climate science, we discuss the potential and limits of inferences from model fit. We suggest that support of a model by background knowledge is an additional consideration that can be appealed to in arguments for a model's adequacy for long-term projections, and that this should explicitly be spelled out. Empirical accuracy, robustness and support by background knowledge neither individually nor collectively constitute sufficient conditions in a strict sense for a model's adequacy for long-term projections. However, they provide reasons that can be strengthened by additional information and thus contribute to a complex non-deductive argument for the adequacy of a climate model or a family of models for long-term climate projections.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000125398",,"1757-7780||1757-7799","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/125398||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/213284","10.1002/wcc.454","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/215008","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Building confidence in climate model projections: an analysis of inferences from fit",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-06-12T18:04:26Z",,,,"pub:187999",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936550f8315068160",,"85018214663",,"000399906300004",,"3","WIREs Climate Change","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Medical pluralism is thus in many developing countries the rule rather than the exception, which is why the World Health Organization is calling for intercultural partnerships to improve health care in these regions. They are, however, challenging due to disparate knowledge systems and lack of trust that hamper understanding and collaboration. We developed a collaborative, patient-centered boundary mechanism to overcome these challenges and to foster intercultural partnerships in health care. To assess its impact on the quality of intercultural patient care in a medically pluralistic developing country, we conducted and evaluated a case study.  Methods  The case study took place in Guatemala, since previous efforts to initiate intercultural medical partnerships in this country were hampered by intense historical and societal conflicts. It was designed by a team from ETH Zurich’s Transdisciplinarity Lab, the National Cancer Institute of Guatemala, two traditional Councils of Elders and 25 Mayan healers from the Kaqchikel and Q’eqchi’ linguistic groups. It was implemented from January 2014 to July 2015. Scientists and traditional political authorities collaborated to facilitate workshops, comparative diagnoses and patient referrals, which were conducted jointly by biomedical and traditional practitioners. The traditional medical practices were thoroughly documented, as were the health-seeking pathways of patients, and the overall impact was evaluated.  Results  The boundary mechanism was successful in discerning barriers of access for indigenous patients in the biomedical health system, and in building trust between doctors and healers. Learning outcomes included a reduction of stereotypical attitudes towards traditional healers, improved biomedical procedures due to enhanced self-reflection of doctors, and improved traditional health care due to refined diagnoses and adapted treatment strategies. In individual cases, the beneficial effects of traditional treatments were remarkable, and the doctors continued to collaborate with healers after the study was completed. Comparison of the two linguistic groups illustrated that the outcomes are highly context-dependent.  Conclusions  If well adapted to local context, patient-centered boundary mechanisms can enable intercultural partnerships by creating access, building trust and fostering mutual learning, even in circumstances as complex as those in Guatemala. Creating multilateral patient-centered boundary mechanisms is thus a promising approach to improve health care in medically pluralistic developing countries.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000191609",,,,"10.1186/s13002-017-0170-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/191609","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Intercultural health||Central America||Traditional medicine||Mayan medicine||Partnerships||Guatemala||Boundary management||Integrative medicine","Patient-centered boundary mechanisms to foster intercultural partnerships in health care: a case study in Guatemala",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-10-06T03:27:57Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85027190689",,"000408027100002",,,"JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this paper, we focus on Shuhi kinship practices that accord the house the importance it appears to have for the Shuhi themselves. We demonstrate that the Shuhi engage in kinship practices that are ‘hearth-oriented’ (Hsu 1998b: 67–99) in a dynamic process affected by the current political economic changes in reformist China and religious revivalism in Tibet. The ‘hearth-oriented’ kinship practices we discuss include issues of who among the offspring continues to live in the house of their parents, how places of worship in a house are oriented in relation to the physical environment and the divine landscape, and how practices regarding the naming of houses are changing from deictics of place to lineage and family names. Based on empirical data, gathered between 1996–2011, we show that there are significant differences in all practices, which reflect a Tibetan-Chinese gradient along the north-south axis of Shuhi settlements.

We seek to understand why many of the farmers living in the Brazilian Amazon, home to the world’s largest tropical agricultural-forest frontier, persist in agricultural activities associated with low incomes and high environmental damage. To answer this question, we assess the factors that shape the development and distribution of agricultural activities and farmer well-being in these frontiers. Our study utilizes a uniquely comprehensive social-ecological dataset from two regions in the eastern Brazilian Amazon and employs a novel conceptual framework that highlights the interdependencies between household attributes, agricultural activities, and well-being. We find that livestock production, which yields the lowest per hectare incomes, remains the most prevalent land use in remote areas, but many examples of high income fruit, horticulture, and staple crop production exist on small properties, particularly in peri-urban areas. The transition to more profitable land uses is limited by lagging supply chain infrastructure, social preferences, and the fact that income associated with land use activities is not a primary source of perceived life quality. Instead subjective well-being is more heavily influenced by the nonmonetary attributes of a rural lifestyle (safety, tranquility, community relations, etc.). We conclude that transitions away from low-income land uses in agricultural-forest frontiers of the Brazilian Amazon need not abandon a land-focused vision of development, but will require policies and programs that identify and discriminate households based on a broader set of household assets, cultural attributes, and aspirations than are traditionally applied. At a broader scale, access to distant markets for high value crops must be improved via investments in processing, storage, and marketing infrastructure.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000359712",,"1708-3087",,"10.5751/es-09364-220327","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/359712","en","Resilience Alliance Publications","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","cattle||land use transitions||rural development||social capital||sustainable livelihoods","Explaining the persistence of low income and environmentally degrading land uses in the Brazilian Amazon",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-21T13:51:03Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Ecology and Society","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While grid extension is claimed as necessary, stakeholder opposition has slowed down this process. To alleviate this tension, increased stakeholder participation is considered as a solution to increase acceptance. The question of stakeholder empowerment is central to participation and it is assumed that higher levels of empowerment improve planning processes. In this paper, we describe, evaluate and compare the planning processes for very high-voltage transmission lines in France and Norway by means of a document analysis. We operationalize the degree of empowerment in three levels: information, consultation and cooperation. The results reveal low stakeholder empowerment that barely rises above the level of consultation. The evaluation of recent projects entailing innovations to enhance stakeholder participation reveals a trend of increasing empowerment levels, especially in the early phases of the planning procedure, i.e. the discussion about the needs for new lines and about the needs of the affected stakeholders. The results suggest that current planning regulations can benefit from high levels of stakeholder empowerment, especially in the early phases of the planning process.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000124395",,"2214-6296",,"10.1016/j.erss.2016.10.002","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/124395","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Power lines||Acceptance||Empowerment||Participation","Stakeholder empowerment through participatory planning practices: The case of electricity transmission lines in France and Norway",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2017-06-12T17:29:03Z",,,,"pub:186878",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654fcea84754856","010152760","85006049695",,"000396395200017",,,"Energy Research & Social Science","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, climate change can be a fluid concept for the public to understand as it intrinsically uncertain and involves long time scales. Given the importance of the assessment reports published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) it is essential that this accrued evidence is accessible to policymakers. However, little is understood about how the representation of the science in these reports is perceived, comprehended and used in the decision process. This has only contributed to the overwhelming criticism of the IPCC communication approach, which arguably is not new information but has been apparent in the literature for some time now. Still, few have attempted to systematically evaluate how climate science is visually represented in the IPCC publications. This thesis attempts to fill this gap in understanding by examining how climate visualisations could be more effectively designed and communicated to non-technical audiences.  In a first step, an empirical test was conducted on a central figure from the Summary for Policymakers (SPMs) published in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The results highlight how novice readers, even highly educated ones, are unable to distinguish between different types of uncertainties shown without substantial guidance. Instead, readers saw a great deal of uncertainty in this figure but falsely attributed it to the climate model(s) and ignored the scenario uncertainties. The inability to distinguish between the various sources of climate uncertainties exemplifies the importance of rigorously pretesting SPM visuals. Following up on these findings, a further study was conducted to examine four visual devices typically used by Working Group I (WGI) in the SPMs for the IPCC AR4 and Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) plus two open sourced infographics. Pre-attentive visual features were found to significantly influence the judgement and confidence of readers. While the infographic supported the extraction of relevant information it was not considered to be as legitimate as the scientific looking SPM figures. Thus, providing further evidence that the design structure itself carries important perceptual information. Using an excerpt of the AR5 Synthesis Report (SYR) SPM the final study of this thesis examined the semantic arrangement of the text and visuals in this report. Certain improvement measures were implemented and the new layout was found to be more aesthetically pleasing and attractive than the original. Such findings illustrate that certain improvements in the visual communication can be achieved without altering the IPCC mandate and procedures.  As the preparation work for the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) begins, the timing of this thesis is highly relevant. While we can have no influence on the final outcome of the next assessment cycle, it is our intention to provide IPCC authors with timely and relevant guidance. This work has contributed to our greater understanding of visual communication in the context of climate change but it has also underscored some of the fundamental shortcomings in this research area.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000218167",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/218167","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","climate change||Visualisation analysis||Communication||uncertainty analysis||Science communication||Interdisciplinary research","An interdisciplinary study on scientific visual communication in the context of climate change",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::0 - Computer science, information & general works::0 - Computer science, information & general works||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2017-12-06T10:41:48Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"24598",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
