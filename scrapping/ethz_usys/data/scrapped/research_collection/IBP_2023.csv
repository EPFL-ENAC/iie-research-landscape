Here, we further broaden the suite of possible techniques which can directly detect MPs in suspension while differentiating the carbon contained in MPs from other natural particles and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (sp-ICP-MS) is well suited to measuring particles at trace concentrations, and the use of ICP time-of-flight-MS (ICP-TOFMS) allows one to simultaneously monitor the entire elemental spectrum to assess the full elemental composition of individual particles through developing elemental fingerprints. Because carbon is not detected in a standard operation mode with icp TOF, a dedicated optimization was necessary. Subsequently, to assess the feasibility of monitoring 12C particle pulses for the detection of MPs in more complex natural waters, two proof-of-principle studies were performed to measure MPs in waters with environmentally relevant DOC backgrounds (≤20 mg/L) and in the presence of other carbon containing particles, here, algae. Elevated DOC concentrations did not impact the enumeration of particles in suspension, and individual MPs, single algae, and aggregates of MPs and algae were clearly distinguished. The simultaneous identification of different analytes of interest allows for multiplexed sp-ICP-TOFMS experiments utilizing elemental fingerprinting of particles and is a step forward in quantifying MPs in aqueous environmental samples.",,,,"0013-936X||1520-5851","10.1021/acs.est.3c01192","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/610960","en","American Chemical Society",,,"microplastics||freshwater||algae||complex media||analysis||detection||single particle ICP-MS||ICP-TOFMS","Direct Measurement of Microplastics by Carbon Detection via Single Particle ICP-TOFMS in Complex Aqueous Suspensions","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2023-05-08T06:55:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)","186856","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Eccellenza",,,"000981970100001","Environ.

REACH requires registrants to submit data on bioaccumulation if the chemical is manufactured in and/or imported to the European Economic Area at more than 100 tonnes per year. Most of the experimental bioaccumulation studies submitted were on the bioconcentration factor (BCF) and were conducted prior to 2012, before the OECD Test Guideline 305 on Bioaccumulation in Fish was updated. An analysis of the submitted data revealed that a lot of the experimental data but also the data from QSARs and other calculation methods underestimate the actual bioaccumulation potential of hydrophobic substances considerably. One of the main reasons in the non-experimental studies is that the BCF is related there to the total concentration of the chemical in water and not to the dissolved chemical concentration. There is therefore an urgent need to re-assess the bioaccumulation potential of the hydrophobic substances registered under REACH. Based on the model calculations in the present study, between 309 and 556 substances that are registered under REACH are likely to bioaccumulate in the aquatic environment – many more than so far identified in the B assessment under REACH.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583332",,"1551-3777||1551-3793","10.1002/ieam.4714","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583332","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bioaccumulation||bioconcentration factor||hydrophobic substances||risk assessment","How error‐prone bioaccumulation experiments impact the risk assessment of hydrophobic chemicals and what could be improved","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-11-28T08:13:37Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"85144130847","000897858500001","Integr. environ. assess. manag.","3","Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The data concerning multiple generations are especially rare – an exposure scenario that is the most relevant from the standpoint of environmental reality aspect. Using Pd-doped 200 nm polystyrene NPs, which allowed for quantification of NPs in trace concentrations, the aim of the study was to evaluate the multigenerational impact of NPs for the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna. Four consecutive 21-day exposures involving F0–F3 generations of D. magna were conducted according to OECD211. NPs impact (at 0.1 mg/L and 1 mg/L) was assessed in parallel to a comparative particle mesoporous SiO2 of similar size and shape (at 1 mg/L) to deconvolute impacts of variable particle chemistry. D. magna mortality, reproductive endpoints, body length (adults and offspring) and lipid content (offspring) were assessed upon NPs and SiO2 exposures. NPs association with adults and offspring was quantified by ICP-MS through the NPs Pd-dopant. The results showed no NPs impact on D. magna at 0.1 mg/L. At 1 mg NPs/L, the only statistically significant effect on adult organisms was increased fertility in the F3 generation. Conversely, SiO2 induced 80% mortality in F3 adult D. magna and the survived adults were significantly smaller and less fertile than those of other treatments. Both particles induced decreased size and lipid content in F3 offspring. The average NPs body burdens (ng NPs/mg D. magna dwt) for the adult and offspring D. magna were 105 ± 12 and 823 ± 440, respectively at 0.1 mg/L exposure and 503 ± 176 and 621 ± 235, respectively at 1 mg/L exposure. Finally, the results of this study add to the previous findings showing that multi-generation exposure to synthetic nano-sized particles of different chemistries may disturb the energy balance of D. magna.",,,,"0269-7491||1878-2450||1873-6424","10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121213","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/598653","en","Elsevier",,,"SiO2||Mesoporous silica||Bioaccumulation||Transgenerational||Pd-doped","Multi-generation exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics showed no major adverse effects in Daphnia magna","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2023-02-15T08:52:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)||The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems","186856||168105","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Eccellenza||Ambizione",,"85148038895","000939813800001","Environ Pollut",,"Environmental Pollution","323","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We studied the yet unclear interactions of soil sulfate amendment and water management for decreasing As accumulation in rice grain in a pot experiment. We show that soil sulfate amendment (+200 mg S/kg soil) decreased grain iAs by 44% without clearly increasing grain DMA under intermittent flooding from booting stage to maturation. Under continuous flooding during this period, sulfate amendment decreased grain iAs only by 25% but increased grain DMA by 68%. The mechanisms of sulfate amendment effects on grain iAs were not explained by porewater composition or in-planta As sequestration but were allocated to the rhizosphere. Grain iAs closely correlated with As in the root iron-plaque (r = 0.92) which was effectively decreased by sulfate amendment and may have acted as an iAs source for rice uptake. Although both sulfate amendment and intermittent flooding substantially increased porewater DMA concentrations, it was the continuous flooding, irrespective of sulfate amendment, that resulted in rice straighthead disease with 47–55% less yield and 258–320% more DMA in grains than intermittent flooding. This study suggests that combining soil sulfate amendment and intermittent flooding can help to secure the quantity and quality of rice produced in As-affected areas. Our results also imply the key role of rhizosphere processes in controlling both iAs and DMA accumulation in rice which should be elucidated in the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000596722",,"0269-7491||1878-2450||1873-6424","10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121152","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/596722","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Food safety||Yield||Inorganic As||DMA||Iron plaque||Intermittent flooding","Decreasing arsenic in rice: Interactions of soil sulfate amendment and water management","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-02-02T07:51:49Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Reducing Cd and As uptake by rice in contaminated paddy soils: From biogeochemical processes to improved paddy management","170120","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Sino-Swiss Science and Technology Cooperation (SSSTC)",,"85149427545","000932517700001","Environ Pollut",,"Environmental Pollution","322","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To analyse the correlation between global richness and nitrogen fixation rates, we integrate -omics and traditional microscopic based observations and make use of Species Distribution Models that have been developed to cope with datasets that suffer from uneven sampling efforts and scarce observations. Global diazotroph richness is generally high in subtropical and tropical marine regions declining polewards with hotspots of diversity found in the Pacific and Indian Ocean. We provide the first global biogeographic pattern of non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs that show increased probability of occurrences within upwelling regions when contrasted to cyanobacterial diazotrophs. Finally, to assess the relationship between global diazotroph richness and ecosystem function, we analysed the correlation between our global richness projections and global nitrogen fixation rates from two separate publications and found a positive relationship between global diazotroph richness and nitrogen fixation rates supporting the resource use efficiency hypothesis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594885",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594885","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Nitrogen fixation increases with diazotroph diversity in the global ocean","Conference Poster","Open access",,,"2023-01-25T15:31:03Z",,,,,"yes","15th IBP PhD Congress 2023","April 14, 2023","Dübendorf, Switzerland",,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

PS-NPLs induced dose-dependent reactive oxygen species overproduction, membrane damage and metabolic alterations. To shed light on the environmental fate of PS-NPLs, the short-term distribution of PS-NPLs under static (using lake water and sediments) and stirring (using river water and sediments) conditions was studied at laboratory scale. The results showed that most NPLs remained in the water column over the course of 48 h. The maximum percentage of settled particles (∼ 30 %) was found under stirring conditions in comparison with the ∼ 10 % observed under static ones.

Here we study how interactions mediated by the exchange of metabolites through the environment change over time within a simple marine microbial community. We used a microfluidic-based approach that allows us to disentangle the effect cells have on their environment from how they respond to their environment. We found that the interactions between two species-a degrader of chitin and a cross-feeder that consumes metabolic by-products-changes dynamically over time as cells modify their environment. Cells initially interact positively and then start to compete at later stages of growth. Our results demonstrate that interactions between microorganisms are not static and depend on the state of the environment, emphasizing the importance of disentangling how modifications of the environment affects species interactions. This experimental approach can shed new light on how interspecies interactions scale up to community level processes in natural environments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000595603",,"1751-7362||1751-7370","10.1038/s41396-022-01312-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/595603","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Food webs||Microbial ecology||Population dynamics||Water microbiology","Changes in interactions over ecological time scales influence single-cell growth dynamics in a metabolically coupled marine microbial community","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-01-30T04:11:37Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"A microscale analysis of the causes and consequences of the spatial arrangement of biological functions in microbial consortia","169978","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,"85145825818","000910809600001","ISME J","3","The ISME Journal","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A central environmental variable affecting photochemical processes in surface waters is the incoming solar irradiance, as this initiates these processes. However, clear-sky incident irradiance spectra are often used when evaluating the fate of aquatic contaminants, leading to an overestimation of contaminant decay rates due to photochemical transformation. In this work, incident irradiance satellite data were used to develop global-scale non-clear-sky correction factors for commonly used reference irradiance spectra. Non-clear-sky conditions can decrease incident irradiance by over 90% depending on the geographic location and time of the year, with latitudes above 40°N being most heavily affected by seasons. The impact of non-clear-sky conditions on contaminant half-lives was illustrated in a case study of triclosan in lake Greifensee, which showed a 39% increase in the triclosan half-life over the course of a year under non-clear-sky conditions. A global annual average correction factor of 0.76 was determined as an approximate way to account for non-clear-sky conditions. The correction factors are developed at monthly and seasonal resolutions for every location on the globe between 70°N and 60°S at a 4 km spatial resolution and can be used by researchers, practitioners, and regulators who need improved estimates of incident irradiance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000599474",,"0013-936X||1520-5851","10.1021/acs.est.2c07359","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/599474","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","incident irradiance||correction factors||satellite data||photochemical processes||non-clear-sky conditions||reference spectra","Global Corrections to Reference Irradiance Spectra for Non-Clear-Sky Conditions","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-02-20T08:32:31Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Reactivity-based characterization of photoexcited natural organic matter","188565","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85147411929","000931255700001||000935719500001","Environ.

This growth of the ocean sink matches expectations based on the increase in atmospheric CO2, but research has shown that the sink is more variable than long assumed. In this Review, we discuss trends and variations in the ocean carbon sink. The sink stagnated during the 1990s with rates hovering around –2 Pg C year–1, but strengthened again after approximately 2000, taking up around –3 Pg C year–1 for 2010–2019. The most conspicuous changes in uptake occurred in the high latitudes, especially the Southern Ocean. These variations are caused by changes in weather and climate, but a volcanic eruption-induced reduction in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate and the associated global cooling contributed as well. Understanding the variability of the ocean carbon sink is crucial for policy making and projecting its future evolution, especially in the context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change stocktaking activities and the deployment of CO2 removal methods. This goal will require a global-level effort to sustain and expand the current observational networks and to better integrate these observations with models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000595538",,"2662-138X","10.1038/s43017-022-00381-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/595538","en","Nature",,,"Ocean carbon cycle||Carbon budget||Oceanography||Climate","Trends and variability in the ocean carbon sink","Review Article","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2023-01-28T17:34:40Z","2023-07-24",,,,"yes",,,,"Climate-Carbon Interactions in the Coming Century||Southern Ocean Carbon and Heat Impact on Climate||Our common future ocean – quantifying coupled cycles of carbon, oxygen, and nutrients for determining and achieving safe operating spaces with respect to tipping points","821003||821001||820989","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC||EC","H2020||H2020||H2020",,"85146659046","000919937100001","Nat Rev Earth Environ",,"Nature Reviews Earth & Environment","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Even less is known regarding nanoplastic pollution (generally considered to be plastic particles < 1 μm). Due to their small size, nanoplastics pose unique challenges and potential risks. We herein report a technique focused on the concentration and measurement of nanoplastics in aqueous systems. Hydrophobically functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (HDTMS-FeNPs) were used as part of a method to separate and concentrate nanoplastics from environmentally relevant matrices, here using metal-doped polystyrene nanoplastics (PAN-Pd@NPs) to enable low-level detection and validation of the separation technique. Using a magnetic separation flow cell, PAN-Pd@NPs were removed from suspensions and captured on regenerated cellulose membranes. Depending on the complexity of solution chemistry, variable extraction rates were possible. PAN-Pd@NPs were recovered from ultrapure water, synthetic freshwater, synthetic freshwater with a model natural organic matter isolate (NOM; Suwannee River Humic Acid), and from synthetic marine water, with recoveries for PAN-Pd@NPs of 84.9%, 78.9%, 70.4%, and 56.1%, respectively. During the initial method testing, it was found that the addition of NaCl was needed in the ultrapure water, synthetic freshwater and synthetic fresh water with NOM to induce particle aggregation and attachment. These results indicate that magnetic nanoparticles in combination with a flow-through system is a promising technique to extract nanoplastics from aqueous suspensions with various compositions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000598233",,"2662-4966","10.1186/s43591-022-00051-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/598233","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Extraction and concentration of nanoplastic particles from aqueous suspensions using functionalized magnetic nanoparticles and a magnetic flow cell","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-02-13T13:07:24Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems||Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)","168105||186856","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Ambizione||Eccellenza",,,,,,"Microplastics and Nanoplastics","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The transport of Cant from the surface into the ocean interior, where most of it is accumulating, is the rate limiting step for this uptake. Yet multi-decadal trends in the ocean interior storage of Cant have not been assessed at global scale. Here, we determine such trends by applying the eMLR(C*) regression method to ocean interior observations collected between 1989 and 2020. We find that the global ocean storage of Cant grew by 29 ± 3 Pg C dec-1 and 27 ± 3 Pg C dec-1 (±1σ) from 1994 to 2004 and 2004 to 2014, respectively. Although the two growth rates are not significantly different, they imply a reduction of the oceanic uptake fraction of the anthropogenic emissions from 36 ± 4 % to 27 ± 3 % during the respective decades. We attribute this reduction to a decrease of the ocean buffer capacity and changes in ocean circulation. In the Atlantic Ocean, the maximum storage rate shifted from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere, plausibly caused by a weaker formation rate of North Atlantic Deep Waters and an intensified ventilation of mode and intermediate waters in the Southern Hemisphere. Between 1994 and 2004, the oceanic Cant accumulation exceeded the net air-sea flux by 8 ± 4 Pg C dec-1, suggesting a loss of natural carbon from the ocean during this decade. Our results reveal a substantial vulnerability of the ocean carbon sink.","application/x-hdf5||application/netcdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590910",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590910","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Decadal Trends in the Oceanic Storage of Anthropogenic Carbon from 1994 to 2014","Dataset","Open access",,,"2023-01-09T08:50:29Z",,"indefinite","292278994-08-17T07:12:55Z",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

High-resolution paleoenvironmental records are essential to contextualize archaeological data and to evaluate the sociopolitical response of ancient societies to environmental variability. Middle-to-Late Holocene water levels in Lake Titicaca were reevaluated through a transfer function model based on measurements of organic carbon stable isotopes, combined with high-resolution profiles of other geochemical variables and paleoshoreline indicators. Our reconstruction indicates that following a prolonged low stand during the Middle Holocene (4000 to 2400 BCE), lake level rose rapidly ~15 m by 1800 BCE, and then increased another 3 to 6 m in a series of steps, attaining the highest values after ~1600 CE. The largest lake-level increases coincided with major sociopolitical changes reported by archaeologists. In particular, at the end of the Formative Period (500 CE), a major lake-level rise inundated large shoreline areas and forced populations to migrate to higher elevation, likely contributing to the emergence of the Tiwanaku culture.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590863",,"0027-8424||1091-6490","10.1073/pnas.2215882120","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590863","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","central Andes||Lake Titicaca sediment||biomarkers||carbon isotopes||societies","Holocene variations in Lake Titicaca water level and their implications for sociopolitical developments in the central Andes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2023-01-08T10:30:52Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"85145428330","000969771500006","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","2","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","120","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we modelled global annual patterns of pteropod and foraminifer total carbon (TC) biomass and total inorganic carbon (TIC) export fluxes over the top 200m using an ensemble of five species distribution models (SDMs). An exhaustive newly assembled dataset of zooplankton abundance observations was used to estimate the biomass of both plankton groups. With the SDM ensemble we modeled global TC biomass depending on multiple environmental parameters. We found hotspots of mean annual pteropod biomass in the high Northern latitudes and the global upwelling systems, and in the high latitudes of both hemispheres and the tropics for foraminifers. This largely agrees with previously observed distributions. For the biomass of both groups, surface temperature is the strongest environmental correlate, followed by chlorophyll-a. We found mean annual standing stocks of 52 (48-57) Tg TC and 0.9 (0.6-1.1) Tg TC for pteropods and foraminifers, respectively. This translates to mean annual TIC fluxes of 14 (9-22) Tg TIC yr-1 for pteropod shells and 11 (3-27) Tg TIC yr-1 for foraminifer tests. These results are similar to previous estimates for foraminifers standing stocks and fluxes but approximately a factor of ten lower for pteropods. The two zooplankton calcifiers contribute approximately 1.5% each to global surface carbonate fluxes, leaving 40%-60% of the global carbonate fluxes unaccounted for.

Yet, we lack a clear understanding of how many functional groups (FGs) exist in the zooplankton and how their traits are distributed on a global scale. Here, we model and map the environmental habitats of copepod (i.e. the main component of marine zooplankton) FGs to identify regions sharing similar functional trait expression at the community level.  Taxon Marine planktonic Neocopepoda.  Location Global ocean.  Methods Factor analysis on mixed data and hierarchical clustering were used to identify copepod FGs based on five species-level functional traits. An ensemble of species distribution models was used to estimate the environmental niches of the species modelled and the community weighted mean (CWM) values of the traits studied. Ocean regions were defined based on their community-level mean trait expression using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering.  Results Eleven global copepods FGs were identified. They displayed contrasting latitudinal patterns in mean annual habitat suitability that could be explained by differences in environmental niche preferences: two FGs were associated with polar conditions, one followed the global temperature gradient, five were associated with tropical oligotrophic gyres and the remaining three with boundary currents and counter currents. Four main regions of varying CWM trait values emerged: the Southern Ocean, the northern and southern high latitudes, the tropical gyres and the boundary currents and upwelling systems.  Conclusions The present FGs will improve the representation of copepods in global marine ecosystem models. This study improves the understanding of the patterns and drivers of copepods trait biogeography and will serve as a basis for studying links between zooplankton biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in a context of climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000578164",,"0305-0270||1365-2699","10.1111/jbi.14512","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/578164","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","community weighted mean trait||functional groups||global Ocean||marine copepods||species distribution models||trait-based approach||zooplankton","Copepod functional traits and groups show divergent biogeographies in the global ocean","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-10-28T03:15:40Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Atlantic ECOsystems assessment, forecasting & sustainability","862923","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,"85140079443","000869900700001","J. biogeogr.","1","Journal of Biogeography","50","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the relatively demanding experimental effort required for noble gas sampling and analysis still limits the application of this method and many potential applications of noble gases as tracers in sediments have not yet been explored. This work aims to demonstrate versatile and novel applications of noble gas analysis in sediment pore fluids, to gain insights into hydrothermal fluid transport in the ocean, to study submarine groundwater and, thus, to broaden the application of noble gases in environmental and sedimentological research. Furthermore, this work aims at expanding the currently available methods for in-situ noble gas analysis to allow quasi-continuous noble gas measurements in low water yield environments such as sediment pore water and even trees directly in the field. This thesis consists of five main studies in which different and novel applications of noble gas analysis in pore fluids of marine and terrestrial sediments were explored:  (1) Noble gases were used to study hydrothermal fluid transport in deep-sea sediments in the Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California in the vicinity of a recently discovered active black smoker field. Results suggest that upward hydrothermal fluid transport through the sediments is limited to narrow pathways underlying the black smoker system and that the surrounding pelagic sediment do not take part in hydrothermal fluid injection into the local basin bottom water. Furthermore, noble gas data support previous hypotheses suggesting a more active phase of rigorous venting during the early stages of evolution of the hydrothermal vent field, followed by a more sedate phase that prevails until this day. This study is the first to apply noble gas analysis in deep-sea sediment to study a known active hydrothermal vent system.  (2) Dissolved noble gas concentrations were analyzed in deep-sea sediments surrounding the Azores Plateau to identify the presence of hydrothermal fluids in the pelagic sediments and to study the associated fluid transport processes. The results suggest that at the Azores transport of solutes associated with hydrothermal activity likely takes place in a spatially distributed diffusive regime, and as a consequence, hydrothermal solutes may be emitted into the bottom water over larger areas of the ocean floor. Additionally, noble gas concentrations profiles in the sediments indicate that hydrothermal signatures may only be observable in the sediment pore fluids, but not in the overlying ocean bottom water. This strongly motivates the application of noble gas analysis in sediments as a tool to identify hydrothermal fluid systems in ocean sediments.  (3) Noble gas concentrations and their respective excess air pattern typical for groundwater were used to identify offshore-freshened groundwater, i.e., freshwater found in marine sediments underlying the ocean, in the Mecklenburg Bay, Baltic Sea. Excess air patterns and reconstructed noble gas temperatures suggest an emplacement of groundwater during the early Holocene, likely during sea-level lowstands of the Baltic Sea, when local hydraulic gradients from land towards the sea were strongly enhanced. This study demonstrates for the first time that noble gases can be successfully used to identify the presence of terrestrial groundwater in marine sediments.  (4) The depositional conditions of fine-grained clays in the Binz area, Zürich, were studied by analyzing the noble gas pattern in the local sediments. The data supports previous studies speculating that the clays were deposited during the transition from the late Pleistocene to the early Holocene in response to a seismically induced a mass movement (landslide) from the close-by Uetliberg mountain.  (5) A novel prototype of a membrane probe was developed to take first steps towards overcoming the experimental difficulties and time effort required for the available traditional noble gas analysis in sediment pore fluids. The developed membrane probe can directly be connected to a portable mass spectrometer and is able to be installed in free water or sediments. This new approach, thus, allows for real-time in-situ measurements of noble gases even in sediment pore water. The potential and limitations of this new technique were studied and an experimental protocol facilitating the reliable measurement of intermittent time-series of noble gas concentrations has been developed. This prototype has since then been improved and the suggested measurement protocols were successfully employed to analyze noble gases in in soils and tree trunks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000599686",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/599686","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","noble gases; pore fluids; hydrothermal activity; hydrothermal system; groundwater; fluid transport","Stories of Noble Gases in Low Permeable Sediments, Hydrothermal Systems, and Groundwater in the Sea","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2023-02-21T08:48:52Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28947",,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These transformations can occur through either direct absorption of photons by the chemical, or through indirect processes whereby the chemical reacts with a photochemically produced reactive intermediate (PPRI). One important PPRI is singlet oxygen (¹O₂), which is generated when the ground state of the chromophoric fraction of dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorbs a photon and is excited to its triplet state (³CDOM*). The reaction of ³CDOM* with molecular oxygen generates ¹O₂.  The photons that are absorbed either by an organic contaminant directly or by the CDOM ubiquitous in surface waters are transmitted through the atmosphere from the sun. The atmosphere and the water column can impact the light field in complex ways that are not commonly accounted for in photochemical models. In the laboratory, light sources are often used that are not representative of the light from the sun, but allow for specific parameters to be elucidated, such as those that are wavelength-dependent. It is relatively straightforward to account for the photons from a laboratory light source; it is much more complicated to account for the full range of variability in light from the sun over different latitudes, seasons, and meteorological conditions.  This thesis focuses on improving our ability to accurately describe photochemical transformations that occur in the environment. The following objectives were defined: 1) Improve estimates of singlet oxygen-induced oxidations in aquatic systems, 2) Provide a global, temporally resolved set of correction factors to incident irradiance spectra to account for non-clear-sky conditions, and 3) Determine photolysis half-lives for a set of common aquatic contaminants in a field setting.  Chapters 2 and 3 address the first objective. In Chapter 2 we used time-resolved ¹O₂ phosphorescence to determine the ¹O₂ quantum yields (ΦΔ) of a variety of natural waters and organic matter isolates over a wide range of environmentally relevant wavelengths. This approach to measuring ΦΔ uses a direct measurement technique rather than commonly used steady-state measurements, and as such, result in more accurate values. Wavelength-dependency is hardly ever assessed but is crucial to accurately describe the environmental behaviour of this PPRI. We used our wavelength-dependent ΦΔ values to estimate polychromatic ΦΔ values for DOM and suggest using a light source with emission centered at 400 nm for the most environmentally relevant single-wavelength measurements of ΦΔ. In Chapter 3 we focus on determining environmentally realistic ranges of ¹O₂ steady-state concentrations ([¹O₂]SS). Typical literature values of this parameter reflect optimum conditions, such as the near-surface of a water body and summer day or solar noon irradiance. We explored the influence of a variety of environmental and physical parameters on [¹O₂]SS, and found that the mixed layer (epilimnion) depth of a lake has the largest impact on ¹O₂ quantities, followed by the latitude. Interestingly, within the epilimnion the amount of dissolved organic carbon present has a limited impact, though it is important at the near-surface.  Chapter 4 addresses the second objective, and focusses on increasing the accuracy of the incident irradiance parameter by accounting for non-clear-skies in a systematic manner. Often clear sky conditions are assumed in the context of photochemical modelling, but the impact of this assumption is generally not well understood. Satellites can provide estimates of incident irradiance by using algorithms to convert reflected light from the surface of the earth to irradiance values. Satellite-derived incident irradiance accounts for non-clear skies and is globally and temporally well-resolved but is difficult to directly incorporate into photochemical modelling. We compared satellite-derived incident irradiance values to commonly used reference irradiance spectra to derive a set of correction factors that are straightforward for researchers, practitioners and regulators to use.  The third objective is addressed in Chapter 5, where we describe a field installation that is being used to study photochemical transformation in a realistic environmental setting. We present details of the experimental setup and some preliminary data that shows the photochemical transformation of two common aquatic pollutants, diclofenac and cimetidine. This type of whole-system study is crucial to understanding the environmental behaviour of aquatic contaminants and contributes to the growing body of knowledge on this topic.  This thesis advances our understanding of how photochemical transformations occur in the environment. It provides better alternatives to some common, but inaccurate, assumptions in photochemical modelling, and contributes important insights to our understanding of real-world photolysis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000606052",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/606052","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"From clear skies and test tubes to cloudy days and deep waters: Studies on the simplifying assumptions in aquatic photochemistry","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2023-03-31T12:36:49Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"29146",,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Both aspects introduce a temporal dimension that allows quantifying rates or time scales of marine processes.

The latest studies of these tracers, supported by simulations using the North Atlantic–Arctic Ocean–Sea Ice Model (NAOSIM) and enhanced by the use of transit time distributions to more precisely accommodate mixing, have provided a rich inventory of transport data for circulation in the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans that are of great importance to global thermohaline circulation and climate.",,,,"1941-0611||1941-1405","10.1146/annurev-marine-032122-112413","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/585879","en","Annual Reviews",,,"tracer||Arctic||Atlantic||circulation||transit time distribution||¹²⁹I","Nuclear Reprocessing Tracers Illuminate Flow Features and Connectivity Between the Arctic and Subpolar North Atlantic Oceans","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-12-08T15:29:08Z",,,,"Yes","yes",,,,,,,,,,"85146365402","000915412400010",,"1","Annual Review of Marine Science","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02010 - Dep.
