The models included in the comparison are the 3d Chemistry Transport model (3dCTM), the ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model, FinROSE, the Hamburg Model of the Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere (HAMMONIA), the Karlsruhe Simulation Model of the Middle Atmosphere (KASIMA), the modeling tools for SOlar Climate Ozone Links studies (SOCOL and CAO-SOCOL), and the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM4). The comparison focuses on the energetic particle precipitation (EPP) indirect effect, that is, the polar winter descent of NOx largely produced by EPP in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. A particular emphasis is given to the impact of the sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) in January 2009 and the subsequent elevated stratopause (ES) event associated with enhanced descent of mesospheric air. The chemistry climate model simulations have been nudged toward reanalysis data in the troposphere and stratosphere while being unconstrained above. An odd nitrogen upper boundary condition obtained from MIPAS observations has further been applied to medium-top models. Most models provide a good representation of the mesospheric tracer descent in general, and the EPP indirect effect in particular, during the unperturbed (pre-SSW) period of the NH winter 2008/2009. The observed NOx descent into the lower mesosphere and stratosphere is generally reproduced within 20%. Larger discrepancies of a few model simulations could be traced back either to the impact of the models’ gravity wave drag scheme on the polar wintertime meridional circulation or to a combination of prescribed NOx mixing ratio at the uppermost model layer and low vertical resolution. In March–April, after the ES event, however, modelled mesospheric and stratospheric NOx distributions deviate significantly from the observations. The too fast and early downward propagation of the NOx tongue, encountered in most simulations, coincides with a temperature high bias in the lower mesosphere (0.2–0.05 hPa) being likely caused by an overestimation of descent velocities. On the other hand, upper mesospheric temperatures (at 0.05–0.001 hPa) are generally underestimated by the high-top models after the onset of the ES event, being indicative for too slow descent and hence too low NOx fluxes. As a consequence, the magnitude of the simulated NOx tongue is generally underestimated by these models. Descending NOx amounts simulated with medium-top models are on average closer to the observations but show a large spread of up to several hundred percent. This is primarily attributed to the different vertical model domains in which the NOx upper boundary condition is applied. In general, the intercomparison demonstrates the ability of state-of-the-art atmospheric models to reproduce the EPP indirect effect in dynamically and geomagnetically quiescent NH winter conditions. The encountered differences between observed and simulated NOx, CO, and temperature distributions during the perturbed phase of the 2009 NH winter, however, emphasize the need for model improvements in the dynamical representation of elevated stratopause events in order to allow for a better description of the EPP indirect effect under these particular conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000123931",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-2016-971","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/123931","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"HEPPA-II model-measurement intercomparison project: EPP indirect effects during the dynamically perturbed NH winter 2008/2009","Working Paper","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T17:14:21Z",,"pub:186370",,"yes",,,,"Future and Past Solar Influence on the Terrestrial Climate II","147659||147659||147659||147659","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","SNF: Sonstige||SNF: Sonstige||SNF: Sonstige||SNF: Sonstige",,"imp593654f466d8834628",,,,"Atmos. chem. phys. discuss.",,"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These mid-latitude anomalies occur on timescales of up to a month, and are related to changes in wave forcing. A change in the meridional Brewer–Dobson circulation extends from the middle stratosphere into the mesosphere and forms a temperature-change quadrupole from Equator to pole. We develop a dynamical index based on detrended, deseasonalised mid-latitude temperature. When employed in multiple linear regression, this index can account for up to 60% of the total variability of temperature, peaking at  5 hPa and dropping to 0 at  50 and  0.5 hPa, respectively, and increasing again into the mesosphere. Ozone similarly sees up to an additional 50% of variability accounted for, with a slightly higher maximum and strong altitude dependence, with zero improvement found at 10 hPa. Further, the uncertainty on all equatorial multiple-linear regression coefficients can be reduced by up to 35 and 20% in temperature and ozone, respectively, and so this index is an important tool for quantifying current and future ozone recovery.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000128332",,"1680-7375||1680-7367","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/123935||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/128332","10.5194/acp-16-15485-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/180778","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"An upper-branch Brewer-Dobson circulation index for attribution of stratospheric variability and improved ozone and temperature trend analysis","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T19:41:30Z",,"pub:191239",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936553f01bfe30435","004294181",,"000391486900004","Atmos. chem. phys.","24","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Accordingly, the observed surface radiation in Japan generally shows a strong decline until the end of the 1980s and then a recovery until around 2000. Because a substantial number of measurement stations are located within or close to populated areas, one may speculate that the observed trends are strongly influenced by local air pollution and are thus not of large-scale significance. This hypothesis poses a serious question as to what regional extent the global dimming and brightening are significant: are the global dimming and brightening truly global phenomena, or regional, or even only local? Our study focused on 14 meteorological observatories that measured all-sky surface solar radiation, zenith transmittance, and maximum transmittance. On the basis of municipality population time series, historical land use maps, recent satellite images, and actual site visits, we concluded that eight stations have been significantly influenced by urbanization, with the remaining six stations being left pristine. Between the urban and rural areas, no marked differences were identified in the temporal trends of the aforementioned meteorological parameters.

Here we infer 1540 summer temperatures from the number of dry days (NDDs) in spring (March–May) and summer (June–August) in 1540 derived from historical documentary evidence published elsewhere, and compare our estimates with present-day temperatures. We translate the NDD values into temperature distributions using a linear relationship between modeled temperature and NDD from a 3000 year pre-industrial control simulation with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Our results show medium confidence that summer mean temperatures (T JJA) and maximum temperatures (TXx) in Central Europe in 1540 were warmer than the respective present-day mean summer temperatures (assessed between 1966–2015). The model-based reconstruction suggests further that with a probability of 40%–70%, the highest daily temperatures in 1540 were even warmer than in 2003, while there is at most a 20% probability that the 1540 mean summer temperature was warmer than that of 2003 in Central Europe. As with other state-of-the-art analyses, the uncertainty of the reconstructed 1540 summer weather in this study is considerable, for instance as extrapolation is required because 1540-like events are not captured by the employed Earth system model (ESM), and neither by other ESMs. However, in addition to paleoclimatological approaches we introduce here an independent methodology to estimate 1540 temperatures, and contribute consequently to a reduced overall uncertainty in the analysis of this event. The characterization of such events and the related climate system functioning is particularly relevant in the context of global warming and the corresponding increase of extreme heat wave magnitude and occurrence frequency.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000123561",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/11/11/114021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/123561","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","1540 drought||Climate model||Soil moisture feedbacks||(Extreme) temperature reconstruction","Did European temperatures in 1540 exceed present-day records?","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T17:03:12Z",,"pub:185966",,"yes",,,,"Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate","617518","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,"imp593654ee1283768836","005253059","85005976233",,"Environ.

This study aims to increase understanding of multi-hazard events in poorly documented regions with low accessibility. We focus on the Nyamwamba catchment (107 km2) located in the Rwenzori Mountains (Uganda) where on May 1, 2013, a severe flash flood occurred. In this region, wildfires, earthquakes and landslides occur as well. Here we reconstruct the circumstances under which this flash flood event was triggered, characterize the different processes acting upon the catchment dynamics and estimate the damaging effects of the flash flood within the catchment. The combined occurrence of intense rainfall, a forest fire having burned 18 % of the catchment area and the occurrence of 29 landslides providing debris to the river system, induced a debris-rich and very destructive flash flood which caused several fatalities, the destruction of 70 buildings, several bridges, a hospital, a school, a tarmac road and several lifelines. Although the methodologies applied to estimate peak discharge, detect landslides and delineate wildfires are well established in their disciplines and sometimes limited in their precision, their combination is required to demonstrate the importance of the wildfire and landslides for the magnitude of this flood, unprecedented in decades but characterized by a low return period of the triggering rainfall event. This indicates that flash floods should not be considered as self-determined phenomena but as a result of several cascading and interacting hazard processes.",,,,"0921-030X||1573-0840",,"10.1007/s11069-016-2458-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/118363","en","Springer",,,"Flash flood||Landslide||Forest fire||Multi-hazard||Equatorial Africa","Reconstruction of a flash flood event through a multi-hazard approach: focus on the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2017-06-12T09:08:45Z",,"pub:180316",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936548bc97ce56244",,"84978075341","000386241300007","Nat. hazards","2","Natural Hazards","84","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Model simulations cover the 2002-2010 period for which ionization rates from the AIMOS dataset and atmospheric composition observations from MIPAS are available. Results show that during geomagnetically active periods MEE significantly increase the amount of NOy and HOx in the polar winter mesosphere, in addition to other particles and sources, resulting in local ozone decreases of up to 35%. These changes are followed by an intensification of the polar night jet, as well as mesospheric warming and stratospheric cooling. The contribution of MEE also substantially enhances the difference in the ozone anomalies between geomagnetically active and quiet periods. Comparison with MIPAS NOy observations indicates that the additional source of NOy from MEE improves the model results, however substantial underestimation above 50 km remains and requires better treatment of the NOy source from the thermosphere. A surface air temperature response is detected in several regions, with the most pronounced warming occurring in the Antarctic during austral winter. Surface warming of up to 2 K is also seen over continental Asia during boreal winter.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000115871",,"1364-6826||1879-1824",,"10.1016/j.jastp.2016.04.008","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/115871","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Atmospheric Chemistry||Climate||Mesosphere||Middle Energy Electrons||Ozone","The influence of Middle Range Energy Electrons on atmospheric chemistry and regional climate","Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::520 - Astronomy, cartography","2017-06-12T05:15:17Z",,"pub:177708",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936545b9e01386255","001728088","84964266962","000389094300021","J. atmos. sol.-terr. phys.",,"Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics","146","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study highlights the role of diabatic outflow in midlatitude flow amplification within the context of a review of the physical and dynamical processes involved in ET. Composite fields of 12 western North Pacific ET cases are used as initial and boundary conditions for high-resolution numerical simulations of the North Pacific–North American sector with and without the TC present. It is demonstrated that a three-stage sequence of diabatic outflow associated with different weather systems is involved in triggering a highly amplified midlatitude flow pattern: 1) preconditioning by a predecessor rain event (PRE), 2) TC–extratropical flow interaction, and 3) downstream flow amplification by a downstream warm conveyor belt (WCB). An ensemble of perturbed simulations demonstrates the robustness of these stages. Beyond earlier studies investigating PREs, recurving TCs, and WCBs individually, here the fact that each impacts the midlatitude flow through a similar sequence of processes surrounding ET is highlighted. Latent heat release in rapidly ascending air leads to a net transport of low-PV air into the upper troposphere. Negative PV advection by the diabatically driven outflow initiates ridge building, accelerates and anchors a midlatitude jet streak, and overall amplifies the upper-level Rossby wave pattern. However, the three weather systems markedly differ in terms of the character of diabatic heating and associated outflow height, with the TC outflow reaching highest and the downstream WCB outflow producing the strongest negative PV anomaly.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-a-010870011",,"1520-0493||0027-0644","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/156259||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/122120","10.1175/mwr-d-15-0419.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/353297","en","American Meteorological Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Circulation/ Dynamics||Potential vorticity||Rossby waves||Atm/Ocean Structure/ Phenomena||Diabatic heating||Extratropical cyclones||Tropical cyclones||Upper troposphere","The key role of diabatic outflow in amplifying the midlatitude flow: A representative case study of weather systems surrounding western North Pacific extratropical transition","Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2017-06-12T15:11:12Z",,"pub:184403","eth:50703","yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59366bae9191568782||imp593654d46425910918",,"84994181551","000385435200017","Mon.

Using horizontal grid spacings of O(1km), convection-resolving weather and climate models allows one to explicitly resolve deep convection. However, due to their extremely demanding computational requirements, they have so far been limited to short simulations and/or small computational domains. Innovations in supercomputing have led to new hybrid node designs, mixing conventional multi-core hardware and accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs). One of the first atmospheric models that has been fully ported to these architectures is the COSMO (Consortium for Small-scale Modeling) model.  Here we present the convection-resolving COSMO model on continental scales using a version of the model capable of using GPU accelerators. The verification of a week-long simulation containing winter storm Kyrill shows that, for this case, convection-parameterizing simulations and convection-resolving simulations agree well. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of the approach to longer simulations by conducting a 3-month-long simulation of the summer season 2006. Its results corroborate the findings found on smaller domains such as more credible representation of the diurnal cycle of precipitation in convection-resolving models and a tendency to produce more intensive hourly precipitation events. Both simulations also show how the approach allows for the representation of interactions between synoptic-scale and meso-scale atmospheric circulations at scales ranging from 1000 to 10km. This includes the formation of sharp cold frontal structures, convection embedded in fronts and small eddies, or the formation and organization of propagating cold pools. Finally, we assess the performance gain from using heterogeneous hardware equipped with GPUs relative to multi-core hardware. With the COSMO model, we now use a weather and climate model that has all the necessary modules required for real-case convection-resolving regional climate simulations on GPUs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120961",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-9-3393-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120961","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Towards European-scale convection-resolving climate simulations with GPUs: a study with COSMO 4.19","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T13:15:15Z",,"pub:183044",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654bd8ec1a85274",,"84988692327","000384465000003","Geosci. model dev.","9","Geoscientific Model Development","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, this airborne fraction may change in the future depending on the emissions scenario. An important issue in developing carbon budgets to achieve climate stabilisation targets is the behaviour of natural carbon sinks, particularly under low emissions mitigation scenarios as required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. A key requirement for low carbon pathways is to quantify the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies which will be strongly affected by carbon cycle feedbacks. Here we find that Earth system models suggest significant weakening, even potential reversal, of the ocean and land sinks under future low emission scenarios. For the RCP2.6 concentration pathway, models project land and ocean sinks to weaken to 0.8 ± 0.9 and 1.1 ± 0.3 GtC yr−1 respectively for the second half of the 21st century and to −0.4 ± 0.4 and 0.1 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1 respectively for the second half of the 23rd century. Weakening of natural carbon sinks will hinder the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies and therefore increase their required deployment to achieve a given climate stabilisation target. We introduce a new metric, the perturbation airborne fraction, to measure and assess the effectiveness of negative emissions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000121929",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/11/9/095012","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/121929","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Climate||Carbon cycle||Earth system||Negative emissions||Carbon dioxide removal||Mitigation scenarios","Simulating the Earth system response to negative emissions","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T14:54:11Z",,"pub:184192",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654d0db60174789","005253059","84992073596","000385393300008","Environ.

It has relevance for the atmosphere since it is used for glaciogenic cloud seeding. Theoretical and experimental studies over the last 60 years provide a complex picture of silver iodide as an ice-nucleating agent with conflicting and inconsistent results. This review compares experimental ice nucleation studies in order to analyze the factors that influence the ice nucleation ability of AgI. The following picture emerges from this analysis: the ice nucleation ability of AgI seems to be enhanced when the AgI particle is on the surface of a droplet, which is indeed the position that a particle takes when it can freely move in a droplet. The ice nucleation by particles with surfaces exposed to air depends on water adsorption. AgI surfaces seem to be most efficient at nucleating ice when they are exposed to relative humidity at or even above water saturation. For AgI particles that are completely immersed in water, the freezing temperature increases with increasing AgI surface area. Higher threshold freezing temperatures seem to correlate with improved lattice matches as can be seen for AgI–AgCl solid solutions and 3AgI·NH4I·6H2O, which have slightly better lattice matches with ice than AgI and also higher threshold freezing temperatures. However, the effect of a good lattice match is annihilated when the surfaces have charges. Also, the ice nucleation ability seems to decrease during dissolution of AgI particles. This introduces an additional history and time dependence for ice nucleation in cloud chambers with short residence times.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000118901",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-8915-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/118901","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Ice nucleation efficiency of AgI: review and new insights","Review Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T09:56:48Z",,"pub:180887",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654962b32d95490",,"84979742802","000381213300011","Atmos. chem. phys.","14","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite its scientific and societal importance, there are to date no pan-European observation-based runoff estimates available. Here we employ a recently developed methodology to estimate monthly runoff rates on regular spatial grid in Europe. For this we first assemble an unprecedented collection of river flow observations, combining information from three distinct databases. Observed monthly runoff rates are subsequently tested for homogeneity and then related to gridded atmospheric variables (E-OBS version 12) using machine learning. The resulting statistical model is then used to estimate monthly runoff rates (December 1950–December 2015) on a 0.5° × 0.5° grid. The performance of the newly derived runoff estimates is assessed in terms of cross validation. The paper closes with example applications, illustrating the potential of the new runoff estimates for climatological assessments and drought monitoring.

Such indicators include the peak year of global emissions, the decarbonisation rate and the deployment of low-carbon technology. Here, we show typical values for these indicators for different carbon budgets, using the recently compiled IPCC scenario database, and discuss how these vary as a function of non-CO2 forcing, energy use and policy delay. For carbon budgets of 2000 GtCO2 and less over the 2010–2100 period, supply of low carbon technologies needs to be scaled up massively from today's levels, unless energy use is relatively low. For the subgroup of scenarios with a budget below 1000 GtCO2 (consistent with >66% chance of limiting global warming to below 2 °C relative to preindustrial levels), the 2050 contribution of low-carbon technologies is generally around 50%–75%, compared to less than 20% today (range refers to the 10–90th interval of available data).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000119137",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/11/7/075002","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/119137","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Carbon budget||Climate policy||Integrated assessment||Mitigation strategy","Carbon budgets and energy transition pathways","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T10:28:50Z",,"pub:181136",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936549ae4f7656258","005253059","84980351288","000380817000031","Environ.

Here we present an evaluation of COSMO-CLM2, a model which couples the COSMO-CLM Regional Climate Model to the Community Land Model (CLM4.0). CLM4.0 provides a more detailed representation of land processes compared to the native land surface scheme in COSMO-CLM. We perform historical reanalysis-driven simulations over Europe with COSMO-CLM2 following the EURO-CORDEX intercomparison protocol. We then evaluate simulations performed with COSMO-CLM2, the standard COSMO-CLM and other EURO-CORDEX RCMs against various observational datasets of temperature, precipitation and surface fluxes. Overall, the results indicate that COSMO-CLM2 outperforms both the standard COSMO-CLM and the other EURO-CORDEX models in simulating sensible, latent and surface radiative fluxes as well as 2-meter temperature across different seasons and regions. The performance improvement is particularly strong for turbulent fluxes and for daily maximum temperatures and more modest for daily minimum temperature, suggesting that land surface processes affect daytime even more than nighttime conditions. COSMO-CLM2 also alleviates a long-standing issue of overestimation of interannual summer temperature variability present in most EURO-CORDEX RCMs. Finally, we show that several factors contribute to these improvements, including the representation of evapotranspiration, radiative fluxes and ground heat flux. Overall, these results demonstrate that land processes represent a key area of development to tackle current deficiencies in RCMs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000118163",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/11/7/074027","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/118163","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Regional climate model||Land surface model||EURO-CORDEX||Land processes||COSMO-CLM 2","Is land surface processes representation a possible weak link in current Regional Climate Models?","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T08:49:16Z",,"pub:180108",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654879b99a24989","005253059","84980349952","000380817000027","Environ.

Climate change projections suggest that climate in this area will shift towards warmer temperatures by the end of the 21st century, while projected precipitation changes are highly uncertain. Here we show that the 2015 summer rainfall was the lowest on record since 1901 in Central Europe, and that climate models that perform best in the three driest years of the historical time period 1901–2015 project stronger drying trends in the 21st century than models that perform best in the remaining years. Analyses of precipitation and derived soil moisture reveal that the 2015 event was drier than both the recent 2003 or 2010 extreme summers in Central Europe. Additionally there are large anomalies in satellite-derived vegetation greenness. In terms of precipitation and temperature anomalies, the 2015 summer in Central Europe is found to lie between historical climate in the region and that characteristic of the Mediterranean area. Even though the models best capturing past droughts are not necessarily generally more reliable in the future, the 2015 drought event illustrates that potential future drying trends have severe implications and could be stronger than commonly assumed from the entire IPCC AR5 model ensemble.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117920",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/srep28334","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117920","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Hydrology||Climate sciences","Record dry summer in 2015 challenges precipitation projections in Central Europe","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T08:30:55Z",,"pub:179850",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365482d8c7d38195","006751867","84975489648","000378197300001","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

New radiosonde instruments for in situ humidity-, radiation- and gas-profile measurements in the troposphere and the lower stratosphere, were introduced in recent years for atmospheric research and climate monitoring, but such instruments are often expensive and it is desired they be reused on multiple flights. Recovering instruments that freely descend with parachutes is time consuming, sometimes difficult and even dangerous. Here, we introduce the return glider radiosonde (RGR), which enables flying and retrieving valuable in situ upper-air instruments. The RGR is lifted with weather balloons similar to traditional radiosondes to a preset altitude, at which time a release mechanism cuts the tether string, and a built-in autopilot flies the glider autonomously back to the launch site or a desired preprogrammed location. Once the RGR reaches the landing coordinates it circles down and releases a parachute 100m above ground for landing. The motivation for this project was to measure radiation profiles throughout the atmosphere with the same instrument multiple times and with a rapid turn-around time. The paper describes technical aspects of the return glider radiosonde and the built-in radiation instruments and shows test flights up to 24km altitude that are analyzed in terms of flight performance and maximal distances covered. Several successive flights measuring radiation profiles demonstrate the reliability and the operational readiness of the RGR, allowing new ways for atmospheric in situ research and monitoring with payloads up to several kg depending on the specific size of the glider.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117707",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-9-2535-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117707","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Return glider radiosonde for in situ upper-air research measurements","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T08:02:40Z",,"pub:179624",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936547e6c98c36053",,"84974815611","000379397100005","Atmos. meas. tech.","6","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The simulations are a contribution of the CLM-Community to EURO-CORDEX – the European branch of the international CORDEX initiative. The study documents the influence of two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and four driving global climate models (MPI-ESM-LR, HadGEM2-ES, CNRM-CM5, EC-EARTH) on the climate change signal of seasonal near-surface air temperature, seasonal precipitation amount and daily precipitation intensity in eight different regions of Europe. Both temperature and precipitation changes show comparable spatial patterns across the ensemble. The warming magnitude, however, strongly depends on the emission scenario and the driving GCM. The analysis demonstrates that the influence of the driving GCM on the temperature change signal can be of comparable magnitude as the influence of the emission scenario. For seasonal precipitation changes the influence of the driving GCM is even more important. All ensemble members show a consistent increase in the frequency of days with intense precipitation while the total number of precipitation days decreases. A further aspect is the comparison between the climate change signals in the regional and the driving global simulations. A critical intensity class is used to quantify the transition from decreasing to increasing precipitation frequencies. The analysis reveals that the variability of frequency changes is smaller in the regional than in the global model ensemble, which can be interpreted as an improved robustness and a possible added value of the regional projections. It is also shown that the regional simulations tend to reduce the seasonal mean temperature change of the driving global simulation. In some seasons and regions the damping of the warming signal can amount to more than 2 K. Overall, the analysis reveals a strong influence of comparable magnitude of the choice of the emission scenario and the driving global model on regional climate change signals, and stresses the necessity of a large regional model ensemble for a reliable and robust assessment of regional climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117030",,"0941-2948||1610-1227",,"10.1127/metz/2016/0662","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117030","en","Schweizerbart","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","Regional climate change||COSMO-CLM||EURO-CORDEX||dynamical downscaling","Regional climate change over Europe in COSMO-CLM: Influence of emission scenario and driving global model","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T07:02:10Z",,"pub:178926",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365470a42ae58644","000637360","84971357125","000376160400002","Meteorol.

It is poorly represented in models using parameterized convection. In this study, we investigate the diurnal cycle of convection during 11 days in June 2007 using the COSMO model. The numerical simulations are compared with satellite measurements of GERB and SEVIRI, AVHRR satellite-based cloud properties and ground-based precipitation and temperature measurements. The simulations use horizontal resolutions of 12 km (convection-parameterizing model, CPM) and 2 km (convection-resolving model, CRM) and either a one-moment microphysics scheme (1M) or a two-moment microphysics scheme (2M).They are conducted for a computational domain that covers an extended Alpine area from Northern Italy to Northern Germany. The CPM with 1M exhibits a significant overestimation of high cloud cover. This results in a compensation effect in the top of the atmosphere energy budget due to an underestimation of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and an overestimation of reflected solar radiation (RSR). The CRM reduces high cloud cover and improves the OLR bias from a domain mean of −20.1 to −2.6 W/m2. When using 2M with ice sedimentation in the CRM, high cloud cover is further reduced. The stronger diurnal cycle of high cloud cover and associated convection over the Alps, compared to less mountainous regions, is well represented by the CRM but underestimated by the CPM. Despite substantial differences in high cloud cover, the use of a 2M has no significant impact on the diurnal cycle of precipitation. Furthermore, a negative mid-level cloud bias is found for all simulations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000111479",,"0941-2948||1610-1227",,"10.1127/metz/2015/0715","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/111479","en","Schweizerbart","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","convection||diurnal cycle||Alps||convection-resolving||satellite observations||cloud validation","Evaluation of convection-resolving models using satellite data: The diurnal cycle of summer convection over the Alps","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T23:38:24Z",,"pub:172891",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654061d19d79929","000637360","84971249975","000376160400005","Meteorol.

This proportional relationship has received considerable attention, as it allows one to calculate the cumulative CO2 emissions ('carbon budget') compatible with temperature targets and is a useful measure for model inter-comparison. Here we use an Earth system model to explore whether this relationship persists during periods of net negative CO2 emissions. Negative CO2 emissions are required in the majority of emissions scenarios limiting global warming to 2 °C above pre-industrial, with emissions becoming net negative in the second half of this century in several scenarios. We find that for model simulations with a symmetric 1% per year increase and decrease in atmospheric CO2, the temperature change (ΔT) versus cumulative CO2 emissions (CE) relationship is nonlinear during periods of net negative emissions, owing to the lagged response of the deep ocean to previously increasing atmospheric CO2. When corrected for this lagged response, or if the CO2 decline is applied after the system has equilibrated with the previous CO2 increase, the ΔT versus CE relationship is close to linear during periods of net negative CO2 emissions. A proportionality constant—the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE)− can therefore be calculated for both positive and net negative CO2 emission periods. We find that in simulations with a symmetric 1% per year increase and decrease in atmospheric CO2 the TCRE is larger on the upward than on the downward CO2 trajectory, suggesting that positive CO2 emissions are more effective at warming than negative emissions are at subsequently cooling. We also find that the cooling effectiveness of negative CO2 emissions decreases if applied at higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117254",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/11/5/055006","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117254","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Negative emissions||Carbon dioxide removal||Cumulative emissions||Earth system modelling||Transient climate response","On the proportionality between global temperature change and cumulative CO2 emissions during periods of net negative CO2 emissions","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T07:22:15Z",,"pub:179155",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654753155d12524","005253059","85014457056","000376484300030","Environ.

By utilising simulations of cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and temperature changes from eleven earth system models, we demonstrate that the inherently lower internal variability found at tropical latitudes results in large increases in the frequency of extreme daily temperatures (exceedances of the 99.9th percentile derived from pre-industrial climate simulations) occurring much earlier than for mid-to-high latitude regions. Most of the world's poorest people live at low latitudes, when considering 2010 GDP-PPP per capita; conversely the wealthiest population quintile disproportionately inhabit more variable mid-latitude climates. Consequently, the fraction of the global population in the lowest socio-economic quintile is exposed to substantially more frequent daily temperature extremes after much lower increases in both mean global warming and cumulative CO2 emissions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117253",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/11/5/055007","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117253","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Emergence||Extreme temperatures||Cumulative emissions||Population exposure||CMIP5","Poorest countries experience earlier anthropogenic emergence of daily temperature extremes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T07:22:15Z",,"pub:179154",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654752be3c16222","005253059","85014502537","000376484300031","Environ.

Climate model simulations with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations project increased drought risk in southern Europe, and on the other hand decreased drought risk in the north. Observed changes in water balance components and drought indicators resemble the projected pattern. However, assessments of possible causes of the reported regional changes have so far been inconclusive. Here we investigate whether anthropogenic emissions have altered past and present meteorological (precipitation) drought risk. For doing so we first estimate the magnitude of 20 year return period drought years that would occur without anthropogenic effects on the climate. Subsequently we quantify to which degree the occurrence probability, i.e. the risk, of these years has changed if anthropogenic climate change is accounted for. Both an observational and a climate model-based assessment suggest that it is >95% likely that human emissions have increased the probability of drought years in the Mediterranean, whereas it is >95% likely that the probability of dry years has decreased in northern Europe. In central Europe the evidence is inconclusive. The results highlight that anthropogenic climate change has already increased drought risk in southern Europe, stressing the need to develop efficient mitigation measures.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000116138",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/044005","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/116138","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Drought||Detection and attribution||Europe||Precipitation||Risk||Climate change","Anthropogenic climate change affects meteorological drought risk in Europe","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T05:44:40Z",,"pub:177994",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365460dc49196729","005253059","84964777680","000375746800009","Environ.

The 2015 Paris Agreement includes a two-headed temperature goal: ""holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C"". Despite the prominence of these two temperature limits, a comprehensive overview of the differences in climate impacts at these levels is still missing. Here we provide an assessment of key impacts of climate change at warming levels of 1.5°C and 2°C, including extreme weather events, water availability, agricultural yields, sea-level rise and risk of coral reef loss. Our results reveal substantial differences in impacts between a 1.5°C and 2°C warming that are highly relevant for the assessment of dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. For heat-related extremes, the additional 0.5°C increase in global-mean temperature marks the difference between events at the upper limit of present-day natural variability and a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions. Similarly, this warming difference is likely to be decisive for the future of tropical coral reefs. In a scenario with an end-of-century warming of 2°C, virtually all tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature-induced bleaching from 2050 onwards. This fraction is reduced to about 90% in 2050 and projected to decline to 70% by 2100 for a 1.5°C scenario. Analyses of precipitation-related impacts reveal distinct regional differences and hot-spots of change emerge. Regional reduction in median water availability for the Mediterranean is found to nearly double from 9% to 17% between 1.5°C and 2°C, and the projected lengthening of regional dry spells increases from 7 to 11%. Projections for agricultural yields differ between crop types as well as world regions. While some (in particular high-latitude) regions may benefit, tropical regions like West Africa, South-East Asia, as well as Central and northern South America are projected to face substantial local yield reductions, particularly for wheat and maize. Best estimate sea-level rise projections based on two illustrative scenarios indicate a 50cm rise by 2100 relative to year 2000-levels for a 2°C scenario, and about 10 cm lower levels for a 1.5°C scenario. In a 1.5°C scenario, the rate of sea-level rise in 2100 would be reduced by about 30% compared to a 2°C scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of regional differentiation to assess both future climate risks and different vulnerabilities to incremental increases in global-mean temperature. The article provides a consistent and comprehensive assessment of existing projections and a good basis for future work on refining our understanding of the difference between impacts at 1.5°C and 2°C warming.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000116569",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-7-327-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/116569","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Differential climate impacts for policy-relevant limits to global warming: The case of 1.5 °c and 2 °c","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T06:14:25Z",,"pub:178443",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365468017c012077","010169961","84966340590","000379425700003",,"2","Earth System Dynamics","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Blocking leads to a reversal of the customary upper-level westerly flow and deflects the jet stream as well as migratory weather systems north and southward. Owing to the long persistence and anomalous flow regime, blocking is associated with severe heat waves in summer and cold spells in winter. Despite its vast impact on regional weather and society, average skills in predicting blocking initiation and continuation are observed across many numerical weather prediction models. In this study, the representation of atmospheric blocking in the new general circulation model ICON is investigated by means of a blocking climatology, an analysis of blocking characteristics and a mean state assessment. To this end, a Northern Hemisphere blocking climatology is derived by identifying blocking as regions of anomalous low vertically averaged potential vorticity (PV) values directly below the tropopause. Three 5-year model runs forced with sea surface temperatures and sea ice fields from the ERA-Interim reanalysis for the period of 2001 to 2005 are integrated (AMIP setup). Results from increasing horizontal resolutions (80, 40 and 20 km) are considered and compared to ERA-Interim observations for the period of 1979 to 2014. Three preferred regions of blocking activity are identified, two at the end of the Atlantic and Pacific storm track and a third over northern Russia. Good agreement of the spatial blocking patterns is found, especially in the core region of blocking activity. Main regions of deviation are confined to the mid-latitudes ranging from the Pacific to the Atlantic ocean. Statistics show that blocking duration is overestimated, while blocking size is systematically underestimated in ICON. The atmospheric mean state of the troposphere is generally simulated well, whereas large biases emerge in the stratosphere. A cool bias in the lower stratosphere leads to a PV dipole which is responsible for globally lifting the tropopause north of 50° N. A potential link between the Madden-Julian oscillation and the PV distribution in the Pacific region is suggested, leading to a shift of the customary Pacific PV trough. The strong mean state bias as well as the overestimated duration of blocking in the low resolution configuration are mainly responsible for the mediocre blocking representation in the mid-latitude Pacific sector. An improved mean state with increasing horizontal resolution is observed in the Pacific, resulting in better blocking depiction. However, in the Atlantic sector, no improvement of the 20 km run over the intermediate configuration is found. This points to the importance of different processes in blocking representation such as orographic or diabatic effects in the Atlantic sector.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000361283",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/361283","en","Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science (IAC), ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","atmospheric blocking||Model evaluation","Representation of blocking anticyclones in the new numerical weather prediction model ICON","Master Thesis","Open access",,,"2019-08-29T09:48:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To investigate the impacts of climate change on future European wind power generation potential, we analyze a multi-model ensemble of the most recent EURO-CORDEX regional climate simulations at the 12 km grid resolution. We developed a mid-century wind power plant scenario to focus the impact assessment on relevant locations for future wind power industry. We found that, under two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, changes in the annual energy yield of the future European wind farms fleet as a whole will remain within ±5% across the 21st century. At country to local scales, wind farm yields will undergo changes up to 15% in magnitude, according to the large majority of models, but smaller than 5% in magnitude for most regions and models. The southern fleets such as the Iberian and Italian fleets are likely to be the most affected. With regard to variability, changes are essentially small or poorly significant from subdaily to interannual time scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000114906",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/11/3/034013","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114906","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Climate change impacts||Wind energy||Regional climate modelling||Europe","Climate change impacts on the power generation potential of a European mid-century wind farms scenario","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T03:48:55Z",,"pub:176715",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365448bef2f72704","005253059","84962224607","000373401400016","Environ.

The data set was used to run four established ET algorithms: the Priestley–Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPL), the Penman–Monteith algorithm from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) evaporation product (PM-MOD), the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). In addition, in situ meteorological data from 24 FLUXNET towers were used to force the models, with results from both forcing sets compared to tower-based flux observations. Model performance was assessed on several timescales using both sub-daily and daily forcings. The PT-JPL model and GLEAM provide the best performance for both satellite- and tower-based forcing as well as for the considered temporal resolutions. Simulations using the PM-MOD were mostly underestimated, while the SEBS performance was characterized by a systematic overestimation. In general, all four algorithms produce the best results in wet and moderately wet climate regimes. In dry regimes, the correlation and the absolute agreement with the reference tower ET observations were consistently lower. While ET derived with in situ forcing data agrees best with the tower measurements (R2  =  0.67), the agreement of the satellite-based ET estimates is only marginally lower (R2  =  0.58). Results also show similar model performance at daily and sub-daily (3-hourly) resolutions. Overall, our validation experiments against in situ measurements indicate that there is no single best-performing algorithm across all biome and forcing types. An extension of the evaluation to a larger selection of 85 towers (model inputs resampled to a common grid to facilitate global estimates) confirmed the original findings.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-a-010611421",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-20-803-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114075","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The WACMOS-ET project – Part 1: Tower-scale evaluation of four remote-sensing-based evapotranspiration algorithms","Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2017-06-12T02:35:32Z",,"pub:175846","eth:48823","yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59366b8ae944d44502||imp59365436a3f8232492",,"84975701629","000377697600015","Hydrol.

A substantial fraction of this carbon has been frozen and therefore protected from microbial decay for millennia. As anthropogenic climate warming progresses much of this permafrost is expected to thaw. Here we conduct perturbed model experiments on a climate model of intermediate complexity, with an improved permafrost carbon module, to estimate with formal uncertainty bounds the release of carbon from permafrost soils by the year 2100 and 2300CE. We estimate that by year 2100 the permafrost region may release between 56 (13 to 118)PgC under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 102 (27 to 199)PgC under RCP 8.5, with substantially more to be released under each scenario by the year 2300. Our analysis suggests that the two parameters that contribute most to the uncertainty in the release of carbon from permafrost soils are the size of the non-passive fraction of the permafrost carbon pool and the equilibrium climate sensitivity. A subset of 25 model variants are integrated 8000 years into the future under continued RCP forcing. Under the moderate RCP 4.5 forcing a remnant near-surface permafrost region persists in the high Arctic, eventually developing a new permafrost carbon pool. Overall our simulations suggest that the permafrost carbon cycle feedback to climate change will make a significant contribution to climate change over the next centuries and millennia, releasing a quantity of carbon 3 to 54% of the cumulative anthropogenic total.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000115223",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-13-2123-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/115223","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Projecting the release of carbon from permafrost soils using a perturbed parameter ensemble modelling approach","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T04:17:33Z",,"pub:177043",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936544f4abeb73886","006289717","84964319117","000377276000010",,"7","Biogeosciences","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The change in dust flux has been attributed to varying Saharan land surface cover. Alternatively, the enhanced dust accumulation is linked to enhanced surface winds and a consequent intensification of coastal upwelling. Here we demonstrate for the first time the direct link between dust accumulation in marine cores and changes in Saharan land surface. We simulate the mid-Holocene (6ka BP) and pre-industrial (1850 AD) dust cycle as a function of Saharan land surface cover and atmosphere-ocean conditions using the coupled atmosphere–aerosol model ECHAM6.1-HAM2.1. Mid-Holocene surface characteristics, including vegetation cover and lake surface area, are derived from proxy data and simulations. In agreement with data from marine sediment cores, our simulations show that mid-Holocene dust deposition fluxes in the North Atlantic were two to three times lower compared with pre-industrial fluxes. We identify Saharan land surface characteristics to be the main control on dust transport from North Africa to the North Atlantic. We conclude that the increase in dust accumulation in marine cores is directly linked to a transition of the Saharan landscape during the Holocene and not due to changes in atmospheric or ocean conditions alone.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000116105",,"1814-9324||1814-9332",,"10.5194/cp-12-1009-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/116105","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The link between marine sediment records and changes in Holocene Saharan landscape: Simulating the dust cycle","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T05:34:08Z",,"pub:177960",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654602c5fd78275","005583758","84964918365","000376073100012","Clim. past","4","Climate of the Past","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The projections of the different SeaRISE participants show dispersion, which has not been examined in detail to date. A series of sensitivity experiments are conducted and analyzed using the ice-sheet model for integrated Earth-system studies (IcIES) by replacing one or more formulations of the model parameters with those adopted in other model(s). The results show that large potential sources of the dispersion among the projections of the different SeaRISE participants are differences in the initialization methods and in the surface mass balance methods, and both aspects have almost equal impact on the results. The treatment of ice-sheet margins in the simulation has a secondary impact on the dispersion. We conclude that spinning up the model using fixed topography through the spin-up period while the temperature is allowed to evolve according to the surface temperature history is the preferred representation, at least for the experiment configuration examined in the present paper. A benchmark model experimental setup that most of the numerical models can perform is proposed for future intercomparison projects, in order to evaluate the uncertainties relating to pure ice-sheet model flow characteristics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117830",,"1994-0416||1994-0424",,"10.5194/tc-10-43-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117830","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"SeaRISE experiments revisited: potential sources of spread in multi-model projections of the Greenland ice sheet","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T08:21:57Z",,"pub:179758",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365480ee2a325238","010201627","85009395398","000377602600004",,"1","The Cryosphere","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Many important topics such as the future evolution of permafrost related to climate change and the detection of permafrost related to potential natural hazards sites are of major concern to our society. Numerical permafrost models are the only tools which allow for the projection of the future evolution of permafrost. Due to the complexity of the processes involved and the heterogeneity of Alpine terrain, models must be carefully calibrated, and results should be compared with observations at the site (borehole) scale. However, for large-scale applications, a site-specific model calibration for a multitude of grid points would be very time-consuming. To tackle this issue, this study presents a semi-automated calibration method using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) as implemented in a 1-D soil model (CoupModel) and applies it to six permafrost sites in the Swiss Alps. We show that this semi-automated calibration method is able to accurately reproduce the main thermal condition characteristics with some limitations at sites with unique conditions such as 3-D air or water circulation, which have to be calibrated manually. The calibration obtained was used for global and regional climate model (GCM/RCM)-based long-term climate projections under the A1B climate scenario (EU-ENSEMBLES project) specifically downscaled at each borehole site. The projection shows general permafrost degradation with thawing at 10 m, even partially reaching 20 m depth by the end of the century, but with different timing among the sites and with partly considerable uncertainties due to the spread of the applied climatic forcing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000123152",,"1994-0416||1994-0424",,"10.5194/tc-10-2693-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/123152","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Semi-automated calibration method for modelling of mountain permafrost evolution in Switzerland","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T16:45:38Z",,"pub:185529",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654e786f6063203","010201627",,"000387870400002",,"6","The Cryosphere","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Therefore, the demand for highly sensitive gas-phase amine measurements has emerged in the last several years. Nitrate chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) is routinely used for the measurement of gas-phase sulfuric acid in the sub-pptv range. Furthermore, extremely low volatile organic compounds (ELVOCs) can be detected with a nitrate CIMS. In this study we demonstrate that a nitrate CIMS can also be used for the sensitive measurement of dimethylamine (DMA, (CH3)2NH) using the NO3−•(HNO3)1 − 2• (DMA) cluster ion signal. Calibration measurements were made at the CLOUD chamber during two different measurement campaigns. Good linearity between 0 and  ∼  120 pptv of DMA as well as a sub-pptv detection limit of 0.7 pptv for a 10 min integration time are demonstrated at 278 K and 38 % RH.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117073",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-9-2135-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117073","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Detection of dimethylamine in the low pptv range using nitrate chemical ionization atmospheric pressure interface time-of-flight (CI-APi-TOF) mass spectrometry","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T07:02:10Z",,"pub:178971",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654719ae8e39062","010152804","84970027715","000377855300012","Atmos. meas. tech.","5","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Due to their different mass and symmetry they experience fractionation during phase transitions and thereby record information about the condensation and evaporation history of air parcels. They can be used to study sources and transport of atmospheric moisture or as climate proxies to reconstruct past temperature changes from measurements in paleoarchives. The isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture varies largely on different time scales. However, the dynamical and physical processes influencing the isotopic variability are complex and not completely understood so far, in particular on short (hourly to daily) time scales. The application of numerical models is a useful way of studying these processes. They provide the full four-dimensional structure of the isotope fields and can be used for sensitivity tests to quantify the role of specific mechanisms for isotopic variability. In this thesis, atmospheric stable water isotope processes are investigated with the help of different numerical model simulations. The aim is to improve our understanding of the hourly to seasonal variations of δ2H and deuterium excess in water vapour and precipitation, with a focus on Europe. In the first part of the thesis, a simple Rayleigh model simulating the isotopic composition of air parcels during moist adiabatic ascent is used to study the impact of the nonequilibrium effect, the temperature effect, and the nonlinear effect of the δ scale on deuterium excess. The δ scale effect is important especially in depleted air parcels, for which it can change the sign of the deuterium excess in the remaining vapour from negative to positive. In this case the deuterium excess to a large extent reflects an artefact of its own definition, which overwrites both the nonequilibrium and the temperature effect. We propose an alternative definition of the deuterium excess that solves this problem, as it is based on the logarithmic scale and therefore not affected by the nonlinearity of the δ scale. In the second part of the thesis, stable water isotopes are simulated in an idealised extratropical cyclone using the isotope-enabled version of the COSMO model (COSMOiso). A set of experiments with differing initial conditions of δ2H in vapour and partly deactivated isotopic fractionation allows quantifying the relative roles of cloud fractionation and vertical and horizontal advection for the simulated δ2H signals associated with the cyclone and its fronts. Horizontal transport determines the large-scale pattern of δ2H in both vapour and precipitation, while fractionation and vertical transport are more important on a smaller scale, near the fronts. During the passage of the cold front fractionation leads to a V-shaped pattern of δ2H in precipitation and vapour, which is, for vapour, superimposed on a gradual decrease caused by the arrival of colder air masses. Finally, in the third part of the thesis, realistic COSMOiso simulations are performed over Europe for the years 2002 – 2011, with input data from two different general circulation models (IsoGSM and ECHAMwiso). The nested COSMOiso simulations show an improved performance compared to the general circulation models, underlining the added value of simulating stable water isotopes with high resolution numerical models. Linear correlations of δ2H and deuterium excess with meteorological variables highlight the important role of temperature and relative humidity for the variability of δ2H and deuterium excess, respectively. Furthermore, a new Lagrangian method for quantifying the impact of different processes on isotopes along trajectories shows that evaporation from the ocean, evaporation from land, and mixing with moister air are the most important processes determining climatological mean δ2H and deuterium excess at low levels, while cloud formation processes are important for their variability. In summary, this thesis applies different numerical model simulations to disentangle the complex interactions of meteorological processes involving isotopic fractionation, and provides new insight into how they shape the isotopic composition of water vapour and precipitation. This is a step towards a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for isotopic variations in atmospheric moisture and towards the overall aim of using stable water isotopes as tracers of key processes in the atmospheric water cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000000058",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/58","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Stable water isotopes||Fractionation||Water cycle||Weather systems||Extratropical cyclones","Stable water isotope fractionation processes in weather systems and their influence on isotopic variability on different time scales","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2017-05-17T10:14:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"23939",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The feasibility of cirrus seeding is assessed with the general circulation model ECHAM6-HAM with coupled aerosol-cloud interactions. The warming effect of cirrus clouds on climate led part of the research community to the idea of artificially decreasing their frequency and optical thickness by seeding them with ice nucleating particles. Cirrus seeding re- lies on the competition between two distinct cirrus formation pathways: homogeneous nucleation of soluble aerosols and heterogeneous ice crystal nucleation with the help of solid ice nucleating particles. Seeding attempts to transform optically thicker, longer lived homogeneously nucleated cirrus clouds to thinner and shorter lived heteroge- neously nucleated cirrus clouds.  The cirrus seeding effectiveness depends on the correct representation of cirrus clouds in climate models. We evaluated the ECHAM6-HAM model against CALIPSO satellite data and found that the model reproduces the cirrus cloud occurrence fraction and ice water content well, but overestimates their extinction. Most importantly, we found that a large fraction of cirrus clouds formed in environments with liquid water, which cannot be modified by cirrus seeding. Moreover, modelled in situ cirrus formed by heterogenous ice nucleation on dust aerosols in most of the world, limiting the cir- rus geoengineering potential. Meanwhile, homogeneous cirrus were dominant only in the tropical tropopause layer and over mountain regions.  Seeding cirrus clouds with ice nucleating particles of radii below 10 μm did not lead to a significant cooling effect on climate, due to radiative warming effects of increasing cir- rus cloud cover and decreasing ice crystal radius, which neutralized the cooling gained by the ice crystal number decrease. However, when seeding with larger ice nucleating particles, cirrus cloud cover, ice crystal number concentration, and ice water content decreased, due to increased ice crystal sedimentation velocity, leading to a cooling of up to 0.7◦ C globally. In addition, an idealized cirrus geoengineering setup with in- creased ice crystal sedimentation velocities at temperatures colder than -35◦ C could fully counteract the temperature increase by 1.5 x CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, seeding with ice nucleating particles larger than 10 μm could counteract up to 55% of the temperature and precipitation damage caused by a 1.5 x CO2 increase, without causing negative side effects in any of the analysed regions. Thus, cirrus geoengi- neering was found to be, not considering its problematic engineering details and large modelling uncertainties, an attractive method to counteract part of the anthropogenic warming.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000000052",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/52","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","climate modelling||cirrus clouds||geoengineering||aerosol-cloud interactions||cloud radiative effects||climate engineering","Cirrus clouds and their geoengineering potential","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2017-05-17T09:11:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"23921",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet how these thunderstorms will evolve in a future warmer climate is still unknown. Here we show that Lake Victoria is projected to be a hotspot of future extreme precipitation intensification by using new satellite-based observations, a high-resolution climate projection for the African Great Lakes and coarser-scale ensemble projections. Land precipitation on the previous day exerts a control on night-time occurrence of extremes on the lake by enhancing atmospheric convergence (74%) and moisture availability (26%). The future increase in extremes over Lake Victoria is about twice as large relative to surrounding land under a high-emission scenario, as only over-lake moisture advection is high enough to sustain Clausius–Clapeyron scaling. Our results highlight a major hazard associated with climate change over East Africa and underline the need for high-resolution projections to assess local climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120618",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/ncomms12786","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120618","en","Nature Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Hazardous thunderstorm intensification over Lake Victoria","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T12:45:48Z",,"pub:182691",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654b712ec279592","007044158","84988681736","000385256500016","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, climate model simulations generated for this purpose typically exhibit biases in their output that hinder any straightforward assessment of impacts. To overcome this issue, various bias correction strategies are routinely used to alleviate climate model deficiencies, most of which have been criticized for physical inconsistency and the nonpreservation of the multivariate correlation structure. In this study, we introduce a novel, resampling-based bias correction scheme that fully preserves the physical consistency and multivariate correlation structure of the model output. This procedure strongly improves the representation of climatic extremes and variability in a large regional climate model ensemble (HadRM3P, climateprediction.net/weatherathome), which is illustrated for summer extremes in temperature and rainfall over Central Europe. Moreover, we simulate biosphere–atmosphere fluxes of carbon and water using a terrestrial ecosystem model (LPJmL) driven by the bias-corrected climate forcing. The resampling-based bias correction yields strongly improved statistical distributions of carbon and water fluxes, including the extremes. Our results thus highlight the importance of carefully considering statistical moments beyond the mean for climate impact simulations. In conclusion, the present study introduces an approach to alleviate climate model biases in a physically consistent way and demonstrates that this yields strongly improved simulations of climate extremes and associated impacts in the terrestrial biosphere. A wider uptake of our methodology by the climate and impact modelling community therefore seems desirable for accurately quantifying changes in past, current and future extremes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000113596",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-7-71-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/113596","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"A novel bias correction methodology for climate impact simulations","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T01:51:36Z",,"pub:175293",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936542ae75e423134","010169961","84957823969","000377217200004",,"1","Earth System Dynamics","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, we use an earth system model of intermediate complexity to investigate how deforestation on various spatial scales affects ground temperature, with an emphasis on the latitudinal temperature response and its underlying mechanisms. Results show that the latitudinal pattern of temperature response depends nonlinearly on the spatial extent of deforestation and the fraction of vegetation change. Compared with regional deforestation, temperature change in global deforestation is greatly amplified in temperate and boreal regions but is dampened in tropical regions. Incremental forest removal leads to increasingly larger cooling in temperate and boreal regions, while the temperature increase saturates in tropical regions. The latitudinal and spatial patterns of the temperature response are driven by two processes with competing temperature effects: decrease in absorbed shortwave radiation due to increased albedo and decrease in evapotranspiration. These changes in the surface energy balance reflect the importance of the background climate in modifying the deforestation impact. Shortwave radiation and precipitation have an intrinsic geographical distribution that constrains the effects of biophysical changes and therefore leads to temperature changes that are spatially varying. For example, wet (dry) climate favors larger (smaller) evapotranspiration change; thus, warming (cooling) is more likely to occur. Our analysis reveals that the latitudinal temperature change largely results from the climate conditions in which deforestation occurs and is less influenced by the magnitude of individual biophysical changes such as albedo, roughness, and evapotranspiration efficiency.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000114256",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-7-167-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114256","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The role of spatial scale and background climate in the latitudinal temperature response to deforestation","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T02:53:50Z",,"pub:176031",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936543a48c6f34692","010169961","84960489318","000377217200010",,"1","Earth System Dynamics","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study presents a standard description for using the SPIN instrument and also highlights methods to analyze measurements in more advanced ways. It characterizes and describes the behavior of the SPIN chamber, reports data from laboratory measurements, and quantifies uncertainties associated with the measurements. Experiments with ammonium sulfate are used to investigate homogeneous freezing of deliquesced haze droplets and droplet breakthrough. Experiments with kaolinite, NX illite, and silver iodide are used to investigate heterogeneous ice nucleation. SPIN nucleation results are compared to those from the literature. A machine learning approach for analyzing depolarization data from the SPIN optical particle counter is also presented (as an advanced use).

Globally, around half of cloud condensation nuclei originate from nucleation of atmospheric vapours2. It is thought that sulfuric acid is essential to initiate most particle formation in the atmosphere3,4, and that ions have a relatively minor role5. Some laboratory studies, however, have reported organic particle formation without the intentional addition of sulfuric acid, although contamination could not be excluded6,7. Here we present evidence for the formation of aerosol particles from highly oxidized biogenic vapours in the absence of sulfuric acid in a large chamber under atmospheric conditions. The highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs) are produced by ozonolysis of α-pinene. We find that ions from Galactic cosmic rays increase the nucleation rate by one to two orders of magnitude compared with neutral nucleation. Our experimental findings are supported by quantum chemical calculations of the cluster binding energies of representative HOMs. Ion-induced nucleation of pure organic particles constitutes a potentially widespread source of aerosol particles in terrestrial environments with low sulfuric acid pollution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117259",,"0028-0836||1476-4687",,"10.1038/nature17953","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117259","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ion-induced nucleation of pure biogenic particles","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T07:22:15Z",,"pub:179160",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654754cbd910856","000984850","84971327870","000376443100038",,"7604","Nature","533","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we present a climatology of midlatitude cirrus clouds measured with the same type of ground-based lidar at three midlatitude research stations: at the Swiss high alpine Jungfraujoch station (3580ma.s.l.), in Zürich (Switzerland, 510ma.s.l.), and in Jülich (Germany, 100ma.s.l.). The analysis is based on 13000h of measurements from 2010 to 2014. To automatically evaluate this extensive data set, we have developed the Fast LIdar Cirrus Algorithm (FLICA), which combines a pixel-based cloud-detection scheme with the classic lidar evaluation techniques. We find mean cirrus optical depths of 0.12 on Jungfraujoch and of 0.14 and 0.17 in Zürich and Jülich, respectively.  Above Jungfraujoch, subvisible cirrus clouds (τ < 0.03) have been observed during 6% of the observation time, whereas above Zürich and Jülich fewer clouds of that type were observed. Cirrus have been observed up to altitudes of 14.4kma.s.l. above Jungfraujoch, whereas they have only been observed to about 1km lower at the other stations. These features highlight the advantage of the high-altitude station Jungfraujoch, which is often in the free troposphere above the polluted boundary layer, thus enabling lidar measurements of thinner and higher clouds. In addition, the measurements suggest a change in cloud morphology at Jungfraujoch above ∼ 13km, possibly because high particle number densities form in the observed cirrus clouds, when many ice crystals nucleate in the high supersaturations following rapid uplifts in lee waves above mountainous terrain.  The retrieved optical properties are used as input for a radiative transfer model to estimate the net cloud radiative forcing, CRFNET, for the analyzed cirrus clouds. All cirrus detected here have a positive CRFNET. This confirms that these thin, high cirrus have a warming effect on the Earth's climate, whereas cooling clouds typically have cloud edges too low in altitude to satisfy the FLICA criterion of temperatures below −38°C. We find CRFNET = 0.9Wm−2 for Jungfraujoch and 1.0Wm−2 (1.7Wm−2) for Zürich (Jülich). Further, we calculate that subvisible cirrus (τ < 0.03) contribute about 5%, thin cirrus (0.03 < τ < 0.3) about 45%, and opaque cirrus (0.3 < τ) about 50% of the total cirrus radiative forcing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117879",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-7605-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117879","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Climatological and radiative properties of midlatitude cirrus clouds derived by automatic evaluation of lidar measurements","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T08:21:57Z",,"pub:179809",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365481ec68b10325","004294181","84975885867","000379417300008","Atmos. chem. phys.","12","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Key processes driving changes in SWV include dehydration of air masses transiting the cold-point tropopause (CPT) and methane oxidation. We use a chemistry–climate model to simulate changes in SWV through the 21st century following the four canonical representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Furthermore, we quantify the contribution that methane oxidation makes to SWV following each of the RCPs. Although the methane contribution to SWV maximizes in the upper stratosphere, modelled SWV trends are found to be driven predominantly by warming of the CPT rather than by increasing methane oxidation. SWV changes by −5 to 60% (depending on the location in the atmosphere and emissions scenario) and increases in the lower stratosphere in all RCPs through the 21st century. Because the lower stratosphere is where water vapour radiative forcing maximizes, SWV's influence on surface climate is also expected to increase through the 21st century.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000122187",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-13067-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/122187","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The role of methane in projections of 21st century stratospheric water vapour","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T15:20:40Z",,"pub:184472",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654d5d985e27854","004294181","84992602693","000386770100005","Atmos. chem. phys.","20","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Different mechanisms of heterogeneous ice nucleation can compete under mixed-phase cloud conditions. Contact freezing is considered relevant because higher ice nucleation temperatures than for immersion freezing for the same INPs were observed. It has limitations because its efficiency depends on the number of collisions between cloud droplets and INPs. To date, direct comparisons of contact and immersion freezing with the same INP, for similar residence times and concentrations, are lacking. This study compares immersion and contact freezing efficiencies of three different INPs. The contact freezing data were obtained with the ETH CoLlision Ice Nucleation CHamber (CLINCH) using 80µm diameter droplets, which can interact with INPs for residence times of 2 and 4s in the chamber. The contact freezing efficiency was calculated by estimating the number of collisions between droplets and particles. Theoretical formulations of collision efficiencies gave too high freezing efficiencies for all investigated INPs, namely AgI particles with 200nm electrical mobility diameter, 400 and 800nm diameter Arizona Test Dust (ATD) and kaolinite particles. Comparison of freezing efficiencies by contact and immersion freezing is therefore limited by the accuracy of collision efficiencies. The concentration of particles was 1000cm−3 for ATD and kaolinite and 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000cm−3 for AgI. For concentrations  < 5000cm−3, the droplets collect only one particle on average during their time in the chamber. For ATD and kaolinite particles, contact freezing efficiencies at 2s residence time were smaller than at 4s, which is in disagreement with a collisional contact freezing process but in accordance with immersion freezing or adhesion freezing. With “adhesion freezing”, we refer to a contact nucleation process that is enhanced compared to immersion freezing due to the position of the INP on the droplet, and we discriminate it from collisional contact freezing, which assumes an enhancement due to the collision of the particle with the droplet. For best comparison with contact freezing results, immersion freezing experiments of the same INPs were performed with the continuous flow diffusion chamber Immersion Mode Cooling chAmber–Zurich Ice Nucleation Chamber (IMCA–ZINC) for a 3s residence time. In IMCA–ZINC, each INP is activated into a droplet in IMCA and provides its surface for ice nucleation in the ZINC chamber. The comparison of contact and immersion freezing results did not confirm a general enhancement of freezing efficiency for contact compared with immersion freezing experiments. For AgI particles the onset of heterogeneous freezing in CLINCH was even shifted to lower temperatures compared with IMCA–ZINC. For ATD, freezing efficiencies for contact and immersion freezing experiments were similar. For kaolinite particles, contact freezing became detectable at higher temperatures than immersion freezing. Using contact angle information between water and the INP, it is discussed how the position of the INP in or on the droplets may influence its ice nucleation activity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000118903",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-8899-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/118903","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Comparing contact and immersion freezing from continuous flow diffusion chambers","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T09:56:48Z",,"pub:180889",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936549635caa49196","004294181","84979740245","000381213300010","Atmos. chem. phys.","14","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Dust collection sites were distributed across Africa, South America, the Middle East, and Antarctica. Mineralogical composition has been determined by means of X-ray diffraction. All samples proved to be mixtures of minerals, with major contributions from quartz, calcite, clay minerals, K-feldspars, and (Na, Ca)-feldspars. Reference samples of these minerals were investigated with the same methods as the natural dust samples. Furthermore, Arizona test dust (ATD) was re-evaluated as a benchmark. Immersion freezing of emulsion and bulk samples was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. For emulsion measurements, water droplets with a size distribution peaking at about 2µm, containing different amounts of dust between 0.5 and 50wt% were cooled until all droplets were frozen. These measurements characterize the average freezing behaviour of particles, as they are sensitive to the average active sites present in a dust sample. In addition, bulk measurements were conducted with one single 2mg droplet consisting of a 5wt% aqueous suspension of the dusts/minerals. These measurements allow the investigation of the best ice-nucleating particles/sites available in a dust sample. All natural dusts, except for the Antarctica and ATD samples, froze in a remarkably narrow temperature range with the heterogeneously frozen fraction reaching 10% between 244 and 250K, 25% between 242 and 246K, and 50% between 239 and 244K. Bulk freezing occurred between 255 and 265K. In contrast to the natural dusts, the reference minerals revealed ice nucleation temperatures with 2–3 times larger scatter. Calcite, dolomite, dolostone, and muscovite can be considered ice nucleation inactive. For microcline samples, a 50% heterogeneously frozen fraction occurred above 245K for all tested suspension concentrations, and a microcline mineral showed bulk freezing temperatures even above 270K. This makes microcline (KAlSi3O8) an exceptionally good ice-nucleating mineral, superior to all other analysed K-feldspars, (Na, Ca)-feldspars, and the clay minerals. In summary, the mineralogical composition can explain the observed freezing behaviour of 5 of the investigated 12 natural dust samples, and partly for 6 samples, leaving the freezing efficiency of only 1 sample not easily explained in terms of its mineral reference components. While this suggests that mineralogical composition is a major determinant of ice-nucleating ability, in practice, most natural samples consist of a mixture of minerals, and this mixture seems to lead to remarkably similar ice nucleation abilities, regardless of their exact composition, so that global models, in a first approximation, may represent mineral dust as a single species with respect to ice nucleation activity. However, more sophisticated representations of ice nucleation by mineral dusts should rely on the mineralogical composition based on a source scheme of dust emissions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120332",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-11177-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120332","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Ice nucleation efficiency of natural dust samples in the immersion mode","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T12:24:46Z",,"pub:182397",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654b29cefc43771","004294181","84986563694","000384142900002","Atmos. chem. phys.","17","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the Budyko framework is limited to steady-state conditions, being a result of assuming negligible storage change in the land–water balance. Processes leading to changes in the terrestrial water storage at any spatial and/or temporal scale are hence not represented. Here we propose an analytically derived modification of the Budyko framework including a new parameter explicitly representing additional water available to evapotranspiration besides instantaneous precipitation. The modified framework is comprehensively analyzed, showing that the additional parameter leads to a rotation of the original water supply limit. We further evaluate the new formulation in an example application at mean seasonal timescales, showing that the extended framework is able to represent conditions in which monthly to annual evapotranspiration exceeds monthly to annual precipitation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117531",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-20-2195-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117531","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"A two-parameter Budyko function to represent conditions under which evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T07:52:57Z",,"pub:179441",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936547adca5d42727","001881462","84973621964","000379419500005","Hydrol.

In the future, land-use activities are likely to expand and intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. The Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP) aims to further advance understanding of the impacts of land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) on climate, specifically addressing the following questions. (1) What are the effects of LULCC on climate and biogeochemical cycling (past–future)? (2) What are the impacts of land management on surface fluxes of carbon, water, and energy, and are there regional land-management strategies with the promise to help mitigate climate change? In addressing these questions, LUMIP will also address a range of more detailed science questions to get at process-level attribution, uncertainty, data requirements, and other related issues in more depth and sophistication than possible in a multi-model context to date. There will be particular focus on the separation and quantification of the effects on climate from LULCC relative to all forcings, separation of biogeochemical from biogeophysical effects of land use, the unique impacts of land-cover change vs. land-management change, modulation of land-use impact on climate by land–atmosphere coupling strength, and the extent to which impacts of enhanced CO2 concentrations on plant photosynthesis are modulated by past and future land use.  LUMIP involves three major sets of science activities: (1) development of an updated and expanded historical and future land-use data set, (2) an experimental protocol for specific LUMIP experiments for CMIP6, and (3) definition of metrics and diagnostic protocols that quantify model performance, and related sensitivities, with respect to LULCC. In this paper, we describe LUMIP activity (2), i.e., the LUMIP simulations that will formally be part of CMIP6. These experiments are explicitly designed to be complementary to simulations requested in the CMIP6 DECK and historical simulations and other CMIP6 MIPs including ScenarioMIP, C4MIP, LS3MIP, and DAMIP. LUMIP includes a two-phase experimental design. Phase one features idealized coupled and land-only model simulations designed to advance process-level understanding of LULCC impacts on climate, as well as to quantify model sensitivity to potential land-cover and land-use change. Phase two experiments focus on quantification of the historic impact of land use and the potential for future land management decisions to aid in mitigation of climate change. This paper documents these simulations in detail, explains their rationale, outlines plans for analysis, and describes a new subgrid land-use tile data request for selected variables (reporting model output data separately for primary and secondary land, crops, pasture, and urban land-use types). It is essential that modeling groups participating in LUMIP adhere to the experimental design as closely as possible and clearly report how the model experiments were executed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120347",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-9-2973-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120347","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP) contribution to CMIP6: Rationale and experimental design","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T12:24:46Z",,"pub:182414",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654b2df7e880210","010180250","84986300529","000383892800002","Geosci. model dev.","9","Geoscientific Model Development","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2°C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017–2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018–2020 period.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000121420",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-9-3461-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/121420","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) for CMIP6","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T14:03:56Z",,"pub:183518",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654c64302c85203","010180250","84990046271","000385385700001","Geosci. model dev.","9","Geoscientific Model Development","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Further, these exceedingly large storage requirements negatively impact science objectives, for example, by forcing reductions in data output frequency, simulation length, or ensemble size. To lessen data volumes from the Community Earth System Model (CESM), we advocate the use of lossy data compression techniques. While lossy data compression does not exactly preserve the original data (as lossless compression does), lossy techniques have an advantage in terms of smaller storage requirements. To preserve the integrity of the scientific simulation data, the effects of lossy data compression on the original data should, at a minimum, not be statistically distinguishable from the natural variability of the climate system, and previous preliminary work with data from CESM has shown this goal to be attainable. However, to ultimately convince climate scientists that it is acceptable to use lossy data compression, we provide climate scientists with access to publicly available climate data that have undergone lossy data compression. In particular, we report on the results of a lossy data compression experiment with output from the CESM Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) Community Project, in which we challenge climate scientists to examine features of the data relevant to their interests, and attempt to identify which of the ensemble members have been compressed and reconstructed. We find that while detecting distinguishing features is certainly possible, the compression effects noticeable in these features are often unimportant or disappear in post-processing analyses. In addition, we perform several analyses that directly compare the original data to the reconstructed data to investigate the preservation, or lack thereof, of specific features critical to climate science. Overall, we conclude that applying lossy data compression to climate simulation data is both advantageous in terms of data reduction and generally acceptable in terms of effects on scientific results.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000125344",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-9-4381-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/125344","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Evaluating lossy data compression on climate simulation data within a large ensemble","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T18:04:26Z",,"pub:187936",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936550e4f99f13571","010180250",,"000390650300001","Geosci. model dev.","12","Geoscientific Model Development","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In order to better understand the sources of these model diversities, the Model Intercomparison Project on the climatic response to Volcanic forcing (VolMIP) has defined a coordinated set of idealized volcanic perturbation experiments to be carried out in alignment with the CMIP6 protocol. VolMIP provides a common stratospheric aerosol data set for each experiment to minimize differences in the applied volcanic forcing. It defines a set of initial conditions to assess how internal climate variability contributes to determining the response. VolMIP will assess to what extent volcanically forced responses of the coupled ocean–atmosphere system are robustly simulated by state-of-the-art coupled climate models and identify the causes that limit robust simulated behavior, especially differences in the treatment of physical processes. This paper illustrates the design of the idealized volcanic perturbation experiments in the VolMIP protocol and describes the common aerosol forcing input data sets to be used.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000119853",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-9-2701-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/119853","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The Model Intercomparison Project on the climatic response to Volcanic forcing (VolMIP): Experimental design and forcing input data for CMIP6","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T11:36:03Z",,"pub:181889",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654a985fd353898","010180250","84983430283","000383794200001","Geosci. model dev.","8","Geoscientific Model Development","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The primary goals of the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP) are to facilitate improved estimation of the contributions of anthropogenic and natural forcing changes to observed global warming as well as to observed global and regional changes in other climate variables; to contribute to the estimation of how historical emissions have altered and are altering contemporary climate risk; and to facilitate improved observationally constrained projections of future climate change. D&A studies typically require unforced control simulations and historical simulations including all major anthropogenic and natural forcings. Such simulations will be carried out as part of the DECK and the CMIP6 historical simulation. In addition D&A studies require simulations covering the historical period driven by individual forcings or subsets of forcings only: such simulations are proposed here. Key novel features of the experimental design presented here include firstly new historical simulations with aerosols-only, stratospheric-ozone-only, CO2-only, solar-only, and volcanic-only forcing, facilitating an improved estimation of the climate response to individual forcing, secondly future single forcing experiments, allowing observationally constrained projections of future climate change, and thirdly an experimental design which allows models with and without coupled atmospheric chemistry to be compared on an equal footing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000121875",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-9-3685-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/121875","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP v1.0) contribution to CMIP6","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T14:54:11Z",,"pub:184137",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654cfcddce46371","010180250","84992376571","000386585100001","Geosci. model dev.","10","Geoscientific Model Development","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The solid and liquid water stored at the land surface has a large influence on the regional climate, its variability and predictability, including effects on the energy, water and carbon cycles. Notably, snow and soil moisture affect surface radiation and flux partitioning properties, moisture storage and land surface memory. They both strongly affect atmospheric conditions, in particular surface air temperature and precipitation, but also large-scale circulation patterns. However, models show divergent responses and representations of these feedbacks as well as systematic biases in the underlying processes. LS3MIP will provide the means to quantify the associated uncertainties and better constrain climate change projections, which is of particular interest for highly vulnerable regions (densely populated areas, agricultural regions, the Arctic, semi-arid and other sensitive terrestrial ecosystems).  The experiments are subdivided in two components, the first addressing systematic land biases in offline mode (“LMIP”, building upon the 3rd phase of Global Soil Wetness Project; GSWP3) and the second addressing land feedbacks attributed to soil moisture and snow in an integrated framework (“LFMIP”, building upon the GLACE-CMIP blueprint).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120158",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-9-2809-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120158","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"LS3MIP (v1.0) contribution to CMIP6: The Land Surface, Snow and Soil moisture Model Intercomparison Project - Aims, setup and expected outcome","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T12:07:02Z",,"pub:182211",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654af5c32052787","010180250","84984832799","000383800400002","Geosci. model dev.","8","Geoscientific Model Development","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Scientists must therefore communicate across disciplinary boundaries. For this communication to be successful, scientists must write clearly and concisely, yet the historically poor standard of scientific writing does not seem to be improving. Scientific writing must improve, and the key to long-term improvement lies with the early-career scientist (ECS). Many interventions exist for an ECS to improve their writing, like style guides and courses. However, momentum is often difficult to maintain after these interventions are completed. Continuity is key to improving writing.  This paper introduces the ClimateSnack project, which aims to motivate ECSs to develop and continue to improve their writing and communication skills. The project adopts a peer-learning framework where ECSs voluntarily form writing groups at different institutes around the world. The group members learn, discuss, and improve their writing skills together.  Several ClimateSnack writing groups have formed. This paper examines why some of the groups have flourished and others have dissolved. We identify the challenges involved in making a writing group successful and effective, notably the leadership of self-organized groups, and both individual and institutional time management. Within some of the groups, peer learning clearly offers a powerful tool to improve writing as well as bringing other benefits, including improved general communication skills and increased confidence.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000118933",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-20-2965-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/118933","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Improving together: Better science writing through peer learning","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T10:07:23Z",,"pub:180919",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365496d14e976853","001881462","84979599697","000381101700010","Hydrol.

It is under debate whether anthropogenic aerosols emitted from urban areas close to the measurement sites are mainly responsible for the dimming. In order to assess this urbanization impact on SSR, we use spatially explicit population density data of 0.08° resolution to construct population indices (PI) at 157 high data quality sites. Our study extends previous population-based studies by incorporating distance-weighting as a simple aerosol diffusion model. We measured urbanization in the surrounding of a site as the PI change from 1960 to 1990 and found no negative correlation with the corresponding SSR trends from 1964 to 1989 for the 92 sites in Europe and Japan. For the 39 sites in China the correlation coefficients are significant at the 5 % level and reach around −0.35, while for the 26 remaining Asian, mostly Russian sites the correlation coefficients reach around −0.55 at the 1 % significance level. Results are similar, when the absolute levels of PIs are taken as an indicator for urbanization. Our findings call into question the existence of an urbanization effect for the sites in Europe and Japan, while such an effect cannot be ruled out for the sites in Asia, especially in Russia.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000114334",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-2719-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114334","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Global dimming and urbanization: Did stronger negative SSR trends collocate with regions of population growth?","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T03:02:24Z",,"pub:176113",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936543c882a836294","004294181","84960100665","000374702000001","Atmos. chem. phys.","5","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Special emphasis is given to the quality control and the homogenization of the records in order to ensure the reliability of the resulting trends. This step has been shown as necessary due to the large differences obtained between the raw and homogenized dataset, especially during the first decades of the study period. In addition, SSR series under clear-sky conditions were obtained considering only the cloudless days from corresponding ground-based cloudiness observations. Subsequently, records were interpolated onto a regular grid and clustered into two regions, northern and southern Italy, which were averaged in order to get all-sky and clear-sky regional SSR records. Their temporal evolution is presented, and possible reasons for differences between all-sky and clear-sky conditions and between the two regions are discussed in order to determine to what extent SSR variability depends on aerosols or clouds. Specifically, the all-sky SSR records show a decrease until the mid-1980s (dimming period), and a following increase until the end of the series (brightening period) even though strength and persistence of tendencies are not the same in all seasons. Clear-sky records present stronger tendencies than all-sky records during the dimming period in all seasons and during the brightening period in winter and autumn. This suggests that, under all-sky conditions, the variations caused by the increase/decrease in the aerosol content have been partially masked by cloud cover variations, especially during the dimming period. Under clear sky the observed dimming is stronger in the south than in the north. This peculiarity could be a consequence of a significant contribution of mineral dust variations to the SSR variability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000120331",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-11145-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/120331","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Detection of dimming/brightening in Italy from homogenized all-sky and clear-sky surface solar radiation records and underlying causes (1959-2013)","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T12:24:46Z",,"pub:182396",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654b296f7e37557","004294181","84986566082","000384007100001","Atmos. chem. phys.","17","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We focus on the thermodynamic and dynamic properties that control the chemical distribution of atmospheric constituents in the boundary layer. We show that the evolution of tracer profiles of CO2 and O3 indicate mixing across the inversion layer (or entrainment zone). This finding is supported by the analysis of tracer–tracer correlations which are indicative for mixing and the relation of tracer profiles in relation to the evolution of the boundary layer height deduced from radio soundings. The study shows the relevance of entrainment processes for the lower troposphere in general and specifically that the tracer–tracer correlation method can be used to identify mixing and irreversible exchange processes across the inversion layer.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000117997",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-6011-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/117997","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Airborne observation of mixing across the entrainment zone during PARADE 2011","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T08:30:55Z",,"pub:179935",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654844b67e12273","004294181","84977668177","000378354100001","Atmos. chem. phys.","10","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To predict the role of these particles in climate, visibility and atmospheric chemistry, information on particle phase state (i.e., single liquid, two liquids and solid) is needed. This paper focuses on the phase state of SOM particles free of inorganic salts produced by the ozonolysis of α-pinene. Phase transitions were investigated in the laboratory using optical microscopy and theoretically using a thermodynamic model at 290K and for relative humidities ranging from  < 0.5 to 100%. In the laboratory studies, a single phase was observed from 0 to 95% relative humidity (RH) while two liquid phases were observed above 95% RH. For increasing RH, the mechanism of liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) was spinodal decomposition. The RH range over which two liquid phases were observed did not depend on the direction of RH change. In the modeling studies, the SOM took up very little water and was a single organic-rich phase at low RH values. At high RH, the SOM underwent LLPS to form an organic-rich phase and a water-rich phase, consistent with the laboratory studies. The presence of LLPS at high RH values can have consequences for the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity of SOM particles. In the simulated Köhler curves for SOM particles, two local maxima were observed. Depending on the composition of the SOM, the first or second maximum can determine the critical supersaturation for activation. Recently researchers have observed inconsistencies between measured CCN properties of SOM particles and hygroscopic growth measured below water saturation (i.e., hygroscopic parameters measured below water saturation were inconsistent with hygroscopic parameters measured above water saturation). The work presented here illustrates that such inconsistencies are expected for systems with LLPS when the water uptake at subsaturated conditions represents the hygroscopicity of an organic-rich phase while the barrier for CCN activation can be determined by the second maximum in the Köhler curve when the particles are water rich.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000118090",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-7969-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/118090","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Observations and implications of liquid-liquid phase separation at high relative humidities in secondary organic material produced by α-pinene ozonolysis without inorganic salts","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T08:39:16Z",,"pub:180031",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654860e31895542","004294181","84977090749","000379417300031","Atmos. chem. phys.","12","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Traditionally, clay minerals were assumed to determine the ice nucleation ability of desert dust and constituted the focus of ice nucleation studies over several decades. Recently some feldspar species were identified to be ice active at much higher temperatures than clay minerals, redirecting studies to investigate the contribution of feldspar to ice nucleation on desert dust. However, so far no study has shown the atmospheric relevance of this mineral phase.  For this study four dust samples were collected after airborne transport in the troposphere from the Sahara to different locations (Crete, the Peloponnese, Canary Islands, and the Sinai Peninsula). Additionally, 11 dust samples were collected from the surface from nine of the biggest deserts worldwide. The samples were used to study the ice nucleation behavior specific to different desert dusts. Furthermore, we investigated how representative surface-collected dust is for the atmosphere by comparing to the ice nucleation activity of the airborne samples. We used the IMCA-ZINC setup to form droplets on single aerosol particles which were subsequently exposed to temperatures between 233 and 250K. Dust particles were collected in parallel on filters for offline cold-stage ice nucleation experiments at 253–263K. To help the interpretation of the ice nucleation experiments the mineralogical composition of the dusts was investigated. We find that a higher ice nucleation activity in a given sample at 253K can be attributed to the K-feldspar content present in this sample, whereas at temperatures between 238 and 245K it is attributed to the sum of feldspar and quartz content present. A high clay content, in contrast, is associated with lower ice nucleation activity. This confirms the importance of feldspar above 250K and the role of quartz and feldspars determining the ice nucleation activities at lower temperatures as found by earlier studies for monomineral dusts. The airborne samples show on average a lower ice nucleation activity than the surface-collected ones. Furthermore, we find that under certain conditions milling can lead to a decrease in the ice nucleation ability of polymineral samples due to the different hardness and cleavage of individual mineral phases causing an increase of minerals with low ice nucleation ability in the atmospherically relevant size fraction. Comparison of our data set to an existing desert dust parameterization confirms its applicability for climate models. Our results suggest that for an improved prediction of the ice nucleation ability of desert dust in the atmosphere, the modeling of emission and atmospheric transport of the feldspar and quartz mineral phases would be key, while other minerals are only of minor importance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000123315",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-15075-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/123315","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Heterogeneous ice nucleation on dust particles sourced from nine deserts worldwide – Part 1: Immersion freezing","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T16:53:33Z",,"pub:185699",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654ea68b5846225","004294181","85006127318","000389209000004","Atmos. chem. phys.","23","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Tropopause fold events in EMAC simulations were identified with a 3-D labeling algorithm that detects folds at grid points where multiple crossings of the dynamical tropopause are computed. Subsequently the events featuring the largest horizontal and vertical extent were selected for further study. For the selection of these events we identified a significant contribution of the stratospheric ozone reservoir to the high concentrations of ozone in the middle and lower free troposphere over the EMME. A distinct increase of ozone is found over the EMME in the middle troposphere during summer as a result of the fold activity, shifting towards the southeast and decreasing altitude. We find that the interannual variability of near-surface ozone over the eastern Mediterranean (EM) during summer is related to that of both tropopause folds and ozone in the free troposphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000122891",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-14025-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/122891","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"On the role of tropopause folds in summertime tropospheric ozone over the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T16:23:49Z",,"pub:185227",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654e31509227509","004294181",,"000387453900005","Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Studying them requires long time series of both the QBO and climate variables, which has restricted previous studies to the past 30–50 years. Here we use the benefits of an existing QBO reconstruction back to 1908. We first investigate additional, newly digitized historical observations of stratospheric winds to test the reconstruction. Then we use the QBO time series to analyse atmospheric data sets (reconstructions and reanalyses) as well as the results of coupled ocean–atmosphere–chemistry climate model simulations that were forced with the reconstructed QBO. We investigate effects related to (1) tropical–extratropical interaction in the stratosphere, wave–mean flow interaction and subsequent downward propagation, and (2) interaction between deep tropical convection and stratospheric flow. We generally find weak connections, though some are statistically significant over the 100-year period and consistent with model results. Apparent multidecadal variations in the connection between the QBO and the investigated climate responses are consistent with a small effect in the presence of large variability, with one exception: the imprint on the northern polar vortex, which is seen in recent reanalysis data, is not found in the period 1908–1957. Conversely, an imprint in Berlin surface air temperature is only found in 1908–1957 but not in the recent period. Likewise, in the model simulations both links tend to appear alternatingly, suggesting a more systematic modulation due to a shift in the circulation, for example. Over the Pacific warm pool, we find increased convection during easterly QBO, mainly in boreal winter in observation-based data as well as in the model simulations, with large variability. No QBO effects were found in the Indian monsoon strength or Atlantic hurricane frequency.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000123933",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-15529-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/123933","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Multidecadal Variations of the Effects of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation on the Climate System","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T17:14:21Z",,"pub:186372",,"yes",,,,"Future and Past Solar Influence on the Terrestrial Climate II","147659","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF: Sonstige",,"imp593654f47552598897","004294181","85006410626","000391486900007","Atmos. chem. phys.","24","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The measurements were carried out at four observational sites: Payerne (Switzerland), Bilthoven (the Netherlands), Lindenberg (north-eastern Germany), and the Zugspitze mountain (Garmisch-Partenkichen, German Alps), and by an airborne water-vapour lidar system creating a transect of humidity profiles between all four stations. A high data quality was verified that strongly underlines the scientific findings. The intrusion layer was very dry with a minimum mixing ratios of 0 to 35ppm on its lower west side, but did not drop below 120ppm on the higher-lying east side (Lindenberg). The dryness hardens the findings of a preceding study (“Part 1”, Trickl et al., 2014) that, e.g., 73% of deep intrusions reaching the German Alps and travelling 6 days or less exhibit minimum mixing ratios of 50ppm and less. These low values reflect values found in the lowermost stratosphere and indicate very slow mixing with tropospheric air during the downward transport to the lower troposphere. The peak ozone values were around 70ppb, confirming the idea that intrusion layers depart from the lowermost edge of the stratosphere. The data suggest an increase of ozone from the lower to the higher edge of the intrusion layer. This behaviour is also confirmed by stratospheric aerosol caught in the layer. Both observations are in agreement with the idea that sections of the vertical distributions of these constituents in the source region were transferred to central Europe without major change. LAGRANTO trajectory calculations demonstrated a rather shallow outflow from the stratosphere just above the dynamical tropopause, for the first time confirming the conclusions in “Part 1” from the Zugspitze CO observations. The trajectories qualitatively explain the temporal evolution of the intrusion layers above the four stations participating in the campaign.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000119055",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-8791-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/119055","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"How stratospheric are deep stratospheric intrusions?

The obtained in situ evidence of these phenomena are analysed using satellite observations by Aura MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) and CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) together with trajectory and transport modelling performed using CLaMS (Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere) and HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model. Balloon soundings were conducted during March 2012 in Bauru, Brazil (22.3°S) in the frame of the TRO-Pico campaign for studying the impact of convective overshooting on the stratospheric water budget. The balloon payloads included two stratospheric hygrometers: FLASH-B (Fluorescence Lyman-Alpha Stratospheric Hygrometer for Balloon) and Pico-SDLA instrument as well as COBALD (Compact Optical Backscatter Aerosol Detector) sondes, complemented by Vaisala RS92 radiosondes. Water vapour vertical profiles obtained independently by the two stratospheric hygrometers are in excellent agreement, ensuring credibility of the vertical structures observed. A signature of in-mixing is inferred from a series of vertical profiles, showing coincident enhancements in water vapour (of up to 0.5ppmv) and aerosol at the 425K (18.5km) level. Trajectory analysis unambiguously links these features to intrusions from the Southern Hemisphere extratropical stratosphere, containing more water and aerosol, as demonstrated by MLS and CALIPSO global observations. The in-mixing is successfully reproduced by CLaMS simulations, showing a relatively moist filament extending to 20°S. A signature of local cross-tropopause transport of water is observed in a particular sounding, performed on a convective day and revealing water vapour enhancements of up to 0.6ppmv as high as the 404K (17.8km) level. These are shown to originate from convective overshoots upwind detected by an S-band weather radar operating locally in Bauru. The accurate in situ observations uncover two independent moisture pathways into the tropical lower stratosphere, which are hardly detectable by space-borne sounders. We argue that the moistening by horizontal transport is limited by the weak meridional gradients of water, whereas the fast convective cross-tropopause transport, largely missed by global models, can have a substantial effect, at least at a regional scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000121229",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-12273-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/121229","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Evidence of horizontal and vertical transport of water in the Southern Hemisphere tropical tropopause layer (TTL) from high-resolution balloon observations","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T13:45:00Z",,"pub:183323",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654c2b7a0a70961","004294181","84989329068","000385396900004","Atmos. chem. phys.","18","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

By measuring close to the dust's emission source, before aging processes during the transatlantic advection potentially modify the dust properties, the study fills a gap between in situ measurements of dust ice nucleating particles (INPs) far away from the Sahara and laboratory studies of ground-collected soil. Two months of online INP concentration measurements are presented, which were part of the two CALIMA campaigns at the Izaña observatory in Tenerife, Spain (2373ma.s.l.), in the summers of 2013 and 2014. INP concentrations were measured in the deposition and condensation mode at temperatures between 233 and 253K with the Portable Ice Nucleation Chamber (PINC). Additional aerosol information such as bulk chemical composition, concentration of fluorescent biological particles as well as the particle size distribution was used to investigate observed variations in the INP concentration.  The concentration of INPs was found to range between 0.2stdL−1 in the deposition mode and up to 2500stdL−1 in the condensation mode at 240K. It correlates well with the abundance of aluminum, iron, magnesium and manganese (R: 0.43–0.67) and less with that of calcium, sodium or carbonate. These observations are consistent with earlier results from laboratory studies which showed a higher ice nucleation efficiency of certain feldspar and clay minerals compared to other types of mineral dust. We find that an increase of ammonium sulfate, linked to anthropogenic emissions in upwind distant anthropogenic sources, mixed with the desert dust has a small positive effect on the condensation mode INP per dust mass ratio but no effect on the deposition mode INP. Furthermore, the relative abundance of biological particles was found to be significantly higher in INPs compared to the ambient aerosol. Overall, this suggests that atmospheric aging processes in the SAL can lead to an increase in ice nucleation ability of mineral dust from the Sahara. INP concentrations predicted with two common parameterization schemes, which were derived mostly from atmospheric measurements far away from the Sahara but influenced by Asian and Saharan dust, were found to be higher based on the aerosol load than we observed in the SAL, further suggesting aging effects of INPs in the SAL.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000119159",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-9067-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/119159","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Ice nucleating particles in the Saharan Air Layer","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T10:28:50Z",,"pub:181158",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936549b5e93489719","004294181","84979999798","000381213300018","Atmos. chem. phys.","14","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The variation of aerosol indirect effects (AIE) in climate models is investigated across different dynamical regimes, determined by monthly mean 500 hPa vertical pressure velocity (ω500), lower-tropospheric stability (LTS) and large-scale surface precipitation rate derived from several global climate models (GCMs), with a focus on liquid water path (LWP) response to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. The LWP sensitivity to aerosol perturbation within dynamic regimes is found to exhibit a large spread among these GCMs. It is in regimes of strong large-scale ascent (ω500 < −25 hPa day−1) and low clouds (stratocumulus and trade wind cumulus) where the models differ most. Shortwave aerosol indirect forcing is also found to differ significantly among different regimes. Shortwave aerosol indirect forcing in ascending regimes is close to that in subsidence regimes, which indicates that regimes with strong large-scale ascent are as important as stratocumulus regimes in studying AIE. It is further shown that shortwave aerosol indirect forcing over regions with high monthly large-scale surface precipitation rate (> 0.1 mm day−1) contributes the most to the total aerosol indirect forcing (from 64 to nearly 100 %). Results show that the uncertainty in AIE is even larger within specific dynamical regimes compared to the uncertainty in its global mean values, pointing to the need to reduce the uncertainty in AIE in different dynamical regimes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000114274",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-2765-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114274","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"On the characteristics of aerosol indirect effect based on dynamic regimes in global climate models","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T02:53:50Z",,"pub:176049",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936543aaaf3593862","004294181","84960414965","000374702000004","Atmos. chem. phys.","5","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Five Controlled Meteorological (CMET) balloons were launched from Ny-Ålesund in Svalbard (Spitsbergen) over 5–12 May 2011 and measured vertical atmospheric profiles over coastal areas to both the east and west. One notable CMET flight achieved a suite of 18 continuous soundings that probed the Arctic marine boundary layer (ABL) over a period of more than 10h. Profiles from two CMET flights are compared to model output from ECMWF Era-Interim reanalysis (ERA-I) and to a high-resolution (15km) Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) product. To the east of Svalbard over sea ice, the CMET observed a stable ABL profile with a temperature inversion that was reproduced by ASR but not captured by ERA-I. In a coastal ice-free region to the west of Svalbard, the CMET observed a stable ABL with strong wind shear. The CMET profiles document increases in ABL temperature and humidity that are broadly reproduced by both ASR and ERA-I. The ASR finds a more stably stratified ABL than observed but captured the wind shear in contrast to ERA-I. Detailed analysis of the coastal CMET-automated soundings identifies small-scale temperature and humidity variations with a low-level flow and provides an estimate of local wind fields. We demonstrate that CMET balloons are a valuable approach for profiling the free atmosphere and boundary layer in remote regions such as the Arctic, where few other in situ observations are available for model validation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000121431",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-12383-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/121431","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Controlled meteorological (CMET) free balloon profiling of the Arctic atmospheric boundary layer around Spitsbergen compared to ERA-Interim and Arctic System Reanalyses","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T14:03:56Z",,"pub:183529",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654c681dc817284","004294181","84989925633","000385401900001","Atmos. chem. phys.","19","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Its main objective is the derivation, validation, and intercomparison of a group of existing evaporation retrieval algorithms driven by a common forcing data set. Three commonly used process-based evaporation methodologies are evaluated: the Penman–Monteith algorithm behind the official Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) evaporation product (PM-MOD), the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), and the Priestley–Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPL). The resulting global spatiotemporal variability of evaporation, the closure of regional water budgets, and the discrete estimation of land evaporation components or sources (i.e. transpiration, interception loss, and direct soil evaporation) are investigated using river discharge data, independent global evaporation data sets and results from previous studies. In a companion article (Part 1), Michel et al. (2016) inspect the performance of these three models at local scales using measurements from eddy-covariance towers and include in the assessment the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model. In agreement with Part 1, our results indicate that the Priestley and Taylor products (PT-JPL and GLEAM) perform best overall for most ecosystems and climate regimes. While all three evaporation products adequately represent the expected average geographical patterns and seasonality, there is a tendency in PM-MOD to underestimate the flux in the tropics and subtropics. Overall, results from GLEAM and PT-JPL appear more realistic when compared to surface water balances from 837 globally distributed catchments and to separate evaporation estimates from ERA-Interim and the model tree ensemble (MTE). Nonetheless, all products show large dissimilarities during conditions of water stress and drought and deficiencies in the way evaporation is partitioned into its different components. This observed inter-product variability, even when common forcing is used, suggests that caution is necessary in applying a single data set for large-scale studies in isolation. A general finding that different models perform better under different conditions highlights the potential for considering biome- or climate-specific composites of models. Nevertheless, the generation of a multi-product ensemble, with weighting based on validation analyses and uncertainty assessments, is proposed as the best way forward in our long-term goal to develop a robust observational benchmark data set of continental evaporation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000114077",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-20-823-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/114077","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The WACMOS-ET project – Part 2: Evaluation of global terrestrial evaporation data sets","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T02:35:32Z",,"pub:175848",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365436b063995329","001881462","84975687686","000377697600016","Hydrol.

In this work, a novel tool called STEFLUX (Stratosphere-to-Troposphere Exchange Flux) is presented, discussed, and used to provide a first long-term investigation of SI over two global hot-spot regions for climate change and air pollution: the southern Himalayas and the central Mediterranean Basin. The main purpose of STEFLUX is to obtain a fast-computing and reliable identification of the SI events occurring at a specific location and during a specified time window. It relies on a compiled stratosphere-to-troposphere exchange (STE) climatology, which makes use of the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset from the ECMWF, as well as a refined version of a well-established Lagrangian methodology. STEFLUX results are compared to the SI observations (SIO) at two high-mountain WMO/GAW global stations in these climate hot spots, i.e., the Nepal Climate Observatory-Pyramid (NCO-P, 5079 m a.s.l.) and Mt. Cimone (2165 m a.s.l.), which are often affected by SI events. Compared to the observational datasets at the two specific measurement sites, STEFLUX is able to detect SI events on a regional scale. Furthermore, it has the advantage of retaining additional information concerning the pathway of stratospheric-affected air masses, such as the location of tropopause crossing and other meteorological parameters along the trajectories. However, STEFLUX neglects mixing and dilution that air masses undergo along their transport within the troposphere. Therefore, the regional-scale STEFLUX events cannot be expected to perfectly reproduce the point measurements at NCO-P and Mt. Cimone, which are also affected by small-scale (orographic) circulations. Still, the seasonal variability in SI events according to SIO and STEFLUX agrees fairly well. By exploiting the fact that the ERA-Interim reanalysis extends back to 1979, the long-term climatology of SI events at NCO-P and Mt. Cimone is also assessed in this work. The analysis of the 35-year record at both stations denies the existence of any significant trend in the SI frequency, except for winter seasons at NCO-P. Furthermore, for the first time, by using the STEFLUX outputs, we investigate the potential impact of specific climate factors (i.e. ENSO, QBO, and solar activity) on SI frequency variability over the Mediterranean Basin and the Himalayas.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000123155",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-14203-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/123155","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"STEFLUX, a tool for investigating stratospheric intrusions: application to two WMO/GAW global stations","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T16:45:38Z",,"pub:185533",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654e7a03ee14712","004294181",,"000387861000002","Atmos. chem. phys.","22","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Because of the challenges involved in determining the chemical composition of objects with very small mass, however, the properties of the freshly nucleated particles and the detailed pathways of their formation processes are still not clear. In this study, we focus on a challenging size range, i.e., particles that have grown to diameters of 10 and 15 nm following nucleation, and measure their water uptake. Water uptake is useful information for indirectly obtaining chemical composition of aerosol particles. We use a nanometer-hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (nano-HTDMA) at subsaturated conditions (ca. 90 % relative humidity at 293 K) to measure the hygroscopicity of particles during the seventh Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets (CLOUD7) campaign performed at CERN in 2012. In CLOUD7, the hygroscopicity of nucleated nanoparticles was measured in the presence of sulfuric acid, sulfuric acid–dimethylamine, and sulfuric acid–organics derived from α-pinene oxidation. The hygroscopicity parameter κ decreased with increasing particle size, indicating decreasing acidity of particles. No clear effect of the sulfuric acid concentration on the hygroscopicity of 10 nm particles produced from sulfuric acid and dimethylamine was observed, whereas the hygroscopicity of 15 nm particles sharply decreased with decreasing sulfuric acid concentrations. In particular, when the concentration of sulfuric acid was 5.1 × 106 molecules cm−3 in the gas phase, and the dimethylamine mixing ratio was 11.8 ppt, the measured κ of 15 nm particles was 0.31 ± 0.01: close to the value reported for dimethylaminium sulfate (DMAS) (κDMAS ∼ 0.28). Furthermore, the difference in κ between sulfuric acid and sulfuric acid–imethylamine experiments increased with increasing particle size. The κ values of particles in the presence of sulfuric acid and organics were much smaller than those of particles in the presence of sulfuric acid and dimethylamine. This suggests that the organics produced from α-pinene ozonolysis play a significant role in particle growth even at 10 nm sizes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000113362",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-16-293-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/113362","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Hygroscopicity of nanoparticles produced from homogeneous nucleation in the CLOUD experiments","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T01:34:23Z",,"pub:175053",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936542639aa214922","004294181","84957309648","000371283900019","Atmos. chem. phys.","1","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Ensemble sensitivity simulations are performed with and without interactive chemistry. In both experiments the AMOC is intensified in the course of the solar radiation reduction, which is attributed to the thermal effect of the solar forcing: reduced sea surface temperatures and enhanced sea ice formation increase the density of the upper ocean in the North Atlantic and intensify the deepwater formation. Furthermore, a second, dynamical effect on the AMOC is identified driven by the stratospheric cooling in response to the reduced solar forcing. The cooling is strongest in the tropics and leads to a weakening of the northern polar vortex. By stratosphere–troposphere interactions, the stratospheric circulation anomalies induce a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation in the troposphere which is found to weaken the AMOC through wind stress and heat flux anomalies in the North Atlantic. The dynamic mechanism is present in both ensemble experiments. In the experiment with interactive chemistry, however, it is strongly amplified by stratospheric ozone changes. In the coupled system, both effects counteract and weaken the response of the AMOC to the solar forcing reduction. Neglecting chemistry–climate interactions in model simulations may therefore lead to an overestimation of the AMOC response to solar forcing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000122890",,"2190-4987||2190-4979","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/122890||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/123938","10.5194/esd-7-877-2016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/380623","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Response of the AMOC to reduced solar radiation - the modulating role of atmospheric chemistry","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-12T16:23:49Z",,"pub:185226||pub:186377",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593654e30ff3899267||imp593654f48eae040825",,,"000387459000001",,,"Earth System Dynamics","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
