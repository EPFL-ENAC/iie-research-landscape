We examine short- (13 yr) and long-term (56 yr) heatwave frequency trends in a 21‐member ensemble of a global climate model (Community Earth System Model; CESM), where each member is driven by identical anthropogenic forcings. To estimate changes dominantly due to internal climate variability, trends were calculated in the corresponding pre-industrial control run. We find that short-term trends in heatwave frequency are not robust indicators of long-term change. Additionally, we find that a lack of a long-term trend is possible, although improbable, under historical anthropogenic forcing over many regions. All long-term trends become unprecedented against internal variability when commencing in 2015 or later, and corresponding short-term trends by 2030, while the length of trend required to represent regional long-term changes is dependent on a given realization. Lastly, within ten years of a short-term decline, 95% of regional heatwave frequency trends have reverted to increases. This suggests that observed short-term changes of decreasing heatwave frequency could recover to increasing trends within the next decade. The results of this study are specific to CESM and the 'business as usual' scenario, and may differ under other representations of internal variability, or be less striking when a scenario with lower anthropogenic forcing is employed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000109725",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/10/12/124003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/109725","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Heat wave magnitude index daily||Extreme temperatures||European heatwaves||Heat wave magnitude unit||Russian heatwave||Finland heatwave||Heatwave projections","Top ten European heatwaves since 1950 and their occurrence in the coming decades","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T22:49:34Z",,"pub:170847",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653e76da3a80781","005253059","84952923529",,"000367286300010","Environ.

The carbon budget for 2.0 ${}^{\circ }{\rm{C}}$ of warming is reduced from 1320 Pg C when considering only forcing from CO2 to 810 Pg C when considering permafrost carbon feedbacks as well as other anthropogenic contributions to climate change. We also examined net carbon budgets following an overshoot of and return to a warming target. That is, the net cumulative CO2 emissions at the point in time a warming target is restored following artificial removal of CO2 from the atmosphere to cool the climate back to a chosen temperature target. These overshoot net carbon budgets are consistently smaller than the conventional carbon budgets. Overall carbon budgets persist as a robust and simple conceptual framework to relate the principle cause of climate change to the impacts of climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000108054",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/10/12/125003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/108054","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Carbon budget||TCRE||Climate change","Sensitivity of carbon budgets to permafrost carbon feedbacks, non-CO2 forcings, and negative emissions","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T21:45:10Z",,"pub:168830",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653c79b78a77938","005253059","84952894867",,"000367286300035","Environ.

Combined with the slow response of the climate system, this results in the global temperature increase resulting from CO2 being nearly proportional to the total emitted amount of CO2 since preindustrial times. This has a number of simple but far-reaching consequences that raise important questions for climate change mitigation, policy and ethics. Even if anthropogenic emissions of CO2 were stopped, most of the realized climate change would persist for centuries and thus be irreversible on human timescales, yet standard economic thinking largely discounts these long-term intergenerational effects. Countries and generations to first order contribute to both past and future climate change in proportion to their total emissions. A global temperature target implies a CO2 “budget” or “quota”, a finite amount of CO2 that society is allowed to emit to stay below the target. Distributing that budget over time and between countries is an ethical challenge that our world has so far failed to address. Despite the simple relationship between CO2 emissions and temperature, the consequences for climate policy and for sharing the responsibility of reducing global CO2 emissions can only be drawn in combination with judgments about equity, fairness, the value of future generations and our attitude towards risk.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000098368",,"0165-0009||1573-1480",,"10.1007/s10584-015-1340-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/98368","en","Springer","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"The legacy of our CO2 emissions: A clash of scientific facts, politics and ethics","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T16:17:48Z",,"pub:153830",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593652f38114363357",,"84947868764",,"000365518700002",,"3","Climatic Change","133","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we introduce the Vegetation-Atmosphere Coupling (VAC) index which identifies regions and times of concurrent strong anomalies in temperature and photosynthetic activity. The different classes of the index determine whether a location is currently in an energy-limited or water-limited regime, and its high temporal resolution allows to investigate how these regimes change over time at the regional scale. We show that the VAC index helps to distinguish different evaporative regimes. It can therefore provide indirect information about the local soil moisture state. We further demonstrate how the index can be used to understand processes leading to and occurring during extreme climate events, using the 2010 heat wave in Russia and the 2010 Amazon drought as examples.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000108278",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1002/2015GL066563","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/108278","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A submonthly database for detecting changes in vegetation-atmosphere coupling","Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2017-06-11T21:51:44Z",,"pub:169077",,"yes",,,,"Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate","617518","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,"imp593653cba2a2760084",,"84956890946",,"000368343200028","Geophys.

Currently,  two  such  levels  are  discussed  in  the  context  of the international climate negotiations as long-term global temperature goals: a below 2◦C  and  a  1.5◦C  limit  in  global-mean  temperature  rise  above  pre-industrial  levels.Despite the prominence of these two temperature limits, a comprehensive assessment of the differences in climate impacts at these levels is still missing. Here we provide an  assessment  of  key  impacts  of  climate  change  at  warming  levels  of  1.5◦C  and 2◦C, including extreme weather events, water availability, agricultural yields, sea-level rise and risk of coral reef loss. Our results reveal substantial differences in impacts between 1.5◦C and 2◦C. For heat-related extremes, the additional 0.5◦C increase in global-mean temperature marks the difference between events at the upper limit of present-day natural variability and a new climate regime, particularly in tropical regions.Similarly, this warming difference is likely to be decisive for the future of tropical coral reefs. In a scenario with an end-of-century warming of 2◦C, virtually all tropical coral reefs are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature induced bleaching  from  2050  on wards.  This  fraction  is  reduced  to  about  90 %  in  2050  and projected to decline to 70 % by 2100 for a 1.5◦C scenario. Analyses of precipitation-related  impacts  reveal  distinct  regional  differences  and  several  hot-spots  of  change20emerge. Regional reduction in median water availability for the Mediterranean is found to nearly double from 9 to 17 % between 1.5◦C and 2◦C, and the projected lengthening of regional dry spells increases from 7% longer to 11%. Projections for agricultural yields differ between crop types as well as world regions. While some (in particular high-latitude) regions may benefit, tropical regions like West Africa, South-East Asia, as well as Central and Northern South America are projected to face local yield reductions, particularly  for  wheat  and  maize.  Best  estimate  sea-level  rise  projections  based  on two  illustrative  scenarios  indicate  a  50cm  rise  by  2100  relative  to  year  2000-levels under a 2◦C warming, which is about 10 cm lower for a 1.5◦C scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of regional differentiation to assess future climate risks as well as different vulnerabilities to incremental increases in global-mean temperature. The article provides a consistent and comprehensive assessment of existing projections and a solid foundation for future work on refining our understanding of warming-level dependent climate impacts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000109728",,"2190-4995",,"10.5194/esdd-6-2447-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/109728","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Differential climate impacts for policy-relevant limits to global warming: the case of 1.5° C and 2° C","Working Paper","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T22:49:34Z",,"pub:170850",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653e780ebd28003",,,,,,,"Earth System Dynamics Discussions","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This manuscript evaluates the significance of this imprecision and proposes a method for their estimation in routine data analysis.  In the first part of this work, it is shown that peak-integration errors are expected to scale linearly with peak height for the constrained-peak-shape fits performed in the HR-AMS. An empirical analysis is undertaken to investigate the most complex source of peak-integration imprecision: the imprecision in fitted peak height, σh. It is shown that the major contributors to σh are the imprecision and bias inherent in the m/z calibration, both of which may arise due to statistical and physical non-idealities of the instrument. A quantitative estimation of these m/z-calibration imprecisions and biases show that they may vary from ion to ion, even for ions of similar m/z.  In the second part of this work, the empirical analysis is used to constrain a Monte Carlo approach for the estimation of σh and thus the peak-integration imprecision. The estimated σh for selected well-separated peaks (for which m/z-calibration imprecision and bias could be quantitatively estimated) scaled linearly with peak height as expected (i.e. as n1). In combination with the imprecision in peak-width quantification (which may be easily and directly estimated during quantification), peak-fitting imprecisions therefore dominate counting imprecisions (which scale as n0.5) at high signals. The previous HR-AMS uncertainty model therefore underestimates the overall fitting imprecision even for well-resolved peaks. We illustrate the importance of this conclusion by performing positive matrix factorization on a synthetic HR-AMS data set both with and without its inclusion.  In the third part of this work, the Monte Carlo approach is extended to the case of an arbitrary number of overlapping peaks. Here, a modification to the empirically constrained approach was needed, because the ion-specific m/z-calibration bias and imprecision can generally only be estimated for well-resolved peaks. The modification is to simply overestimate the m/z-calibration imprecision in all cases. This overestimation results in only a slight overestimate of σh, while significantly reducing the sensitivity of σh to the unknown, ion-specific m/z-calibration biases. Thus, with only the measured data and an approximate estimate of the order of magnitude of m/z-calibration biases as input, conservative and unbiased estimates of peak-integration imprecisions may be obtained for each peak in any ensemble of overlapping peaks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000106279",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-8-4615-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/106279","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Peak-fitting and integration imprecision in the Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer: Effects of mass accuracy on location-constrained fits","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T20:33:57Z",,"pub:166386",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653a3d149747289",,"84946227030",,"000365978100003","Atmos. meas. tech.","11","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They combine well-formed language with supporting graphical evidence and have the objective to inform policymakers. One of the most discussed and widely distributed visual in these reports is the graph, showing the global surface temperature evolution for the 21st century as simulated by climate models for various emission scenarios, which is part of the Summary for Policymakers (SPM) and the Working Group I contribution to the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). It displays two types of uncertainties, namely the socio-economic scenarios and response uncertainty due to imperfect knowledge and models. Through 43 in-depth interviews this graph and caption was empirically tested with a sample of people analogous to the SPM target audience. It was found that novice readers were unable to identify the two different types of uncertainties in this graph without substantial guidance. Instead they saw a great deal of uncertainty but falsely attributed it to the climate model(s) and ignored the scenario uncertainties. Our findings demonstrate how the choice of display can directly impact a reader’s perception of the scientific message. A failure to distinguish between these two types of uncertainties could lead to an overestimate of the response uncertainties, and an underestimation of socio-economic choices. We test this assumption and identify the difficulties non-technical audiences have with this graph and how this could inevitably impede its value as a decision support tool.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000106219",,"0165-0009||1573-1480",,"10.1007/s10584-015-1473-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/106219","en","Springer","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"The unseen uncertainties in climate change: reviewing comprehension of an IPCC scenario graph","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T20:30:53Z",,"pub:166322",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653a29915756536","000040037","84951568661",,"000363483800002",,"2","Climatic Change","133","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Halting global warming thus requires virtually zero annual CO2 emissions at some point. Policymakers have now incorporated this concept in the negotiating text for a new global climate agreement, but confusion remains about concepts like carbon neutrality, climate neutrality, full decarbonization, and net zero carbon or net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here we clarify these concepts, discuss their appropriateness to serve as a long-term global benchmark for achieving temperature targets, and provide a detailed quantification. We find that with current pledges and for a likely (>66%) chance of staying below 2 °C, the scenario literature suggests net zero CO2 emissions between 2060 and 2070, with net negative CO2 emissions thereafter. Because of residual non-CO2 emissions, net zero is always reached later for total GHG emissions than for CO2. Net zero emissions targets are a useful focal point for policy, linking a global temperature target and socio-economic pathways to a necessary long-term limit on cumulative CO2 emissions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000108056",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/10/10/105007","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/108056","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Climate policy||Climate stabilization||UNFCCC||Greenhouse gases||Carbon dioxide||Global goal||Climate change","Zero emission targets as long-term global goals for climate protection","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T21:45:10Z",,"pub:168832",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653c7a385e66418","005253059",,,"000367180300027","Environ.

Previous studies have examined the time of emergence of climate averages. However, at the global scale, the emergence of changes in extreme events, which have the greatest societal impacts, has not been investigated before. Based on state-of-the-art climate models, we show that temperature extremes generally emerge slightly later from their quasi-natural climate state than seasonal means, due to greater variability in extremes. Nevertheless, according to model evidence, both hot and cold extremes have already emerged across many areas. Remarkably, even precipitation extremes that have very large variability are projected to emerge in the coming decades in Northern Hemisphere winters associated with a wettening trend. Based on our findings we expect local temperature and precipitation extremes to already differ significantly from their previous quasi-natural state at many locations or to do so in the near future. Our findings have implications for climate impacts and detection and attribution studies assessing observed changes in regional climate extremes by showing whether they will likely find a fingerprint of anthropogenic climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000104150",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/10/9/094015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/104150","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","CMIP5||Attribution||Temperature||Precipitation||Central England temperature","The timing of anthropogenic emergence in simulated climate extremes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T19:17:59Z",,"pub:162846",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653777e0f441234","005253059","84945218981",,"000367141000018","Environ.

Here a new version of the Lagrangian analysis tool LAGRANTO (Wernli and Davies, 1997) is introduced, which offers considerably enhanced functionalities. Trajectory starting positions can be defined easily and flexibly based on different geometrical and/or meteorological conditions, e.g., equidistantly spaced within a prescribed region and on a stack of pressure (or isentropic) levels. After the computation of the trajectories, a versatile selection of trajectories is offered based on single or combined criteria. These criteria are passed to LAGRANTO with a simple command language (e.g., ""GT:PV:2"" readily translates into a selection of all trajectories with potential vorticity, PV, greater than 2 PVU; 1 PVU = 10−6 K m2 kg−1 s−1). Full versions of this new version of LAGRANTO are available for global ECMWF and regional COSMO data, and core functionality is provided for the regional WRF and MetUM models and the global 20th Century Reanalysis data set. The paper first presents the intuitive application of LAGRANTO for the identification of a warm conveyor belt in the North Atlantic. A further case study then shows how LAGRANTO can be used to quasi-operationally diagnose stratosphere–troposphere exchange events. Whereas these examples rely on the ECMWF version, the COSMO version and input fields with 7 km horizontal resolution serve to resolve the rather complex flow structure associated with orographic blocking due to the Alps, as shown in a third example. A final example illustrates the tool's application in source–receptor analysis studies. The new distribution of LAGRANTO is publicly available and includes auxiliary tools, e.g., to visualize trajectories. A detailed user guide describes all LAGRANTO capabilities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103598",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-8-2569-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103598","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The LAGRANTO Lagrangian analysis tool – version 2.0","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T19:04:10Z",,"pub:161860",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936536b61f9452224",,"84939249439",,"000360652200009","Geosci. model dev.","8","Geoscientific Model Development","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, the interconnected avenues through which climate extremes drive ecological and physiological processes and alter the carbon balance are poorly understood. Here, we review the literature on carbon cycle relevant responses of ecosystems to extreme climatic events. Given that impacts of climate extremes are considered disturbances, we assume the respective general disturbance‐induced mechanisms and processes to also operate in an extreme context. The paucity of well‐defined studies currently renders a quantitative meta‐analysis impossible, but permits us to develop a deductive framework for identifying the main mechanisms (and coupling thereof) through which climate extremes may act on the carbon cycle. We find that ecosystem responses can exceed the duration of the climate impacts via lagged effects on the carbon cycle. The expected regional impacts of future climate extremes will depend on changes in the probability and severity of their occurrence, on the compound effects and timing of different climate extremes, and on the vulnerability of each land‐cover type modulated by management. Although processes and sensitivities differ among biomes, based on expert opinion, we expect forests to exhibit the largest net effect of extremes due to their large carbon pools and fluxes, potentially large indirect and lagged impacts, and long recovery time to regain previous stocks. At the global scale, we presume that droughts have the strongest and most widespread effects on terrestrial carbon cycling. Comparing impacts of climate extremes identified via remote sensing vs. ground‐based observational case studies reveals that many regions in the (sub‐)tropics are understudied. Hence, regional investigations are needed to allow a global upscaling of the impacts of climate extremes on global carbon–climate feedbacks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103296",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.12916","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103296","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Carbon cycle||Climate change||Climate extremes||Climate variability||Disturbance||Terrestrial ecosystems","Effects of climate extremes on the terrestrial carbon cycle: concepts, processes and potential future impacts","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:50:21Z",,"pub:161508",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653646a57f25511",,,,"000358485200006","Glob.

On contrast, the Austrian Foehn is characterized by near-horizontal flow to the south of the Alps, followed by dry-adiabatic descent into the northern Foehn valleys. In this study, we make use of three years (2000–2002) of NWP reanalysis data, based on the COSMO model, and corresponding Foehn observations at a Swiss (Altdorf in the Reuss Valley) and Austrian (Ellbögen in the Wipp Valley) measurement site to address the applicability of this Foehn type classification. First, the methods are introduced in a case study of a strong Foehn case on 2–4 April 2000. The more traditional Eulerian analysis is complemented by trajectory calculations. Forward trajectories started in the Po Valley and backward trajectories started at the two Foehn stations reveal a complex flow situation. For instance, air parcels arriving in Altdorf can be trapped in the easterly, low-level Po Valley jet before ascending and passing over the Alpine crest, thus originating from further east than air parcels arriving in Ellbögen and having experienced less vertical ascent south of the Alps. This highlights the potential of Lagrangian-based flow analysis and concurrently points to the limitations of a pure Eulerian perspective.The main part of the study considers a climatology of the 3-year backward trajectories started at Altdorf and Ellbögen. Some key findings are: (i) a larger fraction of trajectories arriving in Altdorf experience substantial lifting on the Alpine south side compared to Ellbögen; (ii) both Foehn types can be observed at both stations, i.e., the type naming cannot be taken as an exclusive regional classification; (iii) precipitation traced back is more predominant for Altdorf trajectories than for Ellbögen ones, indicating that the latent heating contributes more to Foehn warming in Altdorf than in Ellbögen. Finally, from a forecasting perspective it is of interest whether the Foehn type can be deduced from a simple measurement alone. To this aim, Milan pseudo-soundings in the Po Valley, essentially south of Altdorf, are considered. Composite soundings are compared for Foehn cases in Altdorf with substantial lifting to those with weak lifting, corresponding to a non-blocked and blocked flow in the Po Valley. The two classes clearly differ in their composite profile; however, the spread prohibits an immediate classification on this sounding alone.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103254",,"0941-2948||1610-1227",,"10.1127/metz/2015/0647","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103254","en","Schweizerbart","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","Foehn||Climatology||Altdorf||Innsbruck||trajectories","Swiss and Austrian Foehn revisited: A Lagrangian-based analysis","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:46:08Z",,"pub:161465",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653636a82714419","000637360",,,"000358784000001","Meteorol.

Limiting global warming to any level thus implies a finite CO2 budget. Due to geophysical uncertainties, the size of such budgets can only be expressed in probabilistic terms and is further influenced by non-CO2 emissions. We here explore how societal choices related to energy demand and specific mitigation options influence the size of carbon budgets for meeting a given temperature objective. We find that choices that exclude specific CO2 mitigation technologies (like Carbon Capture and Storage) result in greater costs, smaller compatible CO2 budgets until 2050, but larger CO2 budgets until 2100. Vice versa, choices that lead to a larger CO2 mitigation potential result in CO2 budgets until 2100 that are smaller but can be met at lower costs. In most cases, these budget variations can be explained by the amount of non-CO2 mitigation that is carried out in conjunction with CO2, and associated global carbon prices that also drive mitigation of non-CO2 gases. Budget variations are of the order of 10% around their central value. In all cases, limiting warming to below 2 °C thus still implies that CO2 emissions need to be reduced rapidly in the coming decades.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103372",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/10/7/075003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103372","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Climate change||Carbot budgets||Emission budgets||Mitigation||Greenhouse gases||Non-CO2||Methane","Mitigation choices impact carbon budget size compatible with low temperature goals","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:53:26Z",,"pub:161614",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365366296f376032","005253059","84982064540",,"000366759200020","Environ.

Here we assess how emissions from short-lived non-CO2 species like methane, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), black-carbon, and sulphates influence these CO2 budgets. Our default case, which assumes mitigation in all sectors and of all gases, results in a CO2 budget between 2011–2100 of 340 PgC for a >66% chance of staying below 2°C, consistent with the assessment of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Extreme variations of air-pollutant emissions from black-carbon and sulphates influence this budget by about ±5%. In the hypothetical case of no methane or HFCs mitigation—which is unlikely when CO2 is stringently reduced—the budgets would be much smaller (40% or up to 60%, respectively). However, assuming very stringent CH4 mitigation as a sensitivity case, CO2 budgets could be 25% higher. A limit on cumulative CO2 emissions remains critical for temperature targets. Even a 25% higher CO2 budget still means peaking global emissions in the next two decades, and achieving net zero CO2 emissions during the third quarter of the 21st century. The leverage we have to affect the CO2 budget by targeting non-CO2 diminishes strongly along with CO2 mitigation, because these are partly linked through economic and technological factors.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103371",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/10/7/075001","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103371","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Climate change||Carbon budget||Cumulative carbon||Short-lived climate pollutants||Global warming||Carbon dioxide","Impact of short-lived non-CO2 mitigation on carbon budgets for stabilizing global warming","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:53:26Z",,"pub:161613",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936536623bfd24097","005253059","84982074184",,"000366759200018","Environ.

Multiple linear regression is applied to estimate the zonal temperature, wind and annular mode responses to a typical solar cycle, with a focus on both the stratosphere and the stratospheric influence on the surface over the period ∼1850–2005. The analysis is performed on all CMIP‐5 models but focuses on the 13 CMIP‐5 models that resolve the stratosphere (high‐top models) and compares the simulated solar cycle signature with reanalysis data. The 11 year solar cycle component of climate variability is found to be weaker in terms of magnitude and latitudinal gradient around the stratopause in the models than in the reanalysis. The peak in temperature in the lower equatorial stratosphere (∼70 hPa) reported in some studies is found in the models to depend on the length of the analysis period, with the last 30 years yielding the strongest response.  A modification of the Polar Jet Oscillation (PJO) in response to the 11 year solar cycle is not robust across all models, but is more apparent in models with high spectral resolution in the short‐wave region. The PJO evolution is slower in these models, leading to a stronger response during February, whereas observations indicate it to be weaker. In early winter, the magnitude of the modelled response is more consistent with observations when only data from 1979–2005 are considered. The observed North Pacific high‐pressure surface response during the solar maximum is only simulated in some models, for which there are no distinguishing model characteristics. The lagged North Atlantic surface response is reproduced in both high‐ and low‐top models, but is more prevalent in the former. In both cases, the magnitude of the response is generally lower than in observations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000104237",,"0035-9009||1477-870X",,"10.1002/qj.2530","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/104237","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","SolarMIP||Solar variability||Stratosphere||CMIP-5||Climate||Natural variability","Solar signals in CMIP‐5 simulations: the stratospheric pathway","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T19:20:32Z",,"pub:163074",,"yes",,,,"Future and Past Solar Influence on the Terrestrial Climate II","147659","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF: Sonstige",,"imp593653799d87070729","000053342","84941179513",,"000360986200031","Q.

However, combining those projections is complicated by the fact that models developed by different groups share ideas and code and therefore biases. The authors propose a method for combining model results into single or multivariate distributions that are more robust to the inclusion of models with a large degree of interdependency. This study uses a multivariate metric of present-day climatology to assess both model performance and similarity in two recent model intercomparisons, CMIP3 and CMIP5. Model characteristics can be interpolated and then resampled in a space defined by independent climate properties. A form of weighting can be applied by sampling more densely in the region of the space close to the projected observations, thus taking into account both model performance and interdependence. The choice of the sampling distribution’s parameters is a subjective decision that should reflect the researcher’s prior assumptions as to the acceptability of different model errors.",,,,"0894-8755||1520-0442","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/164406||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/102500","10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00361.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/567602","en","American Meteorological Society",,,,"Addressing Interdependency in a Multimodel Ensemble by Interpolation of Model Properties","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2017-06-11T18:24:04Z",,"pub:169074||pub:160640",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653cb9664059872||imp59365351e564a32741",,"84942025934",,"000357485700009","J. climate","13","Journal of Climate","28","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To provide context for local investigations and to better understand phenomena that only emerge at large spatial scales, reliable information on continental-scale freshwater dynamics is necessary. To date streamflow is among the best-observed variables of terrestrial water systems. However, observation networks have a limited station density and often incomplete temporal coverage, limiting investigations to locations and times with observations. This paper presents a methodology to estimate continental-scale runoff on a 0.5° spatial grid with monthly resolution. The methodology is based on statistical upscaling of observed streamflow from small catchments in Europe and exploits readily available gridded atmospheric forcing data combined with the capability of machine learning techniques. The resulting runoff estimates are validated against (1) runoff from small catchments that were not used for model training, (2) river discharge from nine continental-scale river basins and (3) independent estimates of long-term mean evapotranspiration at the pan-European scale. In addition it is shown that the produced gridded runoff compares on average better to observations than a multi-model ensemble of comprehensive land surface models (LSMs), making it an ideal candidate for model evaluation and model development. In particular, the presented machine learning approach may help determining which factors are most relevant for an efficient modelling of runoff at regional scales. Finally, the resulting data product is used to derive a comprehensive runoff climatology for Europe and its potential for drought monitoring is illustrated.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000102543",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-19-2859-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/102543","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Towards observation-based gridded runoff estimates for Europe","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:24:04Z",,"pub:160683",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936535303f4c98344","001881462",,,"000357125300023","Hydrol.

CPMs no longer rely on convection parameterization schemes, which had been identified as a major source of errors and uncertainties in LSMs. Moreover, CPMs allow for a more accurate representation of surface and orography fields. The drawback of CPMs is the high demand on computational resources. For this reason, first CPM climate simulations only appeared a decade ago. In this study, we aim to provide a common basis for CPM climate simulations by giving a holistic review of the topic. The most important components in CPMs such as physical parameterizations and dynamical formulations are discussed critically. An overview of weaknesses and an outlook on required future developments is provided. Most importantly, this review presents the consolidated outcome of studies that addressed the added value of CPM climate simulations compared to LSMs. Improvements are evident mostly for climate statistics related to deep convection, mountainous regions, or extreme events. The climate change signals of CPM simulations suggest an increase in flash floods, changes in hail storm characteristics, and reductions in the snowpack over mountains. In conclusion, CPMs are a very promising tool for future climate research. However, coordinated modeling programs are crucially needed to advance parameterizations of unresolved physics and to assess the full potential of CPMs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000101854",,"8755-1209||0096-1043||1944-9208",,"10.1002/2014RG000475","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/101854","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A review on regional convection‐permitting climate modeling: Demonstrations, prospects, and challenges","Review Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:58:14Z",,"pub:159958",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365342b0c0e12272","000030755","84937516623",,,"Rev.

The retrieval relies on combining mass-to-charge data and size data from light scattering. Here, we use a combination of low- and high-resolution Mie resonance spectroscopy to obtain radius data, enabling an accurate size determination not only when the particle is in equilibrium, but also when it is out of equilibrium due to kinetic limitation of mass transport. With the data measured under non-equilibrium conditions, it is possible to retrieve the water diffusivity. A challenge is that the radius retrieval by comparing measured light scattering with Mie theory requires the knowledge of refractive index as a function of concentration. Here, we show an iterative retrieval of refractive index and size for compounds for which data cannot be obtained in the bulk either due to lack of sufficient amounts of sample or limited solubility. We demonstrate the measurement strategy and the retrieval of water activity, density, refractive index and water diffusivity for aqueous shikimic acid. Water diffusivity in concentrated shikimic acid decreases by 6 orders of magnitude at 250 K compared to that at room temperature.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000101937",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-8-2397-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/101937","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Electrodynamic balance measurements of thermodynamic, kinetic, and optical aerosol properties inaccessible to bulk methods","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:01:00Z",,"pub:160049",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653447c9bc30974",,"84930966173",,"000357117900012","Atmos. meas. tech.","6","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We evaluate these budgets as represented in 43 CMIP5 climate models with direct observations from both surface and space and identify substantial biases, particularly in the surface fluxes of downward solar and thermal radiation. These flux biases in the various models are then linearly related to their respective land and ocean means to infer best estimates for present day downward solar and thermal radiation over land and oceans. Over land, where most direct observations are available to constrain the surface fluxes, we obtain 184 and 306 Wm−2 for solar and thermal downward radiation, respectively. Over oceans, with weaker observational constraints, corresponding estimates are around 185 and 356 Wm−2. Considering additionally surface albedo and emissivity, we infer a surface absorbed solar and net thermal radiation of 136 and −66 Wm−2 over land, and 170 and −53 Wm−2 over oceans, respectively. The surface net radiation is thus estimated at 70 Wm−2 over land and 117 Wm−2 over oceans, which may impose additional constraints on the poorly known sensible/latent heat flux magnitudes, estimated here near 32/38 Wm−2 over land, and 16/100 Wm−2 over oceans. Estimated uncertainties are on the order of 10 and 5 Wm−2 for most surface and TOA fluxes, respectively. By combining these surface budgets with satellite-determined TOA budgets we quantify the atmospheric energy budgets as residuals (including ocean to land transports), and revisit the global mean energy balance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000094233",,"0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-014-2430-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/94233","en","Springer","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Global energy balance||Radiation budget||Global climate models||Surface and satellite observations||CMIP5","The energy balance over land and oceans: An assessment based on direct observations and CMIP5 climate models","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T14:32:00Z",,"pub:148111",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593652a827dce22638","000036174","84916920075",,"000354705700029","Clim Dyn","11-12","Climate Dynamics","44","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Single droplets of mixed phase composition are captured in a gradient force optical trap, and the evolving size, refractive index (RI), and morphology are characterized by cavity-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Starting at a RH above the phase separation RH, the trapped particle is dried to lower RH and the transition to a phase-separated structure is inferred from distinct changes in the spectroscopic fingerprint. In particular, the phase separation RHs of droplets composed of aqueous solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG-400)/ammonium sulfate and a mixture of C6-diacids/ammonium sulfate are probed, inferring the RH from the RI of the droplet immediately prior to phase separation. The observed phase separation RHs occur at RH marginally higher (at most 4%) than reported in previous measurements made from studies of particles deposited on hydrophobic surfaces by brightfield imaging. Clear evidence for the formation of phase-separated droplets of core–shell morphology is observed, although partially engulfed structures can also be inferred to form. Transitions between the different spectroscopic signatures of phase separation suggest that fluctuations in morphology can occur. For droplets that are repeatedly cycled through the phase separation RH, the water activity at phase separation is found to be remarkably reproducible (within ±0.0013) and is the same for the 1-phase to 2-phase transition and the 2-phase to 1-phase transition. By contrast, larger variation between the water activities at phase separation is observed for different droplets (typically ±0.02).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000100841",,"1089-5639||1520-5215",,"10.1021/acs.jpca.5b01658","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/100841","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Liquid-liquid phase separation in mixed organic/inorganic single aqueous aerosol droplets","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:25:13Z",,"pub:158350",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936532bac1e778316",,"84928966997",,"000354339300012","J. phys. chem., A","18","The Journal of Physical Chemistry A","119","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous climate modelling studies have found that the biogeophysical effects of future Amazonian deforestation will likely increase surface temperatures and reduce precipitation locally. However, the magnitude of these changes and the potential existence of tipping points in the underlying relationships is still highly uncertain. Using a regional climate model at a resolution of about 50 km over the South American continent, we perform four ERA-interim-driven simulations with prescribed land cover maps corresponding to present-day vegetation, two deforestation scenarios for the twenty-first century, and a totally-deforested Amazon case. In response to projected land cover changes for 2100, we find an annual mean surface temperature increase of 0.5 °C over the Amazonian region and an annual mean decrease in rainfall of 0.17 mm/day compared to present-day conditions. These estimates reach 0.8 °C and 0.22 mm/day in the total-deforestation case. We also compare our results to those from 28 previous (regional and global) climate modelling experiments. We show that the historical development of climate models did not modify the median estimate of the Amazonian climate sensitivity to deforestation, but led to a reduction of its uncertainty. Our results suggest that the biogeophysical effects of deforestation alone are unlikely to lead to a tipping point in the evolution of the regional climate under present-day climate conditions. However, the conducted synthesis of the literature reveals that this behaviour may be model-dependent, and the greenhouse gas-induced climate forcing and biogeochemical feedbacks should also be taken into account to fully assess the future climate of this region.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000100368",,"0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-014-2203-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/100368","en","Springer","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Land-use and land-cover changes||Amazonian deforestation||Tipping points||Twenty-first century","Influence of Amazonian deforestation on the future evolution of regional surface fluxes, circulation, surface temperature and precipitation","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:09:17Z",,"pub:157432",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936532094a4183643","000036174","84940239344",,"000351459800025","Clim Dyn","9-10","Climate Dynamics","44","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The analysis is based on a composite approach of the 200 most intense cyclones during the period 1989–2008 that have been identified and tracked using the output of a coupled ocean–atmosphere regional simulation with 20 km horizontal grid spacing and 3-hourly output. It is shown that the most intense Mediterranean cyclones have a common baroclinic life cycle with a potential vorticity (PV) streamer associated with an upper-level cyclonic Rossby wave breaking, which precedes cyclogenesis in the region and triggers baroclinic instability. It is argued that this common baroclinic life cycle is due to the strongly horizontally sheared environment in the Mediterranean basin, on the poleward flank of the quasi-persistent subtropical jet. The composite life cycle of the cyclones is further analyzed considering the evolution of key atmospheric elements as potential temperature and PV, as well as the cyclones’ thermodynamic profiles and rainfall. It is shown that most intense Mediterranean cyclones are associated with warm conveyor belts and dry air intrusions, similar to those of other strong extratropical cyclones, but of rather small scale. Before cyclones reach their mature stage, the streamer’s role is crucial to advect moist and warm air towards the cyclones center. These dynamical characteristics, typical for very intense extratropical cyclones in the main storm track regions, are also valid for these Mediterranean cases that have features that are visually similar to tropical cyclones.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000090051",,"0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-014-2330-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/90051","en","Springer","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Cyclone||Potential Vorticity||Relative Vorticity||Extratroptical Cyclone||Cyclone Center","The dynamical structure of intense Mediterranean cyclones","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T12:46:51Z",,"pub:141782",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936525b9268682165","000036174","84925464939",,"000351459800005","Clim Dyn","9-10","Climate Dynamics","44","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Daily 2-m minimum temperatures below the 1st percentile and 2-m maximum temperatures above the 99th percentile at each grid point over Iberia are selected separately for winter and summer. Four categories of extremes are analysed using 10-d backward trajectories initialized at the extreme temperature grid points close to the surface: winter cold (WCE) and warm extremes (WWE), and summer cold (SCE) and warm extremes (SWE). Air masses leading to temperature extremes are first transported from the North Atlantic towards Europe for all categories. While there is a clear relation to large-scale circulation patterns in winter, the Iberian thermal low is important in summer. Along the trajectories, air mass characteristics are significantly modified through adiabatic warming (air parcel descent), upper-air radiative cooling and near-surface warming (surface heat fluxes and radiation). High residence times over continental areas, such as over northern-central Europe for WCE and, to a lesser extent, over Iberia for SWE, significantly enhance these air mass modifications. Near-surface diabatic warming is particularly striking for SWE. WCE and SWE are responsible for the most extreme conditions in a given year. For WWE and SCE, strong temperature advection associated with important meridional air mass transports are the main driving mechanisms, accompanied by comparatively minor changes in the air mass properties. These results permit a better understanding of mechanisms leading to temperature extremes in Iberia.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000101056",,"0280-6495||1600-0870",,"10.3402/tellusa.v67.26032","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/101056","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Temperature extremes||Cold episodes||Warm episodes||Lagrangian trajectories||Large-scale circulation||Surface fluxes||Iberian Peninsula||ERA-Interim","Mechanisms underlying temperature extremes in Iberia: a Lagrangian perspective","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:31:56Z",,"pub:158707",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653307c92e26451","000017638",,,"000353403500001","Tellus, Ser.

We introduce in this study a new hydrological dataset for Europe that consists of soil moisture, runoff and evapotranspiration (ET). It is derived with a simple water balance model (SWBM) forced with precipitation, temperature and net radiation. The SWBM dataset extends over the period 1984–2013 with a daily time step and 0.5° × 0.5° resolution. We employ a novel calibration approach, in which we consider 300 random parameter sets chosen from an observation-based range. Using several independent validation datasets representing soil moisture (or terrestrial water content), ET and streamflow, we identify the best performing parameter set and hence the new dataset. To illustrate its usefulness, the SWBM dataset is compared against several state-of-the-art datasets (ERA-Interim/Land, MERRA-Land, GLDAS-2-Noah, simulations of the Community Land Model Version 4), using all validation datasets as reference. For soil moisture dynamics it outperforms the benchmarks. Therefore the SWBM soil moisture dataset constitutes a reasonable alternative to sparse measurements, little validated model results, or proxy data such as precipitation indices. Also in terms of runoff the SWBM dataset performs well, whereas the evaluation of the SWBM ET dataset is overall satisfactory, but the dynamics are less well captured for this variable. This highlights the limitations of the dataset, as it is based on a simple model that uses uniform parameter values. Hence some processes impacting ET dynamics may not be captured, and quality issues may occur in regions with complex terrain. Even though the SWBM is well calibrated, it cannot replace more sophisticated models; but as their calibration is a complex task the present dataset may serve as a benchmark in future. In addition we investigate the sources of skill of the SWBM dataset and find that the parameter set has a similar impact on the simple model results as the choice of the forcing dataset. The newly derived SWBM dataset is of relevance for a range of applications given the deficit of available land datasets.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000100990",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/10/4/044012","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/100990","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Hydrological dataset||Simple water balance model||Soil moisture||Runoff||Evapotranspiration||Meteorological forcing versus parameter uncertainty","Introduction of a simple-model-based land surface dataset for Europe","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:31:56Z",,"pub:158639",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936532edf3b573524","005253059",,,"000353641400013","Environ.

Aerosols have been taken into account in CNRM-RCSM4 through realistic interannual monthly AOD climatologies. An evaluation of the model has been achieved, against various observations for meteorological parameters, and has shown the ability of CNRM-RCSM4 to reproduce the main patterns of the Mediterranean climate despite some biases in sea surface temperature (SST), radiation and cloud cover. The results concerning the aerosol radiative effects show a negative surface forcing on average because of the absorption and scattering of the incident radiation. The SW surface direct effect is on average −20.9 Wm−2 over the Mediterranean Sea, −14.7 Wm−2 over Europe and −19.7 Wm−2 over northern Africa. The LW surface direct effect is weaker as only dust aerosols contribute (+4.8 Wm−2 over northern Africa). This direct effect is partly counterbalanced by a positive semi-direct radiative effect over the Mediterranean Sea (+5.7 Wm−2 on average) and Europe (+5.0 Wm−2) due to changes in cloud cover and atmospheric circulation. The total aerosol effect is consequently negative at the surface and responsible for a decrease in land (on average −0.4 °C over Europe, and −0.5 °C over northern Africa) and sea surface temperature (on average −0.5 °C for the Mediterranean SST). In addition, the latent heat loss is shown to be weaker (−11.0 Wm−2) in the presence of aerosols, resulting in a decrease in specific humidity in the lower troposphere, and a reduction in cloud cover and precipitation. Simulations also indicate that dust aerosols warm the troposphere by absorbing solar radiation, and prevent radiation from reaching the surface, thus stabilizing the troposphere. The comparison with the model response in atmosphere-only simulations shows that these feedbacks are attenuated if SST cannot be modified by aerosols, highlighting the importance of using coupled regional models over the Mediterranean. Oceanic convection is also strengthened by aerosols, which tends to reinforce the Mediterranean thermohaline circulation. In parallel, two case studies are presented to illustrate positive feedbacks between dust aerosols and regional climate. First, the eastern Mediterranean was subject to high dust aerosol loads in June 2007 which reduce land and sea surface temperature, as well as air–sea humidity fluxes. Because of northern wind over the eastern Mediterranean, drier and cooler air has been consequently advected from the sea to the African continent, reinforcing the direct dust effect over land. On the contrary, during the western European heat wave in June 2006, dust aerosols have contributed to reinforcing an important ridge responsible for dry and warm air advection over western Europe, and thus to increasing lower troposphere (+0.8 °C) and surface temperature (+0.5 °C), namely about 15 % of this heat wave.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000099617",,"0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-014-2205-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/99617","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Aerosol||Radiation||Mediterranean||Regional climate||Dust","Direct and semi-direct aerosol radiative effect on the Mediterranean climate variability using a coupled regional climate system model","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T16:48:41Z",,"pub:155922",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936530ece2bd35653","000036174",,,"000349406100030","Clim Dyn","3-4","Climate Dynamics","44","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using a crop simulation model forced by three global climate model simulations, we investigate the impacts on agricultural production in China, the largest grain producer in the world. In the first year after the regional nuclear war, a cooler, drier, and darker environment would reduce annual rice production by 30 megaton (Mt) (29%), maize production by 36 Mt (20%), and wheat production by 23 Mt (53%). With different agriculture management—no irrigation, auto irrigation, 200 kg/ha nitrogen fertilizer, and 10 days delayed planting date—simulated national crop production reduces 16%–26% for rice, 9%–20% for maize, and 32%–43% for wheat during 5 years after the nuclear war event. This reduction of food availability would continue, with gradually decreasing amplitude, for more than a decade. Assuming these impacts are indicative of those in other major grain producers, a nuclear war using much less than 1% of the current global arsenal could produce a global food crisis and put a billion people at risk of famine.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000102748",,"2328-4277",,"10.1002/2014EF000283","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/102748","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","regional nuclear war||nuclear winter||agriculture impacts||China||DSSAT||famine","Decadal reduction of Chinese agriculture after a regional nuclear war","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:30:36Z",,"pub:160904",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365357a2e5b12085","010090819",,,"000358139000001",,"2","Earth's Future","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it is not clear that there are sufficient numbers of these particles in the atmosphere to strongly influence clouds. Here we show that the ice-nucleating activity of a fungus from the ubiquitous genus Fusarium is related to the presence of nanometre-scale particles which are far more numerous, and therefore potentially far more important for cloud glaciation than whole intact spores or hyphae. In addition, we quantify the ice-nucleating activity of nano-ice nucleating particles (nano-INPs) washed off pollen and also show that nano-INPs are present in a soil sample. Based on these results, we suggest that there is a reservoir of biological nano-INPs present in the environment which may, for example, become aerosolised in association with fertile soil dust particles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000109442",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/srep08082","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/109442","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Atmospheric science||Environmental sciences","The relevance of nanoscale biological fragments for ice nucleation in clouds","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T22:41:01Z",,"pub:170536",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653e25283613172","006751867",,,,"Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are rare in comparison to cloud condensation nuclei. However, the fact that only a small fraction of aerosol particles can nucleate ice means that detection and quantification of INPs is challenging. This is particularly true at temperatures above about −20 °C since the population of particles capable of serving as INPs decreases dramatically with increasing temperature. In this paper, we describe an experimental technique in which droplets of microlitre volume containing ice-nucleating material are cooled down at a controlled rate and their freezing temperatures recorded. The advantage of using large droplet volumes is that the surface area per droplet is vastly larger than in experiments focused on single aerosol particles or cloud-sized droplets. This increases the probability of observing the effect of less common, but important, high-temperature INPs and therefore allows the quantification of their ice nucleation efficiency. The potential artefacts which could influence data from this experiment, and other similar experiments, are mitigated and discussed. Experimentally determined heterogeneous ice nucleation efficiencies for K-feldspar (microcline), kaolinite, chlorite, NX-illite, Snomax® and silver iodide are presented.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000109446",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-8-2437-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/109446","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"A technique for quantifying heterogeneous ice nucleation in microlitre supercooled water droplets","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T22:41:01Z",,"pub:170541",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653e26903a48863","010152804",,,,"Atmos. meas. tech.","6","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we evaluate climate change impacts on solar photovoltaic (PV) power in Europe using the recent EURO-CORDEX ensemble of high-resolution climate projections together with a PV power production model and assuming a well-developed European PV power fleet. Results indicate that the alteration of solar PV supply by the end of this century compared with the estimations made under current climate conditions should be in the range (−14%;+2%), with the largest decreases in Northern countries. Temporal stability of power generation does not appear as strongly affected in future climate scenarios either, even showing a slight positive trend in Southern countries. Therefore, despite small decreases in production expected in some parts of Europe, climate change is unlikely to threaten the European PV sector.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000109241",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/ncomms10014","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/109241","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The impact of climate change on photovoltaic power generation in Europe","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T22:24:16Z",,"pub:170306",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653dea9c8585252","007044158","84949580254",,"000367567400002","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

VALUE aims to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange between climatologists, impact modellers, statisticians, and stakeholders to establish an interdisciplinary downscaling community. A key deliverable of VALUE is the development of a systematic validation framework to enable the assessment and comparison of both dynamical and statistical downscaling methods. In this paper, we present the key ingredients of this framework. VALUE's main approach to validation is user‐ focused: starting from a specific user problem, a validation tree guides the selection of relevant validation indices and performance measures. Several experiments have been designed to isolate specific points in the downscaling procedure where problems may occur: what is the isolated downscaling skill? How do statistical and dynamical methods compare? How do methods perform at different spatial scales? Do methods fail in representing regional climate change? How is the overall representation of regional climate, including errors inherited from global climate models? The framework will be the basis for a comprehensive community‐open downscaling intercomparison study, but is intended also to provide general guidance for other validation studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000102749",,"2328-4277",,"10.1002/2014EF000259","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/102749","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/","Downscaling||Validation||Regional climate modelling||Statistical downscaling||Dynamical downscaling||Bias correction","VALUE: A framework to validate downscaling approaches for climate change studies","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:30:36Z",,"pub:160905",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365357a816177550","010090819",,,"000358138100001",,"1","Earth's Future","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The lack of well-dated terrestrial proxy records spanning this time period, however, renders the reconstruction of past atmospheric patterns difficult. Here we present a precisely dated, continuous terrestrial record of meteoric precipitation in Europe between 30 and 14.7 ka. In contrast to present-day conditions, our speleothem data provide strong evidence for preferential advection of moisture from the South across the Alps supporting a southward shift of the storm track during the local Last Glacial Maximum (that is, 26.5–23.5 ka). Moreover, our age control indicates that this circulation pattern preceded the Northern Hemisphere precession maximum by ~3 ka, suggesting that obliquity may have played a considerable role in the Alpine ice aggradation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000101727",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/ncomms7344","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/101727","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"North Atlantic storm track changes during the Last Glacial Maximum recorded by Alpine speleothems","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:54:46Z",,"pub:159686",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936533fe21ec78918","007044158","84923924979",,,"Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using radiative forcing calculations, we quantify both the carbon sequestration potential and the effect of albedo change at high resolution. We calculate the albedo radiative forcing based on remotely sensed data sets of albedo, global radiation and snow cover. Carbon sequestration is estimated from changes in carbon stocks based on national inventories. We first estimate the spatial pattern of radiative forcing (RF) across Switzerland assuming homogeneous transitions from open land to forest. This highlights where forest expansion still exhibits climatic benefits when including the radiative forcing of albedo change. Second, given that forest expansion is currently the dominant land-use change process in the Swiss Alps, we calculate the radiative forcing that occurred between 1985 and 1997. Our results show that the net RF of forest expansion ranges from −24 W m−2 at low elevations of the northern Prealps to 2 W m−2 at high elevations of the Central Alps. The albedo RF increases with increasing altitude, which offsets the CO2 RF at high elevations with long snow-covered periods, high global radiation and low carbon sequestration. Albedo RF is particularly relevant during transitions from open land to open forest but not in later stages of forest development. Between 1985 and 1997, when overall forest expansion in Switzerland was approximately 4%, the albedo RF offset the CO2 RF by an average of 40%. We conclude that the albedo RF should be considered at an appropriately high resolution when estimating the climatic effect of forestation in temperate mountainous regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000098123",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-12-467-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/98123","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Carbon storage versus albedo change: Radiative forcing of forest expansion in temperate mountainous regions of Switzerland","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T16:08:52Z",,"pub:153425",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593652ede38be22749","006289717","84921713838",,"000348982200014",,"2","Biogeosciences","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recent observational evidence of afternoon rain falling preferentially over land parcels that are drier than the surrounding areas (negative spatial effect), contrasts with previous reports of a predominant positive temporal effect. However, whether spatial effects relating to soil moisture heterogeneity translate into similar temporal effects remains unknown. Here we show that afternoon precipitation events tend to occur during wet and heterogeneous soil moisture conditions, while being located over comparatively drier patches. Using remote-sensing data and a common analysis framework, spatial and temporal correlations with opposite signs are shown to coexist within the same region and data set. Positive temporal coupling might enhance precipitation persistence, while negative spatial coupling tends to regionally homogenize land surface conditions. Although the apparent positive temporal coupling does not necessarily imply a causal relationship, these results reconcile the notions of moisture recycling with local, spatially negative feedbacks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000100610",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/ncomms7443","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/100610","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Reconciling spatial and temporal soil moisture effects on afternoon rainfall","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:19:22Z",,"pub:157960",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653263d00a92728","007044158",,,"000352633900027","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the north, increased precipitation volumes are likely to reduce drought occurrence, whereas more frequent droughts are expected for southern Europe. To assess whether this pattern of changes in drought frequency can already be identified for the past decades, we analyse trends in a recently developed pan-European drought climatology that is based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The index is derived on multiple time scales, ranging from 1 to 36 months, which allows the assessment of trends in both short term and multi-year droughts. Trends are quantified using the Theil-Sen trend estimator combined with an extension of the Mann–Kendal test (p < 0.05) that accounts for serial correlation. Field significance is assessed on the basis of techniques that control the false discovery rate in a multiple testing setting. The trend analysis indicates that changes in drought frequency are more pronounced on time scales of one year and longer. The analysis also reveals that there has been a tendency for decreased drought frequency in northern Europe in the past decades, whereas droughts have likely become more frequent in selected southern regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103378",,"2199-899X||2199-8981",,"10.5194/piahs-369-75-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103378","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"European drought trends","Conference Paper","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:53:26Z",,"pub:161622",,"yes","26th General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG 2015)","June 22 - July 2, 2015","Prague, Czech Republic","Fostering European Drought Research and Science-Policy Interfacing","282769","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,"imp5936536640d6286467",,,,"000365023000013",,,"Proceedings of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences","369","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They are major contributors to the radiative budget of the Earth and to the toxicity of atmospheric pollution. Atmospheric aging of soot may change its health- and climate-relevant properties by oxidizing the primary black carbon (BC) or organic particulate matter (OM) which, together with ash, comprise soot. This atmospheric aging, which entails the condensation of secondary particulate matter as well as the oxidation of the primary OM and BC emissions, is currently poorly understood.  In this study, atmospheric aging of wood-stove soot aerosols was simulated in a continuous-flow reactor. The composition of fresh and aged soot particles was measured in real time by a dual-vaporizer aerosol-particle mass spectrometer (SP-AMS). The dual-vaporizer SP-AMS provided information on the OM and BC components of the soot as well as on refractory components internally mixed with BC. By switching the SP-AMS laser vaporizer off and using only the AMS thermal vaporizer (at 600 °C), information on the OM component only was obtained. In both modes, OM appeared to be generated largely by cellulose and/or hemicellulose pyrolysis and was only present in large amounts when new wood was added to the stove. In SP-AMS mode, BC signals otherwise dominated the mass spectrum. These signals consisted of ions related to refractory BC (rBC, C1-5+), oxygenated carbonaceous ions (CO1-2+), potassium (K+), and water (H2O+ and related fragments). The C4+ : C3+ ratio, but not the C1+ : C3+ ratio, was consistent with the BC-structure trends of Corbin et al. (2015c). The CO1-2+ signals likely originated from BC surface groups: upon aging, both CO+ and CO2+ increased relative to C1-3+ while CO2+ simultaneously increased relative to CO+. Factor analysis (positive matrix factorization) of SP-AMS and AMS data, using a modified error model to address peak-integration uncertainties, indicated that the surface composition of the BC was approximately constant across all stages of combustion for both fresh and aged samples. These results represent the first time-resolved measurements of in situ BC surface aging and suggest that the surface of beech-wood BC may be modelled as a single chemical species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000106328",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-11885-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/106328","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Black carbon surface oxidation and organic composition of beech-wood soot aerosols","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T20:33:57Z",,"pub:166437",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653a4eed4b22273","004294181","84946054678",,"000364316800024","Atmos. chem. phys.","20","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This paper presents an overview of the methods, assumptions, and challenges involved in constructing such merged data sets, as well as the first thorough intercomparison of seven new long-term satellite data sets. The analysis focuses on the representation of the annual cycle, interannual variability, and long-term trends for the period 1984–2011, which is common to all data sets. Overall, the best agreement amongst data sets is seen in the mid-latitude lower and middle stratosphere, with larger differences in the equatorial lower stratosphere and the upper stratosphere globally. In most cases, differences in the choice of underlying instrument records that were merged produced larger differences between data sets than the use of different merging techniques. Long-term ozone trends were calculated for the period 1984–2011 using a piecewise linear regression with a change in trend prescribed at the end of 1997. For the 1984–1997 period, trends tend to be most similar between data sets (with largest negative trends ranging from −4 to −8% decade−1 in the mid-latitude upper stratosphere), in large part due to the fact that most data sets are predominantly (or only) based on the SAGE-II record. Trends in the middle and lower stratosphere are much smaller, and, particularly for the lower stratosphere, large uncertainties remain. For the later period (1998–2011), trends vary to a greater extent, ranging from approximately −1 to +5% decade−1 in the upper stratosphere. Again, middle and lower stratospheric trends are smaller and for most data sets not significantly different from zero. Overall, however, there is a clear shift from mostly negative to mostly positive trends between the two periods over much of the profile.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000100050",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-3021-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/100050","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Intercomparison of vertically resolved merged satellite ozone data sets: Interannual variability and long-term trends","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:00:00Z",,"pub:156653",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653192b64749943","004294181","84925341573",,"000352157600003","Atmos. chem. phys.","6","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we present model simulations performed with the chemistry–climate model SOCOL, in which spatially disaggregated chemistry and transport tracers have been implemented in order to better understand the distribution and projected changes in tropospheric ozone. We examine the influences of ozone precursor emissions (nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)), climate change (including methane effects) and stratospheric ozone recovery on the tropospheric ozone budget, in a simulation following the climate scenario Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 6.0 (a medium-high, and reasonably realistic climate scenario). Changes in ozone precursor emissions have the largest effect, leading to a global-mean increase in tropospheric ozone which maximizes in the early 21st century at 23% compared to 1960. The increase is most pronounced at northern midlatitudes, due to regional emission patterns: between 1990 and 2060, northern midlatitude tropospheric ozone remains at constantly large abundances: 31% larger than in 1960. Over this 70-year period, attempts to reduce emissions in Europe and North America do not have an effect on zonally averaged northern midlatitude ozone because of increasing emissions from Asia, together with the long lifetime of ozone in the troposphere. A simulation with fixed anthropogenic ozone precursor emissions of NOx, CO and non-methane VOCs at 1960 conditions shows a 6% increase in global-mean tropospheric ozone by the end of the 21st century, with an 11 % increase at northern midlatitudes. This increase maximizes in the 2080s and is mostly caused by methane, which maximizes in the 2080s following RCP 6.0, and plays an important role in controlling ozone directly, and indirectly through its influence on other VOCs and CO. Enhanced flux of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere as well as climate change-induced enhancements in lightning NOx emissions also increase the tropospheric ozone burden, although their impacts are relatively small. Overall, the results show that under this climate scenario, ozone in the future is governed largely by changes in methane and NOx; methane induces an increase in tropospheric ozone that is approximately one-third of that caused by NOx. Climate impacts on ozone through changes in tropospheric temperature, humidity and lightning NOx remain secondary compared with emission strategies relating to anthropogenic emissions of NOx, such as fossil fuel burning. Therefore, emission policies globally have a critical role to play in determining tropospheric ozone evolution through the 21st century.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000101988",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-5887-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/101988","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Drivers of the tropospheric ozone budget throughout the 21st century under the medium-high climate scenario RCP 6.0","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:04:44Z",,"pub:160104",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365345ca37345870","004294181",,,"000355289200035","Atmos. chem. phys.","10","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These indicate that water diffusion coefficients are determined by several properties of the aerosol substance and cannot be inferred from the glass transition temperature or bouncing properties. Our results suggest that water diffusion in SOA particles is faster than often assumed and imposes no significant kinetic limitation on water uptake and release at temperatures above 220 K. The fast diffusion of water suggests that heterogeneous ice nucleation on a glassy core is very unlikely in these systems. At temperatures below 220 K, model simulations of SOA particles suggest that heterogeneous ice nucleation may occur in the immersion mode on glassy cores which remain embedded in a liquid shell when experiencing fast updraft velocities. The particles absorb significant quantities of water during these updrafts which plasticize their outer layers such that these layers equilibrate readily with the gas phase humidity before the homogeneous ice nucleation threshold is reached. Glass formation is thus unlikely to restrict homogeneous ice nucleation. Only under most extreme conditions near the very high tropical tropopause may the homogeneous ice nucleation rate coefficient be reduced as a consequence of slow condensed-phase water diffusion. Since the differences between the behavior limited or non limited by diffusion are small even at the very high tropical tropopause, condensed-phase water diffusivity is unlikely to have significant consequences on the direct climatic effects of SOA particles under tropospheric conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000108076",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-13599-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/108076","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Viscous organic aerosol particles in the upper troposphere: diffusivity-controlled water uptake and ice nucleation?","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T21:45:10Z",,"pub:168854",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653c7f044114349","004294181","84949508901",,"000367189600019","Atmos. chem. phys.","23","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The amount of ozone-depleting compounds in the stratosphere (as measured by equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine – EESC) was maximised in the second half of the 1990s. We examine the periods before and after the peak to see if any change in trend is discernible in the ozone record that might be attributable to a change in the EESC trend, though no attribution is attempted. Prior to 1998, trends in the upper stratosphere (~ 45 km, 4 hPa) are found to be −5 to −10 % per decade at mid-latitudes and closer to −5 % per decade in the tropics. No trends are found in the mid-stratosphere (28 km, 30 hPa). Negative trends are seen in the lower stratosphere at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres and in the deep tropics. However, it is hard to be categorical about the trends in the lower stratosphere for three reasons: (i) there are fewer measurements, (ii) the data quality is poorer, and (iii) the measurements in the 1990s are perturbed by aerosols from the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991. These findings are similar to those reported previously even though the measurements for the main satellite and ground-based records have been revised.  There is no sign of a continued negative trend in the upper stratosphere since 1998: instead there is a hint of an average positive trend of ~ 2 % per decade in mid-latitudes and ~ 3 % per decade in the tropics. The significance of these upward trends is investigated using different assumptions of the independence of the trend estimates found from different data sets. The averaged upward trends are significant if the trends derived from various data sets are assumed to be independent (as in Pawson et al., 2014) but are generally not significant if the trends are not independent. This occurs because many of the underlying measurement records are used in more than one merged data set. At this point it is not possible to say which assumption is best. Including an estimate of the drift of the overall ozone observing system decreases the significance of the trends. The significance will become clearer as (i) more years are added to the observational record, (ii) further improvements are made to the historic ozone record (e.g. through algorithm development), and (iii) the data merging techniques are refined, particularly through a more rigorous treatment of uncertainties.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000104255",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-9965-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/104255","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Past changes in the vertical distribution of ozone - Part 3: Analysis and interpretation of trends","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T19:20:32Z",,"pub:163093",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936537a11e9134799","004294181","84941055432",,"000361567600014","Atmos. chem. phys.","17","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For electrolyte-free organic and organic–water mixtures the AIOMFAC model uses a group-contribution approach based on UNIFAC (UNIversal quasi-chemical Functional-group Activity Coefficients). This group-contribution approach explicitly accounts for interactions among organic functional groups and between organic functional groups and water. The previous AIOMFAC version uses a simple parameterisation of the temperature dependence of activity coefficients, aimed to be applicable in the temperature range from ~ 275 to ~ 400 K. With the goal to improve the description of a wide variety of organic compounds found in atmospheric aerosols, we extend the AIOMFAC parameterisation for the functional groups carboxyl, hydroxyl, ketone, aldehyde, ether, ester, alkyl, aromatic carbon-alcohol, and aromatic hydrocarbon to atmospherically relevant low temperatures. To this end we introduce a new parameterisation for the temperature dependence. The improved temperature dependence parameterisation is derived from classical thermodynamic theory by describing effects from changes in molar enthalpy and heat capacity of a multi-component system. Thermodynamic equilibrium data of aqueous organic and water-free organic mixtures from the literature are carefully assessed and complemented with new measurements to establish a comprehensive database, covering a wide temperature range (~ 190 to ~ 440 K) for many of the functional group combinations considered. Different experimental data types and their processing for the estimation of AIOMFAC model parameters are discussed. The new AIOMFAC parameterisation for the temperature dependence of activity coefficients from low to high temperatures shows an overall improvement of 28% in comparison to the previous model version, when both versions are compared to our database of experimentally determined activity coefficients and related thermodynamic data. When comparing the previous and new AIOMFAC model parameterisations to the subsets of experimental data with all temperatures below 274 K or all temperatures above 322 K (i.e. outside a 25 K margin of the reference temperature of 298 K), applying the new parameterisation leads to 37% improvement in each of the two temperature ranges considered. The new parameterisation of AIOMFAC agrees well with a large number of experimental data sets. Larger model–measurement discrepancies were found particularly for some of the systems containing multi-functional organic compounds. The affected systems were typically also poorly represented at room temperature and further improvements will be necessary to achieve better performance of AIOMFAC in these cases (assuming the experimental data are reliable). The performance of the AIOMFAC parameterisation is typically better for systems containing relatively small organic compounds and larger deviations may occur in mixtures where molecules of high structural complexity such as highly oxygenated compounds or molecules of high molecular mass (e.g. oligomers) prevail. Nevertheless, the new parameterisation enables the calculation of activity coefficients for a wide variety of different aqueous/water-free organic solutions down to the low temperatures present in the upper troposphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000098135",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-447-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/98135","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Improved AIOMFAC model parameterisation of the temperature dependence of activity coefficients for aqueous organic mixtures","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T16:08:52Z",,"pub:153438",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593652ee3332b72841","004294181","84921340450",,"000347958200026","Atmos. chem. phys.","1","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The additionally introduced drizzle class improves the physical representation of the droplet spectrum and, more importantly, improves the microphysical processes relevant for precipitation formation compared to the standard parameterization. In order to avoid a mismatch of the liquid and ice phase, a prognostic treatment of snow has been introduced too. This has a significant effect on the amount and altitude of ice clouds, which in turn affects not only the in- and outgoing radiation but also the parameterized collection rates. With the introduction of a prognostic precipitation scheme, a more realistic representation of both liquid and ice phase large-scale precipitation is achieved compared to a diagnostic treatment. An encouraging finding is that with the prognostic treatment the increase of the liquid water path in response to anthropogenic aerosols is reduced by about 25 %. Although the total net radiative forcing is decreased from −1.3±0.3 to −1.6±0.3 W m−2 from the control to the prognostic model version, the difference is within the interannual variability. Altogether the results suggest that the treatment of precipitation in global circulation models has not only a significant influence on the phase of clouds and their conversion rates, but also hints towards uncertainties related to a prognostic precipitation scheme.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000109439",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-8717-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/109439","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Prognostic precipitation with three liquid water classes in the ECHAM5-HAM GCM","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T22:41:01Z",,"pub:170533",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653e243baa73815","004294181",,,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","15","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The new chemistry option called ""RACM-MADE-VBS-AQCHEM"" was evaluated on a cloud resolving scale against ground-based and aircraft measurements collected during the IMPACT-EUCAARI (Intensive Cloud Aerosol Measurement Campaign – European Integrated project on Aerosol Cloud Climate and Air quality interaction) campaign, and complemented with satellite data from MODIS. The day-to-day variability and the diurnal cycle of ozone (O3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the surface are captured by the model. Surface aerosol mass concentrations of sulfate (SO4), nitrate (NO3), ammonium (NH4), and organic matter (OM) are simulated with correlations larger than 0.55. WRF-Chem captures the vertical profile of the aerosol mass concentration in both the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and free troposphere (FT) as a function of the synoptic condition, but the model does not capture the full range of the measured concentrations. Predicted OM concentration is at the lower end of the observed mass concentrations. The bias may be attributable to the missing aqueous chemistry processes of organic compounds and to uncertainties in meteorological fields. A key role could be played by assumptions on the VBS approach such as the SOA formation pathways, oxidation rate, and dry deposition velocity of organic condensable vapours. Another source of error in simulating SOA is the uncertainties in the anthropogenic emissions of primary organic carbon. Aerosol particle number concentration (condensation nuclei, CN) is overestimated by a factor of 1.4 and 1.7 within the PBL and FT, respectively. Model bias is most likely attributable to the uncertainties of primary particle emissions (mostly in the PBL) and to the nucleation rate. Simulated cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are also overestimated, but the bias is more contained with respect to that of CN. The CCN efficiency, which is a characterization of the ability of aerosol particles to nucleate cloud droplets, is underestimated by a factor of 1.5 and 3.8 in the PBL and FT, respectively. The comparison with MODIS data shows that the model overestimates the aerosol optical thickness (AOT). The domain averages (for 1 day) are 0.38 ± 0.12 and 0.42 ± 0.10 for MODIS and WRF-Chem data, respectively. The droplet effective radius (Re) in liquid-phase clouds is underestimated by a factor of 1.5; the cloud liquid water path (LWP) is overestimated by a factor of 1.1–1.6. The consequence is the overestimation of average liquid cloud optical thickness (COT) from a few percent up to 42 %. The predicted cloud water path (CWP) in all phases displays a bias in the range +41–80 %, whereas the bias of COT is about 15 %. In sensitivity tests where we excluded SOA, the skills of the model in reproducing the observed patterns and average values of the microphysical and optical properties of liquid and all phase clouds decreases. Moreover, the run without SOA (NOSOA) shows convective clouds with an enhanced content of liquid and frozen hydrometers, and stronger updrafts and downdrafts. Considering that the previous version of WRF-Chem coupled with a modal aerosol module predicted very low SOA content (secondary organic aerosol model (SORGAM) mechanism) the new proposed option may lead to a better characterization of aerosol–cloud feedbacks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000109444",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-8-2749-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/109444","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"A new chemistry option in WRF/Chem v. 3.4 for the simulation of direct and indirect aerosol effects using VBS: Evaluation against IMPACT-EUCAARI data","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T22:41:01Z",,"pub:170539",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653e25e29c57509","010180250",,,,"Geosci. model dev.","9","Geoscientific Model Development","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Probabilities are derived from Lagrangian particle trajectories computed on the forecast wind fields of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble prediction system. Integration of the method into the 3-D ensemble visualization tool Met.3D, introduced in the first part of this study, facilitates interactive visualization of WCB features and derived probabilities in the context of the ECMWF ensemble forecast. We investigate the sensitivity of the method with respect to trajectory seeding and grid spacing of the forecast wind field. Furthermore, we propose a visual analysis method to quantitatively analyse the contribution of ensemble members to a probability region and, thus, to assist the forecaster in interpreting the obtained probabilities. A case study, revisiting a forecast case from T-NAWDEX-Falcon, illustrates the practical application of Met.3D and demonstrates the use of 3-D and uncertainty visualization for weather forecasting and for planning flight routes in the medium forecast range (3 to 7 days before take-off).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103465",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-8-2355-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103465","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Three-dimensional visualization of ensemble weather forecasts - Part 2: Forecasting warm conveyor belt situations for aircraft-based field campaigns","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:53:26Z",,"pub:161711",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653683875e35403","010180250",,,"000358917100025","Geosci. model dev.","7","Geoscientific Model Development","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In total, 55 out of 216 simulations combining different atmospheric physical schemes have a temperature bias smaller than 1 °C during the heat wave episodes, the majority of simulations showing a cold bias of on average 2–3 °C. Conversely, precipitation is mostly overestimated prior to heat waves, and shortwave radiation is slightly overestimated. Convection is found to be the most sensitive atmospheric physical process impacting simulated heat wave temperature across four different convection schemes in the simulation ensemble. Based on these comparisons, we design a reduced ensemble of five well performing and diverse scheme configurations, which may be used in the future to perform heat wave analysis and to investigate the impact of climate change during summer in Europe.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103466",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-8-2285-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103466","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"An observation-constrained multi-physics WRF ensemble for simulating European mega heat waves","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:56:27Z",,"pub:161712",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653683d77f53947","010180250",,,"000358917100021","Geosci. model dev.","7","Geoscientific Model Development","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The experimental conditions were kept as similar as possible for the different measurements. Of the participating instruments, some examined droplets which had been made from suspensions directly, and the others examined droplets activated on previously generated Snomax particles, with particle diameters of mostly a few hundred nanometers and up to a few micrometers in some cases. Data were obtained in the temperature range from −2 to −38 °C, and it was found that all ice-active protein complexes were already activated above −12 °C. Droplets with different Snomax mass concentrations covering 10 orders of magnitude were examined. Some instruments had very short ice nucleation times down to below 1 s, while others had comparably slow cooling rates around 1 K min−1. Displaying data from the different instruments in terms of numbers of ice-active protein complexes per dry mass of Snomax, nm, showed that within their uncertainty, the data agree well with each other as well as to previously reported literature results. Two parameterizations were taken from literature for a direct comparison to our results, and these were a time-dependent approach based on a contact angle distribution (Niedermeier et al., 2014) and a modification of the parameterization presented in Hartmann et al. (2013) representing a time-independent approach. The agreement between these and the measured data were good; i.e., they agreed within a temperature range of 0.6 K or equivalently a range in nm of a factor of 2. From the results presented herein, we propose that Snomax, at least when carefully shared and prepared, is a suitable material to test and compare different instruments for their accuracy of measuring immersion freezing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000099824",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-1463-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/99824","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Intercomparing different devices for the investigation of ice nucleating particles using Snomax (R) as test substance","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T16:54:28Z",,"pub:156280",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365313c83e687731","004294181","84922953880",,"000349799500021","Atmos. chem. phys.","3","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These dark, light-absorbing particles are known to exert a great melting potential on mountain cryospheric reservoirs through albedo reduction and radiative forcing. This study combines ground-based and satellite remote sensing data to identify a severe aerosol pollution episode observed simultaneously in central Tibet and on the southern side of the Himalayas during 13–19 March 2009 (pre-monsoon). Trajectory calculations based on the high-resolution numerical weather prediction model COSMO are used to locate the source regions and study the mechanisms of pollution transport in the complex topography of the HTP. We detail how polluted air masses from an atmospheric brown cloud (ABC) over South Asia reach the Tibetan Plateau within a few days. Lifting and advection of polluted air masses over the great mountain range is enabled by a combination of synoptic-scale and local meteorological processes. During the days prior to the event, winds over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) are generally weak at lower levels, allowing for accumulation of pollutants and thus the formation of ABCs. The subsequent passing of synoptic-scale troughs leads to southwesterly flow in the middle troposphere over northern and central India, carrying the polluted air masses across the Himalayas. As the IGP is known to be a hotspot of ABCs, the cross-Himalayan transport of polluted air masses may have serious implications for the cryosphere in the HTP and impact climate on regional to global scales. Since the current study focuses on one particularly strong pollution episode, quantifying the frequency and magnitude of similar events in a climatological study is required to assess the total impact.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000102147",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-6007-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/102147","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Atmospheric brown clouds reach the Tibetan Plateau by crossing the Himalayas","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:08:34Z",,"pub:160274",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653498d9fc69519","004294181",,,"000356180900001","Atmos. chem. phys.","11","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In recent years, an increasing number of laboratory experiments utilizing a variety of instruments have examined immersion freezing activity of atmospherically relevant ice-nucleating particles. However, an intercomparison of these laboratory results is a difficult task because investigators have used different ice nucleation (IN) measurement methods to produce these results. A remaining challenge is to explore the sensitivity and accuracy of these techniques and to understand how the IN results are potentially influenced or biased by experimental parameters associated with these techniques.  Within the framework of INUIT (Ice Nuclei Research Unit), we distributed an illite-rich sample (illite NX) as a representative surrogate for atmospheric mineral dust particles to investigators to perform immersion freezing experiments using different IN measurement methods and to obtain IN data as a function of particle concentration, temperature (T), cooling rate and nucleation time. A total of 17 measurement methods were involved in the data intercomparison. Experiments with seven instruments started with the test sample pre-suspended in water before cooling, while 10 other instruments employed water vapor condensation onto dry-dispersed particles followed by immersion freezing. The resulting comprehensive immersion freezing data set was evaluated using the ice nucleation active surface-site density, ns, to develop a representative ns(T) spectrum that spans a wide temperature range (−37 °C < T < −11 °C) and covers 9 orders of magnitude in ns.  In general, the 17 immersion freezing measurement techniques deviate, within a range of about 8 °C in terms of temperature, by 3 orders of magnitude with respect to ns. In addition, we show evidence that the immersion freezing efficiency expressed in ns of illite NX particles is relatively independent of droplet size, particle mass in suspension, particle size and cooling rate during freezing. A strong temperature dependence and weak time and size dependence of the immersion freezing efficiency of illite-rich clay mineral particles enabled the ns parameterization solely as a function of temperature. We also characterized the ns(T) spectra and identified a section with a steep slope between −20 and −27 °C, where a large fraction of active sites of our test dust may trigger immersion freezing. This slope was followed by a region with a gentler slope at temperatures below −27 °C. While the agreement between different instruments was reasonable below ~ −27 °C, there seemed to be a different trend in the temperature-dependent ice nucleation activity from the suspension and dry-dispersed particle measurements for this mineral dust, in particular at higher temperatures. For instance, the ice nucleation activity expressed in ns was smaller for the average of the wet suspended samples and higher for the average of the dry-dispersed aerosol samples between about −27 and −18 °C. Only instruments making measurements with wet suspended samples were able to measure ice nucleation above −18 °C. A possible explanation for the deviation between −27 and −18 °C is discussed. Multiple exponential distribution fits in both linear and log space for both specific surface area-based ns(T) and geometric surface area-based ns(T) are provided. These new fits, constrained by using identical reference samples, will help to compare IN measurement methods that are not included in the present study and IN data from future IN instruments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000099687",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-2489-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/99687","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"A comprehensive laboratory study on the immersion freezing behavior of illite NX particles: A comparison of 17 ice nucleation measurement techniques","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T16:48:41Z",,"pub:155999",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365310b354c41271","004294181","84924301887",,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","5","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We present a description of the Fennec airborne observations during 2011 and 2012 over the remote Sahara (Mauritania and Mali) and the advances in the understanding of mineral dust and boundary layer processes they have provided. Aircraft instrumentation aboard the UK FAAM BAe146 and French SAFIRE (Service des Avions Français Instrumentés pour la Recherche en Environnement) Falcon 20 is described, with specific focus on instrumentation specially developed for and relevant to Saharan meteorology and dust. Flight locations, aims and associated meteorology are described. Examples and applications of aircraft measurements from the Fennec flights are presented, highlighting new scientific results delivered using a synergy of different instruments and aircraft. These include (1) the first airborne measurement of dust particles sizes of up to 300 microns and associated dust fluxes in the Saharan atmospheric boundary layer (SABL), (2) dust uplift from the breakdown of the nocturnal low-level jet before becoming visible in SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible Infra-Red Imager) satellite imagery, (3) vertical profiles of the unique vertical structure of turbulent fluxes in the SABL, (4) in situ observations of processes in SABL clouds showing dust acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) at −15 °C, (5) dual-aircraft observations of the SABL dynamics, thermodynamics and composition in the Saharan heat low region (SHL), (6) airborne observations of a dust storm associated with a cold pool (haboob) issued from deep convection over the Atlas Mountains, (7) the first airborne chemical composition measurements of dust in the SHL region with differing composition, sources (determined using Lagrangian backward trajectory calculations) and absorption properties between 2011 and 2012, (8) coincident ozone and dust surface area measurements suggest coarser particles provide a route for ozone depletion, (9) discrepancies between airborne coarse-mode size distributions and AERONET (AERosol Robotic NETwork) sunphotometer retrievals under light dust loadings. These results provide insights into boundary layer and dust processes in the SHL region – a region of substantial global climatic importance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103252",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-8479-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103252","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Advances in understanding mineral dust and boundary layer processes over the Sahara from Fennec aircraft observations","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:46:08Z",,"pub:161462",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653635bfb610472","004294181","84938302579",,"000358799000041","Atmos. chem. phys.","14","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This is in part due to the enormous advances in measurement technologies, which have allowed for an increasingly accurate understanding of the chemical composition and of the physical properties of atmospheric particles and of their processes in the atmosphere. The growing scientific interest in atmospheric aerosol particles is due to their high importance for environmental policy. In fact, particulate matter constitutes one of the most challenging problems both for air quality and for climate change policies. In this context, this paper reviews the most recent results within the atmospheric aerosol sciences and the policy needs, which have driven much of the increase in monitoring and mechanistic research over the last 2 decades.  The synthesis reveals many new processes and developments in the science underpinning climate–aerosol interactions and effects of PM on human health and the environment. However, while airborne particulate matter is responsible for globally important influences on premature human mortality, we still do not know the relative importance of the different chemical components of PM for these effects. Likewise, the magnitude of the overall effects of PM on climate remains highly uncertain. Despite the uncertainty there are many things that could be done to mitigate local and global problems of atmospheric PM. Recent analyses have shown that reducing black carbon (BC) emissions, using known control measures, would reduce global warming and delay the time when anthropogenic effects on global temperature would exceed 2 °C. Likewise, cost-effective control measures on ammonia, an important agricultural precursor gas for secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA), would reduce regional eutrophication and PM concentrations in large areas of Europe, China and the USA. Thus, there is much that could be done to reduce the effects of atmospheric PM on the climate and the health of the environment and the human population.  A prioritized list of actions to mitigate the full range of effects of PM is currently undeliverable due to shortcomings in the knowledge of aerosol science; among the shortcomings, the roles of PM in global climate and the relative roles of different PM precursor sources and their response to climate and land use change over the remaining decades of this century are prominent. In any case, the evidence from this paper strongly advocates for an integrated approach to air quality and climate policies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103253",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-8217-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103253","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Particulate matter, air quality and climate: lessons learned and future needs","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:46:08Z",,"pub:161464",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936536363b3e99353","004294181",,,"000358799000029","Atmos. chem. phys.","14","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Aerosol particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and ice nucleating particles or become incorporated into cloud droplets by scavenging. For an accurate description of aerosol scavenging and ice nucleation in contact mode, collision efficiency between droplets and aerosol particles needs to be known. This study derives the collision rate from experimental contact freezing data obtained with the ETH CoLlision Ice Nucleation CHamber (CLINCH). Freely falling 80 μm diameter water droplets are exposed to an aerosol consisting of 200 and 400 nm diameter silver iodide particles of concentrations from 500 to 5000 and 500 to 2000 cm−3, respectively, which act as ice nucleating particles in contact mode. The experimental data used to derive collision efficiency are in a temperature range of 238–245 K, where each collision of silver iodide particles with droplets can be assumed to result in the freezing of the droplet. An upper and lower limit of collision efficiency is also estimated for 800 nm diameter kaolinite particles. The chamber is kept at ice saturation at a temperature range of 236 to 261 K, leading to the slow evaporation of water droplets giving rise to thermophoresis and diffusiophoresis. Droplets and particles bear charges inducing electrophoresis. The experimentally derived collision efficiency values of 0.13, 0.07 and 0.047–0.11 for 200, 400 and 800 nm particles are around 1 order of magnitude higher than theoretical formulations which include Brownian diffusion, impaction, interception, thermophoretic, diffusiophoretic and electric forces. This discrepancy is most probably due to uncertainties and inaccuracies in the description of thermophoretic and diffusiophoretic processes acting together. This is, to the authors' knowledge, the first data set of collision efficiencies acquired below 273 K. More such experiments with different droplet and particle diameters are needed to improve our understanding of collision processes acting together.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000109031",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-13759-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/109031","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Comparison of measured and calculated collision efficiencies at low temperatures","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T22:17:53Z",,"pub:170067",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653da5e3be30504","004294181","84950327150",,"000367189600029","Atmos. chem. phys.","23","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we model cirrus clouds along air mass trajectories, whose extinction has been measured with an elastic backscatter lidar at Jungfraujoch research station in the Swiss Alps, with a microphysical stacked box model. The sensitivities of these simulations to input data uncertainties (trajectory resolution, unresolved vertical velocities, ice nuclei number density and upstream specific humidity) are investigated.  Variations in the temporal resolution of the wind field data (COSMO-Model at 2.2 km resolution) between 20 s and 1 h have only a marginal impact on the trajectory path, while the representation of the vertical velocity variability and therefore the cooling rate distribution are significantly affected. A temporal resolution better than 5 min must be chosen in order to resolve cooling rates required to explain the measured extinction. A further increase in the temporal resolution improves the simulation results slightly. The close match between the modelled and observed extinction profile for high-resolution trajectories suggests that the cooling rate spectra calculated by the COSMO-2 model suffice on the selected day. The modelled cooling rate spectra are, however, characterized by significantly lower vertical velocity amplitudes than those found previously in some aircraft campaigns (SUCCESS, MACPEX). A climatological analysis of the vertical velocity amplitude in the Alpine region based on COSMO-2 analyses and balloon sounding data suggests large day-to-day variability in small-scale temperature fluctuations. This demonstrates the necessity to apply numerical weather prediction models with high spatial and temporal resolutions in cirrus modelling, whereas using climatological means for the amplitude of the unresolved air motions does generally not suffice.  The box model simulations further suggest that uncertainties in the upstream specific humidity (± 10 % of the model prediction) and in the ice nuclei number density (0–100 L−1) are more important for the modelled cirrus cloud than the unresolved temperature fluctuations if temporally highly resolved trajectories are used. For the presented case the simulations are incompatible with ice nuclei number densities larger than 20 L−1 and insensitive to variations below this value.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000106469",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-7429-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/106469","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Sensitivities of Lagrangian modeling of mid-latitude cirrus clouds to trajectory data quality","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T20:50:18Z",,"pub:166579",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653a7e54fc50887","004294181","84953896802",,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","13","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We carry out a series of experiments with an atmosphere–ocean–chemistry–climate model to assess how these two processes change stratospheric ozone and Northern Hemispheric (NH) polar vortex dynamics. Ensemble simulations are performed under present day and preindustrial conditions, and with aerosol forcings representative of different eruption strength, to investigate changes in the response behaviour. We show that the halogen component of the HET-AER effect dominates under present-day conditions with a global reduction of ozone (−21 DU for the strongest eruption) particularly at high latitudes, whereas the HET-AER effect increases stratospheric ozone due to N2O5 hydrolysis in a preindustrial atmosphere (maximum anomalies +4 DU). The halogen-induced ozone changes in the present-day atmosphere offset part of the strengthening of the NH polar vortex during mid-winter (reduction of up to −16 m s-1 in January) and slightly amplify the dynamical changes in the polar stratosphere in late winter (+11 m s-1 in March). The RAD-DYN mechanism leads to positive column ozone anomalies which are reduced in a present-day atmosphere by amplified polar ozone depletion (maximum anomalies +12 and +18 DU for present day and preindustrial, respectively). For preindustrial conditions, the ozone response is consequently dominated by RAD-DYN processes, while under present-day conditions, HET-AER effects dominate. The dynamical response of the stratosphere is dominated by the RAD-DYN mechanism showing an intensification of the NH polar vortex in winter (up to +10 m s-1 in January). Ozone changes due to the RAD-DYN mechanism slightly reduce the response of the polar vortex after the eruption under present-day conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000106007",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-11461-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/106007","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"The impacts of volcanic aerosol on stratospheric ozone and the Northern Hemisphere polar vortex: Separating radiative-dynamical changes from direct effects due to enhanced aerosol heterogeneous chemistry","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T20:24:43Z",,"pub:165955",,"yes",,,,"Future and Past Solar Influence on the Terrestrial Climate II","147659","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF: Sonstige",,"imp5936539e1ba7271755","004294181","84944790582",,"000364316800002","Atmos. chem. phys.","20","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The annual mean ratio of activated cloud condensation nuclei (NCCN) to the total number concentration of particles (NCN), known as the activated fraction A, shows a similar functional dependence on supersaturation S at many locations – exceptions to this being certain marine locations, a free troposphere site and background sites in south-west Germany and northern Finland. The use of total number concentration of particles above 50 and 100 nm diameter when calculating the activated fractions (A50 and A100, respectively) renders a much more stable dependence of A on S; A50 and A100 also reveal the effect of the size distribution on CCN activation. With respect to chemical composition, it was found that the hygroscopicity of aerosol particles as a function of size differs among locations. The hygroscopicity parameter κ decreased with an increasing size at a continental site in south-west Germany and fluctuated without any particular size dependence across the observed size range in the remote tropical North Atlantic and rural central Hungary. At all other locations κ increased with size. In fact, in Hyytiälä, Vavihill, Jungfraujoch and Pallas the difference in hygroscopicity between Aitken and accumulation mode aerosol was statistically significant at the 5 % significance level. In a boreal environment the assumption of a size-independent κ can lead to a potentially substantial overestimation of NCCN at S levels above 0.6 %. The same is true for other locations where κ was found to increase with size. While detailed information about aerosol hygroscopicity can significantly improve the prediction of NCCN, total aerosol number concentration and aerosol size distribution remain more important parameters. The seasonal and diurnal patterns of CCN activation and hygroscopic properties vary among three long-term locations, highlighting the spatial and temporal variability of potential aerosol–cloud interactions in various environments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000106275",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-12211-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/106275","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"A synthesis of cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNC) measurements within the EUCAARI network","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T20:33:57Z",,"pub:166382",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653a3b8c1f81962","004294181","84946238238",,"000365329000006","Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Research at the Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets (CLOUD) facility at CERN tries to elucidate which vapors are responsible for this new-particle formation, and how in detail it proceeds. Initial measurement campaigns at the CLOUD stainless-steel aerosol chamber focused on investigating particle formation from ammonia (NH3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Experiments were conducted in the presence of water, ozone and sulfur dioxide. Contaminant trace gases were suppressed at the technological limit. For this study, we mapped out the compositions of small NH3–H2SO4 clusters over a wide range of atmospherically relevant environmental conditions. We covered [NH3] in the range from < 2 to 1400 pptv, [H2SO4] from 3.3 × 106 to 1.4 × 109 cm−3 (0.1 to 56 pptv), and a temperature range from −25 to +20 °C. Negatively and positively charged clusters were directly measured by an atmospheric pressure interface time-of-flight (APi-TOF) mass spectrometer, as they initially formed from gas-phase NH3 and H2SO4, and then grew to larger clusters containing more than 50 molecules of NH3 and H2SO4, corresponding to mobility-equivalent diameters greater than 2 nm. Water molecules evaporate from these clusters during sampling and are not observed. We found that the composition of the NH3–H2SO4 clusters is primarily determined by the ratio of gas-phase concentrations [NH3] / [H2SO4], as well as by temperature. Pure binary H2O–H2SO4 clusters (observed as clusters of only H2SO4) only form at [NH3] / [H2SO4] < 0.1 to 1. For larger values of [NH3] / [H2SO4], the composition of NH3–H2SO4 clusters was characterized by the number of NH3 molecules m added for each added H2SO4 molecule n (Δm/Δ n), where n is in the range 4–18 (negatively charged clusters) or 1–17 (positively charged clusters). For negatively charged clusters, Δ m/Δn saturated between 1 and 1.4 for [NH3] / [H2SO4] > 10. Positively charged clusters grew on average by Δm/Δn = 1.05 and were only observed at sufficiently high [NH3] / [H2SO4]. The H2SO4 molecules of these clusters are partially neutralized by NH3, in close resemblance to the acid–base bindings of ammonium bisulfate. Supported by model simulations, we substantiate previous evidence for acid–base reactions being the essential mechanism behind the formation of these clusters under atmospheric conditions and up to sizes of at least 2 nm. Our results also suggest that electrically neutral NH3–H2SO4 clusters, unobservable in this study, have generally the same composition as ionic clusters for [NH3] / [H2SO4] > 10. We expect that NH3–H2SO4 clusters form and grow also mostly by Δm/Δn > 1 in the atmosphere's boundary layer, as [NH3] / [H2SO4] is mostly larger than 10. We compared our results from CLOUD with APi-TOF measurements of NH3–H2SO4 anion clusters during new-particle formation in the Finnish boreal forest. However, the exact role of NH3–H2SO4 clusters in boundary layer particle formation remains to be resolved.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000098510",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-55-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/98510","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"On the composition of ammonia-sulfuric-acid ion clusters during aerosol particle formation","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T16:20:03Z",,"pub:154120",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593652f681a9d61032","004294181","84920713435",,"000347958200005","Atmos. chem. phys.","1","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We focused on a time interval when both further chlorine activation and ozone loss, but also chlorine deactivation, occur.  We performed a comprehensive Lagrangian analysis to simulate the evolution of an air mass along a 10-day trajectory, coupling a detailed microphysical box model to a chemistry model. Model results have been compared with in situ and remote sensing measurements of particles and ozone at the start and end points of the trajectory, and satellite measurements of key chemical species and clouds along it.  Different model runs have been performed to understand the relative role of solid and liquid polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles for the heterogeneous chemistry, and for the denitrification caused by particle sedimentation. According to model results, under the conditions investigated, ozone depletion is not affected significantly by the presence of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) particles, as the observed depletion rate can equally well be reproduced by heterogeneous chemistry on cold liquid aerosol, with a surface area density close to background values.  Under the conditions investigated, the impact of denitrification is important for the abundances of chlorine reservoirs after PSC evaporation, thus stressing the need to use appropriate microphysical models in the simulation of chlorine deactivation. We found that the effect of particle sedimentation and denitrification on the amount of ozone depletion is rather small in the case investigated. In the first part of the analyzed period, when a PSC was present in the air mass, sedimentation led to a smaller available particle surface area and less chlorine activation, and thus less ozone depletion. After the PSC evaporation, in the last 3 days of the simulation, denitrification increases ozone loss by hampering chlorine deactivation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000102826",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-6651-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/102826","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Lagrangian analysis of microphysical and chemical processes in the Antarctic stratosphere: a case study","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T18:33:11Z",,"pub:160984",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp593653598ba6974600","004294181",,,"000357117500007","Atmos. chem. phys.","12","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The effects of aerosol scavenging, cloud microphysical processing and regeneration upon cloud evaporation on the aerosol population and on subsequent cloud formation are investigated. For this, two-dimensional idealized simulations of moist flow over two bell-shaped mountains were carried out varying the treatment of aerosol scavenging and regeneration processes for a warm-phase and a mixed-phase orographic cloud.  The results allowed us to identify different aerosol cycling mechanisms. In the simulated non-precipitating warm-phase cloud, aerosol mass is incorporated into cloud droplets by activation scavenging and released back to the atmosphere upon cloud droplet evaporation. In the mixed-phase cloud, a first cycle comprises cloud droplet activation and evaporation via the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen (WBF) process. A second cycle includes below-cloud scavenging by precipitating snow particles and snow sublimation and is connected to the first cycle via the riming process which transfers aerosol mass from cloud droplets to snowflakes. In the simulated mixed-phase cloud, only a negligible part of the total aerosol mass is incorporated into ice crystals. Sedimenting snowflakes reaching the surface remove aerosol mass from the atmosphere. The results show that aerosol processing and regeneration lead to a vertical redistribution of aerosol mass and number. Thereby, the processes impact the total aerosol number and mass and additionally alter the shape of the aerosol size distributions by enhancing the internally mixed/soluble Aitken and accumulation mode and generating coarse-mode particles. Concerning subsequent cloud formation at the second mountain, accounting for aerosol processing and regeneration increases the cloud droplet number concentration with possible implications for the ice crystal number concentration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000103921",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-9217-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/103921","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Microphysical processing of aerosol particles in orographic clouds","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T19:12:07Z",,"pub:162465",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp59365372cbd0c72044","004294181","84939863197",,"000360646500009","Atmos. chem. phys.","16","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this respect, weather generators (WGs) designed and calibrated for multiple sites are an appealing statistical downscaling technique to stochastically simulate multiple realisations of possible future time series consistent with the local precipitation characteristics and their expected future changes. In this study, we present the implementation and validation of a multi-site daily precipitation generator re-built after the methodology described in Wilks (1998). The generator consists of several Richardson-type WGs run with spatially correlated random number streams. This study aims at investigating the capabilities, the added value and the limitations of the precipitation generator for a typical Alpine river catchment in the Swiss Alpine region under current climate.  The calibrated multi-site WG is skilful at individual sites in representing the annual cycle of the precipitation statistics, such as mean wet day frequency and intensity as well as monthly precipitation sums. It reproduces realistically the multi-day statistics such as the frequencies of dry and wet spell lengths and precipitation sums over consecutive wet days. Substantial added value is demonstrated in simulating daily areal precipitation sums in comparison to multiple WGs that lack the spatial dependency in the stochastic process. Limitations are seen in reproducing daily and multi-day extreme precipitation sums, observed variability from year to year and in reproducing long dry spell lengths. Given the performance of the presented generator, we conclude that it is a useful tool to generate precipitation series consistent with the mean climatic aspects and likely helpful to be used as a downscaling technique for climate change scenarios.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000100854",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-19-2163-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/100854","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Implementation and validation of a Wilks-type multi-site daily precipitation generator over a typical Alpine river catchment","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T17:25:13Z",,"pub:158363",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936532c0460d68609","001881462","84928911469",,"000355319500004","Hydrol.

The main source of these uncertainties is dynamical processes such as turbulence and entrainment but also key aerosol parameters such as aerosol number concentration and size distribution, and to a much lesser extent, the composition. From June to August 2011 a Cloud and Aerosol Characterization Experiment (CLACE2011) was performed at the high-alpine research station Jungfraujoch (Switzerland, 3580 m a.s.l.) focusing on the activation of aerosol to form liquid-phase clouds (in the cloud base temperature range of −8 to 5 °C). With a box model the sensitivity of the effective peak supersaturation (SSpeak), an important parameter for cloud activation, to key aerosol and dynamical parameters was investigated. The updraft velocity, which defines the cooling rate of an air parcel, was found to have the greatest influence on SSpeak. Small-scale variations in the cooling rate with large amplitudes can significantly alter CCN activation. Thus, an accurate knowledge of the air parcel history is required to estimate SSpeak. The results show that the cloud base updraft velocities estimated from the horizontal wind measurements made at the Jungfraujoch can be divided by a factor of approximately 4 to get the updraft velocity required for the model to reproduce the observed SSpeak. The aerosol number concentration and hygroscopic properties were found to be less important than the aerosol size in determining SSpeak. Furthermore turbulence is found to have a maximum influence when SSpeak is between approximately 0.2 and 0.4 %. Simulating the small-scale fluctuations with several amplitudes, frequencies and phases, revealed that independently of the amplitude, the effect of the frequency on SSpeak shows a maximum at 0.46 Hz (median over all phases) and at higher frequencies, the maximum SSpeak decreases again.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000104646",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-10309-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/104646","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Sensitivity estimations for cloud droplet formation in the vicinity of the high-alpine research station Jungfraujoch (3580 m a.s.l.)","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T19:31:43Z",,"pub:163785",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936538215cec12645","004294181","84941923101",,"000362457400006","Atmos. chem. phys.","18","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Regional modelling can be of particular use for this task, as this approach provides sufficient resolution to resolve the structure of the produced track including their meteorological environment whilst relying on the same formulations of parameterisations as many general circulation models. In this work we simulate a particular case of ship tracks embedded in an optically thin stratus cloud sheet which was observed by a polar orbiting satellite at 12:00 UTC on 26 January 2003 around the Bay of Biscay.  The simulations, which include moving ship emissions, show that the model is indeed able to capture the structure of the track at a horizontal grid spacing of 2 km and to qualitatively capture the observed cloud response in all simulations performed. At least a doubling of the cloud optical thickness was simulated in all simulations together with an increase in cloud droplet number concentration by about 40 cm−3 (300%) and decrease in effective radius by about 5 μm (40%). Furthermore, the ship emissions lead to an increase in liquid water path in at least 25% of the track regions.  We are confident in the model's ability to capture key processes of ship track formation. However, it was found that realistic ship emissions lead to unrealistic aerosol perturbations near the source regions within the simulated tracks due to grid-scale dilution and homogeneity.  Combining the regional-modelling approach with comprehensive field studies could likely improve our understanding of the sensitivities and biases in ACI parameterisations, and could therefore help to constrain global ACI estimates, which strongly rely on these parameterisations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000099515",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-15-2185-2015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/99515","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Real-case simulations of aerosol-cloud interactions in ship tracks over the Bay of Biscay","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2017-06-11T16:46:17Z",,"pub:155661",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"imp5936530c72ff941064","004294181","84924044829",,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","4","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
