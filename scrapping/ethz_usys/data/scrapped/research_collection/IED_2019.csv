To robustly quantify uncertainty in multi-model ensembles, inter-dependencies between models as well as a models ability to reproduce observations should be considered. Here, a model weighting approach, which accounts for both independence and performance, is applied to European temperature and precipitation projections from the CMIP5 archive. Two future periods representing mid- and end-of-century conditions driven by the high-emission scenario RCP8.5 are investigated. To inform the weighting, six diagnostics based on three observational estimates are used to also account for uncertainty in the observational record. Our findings show that weighting the ensemble can reduce the interquartile spread by more than 20% in some regions, increasing the reliability of projected changes. The mean temperature change is most notably impacted by the weighting in the Mediterranean, where it is found to be 0.35 °C higher than the unweighted mean in the end-of-century period. For precipitation the largest differences are found for Northern Europe, with a relative decrease in precipitation of 2.4% and 3.4% for the two future periods compared to the unweighted case. Based on a perfect model test, it is found that weighting the ensemble leads to an increase in the investigated skill score for temperature and precipitation while minimizing the probability of overfitting.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000384838",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab492f","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/384838","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Model weighting||Climate models||CMIP5||Europe||EUCP||Temperature||Precipitation","Quantifying uncertainty in European climate projections using combined performance-independence weighting",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-12-11T14:41:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"European Climate Prediction System||Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach","776613||641816","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100007352","EC||SBFI","H2020||H2020",,,"85081654925",,"000499948800001","Environ.

Without rapid action climate risks will threaten development gains already achieved and affect future economic growth potential.  Climate risk modelling and analysis can provide decision-makers with the information they need to turn policies into action. These tools are already available today and can be implemented globally enabling decision makers to answer the most pressing questions they are facing today.  Results of a San Salvador case study illustrate climate risk analysis as essential instrument of comprehensive climate risk management:      25% of potential damages from flooding could be prevented by implementing the two most cost-effective physical adaptation measures.     Climate risk insurance sends a strong price signal. Risk reduction by implementing the identified adaptation measures can lower the insurance premium by 35%, thus giving a strong incentive to turn adaptation policies into action.     Additionally climate risk insurance represents an effective measure to cap future losses and provide much needed funds for post-disaster relief.  The case study reveals the complementarity of risk prevention and risk reduction. Physical adaptation investments are key to adapt to climate change. However, not all risks can be avoided. Additional financial adaptation measures such as climate risk insurance offer an effective instrument for climate risk management.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/381984","en","Oasis Loss Modelling Framework Ltd",,,,"Understanding Climate Risks",,"Other Publication","Metadata only",,,"2019-12-02T12:54:32Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://oasislmf.org/news/understanding-climate-risks-what-does-it-mean-san-salvador",,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While richer nations are often home to a variety of climate models, data infrastructures and climate experts, poorer sovereigns often lack these attributes. However, less is known about countries’ capacity to use global climate science and customise it into products informing national adaptation. We use a unique global dataset, the UNFCCC National Communications, to perform a global documentary analysis of scientific submissions from individual countries (n = 189). Comparing countries’ climate projections with their competence in publishing climate science, our research examines the existence of geographical divides. Although countries proficient in publishing climate science use more complex climate modelling techniques, key characteristics of climate projections are highly similar around the globe, including multi-model ensembles of Global Circulation Models (GCMs). This surprising result is made possible because of the use of pre-configured climate modelling software packages. One concern is that these tools restrict customisation, such as country-specific observations, modelling information, and visualisation. Such tools may therefore hide a new geographical divide where countries with higher scientific capacities are able to inform what goes into these software packages, whereas lower scientific capacity countries are dependent upon these choices – whether beneficial for them or not.

The first three of these workshops – held in Dublin in December 2019, Edinburgh in January 2020 and Turin in February 2020 – took place as planned. The remaining three – intended to take place in Bilbao in March, in Warsaw in April and in Zurich in May 2020 – were postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to the ongoing and uncertain situation with COVID-19, the SHAPE-ID consortium considered the organisation of in-person meetings no longer feasible and decided to reorganise the workshops in a remote setting. This choice, besides ensuring the protection of all participants’ health while reducing further delays to the project, has presented the opportunity to experiment with interdisciplinary/ transdisciplinary learning activities in a virtual environment. Indeed, despite the adversity, there is an opportunity to be seized in organising online events. Exploring the potential of online techniques for working and developing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaborations is a necessary step considering that personal mobility and gatherings will not resume at previous levels of frequency and intensity soon. In particular, the role of the Arts and Humanities in this scenario is essential because the technology-driven process of moving meetings online will challenge most of the tacit and emotional aspects of human interaction, such as informal and private communication, the emotional effects of collaboration, and all those non-visible elements of social exchange that need to be considered and influence the outcome of collaborative research. We therefore had the opportunity to learn how to design, prepare and conduct online workshops – taking advantage of the necessary delay to research suitable methodologies and redesign already well-planned in-person workshops – and evaluate their efficacy compared to the traditional face-to-face workshops. This document reports on the workshops, organising the findings into a coherent framework in order to feed into a second report, <em>D3.3 – Recommendations and measures to maximise IDR impact on society. </em>The current report is structured as follows: <strong>Section 1: </strong>Integration of challenge-oriented learning journeys <strong>Section 2:</strong> Overview of the six workshops’ outcomes (Dublin, Edinburgh, Turin, Zurich, Warsaw, Bilbao) <strong>Section 3:</strong> Detailed reports for each of the six workshops <strong>Section 4:</strong> Conclusions on IDR learning cases tackling societal challenges and missions In addition, Appendix 1 includes the full set of six workshops evaluation reports and Appendix 2 the full list of participants at all learning workshops.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516061",,,,"10.5281/ZENODO.4439665","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516061","en","Cern","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","interdisciplinary research||Transdisciplinary Research||science policy||learning case workshops","Deliverable 3.1: Matrix for integration of learning cases and framework of analysis",,"Report","Open access",,,"2021-11-19T10:30:26Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Shaping Interdisciplinary Practices in Europe","822705","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,,,,"D 3.1","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, daily precipitation persistence is assessed in an exhaustive ensemble of observation-based daily precipitation datasets and evaluated in global climate model (GCM) simulations for the period of 2001–2013. Daily precipitation time series are first transformed intocategorical time series of dry and wet spells with a 1 mm d−1precipitation threshold. Subsequently, Pdd(Pww),defined as the probability of a dry(wet)day to be followed by another dry(wet)day is calculated to represent daily precipitation persistence. The analysis focuses on the long-term meanand interannual variability(IAV)of the two indices. Both multi-observation and multi-model meansshow higher values of Pdd thanPww. GCMs overestimate Pww with a relatively homogeneous spatialbias pattern. They overestimate Pdd in the Amazon and Central Africa but underestimate Pdd in several regions such as southern Argentina, western North America and the Tibetan Plateau. The IAV of both Pdd and Pww is generally underestimated in climate models, but more strongly for Pww. Overall, our results highlight systematic model errors in daily precipitation persistence that are substantially larger than the already considerable spread across observational products. These findings also provide insights on how precipitation persistence biases on a daily time scale relate to well-documented persistence biases at longer time scales in state-of-the-art GCMs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000384829",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab4169","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/384829","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Daily precipitation||Precipitation persistence||Climate models||CMIP5","Intercomparison of daily precipitation persistence in multiple global observations and climate models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-12-11T14:33:28Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate","617518","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,"85084172329",,"000500812000001","Environ.

Besides having severe impacts on yields, ecosystems, and infrastructures, heat is a serious health problem. High temperatures exacerbate mortality, morbidity, and severely affect the pro ductivity of workers. So far, however, the problematic of occupational health has received relatively little attention. By integrating the three risk components, namely hazard, vulner ability, and exposure, I quantify the economic impact of heat on labour productivity for the Canton of Zurich. The expected annual impact for the present situation amounts to CHF 100 million, with workers performing heavy physically intensive tasks being the category most affected. For comparison, the annual costs of flu due to lost working hours amount to about CHF 40 million for the Canton of Zurich. In 2035, the extent of the impact is expected to double or, in a worst case, even reach the order of magnitude of indirect costs caused by depression (i.e. CHF 1 billion), urging the implementation of targeted adaptation measures in addition to mitigation efforts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000535995",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/535995","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"The impact of heat on labour productivity in Zurich",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,"2022-03-08T08:42:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

An explication of objectual understanding is defended, which helps to make sense of the cognitive achievements and goals of science. The explication combines a necessary condition with three evaluative dimensions: an epistemic agent understands a subject matter by means of a theory only if the agent commits herself sufficiently to the theory of the subject matter, and to the degree that the agent grasps the theory (i.e., is able to make use of it), the theory answers to the facts and the agent’s commitment to the theory is justified. The threshold for outright attributions of understanding is determined contextually. The explication has descriptive as well as normative facets and allows for the possibility of understanding by means of non-explanatory (e.g., purely classificatory) theories.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000374954",,"0925-4560||1572-8587",,"10.1007/s10838-019-09474-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/374954","en","Springer Netherlands","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","understanding||Explanation||explication||prediction||Grasping||Justification||commitment","Explicating Objectual Understanding: Taking Degrees Seriously",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-11-02T17:39:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85074213307",,,"J Gen Philos Sci","3","Journal for General Philosophy of Science","50","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Witnessing a growing call for inter- and transdisciplinarity (ITD), we set our goal to learn more about scholars who engage in this kind of research by asking these questions: What characterizes inter- and transdisciplinary researchers (ITDRs)? To what extent do these characteristics help ITDRs deal with the challenges of an academic career path? We address both questions by comparing the findings from the relevant literature and semi-structured interviews with ITDRs at different stages in their careers. Our results bring the ITDR personality a step further in taking a form. ITDR personalities can be characterized by a particular mix of motivations, attitudes, skills, and behaviors. However, the academic environment and its career paths do not seem prepared and adapted for such ITDR personalities. Furthermore and in contrast to the literature, the T-shaped training (first, disciplinary depth and then, ITDR) is considered one possible career path, with the other one being a specialization in facilitating knowledge integration and in developing theories, methods, and tools for ITD. Our analysis concludes by exploring the future of ITD if formal training and learning would be available and if the contextual conditions would be more conducive to undertaking this type of research.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000356422",,"0016-3287",,"10.1016/j.futures.2019.102441","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/356422","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Interdisciplinarity||Transdisciplinary individuals||Academic career trajectory||Academic system||INTREPID cost action","Who is doing inter- and transdisciplinary research, and why?

However, there has been very little critical appraisal of the contribution made by different transparency initiatives to sustainability and the ways in which they can (and cannot) influence new governance arrangements. Here we seek to strengthen the theoretical underpinning of research and action on supply chain transparency by addressing four questions: (1) What is meant by supply chain transparency? (2) What is the relevance of supply chain transparency to supply chain sustainability governance? (3) What is the current status of supply chain transparency, and what are the strengths and weaknesses of existing initiatives? and (4) What propositions can be advanced for how transparency can have a positive transformative effect on the governance interventions that seek to strengthen sustainability outcomes? We use examples from agricultural supply chains and the zero-deforestation agenda as a focus of our analysis but draw insights that are relevant to the transparency and sustainability of supply chains in general. We propose a typology to distinguish among types of supply chain information that are needed to support improvements in sustainability governance, and illustrate a number of major shortfalls and systematic biases in existing information systems. We also propose a set of ten propositions that, taken together, serve to expose some of the potential pitfalls and undesirable outcomes that may result from (inevitably) limited or poorly designed transparency systems, whilst offering guidance on some of the ways in which greater transparency can make a more effective, lasting and positive contribution to sustainability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000359705",,"0305-750X",,"10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.025","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/359705","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Information||Disclosure||Trade||Deforestation||Agriculture||Forests||Commitments||Soy||Beef||Palm oil","Transparency and sustainability in global commodity supply chains",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-08-21T13:47:21Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"World Development","121","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Thus, governments and private companies have strong interests in improving the understanding of impacts from tropical cyclones in order to better prepare societies for possible disastrous impacts. This led to the development of natural catastrophe models that allow the quantification of expected damages. These models witnessed a streak of constant improvement over the past 60 years by keeping track with the newest statistical and simulation techniques. Due to the complexity of the problem and increasing volumes of available climate, exposure and damage data, machine learning methods might be a promising complement in such assessments. In this Master Thesis, we applied machine learning algorithms to calibrate the tropical cyclone damage module of the open-source disaster impact model CLIMADA. In a first step we defined regions based on socio-economic indicators using feature selection, dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms. In a second step, Bayesian optimization methods were applied to calibrate region specific damage functions. The efficiency of the Bayesian algorithm allowed the introduction of computationally more expensive damage functions as well as the concept of cross validation for a partial quantification of epistemic model uncertainty. Using this calibration, CLIMADA estimates damages for more than half of the storms in the correct order of magnitude. This is an improvement of more than 10% as compared to traditional approaches. However, using region specific damage functions does not substantially improve this result. Estimating impacts of tropical cyclones remains highly uncertain, especially for damages caused by high wind speeds.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000398592",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/398592","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Tropical cyclones||Impact modelling||Calibration||CLIMADA","Applying Machine Learning Methods to the Assessment of Tropical Cyclone Impacts",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2020-02-11T20:11:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, higher grid spacing is also a promising feature to improve the simulation of snow cover. In particular, it provides a refined representation of topography and allows for an explicit simulation of convective precipitation processes. In this study we analyze the snow cover in a set of decade-long high-resolution climate simulation with horizontal grid spacing of 2.2 km over the greater Alpine region. Results are compared against observations and lower resolution models (12 and 50 km), which use parameterized convection. The simulations are integrated using the COSMO (Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling) model. The evaluation of snow water equivalent (SWE) in the simulation of present-day climate, driven by the ERA-Interim reanalysis, against an observational dataset, reveals that the high-resolution simulation clearly outperforms simulations with grid spacing of 12 and 50 km. The latter simulations underestimate the cumulative amount of SWE over Switzerland over the whole annual cycle by 33% (12 km simulation) and 56% (50 km simulation) while the high-resolution simulation shows a spatially and temporally averaged difference of less than 1%. Scenario simulations driven by GCM MPI-ESM-LR (2081–2090 RCP8.5 vs. 1991–2000) reveal a strong decrease of SWE over the Alps, consistent with previous studies. Previous studies had found that the relative decrease becomes gradually smaller with elevation, but this finding was limited to low and intermediate altitudes (as a 12 km simulation resolves the topography up to 2500 m). In the current study we find that the height gradient reverses sign, and relative reductions in snow cover increases above 3000 m asl, where important parts of the cryosphere are present. In addition, the simulations project a transition from permanent to seasonal snow cover at high altitudes, with potentially important impacts to Alpine permafrost. This transition and the more pronounced decline of SWE emphasize the value of the higher grid spacing. Overall, we show that high-resolution climate models offer a promising approach in improving the simulation of snow cover in Alpine terrain.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000360323",,"2073-4433",,"10.3390/atmos10080463","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/360323","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","snow water equivalent||snow cover||convection-resolving||climate projections","Projections of Alpine snow-cover in a high-resolution climate simulation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-08-24T03:23:21Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Towards kilometer-scale climate change scenarios","132614","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,"85070769324",,"000482983500005",,"8","Atmosphere","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite numerous (national) climate scenarios being published by countries across the globe, studies of their actual uptake and application remain low. Analysing a survey and group interviews on the ways the Swiss climate scenarios CH2011 have been actually used by the Swiss adaptation community, we encoded the emerging differences in a new typology of observers, sailors, and divers. Taking an iceberg as a metaphor for climate scenarios, most respondents were sailors, accessing only key findings above the waterline (i.e., summary brochures). However, the vast majority of climate scenario data remains below the surface (i.e., downscaled climate model data), accessible only to the quarter of respondents labelled divers. Lastly, another quarter are observers, interested in the iceberg from afar, but without applying the climate information directly to their work. By describing three ways of using climate scenarios, we aim to clarify the often vague notion of ‘user’ circulating prominently in discussions around climate services and knowledge co-production. In addition, our results question the adequacy of simplifying climate scenario use by a user’s easily observable characteristics – such as being a researcher or practitioner, by sector or by numeracy. Our typology thus highlights the diversity of use(r)s within sectors or academia, but is also able to characterise various similarities of use(r)s between sectors, researchers and practitioners. Our findings assist in more nuanced and informed discussions of how ‘users’ are imagined and characterised in future developments of usable climate services.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000357924",,"2405-8807",,"10.1016/j.cliser.2019.100113","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/357924","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate scenarios||climate projections||use of climate science||user characterisation||tailoring of climate information","Who is ‘the user’ of climate services?

Yet, existing long-term planning tools do not provide the scope or level of integration across the nexus to unravel important development constraints. Moreover, existing tools and data are not always made openly available or are implemented across disparate modeling platforms that can be difficult to link directly with modern scientific computing tools and databases. In this paper, we present the Nexus Solutions Tool (NEST): a new open modeling platform that integrates multi-scale energy-water-land resource optimization with distributed hydrological modeling. The new approach provides insights into the vulnerability of water, energy and land resources to future socioeconomic and climatic change and how multi-sectoral policies, technological solutions and investments can improve the resilience and sustainability of transformation pathways while avoiding counterproductive interactions among sectors. NEST can be applied at different spatial and temporal resolutions, and is designed specifically to tap into the growing body of open access geospatial data available through national inventories and the earth system modeling community. A case study analysis of the Indus River Basin in South Asia demonstrates the capability of the model to capture important interlinkages across system transformation pathways towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, including the intersections between local and regional transboundary policies and incremental investment costs from rapidly increasing regional consumption projected over the coming decades.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000383006",,"1991-962X||1991-9611",,"10.5194/gmd-2019-134","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/383006","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The Nexus Solutions Tool (NEST): An open platform for optimizing multi-scale energy-water-land system transformations",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2019-12-05T13:19:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Geosci. model dev. discuss.",,"Geoscientific Model Development Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the absence of hierarchical chains of command, multistakeholder governance may accommodate conflicting or diverse interests and facilitate collective action, but its effectiveness depends on its capacity to integrate systems, transformation, and target knowledge. Approaches to foster such governance are nascent and quickly evolving, and methodological standards to facilitate comparison and learning from best practice are needed. However, there is currently no evaluation approach that (i) comprehensively assesses the capacity for knowledge integration in multistakeholder governance, (ii) draws on the best available knowledge that is being developed in various fields, and (iii) combines a systematic and transferable methodological design with pragmatic feasibility.  We brought together 20 experts from institutions in nine countries, all working on evaluation approaches for collaborative science–policy initiatives. In a synthesis process that included a 2-day workshop and follow-up work among a core group of participants, we developed a tool for evaluating knowledge integration capacity in multistakeholder governance (EVOLvINC). Its 23 indicators incorporate previously defined criteria and components of transdisciplinary evaluations into a single, comprehensive framework that operationalizes the capacity for integrating systems, target, and transformation knowledge during an initiative’s (a) design and planning processes at the policy formulation stage, (b) organization and working processes at the implementation stage, and (c) sharing and learning processes at the evaluation stage of the policy cycle. EVOLvINC is (i) implemented through a questionnaire, (ii) builds on established indicators where possible, (iii) offers a consistent and transparent semiquantitative scoring and aggregation algorithm, and (iv) uses spider diagrams for visualizing results. The tool builds on experience and expertise from both the northern and southern hemispheres and was empirically validated with seven science–policy initiatives in six African and Asian countries.  As a generalized framework, EVOLvINC thus enables a structured reflection on the capacity of multistakeholder governance processes to foster knowledge integration. Its emphasis on dialog and exploration allows adaptation to contextual specificities, highlights relative strengths and weaknesses, and suggests avenues for shaping multistakeholder governance toward mutual learning, capacity building, and strengthened networks. The validation suggests that the adaptive capacity of multistakeholder governance could be best enhanced by considering systems characteristics at the policy formulation stage and fostering adaptive and generic learning at the evaluation stage of the policy cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000358035",,"1708-3087",,"10.5751/ES-10935-240236","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/358035","en","Resilience Alliance Publications","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Knowledge integration||Process evaluation||multistakeholder governance||Policy cycle||transdisciplinarity","EVOlvINC: Evaluating knowledge integration capacity in multistakeholder governance",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-08-13T02:35:51Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85070239655",,"000482712400028",,"2","Ecology and Society","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Sustainability standards—such as Fairtrade—could potentially improve the situation. Although many studies have analysed the impact of Fairtrade on smallholder farmers, few focus on wage workers beyond those employed by large companies despite most workers being employed by small farms and cooperatives. We analyse the effect of Fairtrade on workers’ wages and working conditions in the small farm sector. We conducted a survey among workers in the cocoa sector in Cote d’Ivoire and their employers, distinguishing between farm workers and cooperative workers. Fairtrade improves wages and reduces poverty among cooperative workers, but not among farm workers, even though the latter are particularly deprived. At the cooperative level, labour standards are regularly monitored by Fairtrade. Certification also helps cooperatives increase the services offered to their members, which leads to more and better-paid employment at the cooperative level. At the farm level, inspections of labour standards are more costly, difficult and rare. Thus, Fairtrade hardly affects traditional employment modalities at the farm level even when farmers themselves benefit from certification. Ensuring that labour standards are met at all levels may require innovative and more efficient monitoring approaches.",,,,"2398-9629",,"10.1038/s41893-019-0311-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539549","en","Springer",,,,"Effects of Fairtrade on the livelihoods of poor rural workers",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-03-28T07:41:57Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nat Sustain","7","Nature Sustainability","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the model, the data dimensionality reduction method and the Grey model (GM(1,1)) were combined and adopted to disaggregate the national economic growth rate into regional levels and forecast each region’s contribution rate to the national economic growth and regional industrial structure. Then, a bottom–up accounting model that considered the impacts of regional industrial structure transformation, regional energy efficiency, and regional household electric consumption was built to predict national and regional electric demand. Based on the predicted values, this paper analyzed the spatial changes in electric demand, and our results indicate the following. Firstly, the proposed model has high accuracy in national electricity demand prediction: the relative error in 2017 and 2018 was 2.90% and 2.60%, respectively. Secondly, China’s electric demand will not peak before 2025, and it is estimated to be between 7772.16 and 8458.85 billion kW·h in 2025, which is an increase of 31.28–42.88% compared with the total electricity consumption in 2016. The proportion of electricity demand in the mid-west regions will increase, while the eastern region will continue to be the country’s load center. Thirdly, under China’s new normal, households and the tertiary industry will be the main driving forces behind the increases in electric demand. Lastly, the drop in China’s economy under the new normal will lead to a decline in the total electricity demand, but it will not evidently change the electricity consumption share of the primary industry, secondary industry, tertiary industry, and household sector.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000348879",,"1996-1073",,"10.3390/en12112220","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/348879","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","China’s new normal||Electricity demand||industrial structure transformation||spatial distribution||data dimensionality reduction","Study on A Simple Model to Forecast the Electricity Demand under China’s New Normal Situation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-06-21T05:23:22Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85067241830",,"000472635900187",,"11","Energies","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Soils across Africa are typically nutrient deficient, a condition exacerbated by long-term nutrient mining. Nitrified urine fertilizer is a nutrient-rich and hygienically safe solution derived from human urine. It has the potential to provide a sustainable source of soil nutrients to low and middle-income countries struggling with food insecurity challenges. This study presents findings of a survey that assessed public acceptance within Msunduzi, Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa towards the use of nitrified urine fertilizer. Results indicate that in general attitudes were much more positive towards the use of nitrified urine fertilizer than raw urine as a soil amendment. Residents living within rural zones of the municipality (78.5%), as opposed to urban (65.7%) and peri-urban (65.2%), and younger individuals within the sampled population were found to be the most receptive to the use of nitrified urine fertilizer. Our findings also underscore the complex set of factors that shape attitudes towards a topic such as the use of human waste as a fertilizer, which are crucial in shaping the legitimacy of an emerging technology such as urine nitrification.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000347664",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su11092456","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/347664","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","sustainability||nitrified urine||consumer acceptance||fertilizer||Msunduzi||South Africa","Nitrified human urine as a sustainable and socially acceptable fertilizer: An analysis of consumer acceptance in Msunduzi, South Africa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-06-17T04:39:03Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85066932863",,"000469518700004",,"9","Sustainability","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Precipitation patterns are known to be changing across the GHA, but trajectories in land surface variables are much less well known. We simulated the GHA land surface environment to assess the balance between natural cycles and human‐induced climate change. Using a new form of event attribution study where we focused on both climate variables and also directly simulated land surface variables, we combined publicly volunteered distributed computing with land surface simulations to quantify land surface responses. Uncertainty was quantified both for climate model and land surface model outputs. We identified two distinct “drought trajectories” in the GHA bimodal seasonality area during the March–May (Long Rains season) of 2014. Human‐induced climate change may have resulted in regions from Lake Nalubaale (Lake Victoria) to Northern Kenya receiving less precipitation in this season and having up to 20% higher probability of drought‐level evapotranspiration rates (increasing drought). In contrast, the simulated anthropogenic climate change signal for this season induced somewhat wetter conditions and up to 20% lower probability of drought‐level evapotranspiration in Eastern Ethiopia, Southern Somalia, and coastal Kenya (decreasing drought). Uncertainties in our modeling system varied by region and variable of focus, but broadly we found that land surface simulation uncertainty neither added significantly to climate model uncertainty nor significantly reduced it.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000340757",,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2018jd030085","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/340757","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/","Climate change||Extreme events||Attribution||Land surface science||Evaporation","The impact of human‐induced climate change on regional drought in the Horn of Africa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-05-06T09:44:52Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85065158751",,"000469071400017","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","8","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","124","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Innovations generally emerge from collective intelligence and action, but innovation systems are often poorly understood. This study explores the properties of innovation systems and their contribution to increased eco-efficiency in agriculture. Using aggregate data and econometric methods, the eco-efficiency of 79 countries was computed and a range of factors relating to research, extension, business and policy was examined. Despite data limitations, the analysis produced some interesting insights. For instance public research spending has a positive significant effect for emerging economies, while no statistically significant effect was found for foreign aid for research. However, foreign aid for extension is important in less developed economies. These and other results suggest the importance of context-specific interventions rather than a “one size fits all” approach. Overall, the analysis illustrated the potential of a macro-level diagnostic approach for assessing the role of innovation systems for sustainability in agriculture.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000338786",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0214115","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338786","en","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Eco-efficiency and agricultural innovation systems in developing countries: Evidence from macro-level analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-04-19T01:42:32Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85064078522",,,"PLoS ONE","4","PLoS ONE","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A set of three metrics are used to assess the sensitivity of afternoon rainfall occurrence to morning soil moisture in terms of their spatial, temporal, and heterogeneity characteristics. Positive (negative) spatial feedback indicates that the afternoon rainfall occurs more frequently over wetter (drier) land surface than its surroundings. Positive (negative) temporal feedback indicates preference over temporally wetter (drier) conditions, and positive (negative) heterogeneity feedback indicates preference over more spatially heterogeneous (homogeneous) soil moisture conditions. We confirm previous results highlighting a dominantly positive spatial feedback in the models as opposed to observations. On average, models tend to agree better with observations for temporal and heterogeneity feedback characteristics, although intermodel variability is largest for these metrics. The collective influence of the three feedbacks suggests that they may lead to more localized precipitation persistence in models than in observations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000328689",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2018GL080879","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/328689","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","soil moisture‐precipitation feedback||global climate models||subdaily precipitation","Soil Moisture Effects on Afternoon Precipitation Occurrence in Current Climate Models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-03-03T03:31:24Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85061568427",,"000462072800081","Geophys.

However, the national and sectoral differences in freight transport operations affect the viability of electric trucks. The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology for estimating the potential of electric trucks and demonstrate the results in Switzerland and Finland. Commodity-level analysis of the continuous road freight survey data were carried out in both countries. As much as 71% of Swiss road freight transport tonne-kilometers may be electrified using battery electric trucks but Finland has very limited potential of 35%, due to the use of long and heavy truck-trailer combinations. Within both countries the electrification potential varies considerably between commodities, although in Finland more so than in Switzerland. Commodities which are constrained by payload volume rather than weight and are to large extent carried using medium duty or <26t rigid trucks trucks seem to provide high potential for electrification even with the current technology. Electric trucks increase the annual electricity consumption by only 1–3%, but truck charging is likely to have a large impact on local grids near logistics centres and rest stations along major roads. A spatial analysis by routing the trips reported in the datasets used in this study should be carried out. Future research should also include comparison between the alternate ways of electrifying road freight transport, i.e. batteries with charging, batteries with battery swapping and electrified road systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000313193",,"0306-2619||1872-9118","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/313193||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/301442","10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.12.017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/315450","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Electric trucks||Road freight transport||Logistics||Charging infrastructure","The potential of electric trucks - an international commodity- level analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-11-06T15:36:14Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85058374379",,"000458712500062","Appl.

The coordination of these actors is important for effective water governance. However, the joining together of multiple actors can have several implications, such as a redistribution of power across actors, a change in democratic control and citizen influence as well as shifting accountability structures. These implications can involve different barriers and bridges that might impede or foster coordination. Through qualitative and quantitative methods, we assess the following barriers and bridges for coordination: (1) reputational power in terms of who is perceived as important for coordination in the water sector; (2) democratic legitimacy in terms of actors’ value of local control of water services; and (3) accountability in terms of the regional actors’ capacity to steer in the water sector. This article focuses on three cases in a Swiss region that has experienced water provision challenges due to its highly fragmented water supply structures. We find that reputational power serves as a bridge in our three cases: when the actors responsible for water supply regard potential coordination partners as important, then we observe coordination. In contrast, we do not find conclusive evidence to support the assumption that a fear of losing local control is a barrier for coordination. Instead, our results indicate that accountability, in the form of vertical steering by the regional actors, serves as a bridge for coordination, and that this could help mitigate some of the potentially negative effects of democratic legitimacy perceptions: through convening local actors or providing positive incentives to municipalities to work together, regional actors can foster coordination.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000327275",,"2073-4441",,"10.3390/w11020326","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/327275","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","coordination||water supply||social network analysis","Actors in water governance: Barriers and bridges for coordination",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-02-23T03:55:44Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85061581816",,"000460899600145",,"2","Water","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Collectively, these ‘physical risks’, threaten the interests of investors and lenders, especially those with interests in real estate and infrastructure assets. This report shows how outputs from climate models can be used by investors and lenders in combination with natural catastrophe risk models to assess physical risks of climate change in different scenarios. As an illustration, this methodology got applied to a sample of 12 real estate portfolios – with a total market value in excess of £2 trillion, spread across Europe, North and South America and Asia – highlights some important preliminary findings, namely that climate change is anticipated to have large impacts on the risk of losses from floods in the UK and tropical cyclones in North America and the Pacific Rim.

Studies have identified a rationale for urban mitigation and energy policies rooted in local co-benefits, such as improvements in local environmental quality or job creation. Here we explore the possibility of financial co-benefits: whether municipal climate policies lead to an enhanced creditworthiness. This would translate into reduced borrowing costs for other infrastructure projects. Interviewing key informants from cities, investment firms and rating agencies, we find that rating agencies do consider climate policies in their ratings. This clearly applies to those climate policies that can result in demonstrable net economic gains to the municipality. However even those mitigation and energy policies that come at net costs to cities can have positive impacts on rating assessments, either because the policies are seen as reducing regulatory risks, or because they send positive signals to those investors having global sustainability agendas. Interestingly, those least aware of these factors appear to be city leaders themselves. This suggests a need to make them aware of how rating agencies and investors positively view climate mitigation policies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302644",,"2214-6296","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/394907||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302644","10.1016/j.erss.2018.09.021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302644","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Creditworthiness||Cities||Climate policies||Energy policies||Low carbon investment||Infrastructure","Creditworthiness and climate: Identifying a hidden financial co-benefit of municipal climate adaptation and mitigation policies",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-11-09T06:07:54Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Desertection - Social challenges of trans-Mediterranean renewable power cooperation","313553","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,"85054603329",,"000457886400013",,,"Energy Research & Social Science","48","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Many studies have compiled lists of such adjustments, especially in the developing country context. There is reason to believe, however, that such studies have suffered from particularly two types of methodological flaws, with the result of over-attributing the importance of climate change, relative to other factors leading farmers to alter their behavior. Firstly, studies in the past often do not consider non-climatic drivers in their analysis and their style of enquiry is also prone to response bias, particularly social desirability bias. In this study, we introduced a new methodological approach that addresses these potential flaws. We applied this new method side-by-side with the more established ones, in a household survey undertaken in Ethiopia. Our new method reveals a list of climate adaptations that is somewhat shorter than previous studies have found. We found that in the study area, crop switching, crop diversification and changing planting date are the adjustments that are primarily motivated by climate change than other drivers. The commonly used approach in studies in the past, the direct enquiry method, identified fertilizer application as the most important adaptation response. Other methods including our suggested new approach, however, indicate that this and other farm-level adjustments, while compatible with climate change, have actually very little to do with it, and instead are primarily motivated by new market and technological opportunities. Our findings could allow for more effective and efficient sets of policies to help farmers best adjust to new threats and opportunities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000303152",,"2212-0963","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/394844||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/303152","10.1016/j.crm.2018.09.003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/303152||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/395670","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Climate change||Adaptation||Farm-adjustment||Multivariate probit model||Social desirability bias||Ethiopia","Climate change as a motivating factor for farm-adjustments: Rethinking the link",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-11-12T15:12:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85054453408",,"000460938500013",,,"Climate Risk Management","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In jüngerer Zeit ist der alleinige Fokus auf Wissen kritisiert und sind weitere epistemische Güter diskutiert worden. Verstehen und Weisheit sind von besonderer Bedeutung. Erstens ist Verstehen ein hohes und Weisheit vielleicht das höchste epistemische Gut; beide scheinen epistemisch wertvoller zu sein als Wissen (Riggs 2003). Zudem ist unklar, ob der epistemische Wert von Wissen den Wert seiner Bestandteile (z.B. wahre, gerechtfertigte Meinung) übersteigt. Es ist behauptet worden, dass sich für Verstehen kein solches Wertproblem stellt und die Erkenntnistheorie deshalb Verstehen ins Zentrum rücken sollte (Kvanvig 2003; Pritchard 2010). Zweitens ist Verstehen ein Ziel von Wissenschaft (Elgin 2017) und von wissenschaftlicher Erklärung (Friedman 1974). Theorien der Erklärung und der kognitiven Leistungen der Wissenschaft verlangen deshalb nach einer Theorie des Verstehens (de Regt u.a. 2009). Drittens mag ein geeigneter Begriff des Verstehens es erlauben, tiefsitzende Intuitionen zur epistemischen Rechtfertigung anzuerkennen, die für Wissen zurückgewiesen wurden, z.B. internalistische und kohärentistische Intuitionen sowie solche zur Rolle von intellektuellen Charaktertugenden (Riggs 2003; Zagzebski 1996). Diese Idee ist kürzlich kritisiert (z.B. Greco 2014) und dafür vorgeschlagen worden, dass solche Intuitionen Merkmale von Weisheit betreffen (Grimm u.a. 2017, Kap. 10). Dieser Artikel behandelt die Natur von Verstehen und von Weisheit, indem er Verstehen mit Wissen und beide mit Weisheit vergleicht (für die Wertfrage s. Kap. „Der Wert des Wissens“).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000378068","978-3-476-04631-4||978-3-476-04632-1",,,"10.1007/978-3-476-04632-1_14","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/378068","de","J.B.

Most prominently, such strategies relate to transitions in the energy sector, on both the supply and the demand side. At the same time they interact with other sectors, such as industrial production, transport, and building, and ultimately require new behaviour patterns at household and individual levels. Currently, much research is available on the effectiveness of these strategies but, in order to successfully implement comprehensive transition pathways, it is crucial not only to understand the benefits but also the risks.  Filling this gap, this volume provides an interdisciplinary, conceptual framework to assess risks and uncertainties associated with low-carbon policies and applies this consistently across 11 country cases from around the world, illustrating alternative transition pathways in various contexts. The cases are presented as narratives, drawing on stakeholder-driven research efforts. They showcase diverse empirical evidence reflecting the complex challenges to and potential negative consequences of such pathways. Together, they enable the reader to draw valuable lessons on the risks and uncertainties associated with choosing the envisaged transition pathways, as well as ways to manage the implementation of these pathways and ultimately enable sustainable and lasting social and environmental effects.  This book will be of great interest to students, scholars, and practitioners of environmental and energy policy, low-carbon transitions, renewable energy technologies, climate change action, and sustainability in general.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000383102","978-0-429-45878-1",,,"10.4324/9780429458781","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/383102","en","Routledge","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Built Environment||Built environment||Development studies||Engineering & Technology||Environment and Sustainability||Politics & International Relations","Narratives of Low-Carbon Transitions: Understanding Risks and Uncertainties",,"Edited Volume","Open access","Routledge",,"2019-12-05T14:31:41Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Soot particles are of special interest since their properties can change significantly due to aging processes once they are emitted into the atmosphere. Probably the largest obstacle for the investigation of these processes in the laboratory is the long atmospheric lifetime of 1 week, requiring tailored experiments that cover this time span. This work presents results on the ability of two types of soot, obtained using a miniCAST soot generator, to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) after exposure to atmospherically relevant levels of ozone (O3) and humidity. Aging times of up to 12 h were achieved by successful application of the continuous-flow stirred tank reactor (CSTR) concept while allowing for size selection of particles prior to the aging step. Particles of 100 nm diameter and rich in organic carbon (OC) that were initially CCN inactive showed significant CCN activity at supersaturations (SS) down to 0.3 % after 10 h of exposure to 200 ppb of O3. While this process was not affected by different levels of relative humidity in the range of 5 %–75 %, a high sensitivity towards the ambient/reaction temperature was observed. Soot particles with a lower OC content required an approximately 4-fold longer aging duration to show CCN activity at the same SS. Prior to the slow change in the CCN activity, a rapid increase in the particle diameter was detected which occurred within several minutes. This study highlights the applicability of the CSTR approach for the simulation of atmospheric aging processes, as aging durations beyond 12 h can be achieved in comparably small aerosol chamber volumes (<3 m3). Implementation of our measurement results in a global aerosol-climate model, ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3, showed a statistically significant increase in the regional and global CCN burden and cloud droplet number concentration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000387470",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-15545-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387470","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Impact of isolated atmospheric aging processes on the cloud condensation nuclei activation of soot particles",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-04T03:33:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Soot Particle Ageing Cloud Effects - SPACE","161343","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,"85077125743",,"000503460000004","Atmos. chem. phys.","24","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Providing information can potentially save lives and improve the resilience of a society. Maps are an established way to illustrate natural hazards. Despite being mainly tailored to the requirements of professional users, they are often the only accessible information to help the public in deciding about mitigation measures. There is evidence that hazard maps are frequently misconceived. Visual and textual characteristics as well as the manner of presentation have been shown to influence their comprehensibility. Using a real case reflecting current practices, the material to communicate the updated seismic hazard model for Switzerland was analyzed in a representative online survey of the population (N=491) and in two workshops involving architects and engineers not specializing in seismic retrofitting (N=23). Although many best-practice recommendations have been followed, the understanding of seismic hazard information remains challenging. Whereas most participants were able to distinguish hazardous from less hazardous areas, correctly interpreting detailed results and identifying the most suitable set of information for answering a given question proved demanding. We suggest scrutinizing current natural-hazard communication strategies, empirically testing new products, and exploring alternatives to raise awareness and enhance preparedness.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000385342",,"1561-8633||1684-9981",,"10.5194/nhess-19-2677-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/385342","en","Copernicus Gesellschaft","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Difficulties in explaining complex issues with maps: evaluating seismic hazard communication - the Swiss case",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-12-13T10:03:22Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85075931508",,"000500242000001","Nat. hazards earth syst. sci.","12","Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00003 - Schulleitung und Dienste::00022 - Bereich VP Forschung / Domain VP Research::02818 - Schweiz.

This routine use of antimicrobials in animal production facilitates the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Despite potentially serious consequences for the animal industry, few studies have documented trends in antimicrobial use (AMU) at the farm-level in low- and middle-income countries. The objective of this study was to estimate AMU in a broiler chicken farm in Pakistan over a five-year period and to extrapolate national AMU in commercial broiler farming. Between 2013 and 2017, we monitored AMU in 30 flocks from a commercial broiler farm in Punjab, the most populous province of Pakistan. The amount of antimicrobials administered was calculated in milligram/population unit of the final flock weight (mg/fPU) and in used daily dose (UDD). The annual on-farm antimicrobial use was 250.84 mg of active ingredient per kilogram of the final flock weight. This consumption intensity exceeds the amount of antimicrobial used per kilogram of chicken of all countries in the world except China. Measured in mg per kg of final flock weight or population unit (fPU), medically important drugs such as colistin (31.39 mg/fPU), tylosin (41.71 mg/fPU), doxycycline (81.81 mg/fPU), and enrofloxacin (26.19 mg/fPU) were the most frequently used antimicrobials for prophylactic or therapeutic use. Lincomycin was the most frequently used antimicrobial used in-feed (29.09 mg/fPU). Our findings suggest that the annual consumption of antimicrobials in the broiler sector in Pakistan could be as high as 568 tons.

Because each company defines its own zero-deforestation commitment goals and implementation mechanisms, commitment content varies widely. This creates challenges for the assessment of commitment implementation or effectiveness. Here, we develop criteria to assess the potential effectiveness of zero-deforestation commitments at reducing deforestation within a company supply chain, regionally, and globally. We apply these criteria to evaluate 52 zero-deforestation commitments made by companies identified by Forest 500 as having high deforestation risk. While our assessment indicates that existing commitments converge with several criteria for effectiveness, they fall short in a few key ways. First, they cover just a small share of the global market for deforestation-risk commodities, which means that their global impact is likely to be small. Second, biome-wide implementation is only achieved in the Brazilian Amazon. Outside this region, implementation occurs mainly through certification programs, which are not adopted by all producers and lack third-party near-real time deforestation monitoring. Additionally, around half of all commitments include zero-net deforestation targets and future implementation deadlines, both of which are design elements that may reduce effectiveness. Zero-net targets allow promises of future reforestation to compensate for current forest loss, while future implementation deadlines allow for preemptive clearing. To increase the likelihood that commitments will lead to reduced deforestation across all scales, more companies should adopt zero-gross deforestation targets with immediate implementation deadlines and clear sanction-based implementation mechanisms in biomes with high risk of forest to commodity conversion.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000359672",,"0959-3780||1872-9495",,"10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2018.11.003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/359672","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Agriculture||Forestry||Supply chain||Conservation||Voluntary environmental policies||Sustainability standards","Criteria for effective zero-deforestation commitments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-08-21T13:04:41Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Glob. environ. change",,"Global Environmental Change","54","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Under the UNFCCC, global institutional efforts exist to mitigate such adverse impacts via adaptation intentions specified in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Yet, the lack of systematic coverage and quantification of these adaptation intentions regarding alignment with empirical risk, scope, costs and benefits prevents identification of adaptation needs, gaps and comparability of efforts among countries.  Drawing on literature research, disaster data from EM-DAT and CLIMADA, a probabilistic risk model, the aim of this thesis is twofold: i) to quantify and contrast empirical monetary and human damages from storms, floods & droughts at national levels globally with respective adaptation intentions in UNFCCC documents; ii) to propose methods to quantitatively capture extent, costs and averted damage to humans of adaptation actions against those hazards at national to global scales.  First, it is shown that ample gaps in risk acknowledgement and adaptation efforts exist within NDCs, NAPAs and NAPs: Countries which specify adaptation measures account for only 2.8 % of global annual storm damage, 17.3 % of flood damage and 8.1 % of drought damage. The thesis points out that the ’UNFCCC picture’ is incomplete and biased towards poorer countries, leading to an adaptation focus of countries most exposed to risk in relative terms (per wealth and population), while large monetary damages incurred by richer countries are systematically excluded. Adaptation costs to natural hazards are anecdotal in UNFCCC documents, amounting to 508 mio USD for storms, 1’747 mio USD for floods and 970 mio USD for droughts, which is less than global annual AEDs from these hazards.  Second, it is verified that risks from natural hazards can be captured adequately with the used probabilistic risk model: Simulations of global monetary damages from tropical cyclones at national levels commonly lie in the same order of magnitude as reported by EM-DAT; global human damages (affected and killed people) from tropical cyclones can be modelled using the proposed physical intensity-vs.- impact relationships and vulnerability classifications. Regarding adaptation costs, methodological input is given on the potentials and limitations of an extrapolation approach to predict global costs of technical adaptation measures. Tackling adaptation benefits, it is shown via a case-study that the risk modelling approach can also be used to infer human benefits (averted casualties and deaths) from the implementation of people-centred adaptation measures.  The results of this research i) shed light on trends and gaps in adaptation efforts to natural hazards within the UNFCCC framework, providing a fact-base for need assessments and resource allocation; ii) give suggestions for improving modelling of risks, costs and human benefits of adaptation actions at coarse national scales under information scarcity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000603215",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/603215","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Global Adaptation to Natural Hazards in Nationally Determined Contributions",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,"2023-03-14T10:39:12Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
