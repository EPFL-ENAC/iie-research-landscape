In this study, fallout radionuclides 239+240Pu are used to assess soil redistribution along topographic gradients at two cropland sites and at three nearby pristine forest sites located in the DR Congo, Uganda and Rwanda. In the study area, a relatively high 239+240Pu baseline inventory is found (mean forest inventory 41 Bq m−2). Pristine forests show no indication for soil redistribution based on 239+240Pu along topographical gradients. In contrast, soil erosion and sedimentation on cropland reached up to 37 and 40 cm within the last 55 years, respectively. Cropland sites show high intra-slope variability with locations showing severe soil erosion located in direct proximity to sedimentation sites.

We report that the introduction of novel herbivores and increased herbivory disrupted the vertical functional organization of the plant canopy. By feeding preferentially on alpine plants with functional traits matching their low-elevation host plants, herbivores reduced the biomass of dominant alpine plant species and favored encroachment of herbivore-resistant small-stature plant species, inflating species richness.

Although models for partitioning tower-measured ET have been developed, their reliability for different types of ecosystems still requires extensive validations. From 2001 to 2019, we measured CO2 and H2O vapor fluxes over an oak-grass savanna landscape from three eddy-covariance towers (i.e., one over an oak woodland; the other two over annual grasslands under tree canopy and in open area). Annual ET (± standard deviation) from the oak woodland, understory grassland, and open grassland was 419±85 mm, 167±36 mm, 324±43 mm, respectively. The differences between the above- and below-canopy ET indicated that oak canopy transpiration (Toak) was 281±48 mm year−1, accounting for 67±8% of the total ET of the woodland. The Toak/ET ratio varied in seasons, similar to the pattern of oak's leaf area index but opposite to that of soil moisture. We then tested two ET-partitioning models: Scott's long-term-regression-interception (LTRI) model (Scott and Biederman, 2017) and Zhou's quantile-regression-maximum-slope (QRMS) model (Zhou et al., 2016). Even though we expected that the two models would give divergent results since theiremo working principles, both models captured reasonable magnitudes and seasonal patterns of the T/ET ratio, as suggested by tower measurements. The study confirms that the LTRI and QRMS models are applicable for savanna ecosystems, but some modifications are necessary for tree dominated areas. In combination with field and modeling approaches, this study improves our understanding on the contributions of transpiration and evaporation to total ET from ecosystems with vertical vegetation layers.",,,,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.108204","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444957","en","Elsevier",,,"Mediterranean climate||Dry summers||Water use efficiency||Gas exchange||Photosynthesis||Latent heat flux","Transpiration and evaporation in a Californian oak-grass savanna: Field measurements and partitioning model results","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-10-07T15:25:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091986501",,,"000582305500036","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","295","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For example, it offers protection from natural hazards and is among other things a habitat for plants and animals. The increasing recreational use of forests leads to a steady decline of refuges for wild animals. This influences the spatial use of red deer (Cervus elaphus). So far, there are only few studies that deal with the effects of changing spatial use of ungulates on vegetation. In Switzerland the red deer populations are increasing. The dense population already has a noticeable impact on forest regeneration in the Aletsch Forest. Since there is currently no sophisticated basis for the proper handling of red deer in the Aletsch-Goms region, therefore the red deer project was launched. In addition to the habitat use, the influence of this species on forests should also be better understood in order to be able to derive measures for improved forest, wildlife and habitat management. The aim of this work was to investigate the density of natural regeneration and the frequency of damage caused by ungulates depending on hiking trails, their intensity of use and visibility in the Aletsch Forest. The following three questions were raised: 1. Does the human intensity of use of the trails or the distance to the nearest hiking trail have an impact on the density of natural regeneration in the Aletsch Forest? 2. Does the human intensity of use of the trails or the distance to the nearest hiking trail have an impact on the frequency of browsing damages? 3. How do the influences of visibility of the hiking trail and distance to the hiking trail differ on forest regeneration? Random plots were distributed within four distance classes along the hiking trails. 149 plots were surveyed. The density of natural regeneration was determined using the “Nearest Tree Method”. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were created to answer the research questions. On 14% of the plots was no regeneration. The density of natural regeneration decreases with the distance and increases with the intensity of use of the hiking trails. In contrast bark stripping increases with the distance and decreases with the intensity of use of the hiking trails. There were no significant results with buck rubbing. The visibility showed no effect on the density of natural regeneration or browsing. Since literature already attached significance to the visibility, further investigations with different methods are suggested. In order to check the results obtained, a space use habitat selection of the red deer and the creation of control fences near and far from the trails are recommended.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000596856",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/596856","de","ETH Zürich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Cervus elaphus||Browsing damage||forest regeneration||Recreation||ALETSCHWALD (CANTON OF VALAIS)||Valais||Switzerland||Hiking Trails||Red deer (Cervus elaphus)","Wald, Wild & Wanderwege: Eine Fallstudie im Aletschwald","Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2023-02-02T19:13:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Reducing deforestation and forest degradation presents a climate change mitigation opportunity critical to meeting Paris Agreement goals. One strategy for decreasing carbon emissions from forests is to provide developing countries with results-based financial incentives for reducing deforestation: nearly two billion dollars are currently committed to finance such programs, referred to as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks). Countries participating in these programs must document the uncertainty in their estimates of emissions and emission reductions, and payments are reduced if uncertainties are high. Our examination of documentation submitted to date to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) reveals that uncertainties are commonly underestimated, both by omitting important sources of uncertainty and by incorrectly combining uncertainties. Here, we offer recommendations for addressing common problems in estimating uncertainty in emissions and emission reductions. Better uncertainty estimates will enable countries to improve forest carbon accounting, contribute to better informed forest management, and support efforts to track global greenhouse gas emissions. It will also strengthen confidence in markets for climate mitigation efforts. Demand by companies for nature-based carbon credits is growing and if such credits are used for offsets, in exchange for fossil fuel emissions, it is essential that they represent accurately quantified emissions reductions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000454830",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/abb96f","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454830","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","REDD+||Carbon credit||Tropical deforestation||Forest carbon||Monte Carlo||Uncertainty estimation","Improving uncertainty in forest carbon accounting for REDD+ mitigation efforts","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-12-06T19:35:35Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85096934697",,,"000591804000001","Environ.

The global food system is causing large-scale environmental degradation and is a major contributor to climate change. Its low diversity and failure to produce enough fruits and vegetables is contributing to a global health crisis. 2. The extraordinary diversity of tropical tree species is increasingly recognized to be vital to planetary health and especially important for supporting climate change mitigation. However, they are poorly integrated into food systems. Tropical tree diversity offers the potential for sustainable production of many foods, providing livelihood benefits and multiple ecosystem services including improved human nutrition. 3. First, we present an overview of these environmental, nutritional and livelihood benefits and show that tree-sourced foods provide important contributions to critical fruit and micronutrient (vitamin A and C) intake in rural populations based on data from sites in seven countries. 4. Then, we discuss several risks and limitations that must be taken into account when scaling-up tropical tree-based food production, including the importance of production system diversity and risks associated with supply to the global markets. 5. We conclude by discussing several interventions addressing technical, financial, political and consumer behaviour barriers, with potential to increase the consumption and production of tropical tree-sourced foods, to catalyse a transition towards more sustainable global food systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000449894",,"2575-8314",,"10.1002/pan3.10159","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/449894","en","John Wiley & Sons","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Food for thought: The underutilized potential of tropical tree‐sourced foods for 21st century sustainable food systems","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-05T13:59:32Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85105177913",,,"000657243300003",,"S 4","People and Nature","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We conducted a systematic comparison of all forest landscape models currently applied in temperate European forests (LandClim, TreeMig, LANDIS-II, iLand). We examined the uncertainty of model projections under several future climate, disturbance, and dispersal scenarios, and quantified uncertainties by variance partitioning. While projections under past climate conditions were in good agreement with observations, uncertainty under future climate conditions was high, with between-model biomass differences of up to 200 t ha−1. Disturbances strongly influenced landscape dynamics and contributed substantially to uncertainty in model projections (~25–40% of observed variance). Overall, model differences were the main source of uncertainty, explaining at least 50% of observed variance. We advocate a more rigorous and systematic model evaluation and calibration, and a broader use of ensemble projections to quantify uncertainties in future landscape dynamics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000440162",,"1364-8152||1873-6726",,"10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104844","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/440162","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Forest landscape models||Model comparison||Variance partitioning||Disturbances||Dispersal||Future projections","How robust are future projections of forest landscape dynamics?

In early studies marine species distributions were interpreted based on tectonic activity during the late Cenozoic, while more recent studies have highlighted a link with the present-day environment. Here, we described the assemblage richness and composition of fishes in Tropical America and related these properties to both the past evolution of marine environmental conditions and current environmental gradients. Location Tropical America. Taxon Demersal and benthic fishes. Methods We mapped the distribution of 2,216 demersal and benthic fish species of Tropical America using existing occurrence data. We computed three assemblage indicators: species richness, composition and nestedness, which we explained by environmental gradients. We linked compositional distance to environmental differences using distance-based redundancy analysis, species richness and nestedness using a generalized linear model. We ran simulations of a mechanistic model in which three processes determine the spatial dynamics of biodiversity: speciation, dispersal and extinction. This model yielded estimates for species assemblage properties following palaeogeographic changes in the region that shaped the current coastal habitat configuration. Results Fish species richness in Tropical America peaks around the Florida Peninsula, Bahamas and Greater Antilles. Fish composition varies along a depth gradient, between the Tropical Eastern Pacific and the Caribbean Sea, and forms distinct domains within the Caribbean region. The nestedness component of beta-diversity is lower in shallower assemblages, especially those along the outer section of the Greater Caribbean. Species richness and nestedness are partly explained by current environmental conditions, but model simulations illustrate how this may be further explained by the tectonic history of the region. Main conclusions Species richness peaks in the Greater Caribbean, coinciding with generally favourable current environmental conditions for demersal and benthic fishes. The high species richness and the low nestedness of fish assemblages in the Cuba region are compatible with the results of palaeo-environmental changes that have occurred in that area. Effects of the plate tectonic history might still be present in the organization of fish fauna in this region.",,,,"0305-0270||1365-2699",,"10.1111/jbi.13985","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/451922","en","Wiley",,,"environment||Greater Caribbean||marine fish diversity||tectonics","Marine fish diversity in Tropical America associated with both past and present environmental conditions","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-11-19T03:48:59Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Relative importance of ecological and evolutionary determinants of coral reef fish biodiversity","164294||164294","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85094157760",,,"000585870300001","J. biogeogr.","12","Journal of Biogeography","47","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In deeply weathered tropical rainforest soils of Africa, it remains unclear whether patterns of microbial processes differ between soils developed from geochemically contrasting parent materials. Here we show that resource availability across soil depths and regions from mafic to felsic geochemistry shape patterns of soil microbial processes. During a 120-day incubation experiment, we found that microbial biomass C and extracellular enzyme activity were highest in the mafic region. Microbial C limitation was highest in the mixed sedimentary region and lowest in the felsic region, which we propose is related to the strength of contrasting C stabilization mechanisms and varying C quality. None of the investigated regions and soil depths showed signs of nitrogen (N) limitation for microbial processes. Microbial phosphorus (P) limitation increased with soil depth but was similar across geochemical regions, indicating that subsoils in the investigated soils were depleted in rock-derived nutrients and are therefore dependent on efficient biological recycling of nutrients. Microbial C limitation was lowest in subsoils, indicating that subsoil microbes can significantly participate in C cycling and limit C storage if increased oxygen availability is prevalent. Using multivariable regressions, we demonstrate that microbial biomass C normalized to soil organic C content (MBCSOC) is controlled by soil geochemistry and substrate quality, while microbial biomass C normalized to soil weight (MBCSoil) is predominantly driven by resource distribution. We conclude that due to differences in resource availability, microbial processes in deeply weathered tropical rainforest soils greatly vary across geochemical regions which must be considered when assessing soil microbial processes in organic matter turnover models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000462030",,,,"10.5194/soil-2020-80","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462030","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Extracellular enzymes||Microbial biomass||Carbon limitation||Nutrient limitation","Patterns of microbial processes shaped by parent material and soil depth in tropical rainforest soils","Working Paper","Open access",,,"2021-01-13T10:30:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Soil Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

All three methods are based on the coupled water and carbon relationship, but they differ in assumptions and parameterizations. Intercomparison of the three daily T estimates shows high correlation among methods (R between .89 and .94), but a spread in magnitudes of T/ET (evapotranspiration) from 45% to 77%. When compared at six sites with concurrent EC and sap flow measurements, all three EC‐based T estimates show higher correlation to sap flow‐based T than EC‐based ET. The partitioning methods show expected tendencies of T/ET increasing with dryness (vapor pressure deficit and days since rain) and with leaf area index (LAI). Analysis of 140 sites with high‐quality estimates for at least two continuous years shows that T/ET variability was 1.6 times higher across sites than across years. Spatial variability of T/ET was primarily driven by vegetation and soil characteristics (e.g., crop or grass designation, minimum annual LAI, soil coarse fragment volume) rather than climatic variables such as mean/standard deviation of temperature or precipitation. Overall, T and T/ET patterns are plausible and qualitatively consistent among the different water flux partitioning methods implying a significant advance made for estimating and understanding T globally, while the magnitudes remain uncertain. Our results represent the first extensive EC data‐based estimates of ecosystem T permitting a data‐driven perspective on the role of plants’ water use for global water and carbon cycling in a changing climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000444958",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15314","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444958","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ecohydrology||eddy covariance||evaporation||evapotranspiration||FLUXNET||transpiration","Ecosystem transpiration and evaporation: Insights from three water flux partitioning methods across FLUXNET sites","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-07T15:36:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,"ICOS-CH Phase 2","173691","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,,"85092098496",,,"000575306700001","Glob.

Here including both above- and below-ground organisms, we quantified the degree of topoclimatic control on the occurrence patterns of >1,500 taxa and phylotypes along a c. 3,000 m elevation gradient, by fitting species distribution models. Higher model performances for animals and plants than for soil microbes (fungi, bacteria and protists) suggest that the direct influence of topoclimate is stronger on above-ground species than on below-ground microorganisms. Accordingly, direct climate change effects are predicted to be stronger for above-ground than for below-ground taxa, whereas factors expressing local soil microclimate and geochemistry are likely more important to explain and forecast the occurrence patterns of soil microbiota. Detailed mapping and future scenarios of soil microclimate and microhabitats, together with comparative studies of interacting and ecologically dependent above- and below-ground biota, are thus needed to understand and realistically forecast the future distribution of ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000445396",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15330","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/445396","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","animals||climate change||ecosystems||microorganisms||niche model||plants||species distributions||taxonomic group","Greater topoclimatic control of above- versus below-ground communities","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-10T02:46:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091484388",,,"000572780800001","Glob.

Here, we show that tree mortality concomitant with drought has led to short-term (mean 5 y, range 1 to 23 y after mortality) vegetation-type conversion in multiple biomes across the world (131 sites). Self-replacement of the dominant tree species was only prevalent in 21% of the examined cases and forests and woodlands shifted to nonwoody vegetation in 10% of them. The ultimate temporal persistence of such changes remains unknown but, given the key role of biological legacies in long-term ecological succession, this emerging picture of postdrought ecological trajectories highlights the potential for major ecosystem reorganization in the coming decades. Community changes were less pronounced under wetter postmortality conditions. Replacement was also influenced by management intensity, and postdrought shrub dominance was higher when pathogens acted as codrivers of tree mortality. Early change in community composition indicates that forests dominated by mesic species generally shifted toward more xeric communities, with replacing tree and shrub species exhibiting drier bioclimatic optima and distribution ranges. However, shifts toward more mesic communities also occurred and multiple pathways of forest replacement were observed for some species. Drought characteristics, species-specific environmental preferences, plant traits, and ecosystem legacies govern postdrought species turnover and subsequent ecological trajectories, with potential far-reaching implications for forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.",,,,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2002314117","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/449416","en","National Academy of Sciences",,,"Drought-induced mortality||Forest dynamics||Forest resilience||Global tree mortality||Climate change","Forest and woodland replacement patterns following drought-related mortality","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-11-03T07:18:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85096885076",,,"000593986600018","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","47","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","117","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The majority of soil redistribution studies focus on water erosion, while wind and tillage erosion also induce pronounced redistribution of soil materials. Tillage erosion especially is understudied, as it does not lead to visible off-site damages. The analysis of on-site/in-field soil redistribution is mostly based on tracer studies, where radionuclide tracers (e.g. 137Cs, 239C240Pu) from nuclear weapon tests are commonly used to derive the erosion history over the past 50-60 years. Tracer studies allow us to determine soil redistribution patterns but integrate all types of soil redistribution processes and hence do not allow us to unravel the contribution of individual erosion processes. The aim of this study is to understand the contribution of water and tillage erosion leading to soil patterns found in a small hummocky ground moraine kettle hole catchment under intensive agricultural use. Therefore, 239C240Pu-derived soil redistribution patterns were analysed using an inverse modelling approach accounting for water and tillage erosion processes. The results of this analysis clearly point out that tillage erosion is the dominant process of soil redistribution in the study catchment, which also affects the hydrological and sedimentological connectivity between arable land and the kettle hole. A topographic change up to 17 cm (53 yr)1 in the eroded parts of the catchment is not able to explain the current soil profile truncation that exceeds the 239C240Pu-derived topographic change substantially. Hence, tillage erosion already started before the onset of intense mechanisation since the 1960s. In general, the study stresses the urgent need to consider tillage erosion as a major soil degradation process that can be the dominant soil redistribution process in sloped arable landscapes. © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag.

However, more detailed interrogations of the subsurface and plant domains have revealed under‐considered transport and isotopic fractionation phenomena. These now apparent complexities raise new questions and challenge the many past assumptions inherent in endmember‐mixing models that now seem overly simple. Here, we introduce discussions of these recent insights and provide an overview of isotope effects that occur naturally in the root zone and in the plant, as well as artificially during sample handling. Better accounting for these complexities and their associated uncertainties can lead to more accurate and robust study designs, analytical frameworks and, ultimately, inferences. Finally, to more robustly characterize plant water sources using δ18O and δ2H, we provide some practical recommendations that aim at maximizing the isotopic contrast between endmembers and/or minimizing potential uncertainties.",,,,"2041-210X||2041-2096",,"10.1111/2041-210X.13461","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444949","en","Wiley",,,"ecohydrology||endmember-mixing models||plant water uptake||review||root zone||stable water isotopes||uncertainties","Plant and root‐zone water isotopes are difficult to measure, explain, and predict: Some practical recommendations for determining plant water sources","Review Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-10-07T14:18:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091371183",,,"000572129200001","Methods Ecol.

However, direct comparisons of the coupled variations of above- and below-ground herbivore communities along elevation gradients remain sparse. Here, we studied the variation in assemblages of two dominant groups of herbivores, namely, aboveground orthoptera and belowground nematodes, in grasslands along six elevation gradients in the Swiss Alps. By examining variations of community properties of herbivores and their food plants along montane clines, we sought to determine whether the structure and functional properties of these taxonomic groups change with elevation. We found that orthoptera decreased in both species richness and abundance with elevation. In contrast with aboveground herbivores, the taxonomic richness and the total abundance of nematode did not covary with elevation. We further found a stronger shift in above- than below-ground functional properties along elevation, where the mandibular strength of orthoptera matched a shift in leaf toughness. Nematodes showed a weaker pattern of declined sedentary behavior and increased mobility with elevation. In contrast to the direct exposal of aboveground organisms to the surface climate, conditions may be buffered belowground, which together with the influence of edaphic factors on the biodiversity of soil biota, may explain the differences between elevational patterns of above- and below-ground communities. Our study emphasizes the necessity to consider both the above- and below-ground compartments to understand the impact of current and future climatic variation on ecosystems, from a functional perspective of species interactions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000449334",,"0029-8549||1432-1939",,"10.1007/s00442-020-04778-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/449334","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Environmental gradient||Species richness||Herbivory||Functional traits||Ecological interactions","Contrasting responses of above- and below-ground herbivore communities along elevation","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-03T03:46:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Lif3web: The present and future spatial structure of tri-trophic networks","162604","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85092721878",,,"000579697800001","Oecologia","3","Oecologia","194","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It remains unknown whether shifts in species’ climatic suitability will be linear or rather non‐linear, with crop exposure to pests suddenly increasing when a critical temperature threshold is crossed. Moreover, uncertainty of forecasts can arise because of the modelling approach based either on species distribution data or on physiological measurements. Here, we compared the predictions of two modelling approaches (physiological models and species distribution models) for forecasting the potential distribution of agricultural insect pests in Europe. Despite conceptual differences, we found good agreement overall between the two approaches. We further identified a potential regime change in pest pressure along a temperature gradient. With both modelling approaches, we found an inflection point in the number of pest species with suitable climatic conditions around a minimum temperature of the coldest month of −3°C. Our results could help decision‐makers anticipate the onset of rising pest pressure and provide support for intensifying surveillance measures, particularly in regions where temperatures are already beyond the inflection point. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15313","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/441322","en","Wiley",,,"Agricultural crop||Climate change||Insect pest||Physiological model||Species distribution model||Temperature threshold","Inflection point in climatic suitability of insect pest species in Europe suggests non‐linear responses to climate change","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-09-20T04:16:26Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85090313501",,,"000566566600001","Glob.

This interpolated climate data represents long‐term average thermal conditions at coarse spatial resolutions only. Hence, many climate‐forcing factors that operate at fine spatiotemporal resolutions are overlooked. This is particularly important in relation to effects of observation height (e.g. vegetation, snow and soil characteristics) and in habitats varying in their exposure to radiation, moisture and wind (e.g. topography, radiative forcing or cold‐air pooling). Since organisms living close to the ground relate more strongly to these microclimatic conditions than to free‐air temperatures, microclimatic ground and near‐surface data are needed to provide realistic forecasts of the fate of such organisms under anthropogenic climate change, as well as of the functioning of the ecosystems they live in. To fill this critical gap, we highlight a call for temperature time series submissions to SoilTemp, a geospatial database initiative compiling soil and near‐surface temperature data from all over the world. Currently, this database contains time series from 7,538 temperature sensors from 51 countries across all key biomes. The database will pave the way toward an improved global understanding of microclimate and bridge the gap between the available climate data and the climate at fine spatiotemporal resolutions relevant to most organisms and ecosystem processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000411646",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15123","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/411646","en","Wiley","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Microclimate||Soil climate||Climate change||Topoclimate||Database||Temperature||Species Distributions||Ecosystem processes","SoilTemp: a global database of near‐surface temperature","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-04-24T09:36:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Lif3web: The present and future spatial structure of tri-trophic networks","162604","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85086643464",,,"000542205100001","Glob.

However, those findings primarily rely on data from temperate regions with soil mineralogy, weathering status and climatic conditions that generally differ from tropical and sub-tropical regions.  We investigated soil properties and climate variables influencing SOC concentrations across sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 1,601 samples were analyzed, collected from two depths (0–20 cm and 20–50 cm) at 45 sentinel sites from 17 countries as part of the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project. The dataset spans climatic conditions from arid to humid and includes soils with a wide range of pHH20 values, weathering status, soil texture, exchangeable cations, extractable metals and a variety of important land cover types.  The most important SOC predictors were identified by linear mixed effects models, regression trees and random forest models. Our results indicate that SOC is primarily controlled by aridity index (PET/MAP), exchangeable calcium (Caex) and oxalate-extractable aluminum (Alox); this was found across both depth intervals. Oxalate-extractable iron (Feox) emerged as the most important predictor for both depth intervals in the regression tree and random forest analyses. However, its influence on SOC concentrations was strong only below Feox concentrations of 0.25 wt %. This suggests that Feox can act as a pedogenic threshold – even on a continental scale. Across model-ling approaches, clay and fine silt content (< 8 µm) and land cover were not significant SOC pre-dictors, in contrast to common assumptions.  Our findings indicate that the key controlling factors of SOC across sub-Saharan Africa are similar to what has been reported for temperate regions – except for soil texture and vegetation cover. However, the strength and importance of the controlling factors vary across the environmental gradient we studied.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460471",,,,"10.5194/soil-2020-69","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460471","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biogeochemistry||Land-use||Soil organic matter||Clay mineralogy||Pedogenic threshold","Continental-scale controls on soil organic carbon across sub-Saharan Africa","Working Paper","Open access",,,"2021-01-08T08:33:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Soil Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In structured uneven-aged deciduous forests with continuous cover, radiation regimes in the understorey are typically characterized by low and heterogeneous light transmittance. The competitive ability of juvenile trees in these forests is therefore linked to their shade tolerance and expressed by different growth strategies. The related growth traits result in different morphological responses to light availability and shape recruitment dynamics. In the different light availability niches created by continuous-cover forestry, assessing tree growth patterns is crucially important towards silvicultural optimization, which aims to promote species diversity and the sustainable provision of forest ecosystem services. However, information on growth rates of small trees below the caliper limit of typical inventories or monitoring plots is relatively scarce. In an extensive field campaign, we sampled juvenile European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) along light availability gradients and analyzed stem discs to quantify primary and secondary growth. We used linear mixed effects models to explain the annual increments of height, basal area and volume as well as allometric exponents. Beech growth rates were explained well by diffuse light availability and ontogeny. Models predicting sycamore growth were slightly less accurate, as indicated by a higher root mean square error. Compared to beech, light availability had a stronger influence on secondary growth of sycamore stems, and height increment decreased with tree age. Trajectories of height and diameter growth of the two species were different at low light availability, where sycamore invested more in height growth and thus was generally slender than beech. At light availability above 20%, similar growth trajectories but different allocation patterns were observed. Overall, we found markedly different growth strategies and different competitive abilities of beech and sycamore in small gaps in uneven-aged mixed deciduous forests. From a management perspective, sycamore should not be left suppressed in shaded conditions as it loses its height growth potential with increasing age. Tending measures may be needed for sycamore to maintain its stability and low height to diameter ratio, but not for juvenile beech, which benefits from positive effects of crowding on height growth.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000424248",,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118314","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424248","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Fagus sylvatica||Acer pseudoplatanus||Basal area increment||Height growth||Light availability||Resource allocation||Allometric exponent||Stem disc","Growth and resource allocation of juvenile European beech and sycamore maple along light availability gradients in uneven-aged forests","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-07-03T06:38:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85087277533",,,"000578991500006","For.

Mathematical modelling has been used for decades to quantify and predict erosion and transport of sediments, e.g. in scenarios of land use change or conservation measures. Being intrigued by both models and the connectivity concept, as a group of modellers we aimed at investigating what different models could tell us about connectivity. Therefore, we evaluated the response of contrasted spatially-distributed models to landscape connectivity features and explained the differences based on different model structures. A total of 53 scenarios were built with varying field sizes and orientations, as well as the implementation of soil conservation measures. These scenarios were simulated, for two rainfall intensities, with five event- and process-based water and soil erosion models – EROSION3D, FullSWOF_2D, LandSoil, OpenLISEM and Watersed. Results showed that rainfall amount plays the most important role in determining relative export and connected area of runoff and sediment in all models, indicating that functional aspects of connectivity were more important than structural connectivity. As for the role of structural landscape elements, there was no overall agreement between models regarding the effects of field sizes, crop allocation pattern, and conservation practices; agreement was also low on the spatial patterns of connectivity. This overall disagreement between models was unexpected. The results of this exercise suggest that the correct parameterization of runoff and sediment production and of routing patterns may be an important issue. Thus, incorporating connectivity functions based on routing would help modelling forward. Our results also suggest that structural connectivity indices may not suffice to represent connectivity in this type of catchment (relatively simple and monotonous land cover), and functional connectivity indices should be applied.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000425985",,"0169-555x||1872-695X",,"10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.107300","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/425985","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Connectivity||Erosion models||Model comparison||Catchment","What do models tell us about water and sediment connectivity?","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-07-13T03:07:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85087474946",,,"000564544900002",,,"Geomorphology","367","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using the Hurst exponent H to characterize the roughness of the self-affine surfaces that constitute the fracture, our analysis reveals the important interplay between geometry and inertia on the flow. Precisely, for low values of Reynolds numbers, Re, we use Darcy's law to quantify the hydraulic resistance G of the fracture and show that its dependence on H can be explained in terms of a simple geometrical model for the geometric tortuosity of the channel. At sufficiently high values of Re, when inertial effects become relevant, our results reveal that nonlinear corrections up to third order to Darcy's law are approximately proportional to H. These results imply that the resistance G to the flow follows a universal behavior by simply rescaling it in terms of the fracture resistivity and using an effective Reynolds number, namely, Re/H.

However, some plantations have launched invasions that cause substantial damage to biodiversity and ecosystem services, while others pose substantial threats of causing such impacts. The challenge is to maximise the benefits of non-native trees, while minimising negative impacts and preserving future benefits and options.  A workshop was held in 2019 to develop global guidelines for the sustainable use of non-native trees, using the Council of Europe – Bern Convention Code of Conduct on Invasive Alien Trees as a starting point.  The global guidelines consist of eight recommendations: 1) Use native trees, or non-invasive non-native trees, in preference to invasive non-native trees; 2) Be aware of and comply with international, national, and regional regulations concerning non-native trees; 3) Be aware of the risk of invasion and consider global change trends; 4) Design and adopt tailored practices for plantation site selection and silvicultural management; 5) Promote and implement early detection and rapid response programmes; 6) Design and adopt tailored practices for invasive non-native tree control, habitat restoration, and for dealing with highly modified ecosystems; 7) Engage with stakeholders on the risks posed by invasive non-native trees, the impacts caused, and the options for management; and 8) Develop and support global networks, collaborative research, and information sharing on native and non-native trees.  The global guidelines are a first step towards building global consensus on the precautions that should be taken when introducing and planting non-native trees. They are voluntary and are intended to complement statutory requirements under international and national legislation. The application of the global guidelines and the achievement of their goals will help to conserve forest biodiversity, ensure sustainable forestry, and contribute to the achievement of several Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations linked with forest biodiversity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000448272",,"1619-0033",,"10.3897/neobiota.61.58380","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448272","en","Pensoft Publishers","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biological invasions||Code of conduct||Environmental policy and legislation||Invasion science||Stakeholder engagement||Stakeholder participation||Sustainable forestry||Tree invasions","Global guidelines for the sustainable use of non-native trees to prevent tree invasions and mitigate their negative impacts","Review Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-28T03:54:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000577174300004",,"61","Neobiota",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Where and when Arctic shrub expansion happens in the future will depend in part on how different shrub communities respond to warming air temperatures. Here, we analyze a shrub ring-width network of 18 sites consisting of Salix spp. and Alnus viridis growing across the North Slope of Alaska (68–71°N; 164–149°W) to assess shrub temperature sensitivity and compare radial growth patterns with satellite NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) data since 1982. Regardless of site conditions and taxa, all shrubs shared a common year-to-year growth variability and had a positive response to daily maximum air temperatures (Tmax) from ca. May 31 (i.e. Tmax ~6 °C) to early July (i.e. Tmax ~12 °C), two-thirds of which were significant correlations. Thus, the month of June had the highest shrub growth-temperature sensitivity. This period coincides with the seasonal increase in temperature and phenological green up on the North Slope indicated by both field observations and the seasonal cycle of NDVI (a proxy of photosynthetic activity). Nearly all of the sampled shrubs (98%) initiated their growth after 1960, with 74% initiated since 1980. This post-1980 shrub-recruitment pulse coincided with ~2 °C warmer June temperatures compared to prior periods, as well as with positive trends in shrub basal area increments and peak summer NDVI. Significant correlations between shrub growth and peak summer NDVI indicate these radial growth patterns in shrubs reflect tundra productivity at a broader scale and that tundra vegetation on the North Slope of Alaska underwent a greening trend between 1980 and 2012.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000446918",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab897f","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446918","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Alaska||NDVI||Remote sensing||Shrubs||Tree rings||Tundra||Warming","A narrow window of summer temperatures associated with shrub growth in Arctic Alaska","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-21T02:37:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85094115522",,,"000576554700001","Environ.

Biodiversity has often been used in spatial conservation planning and has been regarded as one among multiple services delivered by ecosystems. Hence, biodiversity conservation planning should be integrated in a framework of prioritizing services in order to inform decision-making. Here, we propose a prioritization approach based on scenarios maximising both the provision of ecosystem services and the conservation of biodiversity hotspots. Different weighting scenarios for the α-diversity in four taxonomic groups and 10 mapped ecosystem services were used to simulate varying priorities of policymakers in a mountain region. Our results illustrate how increasing priorities to ecosystem services can be disadvantageous to biodiversity. Moreover, the analysis to identify priority areas that best compromise the conservation of α-diversity and ecosystem services are predominantly not located within the current protected area network. Our analyses stress the need for an appropriate weighting of biodiversity within decision making that seek to integrate multiple ecosystem services. Our study paves the way toward further integration of multiple biodiversity groups and components, ecosystem services and various socio-economic scenarios, ultimately fuelling the development of more informed, evidence-based spatial planning decisions for conservation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,,,"2212-0416",,"10.1016/j.ecoser.2020.101186","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/442893","en","Elsevier",,,"Economic valuation||α-diversity||Human-nature trade-off||Spatial prioritization||Conservation planning||Decision support tool||Zonation software","Integrating ecosystem services within spatial biodiversity conservation prioritization in the Alps","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-09-27T02:47:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091240062",,,"000577343300004",,,"Ecosystem Services","45","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This landbridge, however, should have crossed the Caribbean oceanic plate, and the geological evolution of its rise and demise, or its geodynamic forcing, remain unknown. Here we present the results of a land-sea survey from the northeast Caribbean plate, combined with chronostratigraphic data, revealing a regional episode of mid to late Eocene, trench-normal, E-W shortening and crustal thickening by ∼25%. This shortening led to a regional late Eocene–early Oligocene hiatus in the sedimentary record revealing the location of an emerged land (the Greater Antilles-Northern Lesser Antilles, or GrANoLA, landmass), consistent with the GAARlandia hypothesis. Subsequent submergence is explained by combined trench-parallel extension and thermal relaxation following a shift of arc magmatism, expressed by a regional early Miocene transgression. We tentatively link the NE Caribbean intra-plate shortening to a well-known absolute and relative North American and Caribbean plate motion change, which may provide focus for the search of the remaining connection between ‘GrANoLA’ land and South America, through the Aves Ridge or Lesser Antilles island arc. Our study highlights the how regional geodynamic evolution may have driven paleogeographic change that is still reflected in current biology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000448964",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0241000","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448964","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Eocene intra-plate shortening responsible for the rise of a faunal pathway in the northeastern Caribbean realm","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-31T03:50:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85093857759",,,"000585940600001","PLoS ONE","10","PLoS ONE","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These plants are widely vilified and motivate expensive control campaigns, but their presence may be providing a poorly recognized function in the cycling of excess nutrients. The capacity for floating plants to absorb nutrients from surface water has been understood for decades, primarily from their use in constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment. Yet, in natural settings, there has not been to date any effort to quantify whether floating plant invasions represent important pools or fluxes of nutrients relative to those of the river catchments in which they occur. We found that seasonal hydrologic cycles in the Zambezi trap and flush floating plants from river choke points, such as dams and river confluences, on an annual basis. Peak plant biomass at such choke points constitutes a proxy for estimating annual plant-bound nutrient loads. We assessed the significance of floating vegetation as nutrient sinks by comparing annual plant-bound nutrient loading to conventional river nutrient loading (dissolved and particulate) for four tributaries of the Zambezi River in Zambia. We found that the relative importance of floating vegetation was greatest in the more urbanized catchments, such as the Maramba River draining the city of Livingstone, representing approximately 30% and 9% of annual digestible phosphorus and nitrogen flux respectively. We also found plant-bound phosphorus to be important in the Kafue River (19%), draining the industrial town of Kafue and extensive sugarcane plantations. These results demonstrate the great potential of floating plants to take up excess nutrients from natural river systems. Given the importance of hydrology in the life cycle of floating vegetation, controlled dam discharges may have an important role in managing them and their water quality treatment functions. © 2020, The Author(s).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000442923",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-020-72499-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/442923","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Potential of aquatic weeds to improve water quality in natural waterways of the Zambezi catchment","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-09-28T02:48:21Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary...","690268-2","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,,"85091301295",,,"000577219100016","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The aim of this course is to create an effective learning experience and develop critical thinking capacities for future natural resource managers and academics. The course is structured into various parts where students first elaborate on the definition of the theoretical foundations and concepts. In a next step, they use this definition to work on real-world case studies. During their groupwork, they construct a role-playing game that addresses the most prominent issues in the system and thereby learn to understand and deal with the complexity of the management issues. At the same time, students are trained in soft skills like teamwork, self-reflection, debriefing, and facilitation. In this paper, we present the structure of the course and results from an online survey done by students from the last 5 years. We assessed how well former students remember the course and the theory they learnt and how they perceived the teaching approach. We found positive results: students appreciate the different teaching approach and most of the students, including students from earlier cohorts, state that they still remember the concepts. Students report that they have applied the concepts and approaches from the course in other contexts outside the classroom. We, as teaching staff, reflect on the course, the learning experience, and the results from the online survey, and present four teaching principles that underline what has worked in the course: i) self-authorship, ii) education through active and experiential learning, iii) competence-oriented learning on soft skills: self-reflection, teamwork, and facilitation, and finally iv) inter-cultural learning.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000449901",,"2624-7984||2624-7992",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/449901","en","ETH Zurich, Educational Development and Technology","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"“I remember your lecture”: role-playing games and unconventional teaching reinforce learning outcomes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-05T14:14:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://learningteaching.ethz.ch/index.php/lt-eth/article/view/64",,,,"1","ETH Learning and Teaching Journal","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The adoption of sustainable biofuel production technologies that do not place large demands on agricultural or forested lands, has the potential to make a substantial contribution to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions while reducing biodiversity losses and degradation of native ecosystems resulting from high demand for land. With their high productivity per unit area and ability to grow on non-arable lands, microalgal biofuel production systems could become a major sustainable alternative to biofuel production from food crops (first-generation biofuels). However, the potential impacts of microalgal biofuels on food production, biodiversity, and carbon storage, compared to other biofuel production alternatives, are largely unknown. In the present study, the most suitable areas for siting microalgae production farms to fulfill 30% of future transport energy demands were determined within four Neotropical countries with high population densities and high importance for agricultural expansion and biodiversity conservation globally (Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela). These results were contrasted with the best areas for siting oil palm and sugarcane crops to fulfill the same target in future transport energy demands. Microalgal production systems offer the most sustainable alternative for future biofuel production within the Neotropics. Meeting 30% of future transport energy demands with microalgal biofuels reduced land area requirements by at least 52% compared to oil palm and sugarcane. Furthermore, microalgal biofuel production reduced direct competition with agricultural lands, biodiverse areas, and carbon-rich systems within countries, with little overlap with the biodiverse and carbon-rich rainforests. This study can guide decision making towards the identification and adoption of more sustainable biofuel production alternatives in the Neotropics, helping in avoiding unnecessary environmental impacts from biofuel expansion in the region.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000444045",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab8d7f","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444045","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","biofuel||microalgae||oil palm||sugarcane||biodiversity||land-use change","Freeing land from biofuel production through microalgal cultivation in the Neotropical region","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-02T02:46:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091697779",,,"000570739300001","Environ.

Based on the FLUXNET2015 Dataset, we found that relative humidity (RH) is a more important driver of ET than temperature. While actual ET decrease at reduced RH, potential ET increases, consistently with the complementary relationship (CR) framework stating that the fraction of energy not used for actual ET is dissipated as increased sensible heat flux that in turn increases potential ET. In this study, we proposed an improved CR formulation requiring no parameter calibration and assessed its reliability in estimating ET both at site-level with the FLUXNET2015 Dataset and at basin-level. Using the ERA-Interim meteorological dataset for 1979-2017 to calculate ET, we found that the global terrestrial ET showed an increasing trend until 1998, while the trend started to decline afterwards. Such decline was largely associated with a reduced RH, inducing water stress conditions that triggered stomatal closure to conserve water. For the first time, this study quantified the global-scale implications of changes in RH on terrestrial ET, indicating that the temperature-driven acceleration of the terrestrial water cycle will be likely constrained by terrestrial vegetation feedbacks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000440992",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab9967","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/440992","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","terrestrial evapotranspiration||relative humidity||global warming||stomata regulation","Stomatal response to decreased relative humidity constrains the acceleration of terrestrial evapotranspiration","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-09-17T12:02:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,"ICOS-CH Phase 2","173691","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,,"85091159611",,,"000565753300001","Environ.

Using a soil–plant hydraulic model, we show that xylem vulnerability does not trigger stomatal closure in medium-wet to dry soils and we propose that soil hydraulic conductivity loss is the primary driver of stomatal closure. This finding has two key implications: transpiration response to drought cannot be derived from plant traits only and is related to soil–root hydraulics in a predictable way; roots and their interface with the soil, the rhizosphere, are key hydraulic regions that plants can alter to efficiently adapt to water limitations.

Future drought events related to climate change, however, threaten grassland functionality in many regions across the globe. The introduction of sustainable grassland management could buffer these negative effects. According to the biodiversity-productivity hypothesis, productivity positively associates with local biodiversity. The biodiversity-insurance hypothesis states that higher biodiversity enhances the temporal stability of productivity. To date, these hypotheses have mostly been tested through experimental studies under restricted environmental conditions, hereby neglecting climatic variations at a landscape-scale. Here, we provide a landscape-scale assessment of the contribution of species richness, functional composition, temperature, and precipitation on grassland productivity. We found that the variation in grassland productivity during the growing season was best explained by functional trait composition. The community mean of plant preference for nutrients explained 24.8% of the variation in productivity and the community mean of specific leaf area explained 18.6%, while species richness explained only 2.4%. Temperature and precipitation explained an additional 22.1% of the variation in productivity. Our results indicate that functional trait composition is an important predictor of landscape-scale grassland productivity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438570",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.6650","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438570","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","BEF||Biodiversity||Drought||Ecosystem functioning||Ecosystem services||Grasslands||Plant||Productivity||Trait composition","A landscape-scale assessment of the relationship between grassland functioning, community diversity, and functional traits","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-09-04T20:02:02Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85089446843",,,"000559909000001","Ecol Evol","18","Ecology and Evolution","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As a striking example, the wet grasslands of the Marais Poitevin region (France) presents many obstacles against the integration of these issues, especially in terms of public policy design. The socio-cultural situation in this region shows a high degree of political resistance and questions the relevancy of the current Agri-Environmental Schemes (AES) as an incentive for livestock farmers to adopt biodiversity friendly practices favoring the birds’ richness of the area. In this study, we explored the reasons for the poor effect of public policy using a two-fold approach based on ethnographic fieldwork and a role-playing game experiment. The ethnographic fieldwork aimed at understanding the local context and daily lives of farmers and current AES’s difficulties while the observation of the role-playing game session allowed for the exploration of current and alternative policy scenarios. The game represents an archetypal wetland that simulates the grass regeneration, water flows through a canal system and a surrounding network of cultivated plots (wheat, corn, sunflower, alfalfa) and pasture areas. The game is designed for eight players who embody their role in real life, i.e. water managers, biodiversity managers and farmers. The behaviors of the players during the session were observed and analyzed through semantic analysis. The game was structured around two scenarios to allow participants to explore, test and compare the current individual action-oriented AES with alternative collective public policy instruments. Such comparison brings new insights for public policy design. It also highlights the topic of integrated environmental management and questions the relevancy of participatory approaches in striving to resolve contradiction/dilemmas in environmental development.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000416804",,"0264-8377||1873-5754",,"10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104724","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/416804","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cooperation||Agriculture||Wetlands||Role-playing game||Biodiversity||Trade-off||Public policy||Agri-Environmental Schemes","Public policy design: Assessing the potential of new collective Agri-Environmental Schemes in the Marais Poitevin wetland region using a participatory approach","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-27T02:33:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85084851227",,,"000558748500032","Land Use Policy",,"Land Use Policy","97","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

What influences farmers' decisions to adopt agricultural technologies is an important question for international agricultural research projects. There are often interpersonal differences between women and men that influence the adoption of decisions and behaviours, but few studies in the literature focus on these factors. We describe a game-based approach to explore decision-making processes underpinning the adoption of new farming technologies and practices in Lao People's Democratic Republic. Sowing a different rice variety is the tailored technology. The game explored adoption behaviours influencing decisions on transitioning from growing glutinous rice, a traditional variety preferred for consumption, to ""white"" rice for commercial export to international markets. We conducted separate game-workshops with 36 women and 36 men in 4 villages of southern Laos that were transitioning from subsistence to commercial smallholder production. The gaming exposed various possible behaviours and decisions that women and men considered. Access to resources, both assets and information, was equal for all players, yet women were found to adopt new rice varieties more readily than men and to engage in cooperative behaviours in the game situation. The study highlighted the need for further gender-sensitive research into cooperation among women in the agricultural context-an understanding beneficial for countries and regions undergoing agricultural transition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438619",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su12166594","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438619","en","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A game-based approach to exploring gender differences in smallholder decisions to change farming practices: White rice production in Laos","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-09-04T20:16:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85089909736",,,"000579623300001",,"16","Sustainability","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Understanding the variation of δ13C-FAs within catchment land uses is crucial for correct classification of sediment sources but it has rarely been evaluated. Here, we assessed the variability of δ13C values of FAs (C22–32) in soils under land uses within a catchment (23 km2) in the mid-hills of Nepal. High δ13C-FA variability in agricultural terraces (−32.8‰ to −20.2‰) and mixed forest (−37.3‰ to −22.3‰) was observed. This is due to differences in inputs of FAs of different chain-lengths with variable δ13C-FAs values by C3 and C4 crops as well as from farmyard manure in agricultural terraces. The pine plants succession in the forest and differences in FA preservation explained the observed variation in δ13C-FA values in a mixed forest. A pine forest transect that had undergone land cover change about 40 years ago showed high variability of δ13C-FA values strongly linked to legacy effects of previous C4 crops. Importantly, soils from the border of a land use and fresh surface deposits mostly increased the within-land use variability of δ13C-FAs values. Overall, δ13C-FA values have low potential to function as a robust tracer for high resolution discrimination of land uses and the validity of a priori sediment source classification is most questionable in catchments that have undergone land cover change. Cluster analysis was promising for identifying and combining functionally similar land uses to define more meaningful sediment sources at the catchment scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000419524",,"0146-6380",,"10.1016/j.orggeochem.2020.104048","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/419524","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Catchment-wide variations and biogeochemical time lags in soil fatty acid carbon isotope composition for different land uses: Implications for sediment source classification","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-10T12:31:47Z","2022-05-19",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85086011777",,,"000546214000001","Org.

However, the limited observability of key processes at the root-soil interface has so far limited our understanding of how such resilience emerges. Here, we hypothesize that resilience emerges from self-organized spatiotemporal patterns which are the result of complex and dynamic feedbacks between physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring in the rhizosphere. We propose that the combination of modern experimental and modeling techniques, with a focus on imaging approaches, allows for understanding the complex feedbacks between plant resource acquisition, microbiome-related plant health, soil carbon sequestration, and soil structure development. A prerequisite for the identification of patterns, underlying processes, and feedback loops is that joint experimental platforms are defined and investigated in their true 2D and 3D geometry along time. This applies across different scientific disciplines from soil physics/chemistry/microbiology to plant genomics/physiology and across different scales from the nano/microscopic scale of the root soil interface, over the radial profiles around single roots, up to the root architecture and plant scale. Thus, we can move beyond isolated reductionist approaches which have dominated in rhizosphere research so far.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000593292",,"2673-3218",,"10.3389/fagro.2020.00008","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/593292","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Root||Resilience||Pattern analyses||Resource efficiency||Nutrient acquisition||Soil structure||Maize||Self-organization","Rhizosphere Spatiotemporal Organization–A Key to Rhizosphere Functions","Review Article","Open access",,,"2023-01-18T11:26:40Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Front.

The interplay between local hydrodynamics and the fluid’s constitutive law determines the distribution of flow paths. Consequently the spatial heterogeneity of the viscous resistance controls mass and solute transport from the micron to the meter scale. Examples range from oil recovery and groundwater engineering to drug delivery, filters and catalysts. Here we present a new methodology to map the spatial variation of the local viscosity of a non-Newtonian fluid flowing through a complex pore geometry. We use high resolution image velocimetry to determine local shear rates. Knowing the local shear rate in combination with a separate measurement of the fluid’s constitutive law allows to quantitatively map the local viscosity at the pore scale. Our experimental results—which closely match with three-dimensional numerical simulations—demonstrate that the exponential decay of the longitudinal velocity distributions, previously observed for Newtonian fluids, is a function of the spatial heterogeneity of the local viscosity. This work sheds light on the relationship between hydraulic properties and the viscosity at the pore scale, which is of fundamental importance for predicting transport properties, mixing, and chemical reactions in many porous systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000428498",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-020-68545-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/428498","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Mapping the local viscosity of non-Newtonian fluids flowing through disordered porous structures","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-07-25T22:37:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,"The role of ambient flow and physico-chemical microenvironment in determining the microstructure of the biofilm matrix","179834","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","PRIMA",,,,"85088108450",,,"000550057200046","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Firstly, there is a push towards modernization and commercialization of farming. Secondly, though farmers still focus on rice farming as a key activity, there is an increasing move towards diversification of livelihoods. The changes have seen the uptake of non-rice crops, livestock husbandry and forest and river utilization; as well as non-farming activities. This has influenced gender relations, impacting household agricultural production decisions and amplified transitional trends. To explore the processes, we analyzed data from a study of innovation adoption amongst rice farmers in southern Lao PDR. The study revealed nuances of gender-based differences in the priorities and attitudes towards farming and off-farm activities, as well as differences in behaviour related to the adoption of new practices. Women were more focused on non-farming practices and considered engaging in the modern, non-traditional, economy more so than men. Women also reported experiencing greater challenges when engaging and trading in the agricultural marketplace. The study supports the importance of taking a gendered approach to understanding the inherent complexities within agrarian change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000428297",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su12135403","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/428297","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Rice||Gender||Smallholder farmers||Technology adoption||Lao PDR||Innovation diffusion||Agrarian transition","Gendered Roles in Agrarian Transition: A Study of Lowland Rice Farming in Lao PDR","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-07-24T04:08:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85088027328",,,"000550209100001",,"13","Sustainability","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This topographic asymmetry has inspired numerous explanations. In the simplest scenario, insolation-driven microclimatic differences lead to different erosion rates on opposing slopes and topographic asymmetry develops. Alternatively, lateral channel migration and the corresponding steepening of undercut slopes have also been suggested as a dominant cause of topographic asymmetry. To examine these proposed origins of asymmetric topography, we adapted a numerical landscape evolution model to include lateral channel migration as well as aspect-induced variations in soil creep, regolith strength, and runoff. We compared the resulting topography and erosional response produced by each mechanism and found that the model with lateral channel migration produces unique signatures in erosion rates and the ridgetop Laplacian of elevation. To further investigate lateral channel migration, we developed a model of hillslope profile evolution in which sediment fluxes from opposing slopes control lateral channel migration rate and direction. We find that topographic asymmetry in this system can be self-sustaining. All else being equal, we find that the aspect-dependent models with variable regolith strength or runoff predict that less topographic asymmetry should develop as slope length decreases. These two models also predict that weaker asymmetry should develop as rock strength increases, whereas the lateral channel migration model predicts that greater rock strength should lead to weaker asymmetry only if lateral channel migration efficiency increases faster than fluvial incision efficiency. © 2020 American Geophysical Union.",,,,"0148-0227||2169-9003||2169-9011",,"10.1029/2019JF005377","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429581","en","American Geophysical Union",,,,"Modeling the Formation of Topographic Asymmetry by Aspect‐Dependent Erosional Processes and Lateral Channel Migration","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-08-02T03:09:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85088582303",,,"000555444100010","J. geophys. res.

Competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain the asymmetry observed at Gabilan Mesa. One hypothesis states that different microclimates on opposing slopes are responsible for differences in runoff or soil strength, which generates asymmetric topography. A second hypothesis states that differences in sediment flux from opposing slopes causes southward lateral channel migration and oversteepening of north facing slopes. To test these hypotheses, we carried out numerical modeling experiments, terrain analysis, and field measurements. We also considered the role of initial tilting in causing the asymmetry. We found that saturated hydraulic conductivity is considerably lower on south facing slopes in one highly asymmetric basin. This is consistent with the hypothesis that aspect-dependent runoff is responsible for the asymmetry. We also used cosmogenic radionuclide-derived erosion rates and topographic characteristics at Gabilan Mesa to test predictions from numerical landscape evolution models that incorporate asymmetry-forming mechanisms. The aspect-dependent models reproduce the erosional and topographic characteristics of Gabilan Mesa better than the lateral channel migration model. We conclude that aspect-dependent runoff is the most likely explanation for most of the topographic asymmetry at Gabilan Mesa. Our results do not rule out tilting as a possible influence on the initial development of asymmetry nor do they rule out the possibility that lateral channel migration has contributed to the asymmetry, but we suggest that tilting and lateral channel migration are not primarily responsible for it. © 2020 American Geophysical Union.",,,,"0148-0227||2169-9003||2169-9011",,"10.1029/2019JF005378","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429582","en","American Geophysical Union",,,,"Unraveling the Mysteries of Asymmetric Topography at Gabilan Mesa, California","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-08-02T03:09:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85088560850",,,"000555444100016","J. geophys. res.

The uncontrolled development of large oil palm plantations has raised complex socio-ecological issues, including changes of ecological landscapes, organization of production, and farming household livelihood systems. For two oil palm villages with different ecological settings, this article describes changes in land cover, how production is organized, and the income structure changes due to rural economic development. The research used survey approaches and analysis of earth maps, assisted by data obtained from satellite imagery. A qualitative approach was also used to support a survey via in-depth interviews. The research was carried out in two oil palm economy-based villages of Kutai Kartanegara District, of the Province of East Kalimantan of Indonesia. The first village is located very close to the center of regional administration and has evolved into a non-farming economy. In contrast, the other village is more isolated and solely relies on farming activities. The study found that changes of land cover caused by oil palm expansion could be categorized into two types, concentrated and spotted, following the influence of oil palm investment activities. It was also found that organization of the production of most smallholders existed in two types of arrangements, partial and total integration of production. From the perspective of livelihood, two different types of income structures emerged, diversified and uniform. This article concludes that responses of smallholders to palm oil spread varied depending on the ecological setting, the existence of the already established plantation economy in the region, the capacity of the smallholders to diversify economic activities based on palm oil, and the exposure to external economic activities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429578",,"2073-445X",,"10.3390/land9070213","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429578","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Oil palm expansion||Organization of production||Land-cover changes||Income structure change||Farming households","Dynamics of Rural Economy: A Socio-Economic Understanding of Oil Palm Expansion and Landscape Changes in East Kalimantan, Indonesia","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-08-02T03:08:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Oil Palm Adaptive Landscapes","177587","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","r4d - Ecosystems Fortsetzung",,,,"85088537222",,,"000556472200001",,"7","Land","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Simulating how past climate change shaped intraspecific genetic variation can provide a validation of models in anticipation of their use to predict future changes. We review simulation models that provide inferences on population genetic structure. Existing simulation models generally integrate complex demographic and genetic processes but are less focused on the landscape dynamics. In contrast to previous approaches integrating detailed demographic and genetic processes and only secondarily landscape dynamics, we present a model based on parsimonious biological mechanisms combining habitat suitability and cellular processes, applicable to complex landscapes. The simulation model takes as input (a) the species dispersal capacities as the main biological parameter, (b) the species habitat suitability, and (c) the landscape structure, modulating dispersal. Our model emphasizes the role of landscape features and their temporal dynamics in generating genetic differentiation among populations within species. We illustrate our model on caribou/reindeer populations sampled across the entire species distribution range in the Northern Hemisphere. We show that simulations over the past 21 kyr predict a population genetic structure that matches empirical data. This approach looking at the impact of historical landscape dynamics on intraspecific structure can be used to forecast population structure under climate change scenarios and evaluate how species range shifts might induce erosion of genetic variation within species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000422253",,"1752-4571||1752-4563",,"10.1111/eva.12986","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/422253","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Landscape genetics||Migration||Population genetics||Range dynamics||Refugia||Species distribution modeling","Harnessing paleo-environmental modeling and genetic data to predict intraspecific genetic structure","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-24T21:59:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85085889393",,,"000539679800001","Evol.

For management planning, information on site-specific long-term responses to CC as well as the consequences for protection functions is particularly crucial. We used the process-based model ForClim to provide projections of forest development and their protective function as decision support for a large forest enterprise in the Northern Pre-Alps. Specifically, we investigated the impact of three climate scenarios (present climate, low- and high-impact CC) at five representative sites along an elevational gradient (700–1450 m a.s.l.). Relatively small changes to current forest structure and composition were evident under present climate, but divergent trajectories occurred under CC: while the low-elevation sites (≤ 1000 m) were affected by drought-related mortality, high-elevation sites benefited from the warming. Changes at low-elevation sites were accompanied by shifts in species composition, favouring in particular Tilia (‘low-impact’ CC) and Pinus sylvestris (‘high-impact’ CC). Forest management accelerated the shift towards climate-adapted tree species, thereby reducing detrimental effects of the ‘low-impact’ CC scenario. Under the ‘high-impact’ scenario, however, drastic decreases in protective function occurred for the late twenty-first century at low elevations. A set of exemplary disturbance scenarios (windthrow and bark beetle) demonstrated the importance of forest management and low browsing for the resilience of mountain forests. Overall, our results underline the potential of process-based forest models as decision support tools for forest enterprises, providing local projections of CC impacts across large elevational ranges at the site-specific resolution required by forest managers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000416238",,"1612-4677||1612-4669",,"10.1007/s10342-020-01263-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/416238","en","Springer","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Mountain forest||Climate change impacts||Switzerland||Dynamic vegetation model||Ungulate browsing","Climate change impacts across a large forest enterprise in the Northern Pre-Alps: dynamic forest modelling as a tool for decision support","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-22T02:33:30Z","2021-03-06",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85081574969",,,"000532978900012","Eur J Forest Res","3","European Journal of Forest Research","139","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To reduce these negative impacts on wildlife, forecasts of high migration intensities are needed to apply mitigation actions. While existing weather radar networks offer a unique possibility to monitor and forecast bird migration at large spatial scales, forecasts at the fine spatial scale within a complex terrain, such as the mountainous Swiss landscape, require a small‐scale network of ornithological radars. Before attempting to build such a network, it is crucial to first investigate the consistency of the migratory flow across space and time. In this study, we simultaneously operated three ornithological radar systems across the Swiss lowlands to assess the spatio‐temporal consistency of diurnal and nocturnal bird movements during the spring and autumn migration season. The relative temporal course of migration intensities was generally consistent between sites during peak migration, in particular for nocturnal movements in autumn, but absolute intensities differed greatly between sites. Outside peak migration, bird movement patterns were much less consistent and, unexpectedly, some presumably non‐migratory bird activity achieved intensities close to peak migration intensities, but without spatial correlations. Only nocturnal migration intensity in autumn could be predicted with consistently high accuracy, but including parameters of atmospheric conditions in the model improved predictability of diurnal movements considerably. Predictions for spring were less reliable, probably because we missed an important part of the migration season. Our results show that reliable forecasts of bird movements within a complex terrain call for a network of year‐round bird monitoring systems, whereas accurate information of atmospheric conditions can help to limit the number of measurement points.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000387870",,,,"10.1002/rse2.143","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387870","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Avian migration||flight behavior||migration intensity||prediction||radar ornithology","Consistency of spatio-temporal patterns of avian migration across the Swiss lowlands","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-07T04:53:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85077166894",,,"000504289400001",,"22","Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We characterized the genetic diversity of 21 wild and cultivated populations across Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. A complete threat assessment was performed evaluating the short-term threats from overexploitation, overgrazing, landslides, and fragmentation as well as long-term threats from climate change. Based on key indicators of genetic diversity and threat magnitude, we developed an approach to identify wild populations for priority conservation and defined appropriate measures to conserve their genetic diversity based on the specific threat magnitudes. We propose (i) ex situ conservation in areas with “severe threat level” due to climate change and (ii) in situ conservation in areas with “minor threat level” due to climate change. In addition, we suggest (iii) assisted natural regeneration in areas where “minor threat levels” from climate change coincide with “severe threat levels” from one or more short-term threats. Our research shows high levels of genetic diversity as well as high threat levels in the walnut populations examined across three countries. Overgrazing and overexploitation were identified as the two most important threats whereas climate change turned out to be of minor concern in the near future. Four out of the five populations selected for priority conservation are severely threatened: Kara-Alma (KGP3) and Sariosiyo (UZP4) by overexploitation and overgrazing, Vanj (TJP2) by landslides and fragmentation and Bostanlyk_2 (UZP2) by overexploitation. Only the Baljuvon population (TJP4) in Tajikistan shows minor threat levels in the short and long term. Thus, for all five priority populations the most appropriate conservation approach appears to be in situ conservation. Spontaneous natural regeneration should be sufficient to ensure the long-term survival of the Baljuvon population (TJP4), while for the other four priority populations assisted natural regeneration may be needed. This network of five sites represents the minimum number of conservation areas for wild walnut in the three countries that should be established to capture a significant amount of the species genetic diversity. Conservation efforts could be extended to home gardens, which are a valuable genetic reservoir for the wild diversity found in the region.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000425973",,"2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2020.00171","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/425973","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","threat mapping||distribution modeling||genetic diversity||conservation priority||Central Asia||common walnut||climate change||natural population","Diversity Under Threat: Connecting Genetic Diversity and Threat Mapping to Set Conservation Priorities for Juglans regia L.

A key reason for this apparent ineffectiveness could lie in the failure to recognize the agency of all stakeholders involved. Landscapes do not happen. We shape them. Forest transitions are social and behavioral before they are ecological. Decision makers need to integrate better representations of people’s agency in their mental models. A possible pathway to overcome this barrier involves eliciting mental models behind policy decisions to allow better representation of human agency, changing perspectives to better understand divergent points of view, and refining strategies through explicit theories of change. Games can help decision makers in all of these tasks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000454327",,"2590-3322",,"10.1016/j.oneear.2020.05.002","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454327","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The Global Forest Transition as a Human Affair","Review Article","Open access",,,"2020-12-03T03:50:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85089901550",,,"000645255400009",,"5","One Earth","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

On the island of Borneo, between 1973 and 2015, 50% of the forest was lost, much of this to oil palm and other industries. We explore the impacts of these four decades of forest loss on the functionally connected habitat of 245 forest birds and mammals. First, we map potential suitable habitat in 1973 and 2015 by refining reported ranges by elevation, forest cover and patch size. We find that, on average, these species have lost 28% of habitat within their ranges. We then use graph-theory connectivity models to calculate the functionally connected area for each species, according to their natal dispersal abilities. We find a mean loss of 35% in functionally connected area, revealing the often hidden impacts of deforestation. Losses in functionally connected habitat are largely driven by area of habitat loss, though maximum elevational range limit also explains some of the differences modeled across species, with lowland species being most affected. We present a vulnerability index of threat arising from loss of functionally connected habitat. The spatial distribution of vulnerability index values serves as a tool for setting conservation priorities for forest remnants on Borneo, given that most of the ranges of these species are not protected. We make recommendations for the use of connectivity models to prioritize resources for research and conservation on Borneo and other biodiversity hotspots.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000466694",,"2624-893X",,"10.3389/ffgc.2020.00053","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/466694","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Connectivity||Equivalent connected area||Fragmentation||Forest patch||Mammals||Birds||Oil palm","Impacts of Four Decades of Forest Loss on Vertebrate Functional Habitat on Borneo","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-29T12:20:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85104874820",,,"000536335500001",,,"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, few studies take the influence of parent material geochemistry on the development of C stabilization mechanisms into account. In addition, studies evaluating C stabilization in soil are often limited to temperate climate zones with young to intermediate aged soils. This is not representative for older, deeply weathered and leached tropical systems and limits our understanding of the relationship between geology, soil formation and their effect on C stabilization.  Here, we study the relationship between soil carbon stabilization and the geochemical properties of soils developed on different parent material along geomorphic transects in pristine tropical forest systems under comparable climate. Our study is located in the eastern part of the Congo basin along the East African Rift Mountain System where we sampled 36 one meter soil cores along nine geomorphic transects on geologies ranging from mafic to felsic geochemistry.  Carbon stocks ranged between 2.67 tC ha-1 to 85.75 tC ha-1 and were on average composed of 4.5% (±5.3% SD) coarse particulate organic matter, 46.0% (±10.3% SD) (micro)aggregates associated C and 49.6% (±11.2% SD) free silt and clay associated C. Our analysis shows that the topographic position of the investigated soils had no effect on SOC stocks and the distribution of soil C fractions. Regression models and partial correlation analysis reveal that strong correlations of SOC stocks exists to geochemical properties of the solid phase of soil but not to the distribution of soil C fractions. SOC decreased strongly with soil depth on soils developed on felsic parent material, but less so on mafic or intermediate parent material. In addition, mafic geochemistry shows significantly higher SOC stocks compared to their felsic counterparts.  We conclude that despite long-lasting weathering, the contrasting geochemistry of the underlying parent material leaves a footprint in soil geochemistry that affects C stocks but less so on stabilization mechanisms. We hypothesis that carbon dynamics in these undisturbed tropical forest systems are more driven by C input and nutrient recycling than by variation in C stabilization potential.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460456",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-12993","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460456","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Soil organic carbon stocks in tropical soil systems under rainforests controlled by geochemistry","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2021-01-08T08:19:56Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2020","May 4-8, 2020","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Carbon stabilization mechanisms in these ecosystems are often complex, as these mechanisms crucially rely on the interplay of geology, topography, climate, and biology. Future predictions of the perturbation of the soil carbon pool ultimately depend on our mechanistic understanding of these complex interactions.  Using laboratory incubation experiments, we investigated if carbon release from soils through heterotrophic respiration in the African highland forests of the Eastern Congo Basin follows predictable patterns related to topography, soil depth or geochemical soil properties that can be described at the landscape scale and ultimately be used to improve the spatial accuracy of soil C respiration in mechanistic models. In general, soils developed on basalt and granite parent material (mafic and felsic geochemistry of parent material) showed significantly (p <0.05) higher specific respiration than soils developed on sedimentary rocks (mixed geochemistry) with highest rates measured for soils developed on granite. For soils developed on basalt, specific respiration decreased two-fold with soil depth, but not for soils developed on granite or sedimentary rocks. No significant differences in respiration under tropical forest were found in relation to topography for any soil and geochemical background.  Using a non-linear,  stochastic gradient boosting machine learning approach we show that soil biological, physical and chemical properties can predict the pattern of specific soil respiration (R2=0.41, p<0.05). An assessment of the relative importance of the included predictors for soil respiration resulted in 43 % of the model being driven by geochemistry (pedogenic oxides, nutrient availability), 12 % driven by soil texture and clay mineralogy, 34 % by microbial biomass, C:N, and C:P ratios and 11 % by topographic indices.   We conclude that, in order to explain soil C respiration patterns in tropical forests, a complex set of variables need to be considered that differs depending on the local bedrock chemistry. Its effect is likely related to the varying strength of C stabilization with minerals as well as nutrient availability that might drive C input patterns and microbial turnover.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460434",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-13609","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460434","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Soil carbon respiration in tropical forest soils along geomorphic and geochemical gradients","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2021-01-08T07:48:27Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2020","May 4-8, 2020","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Data from the Quillow catchment (size: 196 km2; mean annual precipitation: 500 mm) in North-East Germany are used to estimate landscape-scale water and tillage erosion with the model SPEROS-C. Recent results show that tillage erosion causes substantial soil redistribution that can distinctively exceed water erosion. In consequence, truncated soil profiles can be found on hilltops and steep slopes, whereas colluvial material is accumulated in depressions and along downslope field boarders. The resulting spatial variability of soil types with different properties and conditions is known to influence crop growth and leads to a highly variable biomass pattern in hummocky landscapes under highly mechanised arable cultivation.  The main goal of our study is to link tillage-induced erosion rates to landscape development at centennial time scales. By modelling the development of the hummocky moraine landscape of North-Eastern Germany, we explain the spatial distribution of the current soil erosion state. Furthermore, the soil erosion induced impact on crop biomass patterns and the redistribution of soil organic carbon since the beginning of human land use in this area is assessed. To address this goal, a new model component is implemented into SPEROS-C that iteratively rejuvenates topography backwards in time considering modelled erosion and deposition rates. Afterwards, modelling forward in time allows estimating carbon fluxes due to soil redistribution. Furthermore, the extent and location of truncated soils will be validated with historic aerial photographs at different time steps.  The benefits of implementing landscape development into SPEROS-C are that (i) an annual update of topography generates a more realistic soil erosion pattern, (ii) the current crop biomass pattern may be explained by erosion history, and (iii) estimates about the future development of crop yield patterns considering ongoing tillage practices can be drawn from a validated soil erosion and landscape development model.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460501",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-987","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460501","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"What role does tillage erosion play regarding landscape evolution of an intensively used hummocky landscape?","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2021-01-08T09:06:00Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2020","May 4-8, 2020","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite their success, many questions regarding appropriate model formulations remain unresolved, and few models have found widespread application, for example, across a whole continent. We aimed to scrutinize the representation of ecological processes in dynamic forest models so as to rigorously test core assumptions underlying forest dynamics and the consistency of their interplay, taking the ForClim model as a case study. We developed a set of alternative representations for the main ecological processes, that is, tree establishment, growth, and mortality, and light extinction through the canopy, based on diverse sources of empirical data. We applied a pattern‐oriented modeling (POM) approach to test all combinations of the standard and alternative formulations (>500 model versions) against a comprehensive set of patterns for diverse model applications across a wide range of site conditions. We found that adapting one process in isolation can improve model performance for one specific application. However, the best model versions typically included more than one alternative formulation. Importantly, the best version for an individual application was generally not the best across multiple applications, emphasizing the varying influences of ecological processes. We conclude that the behavior and performance of complex models should not be analyzed for a few specific applications only. Rather, multiple applications, system states, and dynamics of interest should be scrutinized across a wide range of site conditions. This allows for avoiding overfitting and detecting and eliminating structural shortcomings and parameterization problems. We thus propose to make use of the ever‐increasing data availability and the POM framework to challenge the core processes of dynamic models in a holistic manner. For model applications, we propose that a set of alternative formulations (ensemble simulations) should be used to quantify the impacts of structural uncertainty, rather than to rely on the projections from one single model version.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000418738",,"2150-8925",,"10.1002/ecs2.3109","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/418738","en","Ecological Society of America","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","dynamic vegetation model (DVM)||ecological factors||ecological theory||establishment||Europe||ForClim||forest gap model (FGM)||growth||long‐term forest dynamics||mortality||pattern‐oriented modeling (POM)","Capturing ecological processes in dynamic forest models: why there is no silver bullet to cope with complexity","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-08T02:38:35Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85085681359",,,"000538094900010",,"5","Ecosphere","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Experimental studies have shown that soil texture and geochemistry have a strong effect on carbon stocks. However, those findings primarily rely on data from temperate regions or use model approaches that are often based on limited data from tropical and sub-tropical regions.  Here, we evaluate the controls on soil carbon stocks in Africa, using a dataset of 1,580 samples. These were collected across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) within the framework of the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project, which was built on the well-established Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF). Samples were taken from two depths (0–20 cm and 20–50 cm) at 46 LDSF sites that were stratified according to Koeppen-Geiger climate zones. The different pH-values, clay content, exchangeable cations and extractable elements across various soils of the different climatic zones (i.e. from arid to humid (sub)tropical) allow us to identify different soil and climate parameters that best explain SOC variance across SSA.  We tested if these SOC predictors differed across climatological conditions, using the ratio of potential evapotranspiration (PET) to mean annual precipitation (MAP) as indicator. For water-limited regions (PET/MAP > 1), the best predictors were climatic variables, likely because of their effect on the quantity of carbon inputs. Geochemistry dominated SOC storage in energy-limited systems (PET/MAP < 1), reflecting its effect on carbon protection. On a continental scale, climate (e.g. PET) is key to predicting SOC content in topsoil, whereas geochemistry, particularly iron-oxyhydroxides and aluminum-oxides, is more important in subsoil. Clay content had little influence on SOC at both depths. These findings contribute to an improved understanding of the controls on SOC stocks in tropical and sub-tropical regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460477",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-13719","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460477","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Large-scale controls of soil organic carbon in (sub)tropical soils","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2021-01-08T08:40:38Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2020","May 4-8, 2020","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The availability of P to plants and microbes is regulated by abiotic processes (e.g. P sorption/desorption, precipitation/dissolution) and biological activities (microbial P immobilization/organic P mineralization). Due to the strong geochemical component of the P cycle, it can be expected that soil C, N and P cycling may differ in terms of effects of geology, climate and management. Despite advances in our understanding of physico-chemical controls on P availability, there is still little mechanistic understanding of large scale controls on soil P cycling and its relation to soil C and N cycling, due to a lack of broad scale studies using common methodologies.  Here we aimed to investigate soil physicochemical and biological factors that drive soil P cycling and may cause a (de)coupling of C, N and P processes. We therefore sampled mineral topsoils (0-10 cm, n=95) across a continental transect in Europe (Southern Spain to Northern Scandinavia), covering major geological, climatic and land use gradients. The soils derived from different land uses (cropland, grassland, forest/woodland) and bedrock types (silicate, sediment, calcareous). We analyzed a wide range of potentially relevant physico-chemical and biological properties and measured gross rates of soil N and P processes by short term (24 h) incubations of soils with 33P and 15N following isotope pool dilution approaches.  (i) Across the whole transect land-use effects on soil P pools and processes exceeded those of geology, reflecting the accumulation of fertilizer P in soils of managed ecosystems. Cropland (and grasslands) had higher values of soil total P and soil inorganic P (Pi), available Pi (Olsen P), and gross Pi mobilization rates by abiotic and biotic processes compared to forests. Soil phosphatase activity did not vary between land-uses. Soils on silicate bedrock had significantly higher total and labile P than calcareous soils.  (ii) Climate differentially affected P pools and processes. Soil total P, dissolved organic P, and gross Pi desorption decreased with mean annual temperature (MAT; these properties were not sensitive to mean annual precipitation - MAP), while soil phosphatase activity and gross total Pi mobilization through abiotic and biotic processes increased with MAP but were insensitive to MAT. This clearly points to adverse climatic controls of biotic and abiotic soil P processes.  (iii) We found strong interlinkages between soil C, N and P pools (soil organic matter and microbial biomass) and soil enzymes (beta-glucosidase, chitinase, phosphatase) but not in related gross processes (respiration, N and P mineralization). Interestingly the slopes of C-P and N-P relations of pools and enzymes differed systematically between land-uses, indicating that land management causes a partial decoupling of P from C and N cycles, reflecting the P-richness of croplands.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000461925",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-10893","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461925","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Continental scale climate, land-use and geological controls of soil P cycling and relations with soil C and N","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2021-01-13T08:37:08Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2020","May 4-8, 2020","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The by far most often officially used tool to determine soil erosion is the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its regional adaptions. The aim of this study is to use three different regional USLE-based approaches in three different test catchments in the Czech Republic, Germany, and Austria to determine differences in model results and compare these with the revised USLE-base European soil erosion map. The different regional model adaptations and implementation techniques result in substantial differences in test catchment specific mean erosion (up to 75% difference). Much more pronounced differences were modelled for individual fields. The comparison of the region-specific USLE approaches with the revised USLE-base European erosion map underlines the problems and limitations of harmonization procedures. The EU map limits the range of modelled erosion and overall shows a substantially lower mean erosion compared to all region-specific approaches. In general, the results indicate that even if many EU countries use USLE technology as basis for soil conservation planning, a truly consistent method does not exist, and more efforts are needed to homogenize the different methods without losing the USLE-specific knowledge developed in the different regions over the last decades.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000418650",,"2076-3417",,"10.3390/app10103647","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/418650","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","USLE||Erosion||Soil conservation||EU||Model comparison","Operational USLE-Based Modelling of Soil Erosion in Czech Republic, Austria, and Bavaria—Differences in Model Adaptation, Parametrization, and Data Availability","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-06T02:36:50Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85085594982",,,,,"10","Applied Sciences","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Die Zusammenhänge zwischen Durchmesser und Baumlänge einerseits und Biomasse andererseits sind log-linear. Diese Prädiktoren wurden als fixe Effekte in die Modelle aufgenommen. Die einzelnen Probeflächen, auf denen Bäume gesammelt worden waren, wurden als zufällige Effekte verwendet. In Form dieser log-linearen Modelle mit gemischten Effekten wurden verschiedene Modelle angepasst, um die Biomasse und daraus abgeleitet die CO2-Speicherung von Bäumen auf Basis ihres Durchmessers und der Baumlänge vorherzusagen. Dabei konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Standortfaktoren kaum einen Einfluss haben und der Durchmesser als bester Prädiktor fungiert.  Da in Waldinventuren der Jungwuchs oftmals nur in Höhenklassen erhoben wird, wurde auch ein Modell mit den Höhenklassen als Prädiktor angepasst. Dieses ist selbstredend weniger aussagekräftig als dasjenige mit stetigen Daten als Prädiktoren. Zusätzlich wurden die Beziehungen zwischen Baumlänge und Durchmesser modelliert. Diese Zusammenhänge sind möglicherweise interessant für die Verwendung in Waldwachstumsmodellen, da diese oft auf allometrischen Beziehungen basieren.

Despite both scientific evidence and traditional knowledge that supports the value of diverse production systems for ecosystem services and resilience, a trend of agroecosystem intensification is apparent across tropical regions. These transitions happen in spite of policies that prohibit such transformations. We present a participatory modelling study run to (1) understand the drivers of landscape transition and (2) explore the livelihood and environmental impacts of tenure changes in the coffee agroforestry systems of Kodagu (India). The components of the system, key actors and resources, and their interactions were defined with stakeholders, following the companion modelling (ComMod) approach. The underlying ecological processes driving the system were validated through expert knowledge and scientific literature. The conceptual model was transformed into a role-playing game and validated by eight workshops with a total of 57 participants. Two scenarios were explored, a No Policy Change as baseline, and a Restitution of Rights where rights to cut the native trees are handed over to farmers. Our results suggest that the landscape transition is likely to continue unabated unless there is a change to the current policy framework. However, the Restitution of Rights risks speeding up the process rather than reversing it, as inter alia, the differential growth rate between exotic and native tree species, kick in.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000416230",,"1999-4907",,"10.3390/F11040480","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/416230","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","companion modelling||agroforestry||Grevillea robusta||India||policy||role playing games","Coffee, Farmers, and Trees—Shifting Rights Accelerates Changing Landscapes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-22T02:32:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85084666471",,,"000534632500118",,"4","Forests","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although drought frequency, intensity and duration are expected to increase in the near future, the effects of drought events on growth of beech trees are still not completely understood. It is unclear why some beech trees died or have experienced severe vitality decline while other trees have survived the last droughts and remained vital. Here, we took advantage of the unprecedented beech mortality event that is occurring around Basel to investigate the growth response of vital and dying (unvital) beech trees to past and recent extreme droughts. To do this, different analyses were conducted. First, response and correlation functions were calculated between growth series of individual vital and unvital trees and climate variables such as temperature, precipitation and drought index. Second, a superposed epoch analysis was used to assess the impact of past extreme drought years on growth. Resilience components (resistance, recovery and resilience) were also calculated separately for vital and unvital trees and the differences between the two groups were statistically tested. Finally, linear mixed models were used to assess the influence of tree size, drought and competition on tree growth. We built three models with three time windows in order to assess the impact of the variables previously mentioned over three different time periods of the trees’ lifespan. The time windows were 1900-2019, 1970-2019, 2015-2019. The results showed a divergence in the growth of vital and unvital trees starting from the 1970s, with a strong decrease of the basal area increment for unvital trees in the last five decades. The growth of both vital and unvital trees responded negatively to summer drought. This result was also reflected in the superposed epoch analysis, which showed a strong decrease in growth in the past extreme drought years. Both vital and unvital trees were generally more resistant and had a stronger recovery during past extreme drought years. Tree resilience showed a declining trend, in particular for unvital trees. Finally, the models showed that tree vitality, drought and competition have all had a strong and significant effect on tree growth. The results highlighted a high sensitivity of beech trees to drought and climatic water stress that may impact future growth rate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000582823",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/582823","en","ETH Zurich, Department of Environmental Systems Science","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Impact of drought on the growth of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.): A case study in the canton of Basel-Landschaft, Switzerland","Master Thesis","Open access",,,"2022-11-24T09:19:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To better understand these relationships at a regional scale, we used nearly 800 observation years from 271 permanent long‐term forest monitoring plots across Switzerland, obtained between 1980 and 2017. We assimilated these data into the 3‐PG forest ecosystem model using Bayesian inference, reducing the bias of model predictions from 14% to 5% for forest stem carbon stocks and from 45% to 9% for stem carbon stock changes. We then estimated the productivity of forests dominated by Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica for the period of 1960–2018, and tested for productivity shifts in response to climate along elevational gradient and in extreme years. Simulated net primary productivity (NPP) decreased with elevation (2.86 ± 0.006 Mg C ha−1 year−1 km−1 for P. abies and 0.93 ± 0.010 Mg C ha−1 year−1 km−1 for F. sylvatica). During warm–dry extremes, simulated NPP for both species increased at higher and decreased at lower elevations, with reductions in NPP of more than 25% for up to 21% of the potential species distribution range in Switzerland. Reduced plant water availability had a stronger effect on NPP than temperature during warm‐dry extremes. Importantly, cold–dry extremes had negative impacts on regional forest NPP comparable to warm–dry extremes. Overall, our calibrated model suggests that the response of forest productivity to climate extremes is more complex than simple shift toward higher elevation. Such robust estimates of NPP are key for increasing our understanding of forests ecosystems carbon dynamics under climate extremes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000401681",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15011","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/401681","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bayesian inference||Carbon cycling||Data assimilation||Drought||Ecosystem productivity||Extreme events||Fagus sylvatica||Inverse modeling||Model calibration||Picea abies","Assessing the response of forest productivity to climate extremes in Switzerland using model–data fusion","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-02-25T15:56:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,"ICOS-CH Phase 2","173691","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,,"85079726198",,,"000513927400001","Glob.

Here we explored the resource allocation strategies of the farmers of the Karbi tribe in Northeast India, who practice a traditional shifting cultivation system called jhum. Through a participatory modelling framework, we co-developed a role-playing game of the local farming system. In the game, farmers allocated labour and cash to meet household needs, while also investing in new opportunities like bamboo, rubber and tea, or the chance to improve their living standards. Farmers did embrace new options where investment costs, especially monetary investments, are low. Returns on these investments were not automatically re-invested in further long-term, more expensive and promising opportunities. Instead, most of the money is spend on improving household living standards, particularly the next generation’s education. The landscape changed profoundly based on the farmers’ strategies. Natural ecological succession was replaced by an improved fallow of marketable bamboo species. Plantations of tea and rubber became more prevalent as time progressed while old practices ensuring food security were not yet given up.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000409325",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su12062438","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/409325","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Karbi Anglong (India)||jhum||landscape change||socio-ecological system||role-playing games||companion modelling","Exploring livelihood strategies of shifting cultivation farmers in assam through games","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-04-14T01:36:33Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85082863462",,,"000523751400285",,"6","Sustainability","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Plants protect themselves against herbivore attacks with physical traits and toxic secondary metabolites. Levels of plant defences and herbivore performance might shift under climate warming, particularly in alpine habitats, where herbivore pressure is currently low. Plant responses to warming should be driven by species-specific shifts in physical and chemical defence traits.  2. We investigated the association between plant leaf physical and chemical traits and herbivory under current and warmer climates in three grasslands along a subalpine to alpine gradient. Specifically, we measured the rate of in situ natural herbivory, and performed bioassays to measure overall plant species-level resistance using the extreme generalist non-native caterpillar Spodoptera littoralis. We simulated warmer conditions by using open-top chambers and assessed the effect of warming on leaf physical and chemical traits, and how trait changes affect caterpillar performance.  3. Natural herbivory and caterpillar performance were associated with plant physical traits, including specific leaf area, and with ordination axes representing dimensions of the plant chemical profile. We found that the warming treatment independently decreased the number of distinct chemical compounds per species, and marginally increased specific leaf area. Changes in leaf functional traits were not systematically associated with changes in caterpillar performance.  4. Synthesis. Plant physical traits and chemical profiles are both related to natural herbivory and plant resistance against Spodoptera littoralis. While leaf physical and chemical traits of high elevation plants were modified by the warming treatment, these changes did not result in predictable effects on plant resistance against herbivores.",,,,"0022-0477",,"10.1111/1365-2745.13286","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/371718","en","Wiley",,,"Climate change||Functional traits||Herbivore||Liquid chromatography||Metabolomics||Open-top chamber||Phylogenetic signal||Plant-herbivore interactions","Plant physical and chemical traits associated with herbivory in situ and under a warming treatment","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2019-10-19T14:44:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Lif3web: The present and future spatial structure of tri-trophic networks","162604","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85073925950",,,"000489452600001","J.

Most adult populations in the Seychelles exhibit biased sex ratios, but it is unknown whether this is due to different proportions of male and female plants being produced or to differential mortality. In this study, we developed sex-linked markers in Lodoicea using ddRAD sequencing, enabling us to reliably determine the gender of immature individuals. We screened 589 immature individuals to explore sex ratios across life stages in Lodoicea. The two sex-specific markers resulted in the amplification of male-specific bands (Lm123977 at 405 bp and Lm435135 at 130 bp). Our study of four sub-populations of Lodoicea on the islands of Praslin and Curieuse revealed that the two sexes were produced in approximately equal numbers, with no significant deviation from a 1:1 ratio before the adult stage. We conclude that sex in Lodoicea is genetically determined, suggesting that Lodoicea has a chromosomal sex determination system in which males are the heterogametic sex (XY) and females are homogametic (XX). We discuss the potential causes for observed biased sex ratios in adult populations, and the implications of our results for the life history, ecology and conservation management of Lodoicea.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000407051",,"2041-2851",,"10.1093/aobpla/plz079","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/407051","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Borasseae||Conservation management||ddRAD sequencing||Dioecy||Lodoicea maldivica||Palm||Reproductive ecology||Sex-linked markers||Sex ratios||Seychelles Islands","Identification of sex-linked markers in the sexually cryptic coco de mer: are males and females produced in equal proportions?","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-03-28T10:31:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85096579107",,,"000519580100008",,"1","AoB Plants","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous studies have determined concentration-discharge (cQ) relationships from long-term, low-frequency data of a wide range of solutes. These analyses, however, provide little insight into the coupling of solute concentrations and flow during individual hydrologic events. Event-scale cQ relationships have rarely been investigated across a wide range of solutes and over extended periods of time, and thus little is known about differences and similarities between event-scale and long-term cQ relationships. Differences between event-scale and long-term cQ behavior may provide useful information about the processes regulating their transport through the landscape.  Here we analyze cQ relationships of 14 different solutes, ranging from major ions to trace metals, as well as electrical conductivity, in the Swiss Erlenbach catchment. From a 2-year time series of sub-hourly solute concentration data we determined long-term cQ relationships for each solute and compared them to cQ relationships of 30 individual events. The long-term cQ behavior of groundwater-sourced solutes was representative of their cQ behavior during hydrologic events. Other solutes, however, exhibited very different cQ patterns at the event and long-term scale. This was particularly true for trace metals as well as atmospheric and/or biologically active solutes, many of which exhibited highly variable cQ behavior from one event to the next. Most of this inter-event variability in cQ behavior can be explained by factors such as catchment wetness, season, event size, input concentrations, and event-water contributions. We present an overview of the processes regulating different groups of solutes, depending on their origin in and pathways through the catchment. Our analysis thus provides insight into controls on solute variations at the hydrologic event scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000391358",,"1812-2116||1812-2108",,"10.5194/hess-2019-684","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/391358","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Concentration-discharge relationships vary among hydrological events, reflecting differences in event characteristics","Working Paper","Open access",,,"2020-01-17T09:25:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hydrol. earth syst. sci.",,"Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Seawater intrusion is particularly likely where water tables lie below sea level, but can also arise from groundwater pumping in some coastal aquifers with water tables above sea level. Nevertheless, no nation-wide, observation-based assessment of the scope of potential seawater intrusion exists. Here we compile and analyze ~250,000 coastal groundwater-level observations made since the year 2000 in the contiguous United States. We show that the majority of observed groundwater levels lie below sea level along more than 15% of the contiguous coastline. We conclude that landward hydraulic gradients characterize a substantial fraction of the East Coast (>18%) and Gulf Coast (>17%), and also parts of the West Coast where groundwater pumping is high. Sea level rise, coastal land subsidence, and increasing water demands will exacerbate the threat of seawater intrusion.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000424143",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-020-17038-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424143","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Groundwater level observations in 250,000 coastal US wells reveal scope of potential seawater intrusion","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-07-02T02:52:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85086848661",,,"000544946300011","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Farmers cut and burn a patch of forest, and use it to grow food crops to meet family needs. After one or two years, crop yields decline and the field is abandoned. Forest is allowed to re-emerge while the farmer clears his next field. When population numbers increase, less forest remains available, shortening the time between each production phase. Shortening fallow cycles are a global concern, and seen as a major cause of forest degradation. However, farmers also choose to abandon the practise, replacing it with annual crop production or plantation crops like rubber or oil palm when these options become available to them. This development has even bigger negative environmental consequences, but often also improves the household income level of the farmers.  The Karbi farmers of the Karbi Anglong district in Northeast India use shifting cultivation to grow upland rice, vegetables and a range of cash crops, like ginger and chili. This traditional practise is still common, especially amongst the farmers living on the forested hillsides of Karbi Anglong. Kaziranga National Park is situated right next to these hills, and depends on the hills for its ecosystem functioning.  If the Karbi farmers decide to change their practices and alter the landscape, it could have serious consequences for the conservation effort of the government.    This thesis aims to explore the past, the present state and plausible futures of a shifting cultivation system that has not yet been subject to major change, but is exposed to the drivers of landscape transition identified in the literature.

Sie sollen eine Vorbildfunktion übernehmen, indem sie aufzeigen, was und wie sie auf lokaler Ebene zur Erreichung der globalen Ziele Nachhaltiger Entwicklung beitragen. Bisher fehlen jedoch Hinweise, zu welchen SDG mit ihren 169 Unterzielen Biosphärenreservate (BR) überhaupt beitragen können und sollen. Ebenso stellt sich die Frage, ob die SDG wirklich einen sinnvollen Zielrahmen für BR hergeben. Diese Unklarheiten waren Ausgangslage für ein Projekt in der UNESCO Biosphäre Entlebuch. Darin wurden im Rahmen kriterienbasierter Experteneinschätzungen alle 169 SDG-Unterziele dahingehend beurteilt, inwieweit diese für BR in Westeuropa allgemein und speziell für das BR Entlebuch relevant sind, ob die relevanten Unterziele mit Maßnahmen schon abgedeckt sind und ob Anpassungsbedarf bei den Zielen und Maßnahmen besteht. Die Ergebnisse sind vielfältig: Zwei Drittel der 169 SDG-Unterziele haben für BR keine oder eine nur geringe Bedeutung, und auf nur einen Drittel können BR direkt einwirken; indirect (z.B. über Kooperationen mit anderen Akteuren oder Ausbildung) haben sie jedoch bei gewissen Unterzielen weitere Einflussmöglichkeiten. Am Beispiel des BR Entlebuch zeigte sich, dass es noch weniger Unterziele sind, die in der praktischen Umsetzung eines BR eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Aus den Resultaten lässt sich folgern, dass sich die 169 SDG-Unterziele nicht als einziger Zielrahmen für BR eignen. Die allgemein formulierten 17 SDG können hingegen gut als Orientierungsrahmen für BR dienen. Sie erlauben es, eine globale Perspektive auf lokaler Ebene einzubringen und dazu beizutragen, den Zielrahmen wie auch die Maßnahmen eines BR kritisch zu beurteilen.",,,"978-3-662-60706-0||978-3-662-60707-7",,,"10.1007/978-3-662-60707-7_18","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453585","de","Springer Spektrum",,,,"Welchen Beitrag kann ein Biosphere Reserve zur Umsetzung der SDG leisten?

Fires can have large consequences for the provisioning of ecosystem services and for human well-being. Therefore, understanding the drivers of fire occurrence and improving the predictive capability of fire occurrence models is of utmost importance. So far, most studies have focused on individual regions with rather low spatial resolution, and have lacked the ability to apply the models in different regions. Here, a species distribution modelling approach (Maxent) was used to model fire occurrence in four regions across the Mediterranean Basin and the Alps using several environmental variables at two spatial resolutions. Additionally, a cross-regional model was developed and spatial transferability tested. Most models showed good performance, with fine resolution models always featuring somewhat higher performance than coarse resolution models. When transferred across regions, the performance of regional models was good only under similar environmental conditions. The cross-regional model showed a higher performance than the regional models in the transfer tests. The results suggest that a cross-regional approach is most robust when aiming to use fire occurrence models at the regional scale but beyond current environmental conditions, for example in scenario analyses of the impacts of climate change. © 2020 IAWF.",,,,"1049-8001||1448-5516",,"10.1071/WF19158","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438569","en","CSIRO",,,"Fire ignition||Grain size||Maxent||Spatial resolution||Species distribution model","Cross-regional modelling of fire occurrence in the Alps and the Mediterranean Basin","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-09-04T20:02:02Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85083172645",,,"000560709400007",,"8","International Journal of Wildland Fire","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Most trees face several drought events during their life and therefore resilience to dry conditions may be crucial to long-term survival. We assessed how growth resilience to severe droughts, including its components resistance and recovery, is related to the ability to survive future droughts by using a tree-ring database of surviving and now-dead trees from 118 sites (22 species, >3,500 trees). We found that, across the variety of regions and species sampled, trees that died during water shortages were less resilient to previous non-lethal droughts, relative to coexisting surviving trees of the same species. In angiosperms, drought-related mortality risk is associated with lower resistance (low capacity to reduce impact of the initial drought), while it is related to reduced recovery (low capacity to attain pre-drought growth rates) in gymnosperms. The different resilience strategies in these two taxonomic groups open new avenues to improve our understanding and prediction of drought-induced mortality.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000394905",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-020-14300-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/394905","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Low growth resilience to drought is related to future mortality risk in trees","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-28T12:42:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85078481366",,,"000563505800006","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In der vorliegenden Masterarbeit wurde das Wachstum bestehender Edelkastanien-Waldvorkommen auf der Schweizer Alpennordseite untersucht. Es wurden Einflussfaktoren auf das Wachstum der Edelkastanie gesucht und daraus waldbauliche Handlungsmöglichkeiten zur Qualitätsholzproduktion abgeleitet.  Die Untersuchung wurde in 4 Regionen auf jeweils 3-4 Untersuchungsflächen mit unterschiedlichen Standortsfaktoren durchgeführt (total 82 Probebäume). Für jeden Probebaum wurden verschiedene baum- und standortsspezifische Merkmale erhoben sowie ein Bohrkern entnommen. Es wurden Wachstumskurven des Brusthöhendurchmessers (BHD) berechnet und eine Höhenwachstumsabschätzung durchgeführt, um das Wachstum zwischen den Untersuchungsflächen zu vergleichen. Um Einflussfaktoren auf das Wachstum zu finden, wurden der BHD und der laufende Radialzuwachs mit linear mixed-effects models modelliert. Zudem wurden für die Untersuchungsflächen Klima-Wachstumsbeziehungen mit response functions berechnet. Weiter wurde nach sonstigen Zusammenhängen und Korrelationen der Wachstumsmerkmale gesucht.   Die BHD-Wachstumskurven bestätigen das starke Jugendwachstum und die frühe Kulmination des Zuwachses der Edelkastanie. Auf den meisten Untersuchungsflächen wurden die waldbaulichen Zielwerte (BHD 40 cm im Alter 40 Jahre und BHD 60 cm im Alter 60 Jahre) erreicht. Die Edelkastanie hat im Alter 50 meist eine höhere Bonität als die dominierende Hauptbaumart. Aus den Ergebnissen des BHD-Modells kann gefolgert werden, dass für einen hohen BHD im Alter 60 tiefgründige sandig-lehmige Böden einen positiven Einfluss haben. Das Zuwachs-Modell zeigt, dass Probebäume mit einer hohen relativen Kronenlänge einen höheren Zuwachs haben. Dieser Zusammenhang trifft wahrscheinlich im jungen Alter verstärkt zu. Die Ergebnisse der Klima-Wachstumsbeziehungen zeigen, dass zwischen dem Sommerniederschlag und der Jahrringbreite ein positiver Zusammenhang besteht. Für das Wachstum der Edelkastanie ist eine ausreichende Wasserversorgung entweder durch die Speicherkapazität der Böden oder durch den Niederschlag wichtig. Die Konkurrenzverhältnisse und die damit verbundenen Kronendimensionen sind für das Wachstum, aber auch für die Stammqualität entscheidend. Eine starke Konkurrenz zur Erziehung der Edelkastanie ist im jungen Alter wichtig. Ab einem Alter von 20-30 Jahren braucht die Edelkastanie Platz zur lateralen Kronenausbreitung.  Aus den Ergebnissen der vorliegenden Masterarbeit kann gefolgert werden, dass die Untersuchungsflächen grundsätzlich geeignete Edelkastanien-Standorte darstellen. Dennoch unterscheiden sich die Wachstumsvorgänge der Edelkastanie je nach Standort, und es sind dementsprechend andere waldbauliche Eingriffe zielführend.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460730",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460730","de","ETH Zürich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Das Wachstum der Edelkastanie (Castanea sativa Mill.) auf Waldstandorten der Schweizer Alpennordseite","Master Thesis","Open access",,,"2021-01-08T14:35:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Understanding natural dynamics of broadleaf-dominated temperate rainforests is essential for their conservation and management. Here, we investigate for the first time the structure, natural disturbance, and recruitment dynamics of a mixed Colchic old-growth rainforest, dominated by Fagus orientalis and Picea orientalis. We used forest inventories and dendrochronological analysis of tree growth in five 30-m-radius plots to quantify forest structure, growth, and disturbances. For the last 400 years, the forest experienced a mixed disturbance regime dominated by frequent small gaps superimposed onto medium disturbances with about a 25-year recurrence period, with no evidences of stand-replacing disturbances. This disturbance regime favored the dominance of shade-tolerant, late successional species with slow tree canopy access through multiple growth releases. These dynamics impose low growth rates and continuous recruitment of spruce and beech, and contributed to a high heterogeneity of tree ages and sizes that result in stable forest structure, as suggested by the low stand slenderness. Spruces were the oldest (up to 427 years) and fastest growing trees in the forest, suggesting that their low presence in the forest is due to low disturbance rates that limit their recruitment. Spring climate conditions that promoted beech growth were detrimental for spruce growth, suggesting that interspecies interactions may condition the effect of climate on forest growth and development. The dynamic equilibrium state we reconstructed in this old-growth forest could likely be disrupted by anthropogenic disturbances or management. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,,,"1432-9840||1435-0629",,"10.1007/s10021-019-00462-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/380447","en","Springer",,,"Disturbance||Forest dynamics||Dendroecology||mixed forest||Old-growth forest||Recruitment||Growth||Stability","Disturbances and Climate Drive Structure, Stability, and Growth in Mixed Temperate Old-growth Rainforests in the Caucasus","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2019-11-26T07:56:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85076229662",,,"000569248700004",,,"Ecosystems","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It plays a key role in the food and income security as well as the cultural identity of millions of people. Together with habitat fragmentation and loss, however, hunting has been identified as a major driver of biodiversity loss with cascading effects on entire ecosystems. The decline in wildlife poses a dual challenge for both forests and the people whose livelihoods depend on them. In the Amazon basin, most rural and Indigenous communities rely on wildmeat consumption and commercialization for their sustenance. Although cultural identities and Indigenous rights over land and political autonomy are increasingly acknowledged, centralized approaches that alienate local resource users are still prevalent. Hunters are subjected to ambiguous law enforcement that disregard local interests and necessities and that often portrays them as criminals. The stigmatization of hunters and their practices hampers our ability to understand what drives their decisions and strategies. This ultimately risks jeopardizing people’ livelihoods while hindering the development of sustainable wildlife management practices. The current global biodiversity crisis and coronavirus pandemics are likely to further undermine Indigenous hunting habits by reinforcing the general negative perceptions. The aim of this thesis is to go beyond the status quo and provide a deeper understanding of hunters’ strategies, their drivers, and their adaptive capabilities in the face of uncertain futures. To simultaneously embrace the complex nature of the hunting socio-ecological system and its exogenous and endogenous drivers, I used a participatory modelling approach and examine the system through three different entry points. After a general introduction (chapter 1), in chapter 2 I examined hunters’ strategic response to socio-economic changes. Providing hunters with alternative sources of protein and income can decrease overall hunting effort but might focus it on smaller, more vulnerable areas. On the other hand, legalizing trade might encourage hunters to harvest wildlife for commercial purposes, aggravating the impact on the wildlife, unless competition and taxation come into play. In chapter 3 I looked at the factors motivating people to break the rules and enter protected areas. To achieve voluntary compliance, communication between different sets of stakeholders as well as a resource-abundant landscape are key. Past violations of the protected area and resources’ abundance within its borders can further encourage transgression. Transgression is a multi-dimensional concept. Relying on enforcement to achieve compliance can be both ineffective and counterproductive. In chapter 4 I moved to the ecological dimension of hunting and to the need of closing the gap between modelers and the decision-makers to whom our models are directed. In this method-focused chapter, I outlined the process of building an agent-based model on animal population dynamics while enhancing the participation of the local stakeholders. The overarching aim is to illustrate how to build a tool that hunters will be able to use to negotiate wildlife management strategies and their implications. Finally, in chapter 5, I bring all these dimensions back together and I provide an outlook on the current global stance on hunting.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456891",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456891","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","HUNTING AND NATURE CONSERVATION||Natural resource use||Decision making||Participatory modeling||Indigenous communities","Hunters, poachers, stewards.

So far, however, only few studies have focused on the mortality of tree regeneration. Thus, more research is needed in this context to better understand the underlying ecological processes and predict more reliably how forest ecosystems will respond to ongoing climate change. As the current and future changes are expected to either favor or impair the growth and survival of large trees, it is pivotal to investigate the effects on the next generation, i.e. young and small trees. A better understanding of tree regeneration allows to extend or adapt the findings from the already well-studied adult, large trees to small-sized trees, for which sparse empirical data are available. Particularly relevant questions relate to the drivers of survival probabilities and of horizontal spatial patterns (i.e. the distribution in space) of tree regeneration.   The aims of this PhD thesis therefore were (i) to improve the understanding of natural mortality processes of tree regeneration at different developmental stages and spatio-temporal scales, (ii) to investigate the effect of various abiotic and biotic factors on the mortality of tree regeneration, and (iii) to study the relationship between mortality, growth and site conditions. For this purpose, I assessed 1) the effect of emergence time, height and number of leaves of seedlings, light availability, temperature, precipitation, seedbed and microsite conditions on the survival time of seedlings; 2) the effect of light availability on the growth of saplings and its relationship with mortality; and 3) the effect of topography and of large neighboring trees on the spatial pattern of living and dead small trees. These effects were investigated for small-sized trees (diameter at breast height < 10 cm) of both conifer and deciduous species at several study sites in Switzerland across elevational gradients that represent distinct climate regimes and growth conditions.  In Chapter 1, I studied the effects of emergence time on the mortality of seedlings. The underlying rationale was that global warming is expected to advance the timing of germination, leading the seedlings to potentially experience more severe damage and mortality due to late frost events in spring. Thus, I monitored the emergence, characteristics, and survival of seedlings across ten tree species in temperate mixed deciduous forests around Zurich (Switzerland) over one and a half years. For each seedling, I recorded characteristics such as height, number of cotyledons and euphylls, cause and severity of possible damages, and extent of missing foliar tissue due to herbivory. Moreover, I documented the seedbed type of each seedling and that of the microsite at the plot level. For each plot, I also determined light availability using hemispherical canopy photographs, logged the temperature curve, and measured soil moisture. Based on the empirical data, I conducted a survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival curves and Cox’s proportional hazards model to assess the effects of the explanatory variables on survival time. I tested whether the timing of emergence represents a trade‐off for seedling survival between minimizing frost risk and maximizing the length of the growing period. Seedlings that emerged early faced a severe late frost event. Nevertheless, they benefited from the overall longer growing period, resulting in increased overall survival. Larger seedling height and higher number of leaves positively influenced survival. Seedlings growing on moss had higher survival compared to those growing on mineral soil, litter, or in herbaceous vegetation. Since almost two‐thirds of the monitored seedlings died during the first growing season and early-emerging seedlings were more likely to survive, this chapter highlights how the first months of life together with an early emergence time of seedlings are decisive for successful tree regeneration, which will ultimately have an impact on the future development of forest stands.  In Chapter 2, I investigated whether radial and vertical growth rates are suitable indicators of impending mortality in young trees, as previous research on adult, large trees had suggested, and whether light availability and tree size have an influence on mortality probability. Thus, I sampled an equal number of living and dead saplings of four conifer species (Swiss stone pine, European larch, Norway spruce and silver fir) in nine mountain forests along an elevational gradient of the Swiss Alps. I performed a tree-ring analysis, calculated both radial and vertical growth rates and compared them between living and dead saplings based on tree-ring widths reconstructed from stem disks at multiple tree heights. I observed a divergent pattern in radial growth of living and dead saplings, with reduced growth of dead saplings starting several years prior to death, which emphasizes the importance of long-term predisposing factors for tree mortality. Then, I quantified the combined effects of light availability, growth and tree size on mortality, using species- and site-specific conditional logistic regression models, by previously matching living and dead saplings of similar ages. Light availability influenced positively the survival probabilities of conifer saplings in mountain forests, although the positive effect decreased with increasing elevation. Recent radial growth rate and diameter had only minor effects on sapling mortality. By highlighting the importance of long-term predisposing factors for the mortality of conifer saplings in mountain forests, this chapter extends well-established findings of the adult stage to the so far little investigated sapling stage.   In Chapter 3, I analyzed the horizontal spatial patterns of small living and dead Norway spruce trees in two subalpine forest reserves of Switzerland, Scatlè and Bödmerenwald, by nearest neighbor-based and distance-based analyses. I accounted for spatial inhomogeneity by investigating how the local densities of living and dead small trees depend on environmental covariates. I found that the local density of living and dead small trees is influenced by latitude, elevation and aspect. Yet, the influence of these covariates varied between the two forest reserves due to their different topography and peculiar site conditions. Then, I considered neighborhood interactions between trees based on the vicinity and size of trees, by analyzing how small trees are influenced by large neighboring trees over a range of spatial scales. Both tree vicinity and size were important for the spatial patterns of small trees in both reserves. Small living trees showed a random pattern around large dead trees over a range of distances and, at certain distances in one reserve, even dispersion. Small living trees further showed clustering around large living trees at short distances and dispersion at large distances. Small dead trees featured mainly a random pattern, even though with a tendency to cluster at short distances around large neighbors, irrespective of whether these were living or dead. Yet, the fading of clustering with increasing distance indicates that the influence of large trees on small trees varies with the distance and thus that the neighborhood interactions between trees are scale-dependent. I further found that the influence of large neighboring trees on small trees varied with topography, revealing a relationship between spatial inhomogeneity and neighborhood interactions, as I expected due to the strongly different tree sizes and environmental gradients in mountain forests. Overall, this chapter emphasizes the importance of considering both spatial inhomogeneity and neighborhood interactions when investigating the spatial ecology of mortality of small-sized trees in uneven-aged and unmanaged mountain forests.  Throughout this PhD thesis, I extended well-established ecological findings from the adult, large trees to the regeneration stage of trees, which is an important bottleneck of forest dynamics. The empirical findings of my PhD thesis represent a considerable contribution towards a better understanding of the temporal and spatial patterns of mortality in tree regeneration as well as of the relationship between mortality, growth and site conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000464450",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/464450","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","forest ecology||forest dynamics||mountain forest||tree regeneration||tree mortality||seed germination||seedling emergence||Acer||Fagus||Picea||survival time||frost||light availability||canopy gap size||nearest neighbor distance||inhomogeneous marked point pattern analysis||spatial inhomogeneity||Ripley's inhomogeneous bivariate function||neighborhood interaction||reduced tree growth||early life stage||hemispherical photography||tree-ring width||Switzerland||climate change","Temporal and spatial mortality patterns of tree regeneration: the relationship between mortality, growth and site conditions in Swiss forests","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences","2021-01-21T10:35:09Z","2022-01-21",,,"yes",,,,"Advanced Tree MOrtality MOdeling (ATMO^2)","163250","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften","27284",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Incision thresholds affect the topography of landscapes and their scaling properties and can introduce nonlinear relations between climate and erosion with notable implications for long-term landscape evolution. Despite their potential importance, incision thresholds are often omitted from the incision terms of landscape evolution models (LEMs) to simplify analyses. Here, we present theoretical and numerical results from a dimensional analysis of an LEM that includes terms for threshold-limited stream-power incision, linear diffusion, and uplift. The LEM is parameterized by four parameters (incision coefficient and incision threshold, diffusion coefficient, and uplift rate). The LEM's governing equation can be greatly simplified by recasting it in a dimensionless form that depends on only one dimensionless parameter, the incision-threshold number Nθ. This dimensionless parameter is defined in terms of the incision threshold, the incision coefficient, and the uplift rate, and it quantifies the reduction in the rate of incision due to the incision threshold relative to the uplift rate. Being the only parameter in the dimensionless governing equation, Nθ is the only parameter controlling the evolution of landscapes in this LEM. Thus, landscapes with the same Nθ will evolve geometrically similarly, provided that their boundary and initial conditions are normalized according to appropriate scaling relationships, as we demonstrate using a numerical experiment. In contrast, landscapes with different Nθ values will be influenced to different degrees by their incision thresholds. Using results from a second set of numerical simulations, each with a different incision-threshold number, we qualitatively illustrate how the value of Nθ influences the topography, and we show that relief scales with the quantity Nθ+1 (except where the incision threshold reduces the rate of incision to zero).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000421267",,"2196-632X||2196-6311",,"10.5194/esurf-8-505-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/421267","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Dimensional analysis of a landscape evolution model with incision threshold","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-19T09:36:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85086341049",,,"000538548400001","Earth Surf.

I studied an LEM with terms of stream-power incision, linear diffusion, and uniform uplift, parameterized by an incision coefficient K, a diffusion coefficient D, and an uplift rate U, respectively. I also examined a version of the LEM that included an incision threshold θ. This model is mostly applicable to soil-mantled landscapes with gentle slopes, and it can reproduce salient features of fluvial landscapes such as ridge-and-valley topography and dendritic valley networks.       The dimensional analysis of the LEM used characteristic scales that were defined in a novel way, based on the combination of two main premises. First, lengths and heights were assumed to be dimensionally distinct; thus, the LEM was assumed to have three fundamental dimensions, namely, length L, height H, and time T. Second, I defined the corresponding characteristic scales of length, height, and time (lc, hc, and tc) solely in terms of model parameters, not in terms of extrinsic properties of landscapes, such as the domain size or the total relief.       Non-dimensionalizing the LEM with the three parameter-dependent characteristic scales removes three parameter-related degrees of freedom. Thus, in the version of the LEM without incision threshold, which includes three parameters, I obtained a dimensionless governing equation without any parameters. In the LEM version with an incision threshold, I eliminated three out of four parameter-related degrees of freedom and, thus, obtained a dimensionless equation with one parameter. This dimensionless parameter quantifies the importance of the incision threshold θ relative to the incision coefficient K and the uplift rate U, and I termed it the incision-threshold number Nθ.       The dimensionless governing equation without incision threshold has only one solution for any given combination of boundary and initial conditions, because it has no parameters to be adjusted. For the dimensional space, this implies that if we rescale simulation domains, initial conditions, and time steps by the characteristic scales of lc, hc, and tc, respectively, then we can obtain solutions that evolve geometrically and temporally similarly regardless of the values of their parameters. Thus, we can explore the entire parameter space of the LEM with a single simulation per set of boundary and initial conditions, incurring significant savings of computational resources.        The similarity of landscapes implies that, for two landscapes with different parameters, all corresponding distances, elevation differences, and durations will scale with lc, hc, and tc, respectively. Likewise, any landscape metric whose dimensions combine L, H, and T will scale with a corresponding combination of lc, hc, and tc. Based on this fact, we can use the definitions of characteristic scales, which depend only on model parameters, to straightforwardly deduce scaling relations between landscape metrics and the LEM parameters K, D, and U. These relations can be used to verify theoretical results and to test whether numerical results are influenced by boundary or resolution effects.       The dimensionless form of the LEM with incision threshold includes one parameter, the incision-threshold number Nθ. Therefore, the four-dimensional space of the parameters K, D, U, and θ collapses to the one-dimensional parameter space of Nθ, and simulations with equal Nθ values can evolve similarly if they are rescaled by lc, hc, and tc. This also leads to computational savings.       To interpret the characteristic height hc, I defined diffusion- and incision-specific height scales that quantify how the strength of these processes varies within a landscape. Specifically, these height scales give the total elevation change due to each process during one unit of characteristic time tc. I found that these height scales are equal to hc at special landscape points, specifically, at drainage divides and at hillslope–valley transitions. Furthermore, using these height scales, I derived a steady-state relationship between curvature and the steepness index. This relationship plots as a straight line, whose slope and intercepts depend on the characteristic length and height lc and hc, and can be viewed as a counterpart of the slope–area relationship for the case of landscapes that include diffusion. The curvature–steepness-index relationship is a quantitative prediction that one could use to test whether a landscape follows the incision¬–diffusion LEM and to estimate the values of lc and hc. Furthermore, the response of topography to changes in the values of LEM parameters can be visually expressed as simple shifts and rotations of the curvature–steepness-index line.       To interpret the characteristic scales of length and time lc and tc, I examined the competition between advective and diffusive propagation of elevation perturbation. I found that lc and tc characterize points where these two modes of propagation are equally strong. To quantify the relative strength of advection versus diffusion, I used a Péclet number with a modified definition that can account for the scaling of basin length with basin area and, thus, for the convergence or divergence of topography.       These interpretations of lc, hc, and tc remain valid when an incision threshold θ is included in the LEM. However, the curvature–steepness-index relationship and the Péclet number definition, which were used to derive these interpretations, need to be modified and to include the incision-threshold number Nθ. Consequently, an interpretation of Nθ is that it quantifies the effect of the incision threshold on the competition between processes.       The incision-threshold number Nθ characterizes a landscape as a whole and can be used to compare the relative importance of the incision threshold θ in different landscapes. Within a given landscape, however, the relative influence of θ varies. I found that this influence can be quantified by the dimensionless ratio of θ to the steepness index, which I termed the fractional reduction in the rate of incision. I found that this dimensionless quantity can also quantify how the influence of the incision threshold on the Péclet number varies across points in a given landscape. Furthermore, plots of this quantity can be used together with curvature–steepness-index lines to visualize the effects of θ on landscapes.       The results of this work show that the characteristic scales lc, hc, and tc, along with the incision-threshold number Nθ for the case that includes an incision threshold, are fundamental properties of landscapes that follow the LEM and shed light on topographic and scaling properties of these landscapes. I expect that additional properties of such landscapes can be examined using Nθ and the characteristic scales lc, hc, and tc. Furthermore, studies of landscapes that follow other LEMs might benefit from the results of this work by adopting the way in which I defined and interpreted characteristic scales and dimensionless numbers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474710",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474710","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","dimensional analysis||scaling||Landscape evolution model||valley dissection","Exploring topographic and scaling properties of landscapes by dimensionally analyzing stream-power incision and linear diffusion landscape evolution models","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2021-03-15T22:04:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"26966",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Extreme Ereignisse wie Stürme, Überschwemmungen, Trocken- und Hitzeperioden haben direkte Auswirkungen auf unsere Lebenswelt und unseren Alltag. Weniger offensichtlich aber von grosser Tragweite sind die Einflüsse, die der Klimawandel auf die Jahreszeiten ausübt. Die Verschiebung von Blüh- und Ernteterminen, der Rückgang von Schneetagen in höheren Lagen und gar das Ausbleiben von Winterschnee im Mittelland zeigt vor allem mit Blick über mehrere Jahre und Jahrzehnte die gravierenden Folgen für die Umwelt aber auch für Landwirtschaft, Tourismus und Raumplanung. In phänologischen Beobachtungen – breit gefasst definiert als jahreszeitlich wiederkehrende Erscheinungsformen in der Umwelt – lassen sich sinnlich und alltäglich die Veränderungen erfahren, die der Klimawandel mit sich bringt. Darüber hinaus bilden die Überlieferungen dieser Beobachtungen von Generation zu Generation wichtige Brücken in Familiengeschichten und wichtigen Ortsbeschreibungen. Vor allem aber bringen uns die Beobachtungen näher, wie eng Mensch und Natur schon immer verbunden waren. Am Geographischen Institut der Universität Bern hat phänologische Forschung eine lange Tradition. Was in den späten 1960er-Jahren als Beobachtungsnetz und Datengrundlage für die Raum- und Agrareignungsplanung begann, mündete 1970 in die erste komplette Saison des Beobachtungsprogramms BernClim und bildet heute zusammen mit dem Datenschatz des Schweizer Phänologie Beobachtungsnetzes von MeteoSchweiz das Rückgrat für raum-zeitliche Beschreibungen seit Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts. Beobachtungen seit dem Spätmittelalter bieten darüber hinaus die einmalige Möglichkeit, auch langfristige Veränderungen des Klimas zu zeigen. Zum 50-jährigen Bestehen des Beobachtungsprogramms BernClim entstand die vorliegende Broschüre. Über die Aktivitäten in Bern hinaus kommen auch Forschende zu Wort, die sich mit ebenso viel Herzblut und Ausdauer für die phänologischen Beobachtungen und Auswertungen an anderen Institutionen engagieren. Sie forschen mit Pflanzen- und Tierbeobachtungen, im Wald und auf dem Feld und ziehen Schlüsse aus Wetterdaten, Schnee- und Gewässermessungen. Die Grundlage für viele der hier präsentierten Jahreszeiten-Geschichten bilden Beobachtungen, die zum grossen Teil von Freiwilligen und oft über Jahre und Jahrzehnte gemacht wurden. Phänologie ist ohne dieses Engagement nicht möglich und bringt die Herausforderung mit sich, aus vielen individuellen Beobachtungen ein systematisches, grösseres Bild zu zeichnen. Die Publikation dieser Broschüre wurde durch die Sebastiana-Stiftung, das Oeschger-Zentrum für Klimaforschung (OCCR) und die Kommission für Phänologie und Saisonalität (KPS) der Akademie der Naturwissenschaften Schweiz (SCNAT) unterstützt. Gewidmet ist sie allen, die sich dafür einsetzen, das Zusammenspiel zwischen Mensch und Natur aus jahreszeitlicher Perspektive zu dokumentieren und besser zu verstehen.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000457612",,,,"10.4480/GB2020.G97.01","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/457612","de","Geographisches Institut der Universität Bern","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","climate change||seasonality","Klimawandel und Jahreszeiten","Report","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2020-12-21T08:16:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Geographica Bernensia","G97","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To address the lack of quantification and understanding of seasonality in soil respiration of tropical forests in the Congo Basin, soil CO2 fluxes and potential controlling factors were measured annually in two dominant forest types (lowland and montane) of the Congo Basin over 2 years at varying temporal resolution. Soil CO2 fluxes from the Congo Basin resulted in 3.45 ± 1.14 and 3.13 ± 1.22 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1 for lowland and montane forests, respectively. Soil CO2 fluxes in montane forest soils showed a clear seasonality with decreasing flux rates during the dry season. Montane forest soil CO2 fluxes were positively correlated with soil moisture, while CO2 fluxes in the lowland forest were not. Smaller differences of δ13C values of leaf litter, soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil CO2 indicated that SOC in lowland forests is more decomposed than in montane forests, suggesting that respiration is controlled by C availability rather than environmental factors. In general, C in montane forests was more enriched in 13C throughout the whole cascade of carbon intake via photosynthesis, litterfall, SOC, and soil CO2 compared to lowland forests, pointing to a more open system. Even though soil CO2 fluxes are similarly high in lowland and montane forests of the Congo Basin, the drivers of them seem to be different, i.e., soil moisture for montane forest and C availability for lowland forest.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456954",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-17-6207-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456954","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Seasonality, drivers, and isotopic composition of soil CO2 fluxes from tropical forests of the Congo Basin","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-12-17T16:52:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85097591608",,,"000599338300003",,"23","Biogeosciences","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Due to its feedback to large-scale hydrological processes and its impact on atmospheric dynamics, ET is one of the drivers of droughts and heatwaves. Existing land surface models differ substantially, both in their estimates of current ET fluxes and in their projections of how ET will evolve in the future. Any bias in estimated ET fluxes will affect the partitioning between sensible and latent heat and thus alter model predictions of temperature and precipitation. One potential source of bias is the so-called “aggregation bias” that arises whenever nonlinear processes, such as those that regulate ET fluxes, are modeled using averages of heterogeneous inputs. Here we demonstrate a general mathematical approach to quantifying and correcting for this aggregation bias, using the GLEAM land evaporation model as a relatively simple example. We demonstrate that this aggregation bias can lead to substantial overestimates in ET fluxes in a typical large-scale land surface model when sub-grid heterogeneities in land surface properties are averaged out. Using Switzerland as a test case, we examine the scale dependence of this aggregation bias and show that it can lead to an average overestimation of daily ET fluxes by as much as 10 % across the whole country (calculated as the median of the daily bias over the growing season). We show how our approach can be used to identify the dominant drivers of aggregation bias and to estimate sub-grid closure relationships that can correct for aggregation biases in ET estimates, without explicitly representing sub-grid heterogeneities in large-scale land surface models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450412",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-24-5015-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450412","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Averaging over spatiotemporal heterogeneity substantially biases evapotranspiration rates in a mechanistic large-scale land evaporation model","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-10T03:58:50Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85095127389",,,"000586841300001","Hydrol.

We related species richness with the historical (past climate change, mountain uplifting) and ecological variables (climate, topography and vegetation).

These cycles can aid in understanding the mechanisms that couple solar forcing of ET and snowmelt to changes in streamflow. Here we analyze 3 years of 30 min solar flux, sap flow, stream stage, and groundwater level measurements at Sagehen Creek and Independence Creek, two snow-dominated headwater catchments in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. Despite their sharply contrasting geological settings (most of the Independence basin is glacially scoured granodiorite, whereas Sagehen is underlain by hundreds of meters of volcanic and volcaniclastic deposits that host an extensive groundwater aquifer), both streams respond similarly to snowmelt and ET forcing. During snow-free summer periods, daily cycles in solar flux are tightly correlated with variations in sap flow, and with the rates of water level rise and fall in streams and riparian aquifers. During these periods, stream stages and riparian groundwater levels decline during the day and rebound at night. These cycles are reversed during snowmelt, with stream stages and riparian groundwater levels rising during the day in response to snowmelt inputs and falling at night as the riparian aquifer drains.  Streamflow and groundwater maxima and minima (during snowmelt- and ET-dominated periods, respectively) lag the midday peak in solar flux by several hours. A simple conceptual model explains this lag: streamflows depend on riparian aquifer water levels, which integrate snowmelt inputs and ET losses over time, and thus will be phase-shifted relative to the peaks in snowmelt and evapotranspiration rates. Thus, although the lag between solar forcing and water level cycles is often interpreted as a travel-time lag, our analysis shows that it is mostly a dynamical phase lag, at least in small catchments. Furthermore, although daily cycles in streamflow have often been used to estimate ET fluxes, our simple conceptual model demonstrates that this is infeasible unless the response time of the riparian aquifer can be determined.  As the snowmelt season progresses, snowmelt forcing of groundwater and streamflow weakens and evapotranspiration forcing strengthens. The relative dominance of snowmelt vs. ET can be quantified by the diel cycle index, which measures the correlation between the solar flux and the rate of rise or fall in streamflow or groundwater. When the snowpack melts out at an individual location, the local groundwater shifts abruptly from snowmelt-dominated cycles to ET-dominated cycles. Melt-out and the corresponding shift in the diel cycle index occur earlier at lower altitudes and on south-facing slopes, and streamflow integrates these transitions over the drainage network. Thus the diel cycle index in streamflow shifts gradually, beginning when the snowpack melts out near the gauging station and ending, months later, when the snowpack melts out at the top of the basin and the entire drainage network becomes dominated by ET cycles. During this long transition, snowmelt signals generated in the upper basin are gradually overprinted by ET signals generated lower down in the basin.  The gradual springtime transition in the diel cycle index is mirrored in sequences of Landsat images showing the springtime retreat of the snowpack to higher elevations and the corresponding advance of photosynthetic activity across the basin. Trends in the catchment-averaged MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) also correlate closely with the late springtime shift from snowmelt to ET cycles and with the autumn shift back toward snowmelt cycles. Seasonal changes in streamflow cycles therefore reflect catchment-scale shifts in snowpack and vegetation activity that can be seen from Earth orbit. The data and analyses presented here illustrate how streams can act as mirrors of the landscape, integrating physical and ecohydrological signals across their contributing drainage networks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000452319",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-24-5095-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/452319","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The pulse of a montane ecosystem: coupling between daily cycles in solar flux, snowmelt, transpiration, groundwater, and streamflow at Sagehen Creek and Independence Creek, Sierra Nevada, USA","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-22T10:11:41Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85096084823",,,"000589358100001","Hydrol.

Understanding the origins of events like these is important for water resources management. In this work, we provide data illustrating the individual and joint contributions of precipitation and evapotranspiration to low flows in both typical and dry years. To quantify how weather drives low flows, we explore how deviations from mean seasonal climate conditions (i.e., climate anomalies) of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration correlate with the occurrence and magnitude of annual 7 d lowest flows (Qmin) during the warm season (May through November) across 380 Swiss catchments from 2000 through 2018. Most warm-season low flows followed periods of below-average precipitation and above-average potential evapotranspiration, and the lowest low flows resulted from both of these drivers acting together. Low-flow timing was spatially variable across Switzerland in all years, including the driest (2003, 2011, 2015 and 2018). Low flows in these driest years were associated with much longer-lasting climate anomalies than the ≤2 month anomalies which preceded typical warm-season low flows in other years. We found that snow water equivalent and winter precipitation totals only slightly influenced the magnitude and timing of warm-season low flows in low-elevation catchments across Switzerland.

Previous studies have determined concentration–discharge (cQ) relationships from long-term, low-frequency data of a wide range of solutes. These analyses, however, provide little insight into the coupling of solute concentrations and flow during individual hydrologic events. Event-scale cQ relationships have rarely been investigated across a wide range of solutes and over extended periods of time, and thus little is known about differences and similarities between event-scale and long-term cQ relationships. Differences between event-scale and long-term cQ behavior may provide useful information about the processes regulating their transport through the landscape.  Here we analyze cQ relationships of 14 different solutes, ranging from major ions to trace metals, as well as electrical conductivity, in the Swiss Erlenbach catchment. From a 2-year time series of sub-hourly solute concentration data, we determined 2-year cQ relationships for each solute and compared them to cQ relationships of 30 individual events. The 2-year cQ behavior of groundwater-sourced solutes was representative of their cQ behavior during hydrologic events. Other solutes, however, exhibited very different cQ patterns at the event scale and across 2 consecutive years. This was particularly true for trace metals and atmospheric and/or biologically active solutes, many of which exhibited highly variable cQ behavior from one event to the next. Most of this inter-event variability in cQ behavior could be explained by factors such as catchment wetness, season, event size, input concentrations, and event-water contributions. We present an overview of the processes regulating different groups of solutes, depending on their origin in and pathways through the catchment. Our analysis thus provides insight into controls on solute variations at the hydrologic event scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000418589",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-24-2561-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/418589","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Concentration–discharge relationships vary among hydrological events, reflecting differences in event characteristics","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-05T13:35:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85088240258",,,"000535272300002","Hydrol.

The model is based on the simple dynamical systems approach as proposed by Kirchner (2009), and the distributed implementation allows for spatial heterogeneity in the parameters and/or model forcing fields at high spatio-temporal resolution (for instance as derived from precipitation radar data). The concept is extended with snow and routing modules, where the latter transports water from each pixel to the catchment outlet. The sensitivity function, which links changes in storage to changes in discharge, is implemented by a new three-parameter equation that is able to represent the widely observed downward curvature in log–log space. The simplicity of the underlying concept allows the model to calculate discharge in a computationally efficient manner, even at high temporal and spatial resolution, while maintaining proven model performance. The model code is written in Python in order to be easily readable and adjustable while maintaining computational efficiency. Since this model has short runtimes, it allows for extended sensitivity and uncertainty studies with relatively low computational costs. A test application shows good and consistent model performance across scales ranging from 3 to over 1700 km2.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000457339",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-13-6093-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/457339","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A distributed simple dynamical systems approach (dS2 v1.0) for computationally efficient hydrological modelling at high spatio-temporal resolution","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-12-20T03:41:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85097419736",,,"000596734900004","Geosci. model dev.","12","Geoscientific Model Development","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, when water samples are stored in the field for days and weeks in open bottles inside autosamplers, their isotopic signatures can be altered by evaporative fractionation and vapor mixing. We therefore designed an evaporation protection method which modifies autosampler bottles using a syringe housing and silicone tube, and we tested whether this method reduces evaporative fractionation and vapor mixing in water samples stored for up to 24 d in 6712 full-size portable samplers (Teledyne ISCO, Lincoln, USA). Laboratory and field tests under different temperature and humidity conditions showed that water samples in bottles with evaporation protection were far less altered by evaporative fractionation and vapor mixing than samples in conventional open bottles. Our design is a cost-efficient approach to upgrade the 1 L sample bottles of the ISCO autosamplers, allowing secure water sample collection in warm and dry environments.

Using a trait-based approach, we assessed the vulnerability of all marine mammals to global warming under high and low greenhouse gas emission scenarios for the middle and the end of the 21st century. We showed that the North Pacific Ocean, the Greenland Sea and the Barents Sea host the species that are most vulnerable to global warming. Future conservation plans should therefore focus on these regions, where there are long histories of overexploitation and there are high levels of current threats to marine mammals. Among the most vulnerable marine mammals were several threatened species, such as the North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica) and the dugong (Dugong dugon), that displayed unique combinations of functional traits. Beyond species loss, we showed that the potential extinctions of the marine mammals that were most vulnerable to global warming might induce a disproportionate loss of functional diversity, which may have profound impacts on the future functioning of marine ecosystems worldwide.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000395835",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-019-57280-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/395835","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Global vulnerability of marine mammals to global warming","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-30T12:33:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85078049090",,,"000562813800014","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite the wealth of soil radiocarbon data that have been reported over the past 75 years, the ability to apply these data to global-scale questions is limited by our capacity to synthesize and compare measurements generated using a variety of methods. Here, we present the International Soil Radiocarbon Database (ISRaD; http://soilradiocarbon.org, last access: 16 December 2019), an open-source archive of soil data that include reported measurements from bulk soils, distinct soil carbon pools isolated in the laboratory by a variety of soil fractionation methods, samples of soil gas or water collected interstitially from within an intact soil profile, CO2 gas isolated from laboratory soil incubations, and fluxes collected in situ from a soil profile. The core of ISRaD is a relational database structured around individual datasets (entries) and organized hierarchically to report soil radiocarbon data, measured at different physical and temporal scales as well as other soil or environmental properties that may also be measured and may assist with interpretation and context. Anyone may contribute their own data to the database by entering it into the ISRaD template and subjecting it to quality assurance protocols. ISRaD can be accessed through (1) a web-based interface, (2) an R package (ISRaD), or (3) direct access to code and data through the GitHub repository, which hosts both code and data. The design of ISRaD allows for participants to become directly involved in the management, design, and application of ISRaD data.

Measuring this partitioning is difficult, particularly on seasonal timescales. End-member mixing analysis has been widely used to quantify streamflow as a mixture of isotopically distinct sources, but knowing where streamwater comes from is not the same as knowing where precipitation goes, and this latter question is the one we seek to answer. Here we introduce “end-member splitting analysis”, which uses isotopic tracers and water flux measurements to quantify how isotopically distinct inputs (such as summer vs. winter precipitation) are partitioned into different ultimate outputs (such as evapotranspiration and summer vs. winter streamflow). End-member splitting analysis has modest data requirements and can potentially be applied in many different catchment settings. We illustrate this data-driven, model-independent approach with publicly available biweekly isotope time series from Hubbard Brook Watershed 3. A marked seasonal shift in isotopic composition allows us to distinguish rainy-season (April–November) and snowy-season (December–March) precipitation and to trace their respective fates. End-member splitting shows that about one-sixth (18±2 %) of rainy-season precipitation is discharged during the snowy season, but this accounts for over half (60±9 %) of snowy-season streamflow. By contrast, most (55± 13 %) snowy-season precipitation becomes streamflow during the rainy season, where it accounts for 38±9 % of rainy-season streamflow. Our analysis thus shows that significant fractions of each season's streamflow originated as the other season's precipitation, implying significant inter-seasonal water storage within the catchment as both groundwater and snowpack. End-member splitting can also quantify how much of each season's precipitation is eventually evapotranspired. At Watershed 3, we find that only about half (44±8 %) of rainy-season precipitation evapotranspires, but almost all (85±15 %) evapotranspiration originates as rainy-season precipitation, implying that there is relatively little inter-seasonal water storage supplying evapotranspiration. We show how results from this new technique can be combined with young water fractions (calculated from seasonal isotope cycles in precipitation and streamflow) and new water fractions (calculated from correlations between precipitation and streamflow isotope fluctuations) to infer how precipitation is partitioned on multiple timescales. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that end-member mixing and splitting yield different, but complementary, insights into catchment-scale partitioning of precipitation into blue water and green water. It could thus help in gauging the vulnerability of both water resources and terrestrial ecosystems to changes in seasonal precipitation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000391672",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-24-17-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/391672","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Seasonal partitioning of precipitation between streamflow and evapotranspiration, inferred from end-member splitting analysis","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-18T03:13:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85077780591",,,"000505955800001","Hydrol.

The discharge sensitivity of Fyw has been defined as the rate of increase in Fyw with increasing discharge (Q) and has been estimated by the linear regression slope between Fyw and Q, hereafter called DS(Q). The combined use of both metrics, Fyw and DS(Q), provides a promising method for catchment inter-comparison studies that seek to understand streamflow generation processes. Here we explore the discharge sensitivity of Fyw in the intensively sampled small Mediterranean research catchment Can Vila. Intensive sampling of high flows at Can Vila allows young water fractions to be estimated for the far upper tail of the flow frequency distribution. These young water fractions converge toward 1 at the highest flows, illustrating a conceptual limitation in the linear regression method for estimating DS(Q) as a metric of discharge sensitivity: Fyw cannot grow with discharge indefinitely, since the fraction of young water in discharge can never be larger than 1. Here we propose to quantify discharge sensitivity by the parameter of an exponential-type equation that expresses how Fyw varies with discharge. The exponential parameter (Sd) approximates DS(Q) at moderate discharges where Fyw is well below 1; however, the exponential equation and its discharge sensitivity metric better capture the non-linear relationship between Fyw and Q and are robust with respect to changes in the range of sampled discharges, allowing comparisons between catchments with strongly contrasting flow regimes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000406034",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-24-1101-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/406034","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Technical note: An improved discharge sensitivity metric for young water fractions","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-03-22T01:41:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85081612574",,,"000518836500001","Hydrol.

Genetic diversity showed a clear spatial organisation, but a weak association with species diversity for both marine and freshwater species. We found a predominantly positive relationship between genetic diversity and sea surface temperature for marine species. Genetic diversity of freshwater species varied primarily across the regional basins and was negatively correlated with average river slope. The detection of genetic diversity patterns suggests that conservation measures should consider mismatching spatial signals across multiple facets of biodiversity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000399751",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-020-14409-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/399751","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Global determinants of freshwater and marine fish genetic diversity","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-02-16T03:21:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85079209448",,,"000514355700001","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Decomposing the metaweb across regions shows large saturation in southern Europe, while many novel interactions are expected for northern Europe.

Evapotranspiration models that are applied at a continental scale typically operate on relatively large spatial grids, with the result that the heterogeneity in land surface properties and processes at smaller spatial scales cannot be explicitly represented. Averaging over this spatial heterogeneity may lead to biased estimates of energy and water fluxes. Here we estimate how averaging over spatial heterogeneity in precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) may affect grid-cell-averaged evapotranspiration rates, as seen from the atmosphere over heterogeneous landscapes across the globe. Our goal is to identify where, under what conditions, and at what scales this “heterogeneity bias” could be most important but not to quantify its absolute magnitude. We use Budyko curves as simple functions that relate ET to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Because the relationships driving ET are nonlinear, averaging over subgrid heterogeneity in P and PET will lead to biased estimates of average ET. We examine the global distribution of this bias, its scale dependence, and its sensitivity to variations in P vs. PET. Our analysis shows that this heterogeneity bias is more pronounced in mountainous terrain, in landscapes where spatial variations in P and PET are inversely correlated, and in regions with temperate climates and dry summers. We also show that this heterogeneity bias increases on average, and expands over larger areas, as the grid cell size increases.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000412694",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-24-1927-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/412694","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Global assessment of how averaging over spatial heterogeneity in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration affects modeled evapotranspiration rates","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-02T18:35:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85083817631",,,"000527610400004","Hydrol.

Here, we review the role of root and rhizosphere hydraulic processes that affect the ability of a plant to extract water from the soil. Prominent features of rhizosphere hydraulic properties are: root shrinkage, alteration of pore geometry in the rhizosphere, effect of mucilage on water retention, hydraulic conductivity and water repellency, root hairs, and mycorrhiza connecting the root surface to the soil matrix. All these factors are strongly dynamic, changing over time and with soil moisture conditions. Although our understanding of the mechanisms related to these factors has advanced significantly in the last ten years, the relative importance of these rhizosphere processes for the ability of crops to extract water from the soil and better tolerate drought is still largely unclear. We propose that the next research step is to investigate the implications of these rhizosphere processes on crop growth and water use economy and use this knowledge to grow more resilient crops that match to their environment.",,,"978-1-78676-362-4||978-1-78676-363-1||978-1-78676-360-0","2059-6936||2059-6944",,"10.19103/AS.2020.0075.17","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/593297","en","Burleigh Dodds Science Publishing",,,,"Advances in understanding plant root water uptake","Book Chapter","Metadata only","Understanding and improving crop root function",,"2023-01-18T11:38:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Burleigh Dodds Series in Agricultural Science","90","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although the relevance and occurrence of this process are well accepted, resolving the spatial distribution of hydraulic redistribution remains challenging. Here, we show how to use neutron radiography to quantify the rate of water efflux from the roots to the soil. Maize (Zea mays L.) plants were grown in a sandy substrate 40 cm deep. Deuterated water (D2O) was injected in the bottom wet compartment, and its transport through the roots to the top dry soil was imaged using neutron radiography. A diffusion–convection model was used to simulate the transport of D2O in soil and root and inversely estimate the convective fluxes. Overnight, D2O appeared in nodal and lateral roots in the top compartment. By inverse modeling, we estimated an efflux from lateral roots into the dry soil equal to jr = 2.35 × 10−7 cm−1. A significant fraction of the redistributed water flew toward the tips of nodal roots (3.85 × 10−8 cm3 s−1 per root) to sustain their growth. The efflux from nodal roots depended on the roots’ length and growth rate. In summary, neutron imaging was successfully used to quantify hydraulic redistribution. A numerical model was needed to differentiate the effects of diffusion and convection. The highly resolved images showed the spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic redistribution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000593294",,"1539-1663",,"10.1002/vzj2.20084","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/593294","en","Soil Science Society of America","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Quantification of hydraulic redistribution in maize roots using neutron radiography","Other Journal Item","Open access",,,"2023-01-18T11:28:05Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vadose Zone J.","1","Vadose Zone Journal","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

H. Karst.) is one of the most important tree species in the Southern Swiss Alps, especially in the mountain forests which support an essential protective function on the infrastructures and settlements of the inner alpine valleys. Norway spruce forests are subject to a multitude of stressors threatening their stability and hence the provision of their protective function on the long term. In this master thesis, I aim to identify the main processes and factors shaping the Norway spruce’s range in study area of the Southern Swiss Alps. I combined an analytic and modelling approach based on the most recent forest data from the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI) with a set of high-resolution indicators. Firstly, I analysed the current occurrence of this species in the study area. I calculated the changes measured in the Norway spruce’s stands in terms of stem density and basal area of living and dead trees, as well as the change in the number of seedlings and saplings. The reference data are the NFI2 and the NFI4. This first analysis denotes an increase in the species’ stocks but also an increase in the tree mortality, an overall uplift of the species’ range and a strong reduction in the frequency of the species’ rejuvenation. Secondly, I assessed the ecologic connection between the Norway spruce and the alpenroses (Rhododendron spp.), which are vectors of the needle’s bladder rust fungus (Chrysomyxa rhododendri). I used a combined analytic and modelling approach to assess the impact of this connection through a broad spectrum of topographic and pedo-climatic control variables. The procedure consists on a Likelihood-Ratio Test applied to a multi-linear regression. This combinatory assessment shows that the alpenroses’ cover degree is depressing the Norway spruce’s mixture and cover degree, both of the young and in the adult trees. This relationship is also true in the opposite direction. This evidence highlights the ecologic meaning of the allelopathic association between these species.  Thirdly, I modelled the Norway spruce’s range by approximating the species’ mixture degree assessed in the NFI4, either referring to the established rejuvenation and to the adult trees. The method applied was a Tobit multi-regression. I produced four different models’ version. All models are based on high resolution climate data. For each fitted variable, I produced an extended version which accounts for the occurrence of the rustyleaved alpenrose (Rhododendron ferrugineum) recursively predicted with an additional model. Finally, all models’ versions were projected in the second half of the 21st Century by integrating the corresponding future climate indicators based on the CLM scenario. The models based on the current climate display a reliable reconstruction of the present Norway spruce’s range in the study area. The non-linear boundaries of the Norway spruce’s range in the upper forest’s belts are reliably reproduced by integrating the predicted occurrence of the rusty-leaved alpenrose. The projections based on the future climate data present a dramatic retreat of the Norway spruce’s range towards its current centre of gravity in the Upper Ticino and in Val Poschiavo. The migration of the species to higher altitudes is hindered by the presence of the rhododendron. These results contrast with conventional models based on the whole of Switzerland. This shows that distinct dynamics are responsible for the absence of the Norway spruce in the study area, which could lead to a much greater decline of the species in the future than assumed in conventional scenarios. Nevertheless, any extrapolation drawn from modelling approach must be taken very cautiously and, in no circumstances, they should be considered as quantitative forecasts. In conclusion, in this thesis I highlighted that the Norway spruce’s stands of the Southern Swiss Alps are subject to a multitude of dynamics. On the long term-scale, they are showing an overall negative tendency of development. However, the main drivers of change as the changing disturbance regime and the land-use are not quantified in the climatic indicators. The complex interactions between these multiple factors needs therefore to be considered with a greater attention for responsibly addressing the challenges imposed by the current development of the mountain forests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438047",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438047","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"On the processes and factors shaping the Norway spruce’s (Picea abies) forests in the Southern Swiss Alps","Master Thesis","Open access",,,"2020-09-02T12:52:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Diese Entwicklung fand fast ausschliess- lich in höheren Lagen statt, auf Kosten des Kulturlandes. In den letzten Jahren sind im Gebirge viele ehemals beweidete Flächen eingewachsen (Finger, 2012). Von der durch die vergangene Bewirtschaf- tung freigelegten Mineralerde profitiert die Birke (Bugmann & Frehner, 2019). Es können sich auf die- sen frischen Waldflächen Birkenvorwälder bilden. Es stellt sich die Frage, welche Ökosystemdienstleis- tungen diese Vorwälder erfüllen. Eine zentrale Ökosystemdienstleistung in Gebirgswäldern ist der Schutz vor Naturgefahren. Damit die Schutzfunktion nachhaltig erhalten bleibt, werden Wälder schon vom frühsten Waldstadium an ge- pflegt. Dies gewährleistet, dass ein Wald alle Ansprüche erfüllt, um vor Steinschlag, Lawinen und an- deren Massenbewegungen zu schützen. Die dafür nötigen Pflegeeingriffe verursachen Kosten und sind in Gebirgswäldern besonders aufwendig. Birken werden oft noch durch negative Auslese mit aus den Wäldern entfernt (Gayer, 1896) (Leder, 1992) (Herger, 2019). Dies bedeutet Aufwand und höhere Kos- ten. Mit steigenden Löhnen und sinkenden Erträgen in der Forstwirtschaft sind alternativen zum her- kömmlichen Waldbau gefragt (Schütz, 1999). Das Prinzip der biologischen Rationalisierung bietet hier einen Lösungsweg. Ziel der biologischen Rationalisierung besteht darin, natürliche Abläufe und Dyna- miken in der Natur gemäss der waldbaulichen Zielsetzung zu nutzen. Aufgaben, die die Natur von selbst erledigt, werden abgegeben, und unnötige Arbeitsschritte werden weggelassen (Ammann P. , 2004). Die biologische Rationalisierung baut so auf dem Konzentrationsprinzip und dem Prinzip der Naturau- tomation auf. Es finden sich positive Eigenschaften von Birken, die sich ins Konzept der biologischen Rationalisierung einfügen lassen (Glanzmann, Schwitter, & Zürcher, 2019) (Wagnière, 1996). In dieser Masterarbeit werden die Auswirkungen eines solchen Birkenvorwaldes auf die darunter aufwachsenden Fichten er- mittelt. Wie sich die Birke nun in den hochmontanen Wäldern im Sinne der biologischen Rationalisie- rung einsetzen lässt versucht diese Arbeit zu beantworten. Untersucht wurde zum einen, welchen Ein- fluss eine hohe Birkenstammzahl auf das Auftreten von Schadensbildern hat, insbesondere Gipfel- bruch und Säbelwuchs. Des Weiteren wurde untersucht, wie sich der Schlankheitsgrad von Fichten in Abhängigkeit der Anzahl benachbarten Birken verhält. Zusammen wird so die Entwicklung von Stabili- tätsträgern unter Birken ermittelt. Ebenfalls von Interesse war der Einfluss der Birken auf die horizon- tale Strukturierung des Bestandes. Die Erkenntnisse fliessen schlussendlich zusammen in die Beurtei- lung der Schutzwirkung von Fichtenwäldern mit unterschiedlich hohen Birkenanteilen. Die vorliegende Arbeit ist eine Fallstudie, basierend auf empirischen Daten aus Untersuchungsflächen in der Surselva (Graubünden). Es wurden fünf Flächen mit graduell ansteigenden Birkenanteilen (10- 80%) im nordöstlichen Teil des Waldes Prau Nausch untersucht. Die erhobenen Daten aus der Feldar- beit wurden statistisch analysiert und mittels GIS-Programm räumlich ausgewertet. Um vergleichbare Ergebnisse zu erhalten und um die zukünftige Entwicklung der Flächen beurteilen zu können, wurden einige Parameter mittels einfachen Wachstumsmodellen in die Zukunft modelliert. Kein Resultat zeigt einen positiven signifikanten Einfluss der Birke auf die Fichte. Ebenfalls wurde kein signifikanter negativer Einfluss gefunden. Jedoch lassen sich Trends erkennen. Die vorliegende Arbeit zeigt, dass Birkenvorwälder sich positiv auf die horizontale Struktur auswirken. Unter Birken kommen die Fichten nicht Flächendecken und weniger dicht auf. Es entwickeln sich Strukturen, die genügend Raum für die Bildung eines stabilen Bestandes schaffen. Mit mehr Birkenanteil treten tendenziell we- 4 niger Säbelwüchse auf und die Schlankheitsgrade bei Fichten fallen tiefer aus. Die Trends weisen da- rauf hin, dass Birken die Stabilität von Einzelbäumen fördern. Negativ fallen die Birken nur beim Thema Gipfelbruch auf. Tendenziell führt eine höhere Birkenstammzahl zu mehr Gipfelbrüchen. In dieser Ar- beit überwiegen die positiven Aspekte der Birke. Stabile Bestände lassen sich tendenziell besser in Mischung mit Birken erreichen. Bezüglich Naturgefahren zeigte sich, dass auch unter einem Birkenvor- wald ein Fichtenwald mit Schutzwirkung aufkommen kann und zwar ohne forstlichen Eingriff. Diese Arbeit liefert keinen Grund für die negative Auslese von Birken in hochmontanen Fichtenwäl- dern. Es wird empfohlen, diesen Arbeitsschritt zu unterlassen. Trotz hohen Birkenanteilen entwickeln sich in diesen Wäldern stabile Gerüstträger und auch ohne forstliche Eingriffe kann sich unter einem Birkenvorwald ein funktionierender Schutzwald bilden, der in Absehbarer Zeit vor Lawinen, Stein- schlag, Rutschungen und Hochwasser schützt. Die hohen Birkenstammzahlen wirken besonders effektiv gegen Steinschlag mit kleineren Steinen. Wird hingegen ein hoher dauernde Deckungsgrad verlangt, so tragen die Birken weniger zur Schutzwirkung bei. Bei Gebirgswäldern mit hohen Birkenanteilen wird die Schutzwirkung tendenziell erst später erreicht als bei fichtendominierten Wäldern.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438038",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438038","de","ETH Zürich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Biologische Rationalisierung im Schutzwald.

Plant trait data thus represent the basis for a vast area of research spanning from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and landscape management, restoration, biogeography and earth system modelling. Since its foundation in 2007, the TRY database of plant traits has grown continuously. It now provides unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy and is the main plant trait database used by the research community worldwide. Increasingly, the TRY database also supports new frontiers of trait‐based plant research, including the identification of data gaps and the subsequent mobilization or measurement of new data. To support this development, in this article we evaluate the extent of the trait data compiled in TRY and analyse emerging patterns of data coverage and representativeness. Best species coverage is achieved for categorical traits—almost complete coverage for ‘plant growth form’. However, most traits relevant for ecology and vegetation modelling are characterized by continuous intraspecific variation and trait–environmental relationships. These traits have to be measured on individual plants in their respective environment. Despite unprecedented data coverage, we observe a humbling lack of completeness and representativeness of these continuous traits in many aspects. We, therefore, conclude that reducing data gaps and biases in the TRY database remains a key challenge and requires a coordinated approach to data mobilization and trait measurements. This can only be achieved in collaboration with other initiatives.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000389543",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.14904","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/389543","en","Blackwell Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Data coverage||Data integration||Data representativeness||Functional diversity||Plant traits||TRY plant trait database","TRY plant trait database – enhanced coverage and open access","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-13T03:24:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85075196338",,,"000504934700001","Glob.
