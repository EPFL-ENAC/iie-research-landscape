Cooperative behavior is integral to the process of spore formation in some species [3, 6], but the degree to which germination of spore populations involves social interactions remains little explored. Myxococcus xanthus is a predatory soil bacterium that upon starvation forms spore-filled multicellular fruiting bodies that often harbor substantial diversity of endemic origin [7, 8]. Here we demonstrate that germination of M. xanthus spores formed during fruiting-body development is a social process involving at least two functionally distinct social molecules. Using pairs of natural isolates each derived from a single fruiting body that emerged on soil, we first show that spore germination exhibits positive density dependence due to a secreted “public-good” germination factor. Further, we find that a germination defect of one strain under saline stress in pure culture is complemented by addition of another strain that germinates well in saline environments and mediates cheating by the defective strain. Glycine betaine, an osmo-protectant utilized in all domains of life, is found to mediate saline-specific density dependence and cheating. Density dependence in non-saline conditions is mediated by a distinct factor, revealing socially complex spore germination involving multiple social molecules.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000454827",,"0960-9822||1879-0445",,"10.1016/j.cub.2020.08.091","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454827","en","Cell Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Density dependence||Osmotic stress||Public goods||Social evolution||Spore germination||Myxobacteria||Glycine Betaine","Cooperation and Cheating among Germinating Spores","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-12-06T19:34:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Experimental evolution of motile social bacteria","160005","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85092204800",,"000598868900005","Curr Biol","23","Current Biology","30","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We used population genetics approaches, demographic inference and pathogenicity tests on host–pathogen pairs of wild or domesticated apple trees from Central Asia and their main fungal pathogen, Venturia inaequalis, which itself has differentiated agricultural and wild‐type populations. We confirmed the occurrence of gene flow from cultivated (Malus domestica) to wild (Malus sieversii) apple trees in Asian forests, potentially threatening the persistence of Asian wild apple trees. Pathogenicity tests demonstrated the pestification of V. inaequalis, the agricultural‐type population being more virulent on both wild and domesticated trees. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and the demographic modelling of pathogen populations revealed hybridization following secondary contact between agricultural and wild‐type fungal populations, and dispersal of the agricultural‐type pathogen population in wild forests, increasing the threat of disease in the wild apple species. We detected an SNP potentially involved in pathogen pestification, generating an early stop codon in a gene encoding a small secreted protein in the agricultural‐type fungal population. Our findings, based on joint analyses of paired host and pathogen data sets, highlight the threat posed by cultivating a crop near its centre of origin, in terms of pestified pathogen invasions in wild plant populations and introgression in the wild‐type pathogen population.",,,,"0962-1083||1365-294X",,"10.1111/mec.15677","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/463762","en","Wiley",,,"apple||avirulence gene||crop‐to‐wild gene flow||hybridization||Malus||secondary contact||Venturia","Threat to Asian wild apple trees posed by gene flow from domesticated apple trees and their “pestified” pathogens","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-19T13:53:50Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mol Ecol","24","Molecular Ecology","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A better understanding of the conditions and processes determining epidemic outbreaks caused by the emergence of a new pathogen, or pathogen strain, is needed to develop strategies and inform decisions to manage emerging diseases. A polyetic process-based model is developed to analyse conditions of disease emergence. This model simulates polycyclic epidemics during successive growing seasons, the yield losses they cause, and the pathogen survival between growing seasons. This framework considers one immigrant strain coming in a single event into a system where a resident strain is already established. Outcomes are formulated as probability of emergence, time to emergence, and yield loss, resulting from deterministic and stochastic simulations. An analytical solution to determine a threshold for emergence is also derived. Analyses focus on the effects of two fitness parameters on emergence: the relative rate of reproduction (epidemic speed), and the relative rate of mortality (decay of population between seasons). Analyses revealed that stochasticity is a critical feature of disease emergence. The simulations suggest that: (a) emergence may require a series of independent immigration events before a successful invasion takes place; (b) an explosion in the population size of the new pathogen (or strain) may be preceded by many successive growing seasons of cryptic presence following an immigration event; and (c) survival between growing seasons is as important as reproduction during the growing season in determining disease emergence. © 2020 British Society for Plant Pathology",,,,"0032-0862||1365-3059",,"10.1111/ppa.13249","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432249","en","Wiley",,,"global change||pandemic||pathogen fitness||pathogen survival||polyetic epidemics||process-based model","A polyetic modelling framework for plant disease emergence","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-08-23T02:36:41Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Epidemiology of major wheat diseases: using eco-evolutionary models to learn from epidemic and genomic data","161453","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,"85089290385",,"000558258800001","Plant pathol.","9","Plant Pathology","69","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Many studies focus on flowering responses to climate, but few investigate how postflowering processes, such as how quickly plants develop from flowering to seed dispersal, respond to environmental factors. We examined the climatic drivers of postflowering phenology in 28 species of western North American subalpine meadow plants over large spatial and temporal climate gradients. We took a Bayesian hierarchical approach to address whether and how climate influences the time it takes for wildflower populations to transition from flower to seed. Our previous work on the same species demonstrated that the initiation of flowering depends on snowmelt timing, with warmer temperatures and soil moisture also playing a role. Here, we found that for the majority of the flowering community, the same climate drivers also affected the time it takes to move from flowering to seed dispersal. Climate‐sensitive species shortened flower–seed transitions when snow melted earlier, temperatures were warmer, and/or soil dried down more quickly—conditions we expect with higher frequency under climate change. Our work underscores the fact that predicting the impact of climate change on plant reproductive phenology demands empirical data on phases beyond flowering. Additionally, it suggests that some species face a future in which multiple environmental factors will push them towards more rapid transitions from flowering to postflowering phases, with potential effects on plants themselves and the many animal associates that rely on them, including frugivores and seed predators.",,,,"0012-9658||1939-9170",,"10.1002/ecy.3171","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/464917","en","Wiley",,,"Climate change||forbs||global warming||phenology||seed dispersal||species interactions","Early snowmelt and warmer, drier summers shrink postflowering transition times in subalpine wildflowers","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-22T15:29:08Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85096719926",,"000589339600001","Ecol.","12","Ecology","101","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Fungicides can rapidly lose effectiveness due to the rise of resistant individuals in populations. However, the lack of knowledge about resistance mutations beyond known target genes challenges investigations into pathways to resistance. We used whole-genome sequencing data and association mapping to reveal the multilocus genetic architecture of fungicide resistance in a global panel of 159 isolates of Parastagonospora nodorum, an important fungal pathogen of wheat. We found significant differences in azole resistance among global field populations. The populations evolved distinctive combinations of resistance alleles which can interact when co-occurring in the same genetic background. We identified 34 significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms located in close proximity to genes associated with fungicide resistance in other fungi, including a major facilitator superfamily transporter. Using fungal colony growth rates and melanin production at different temperatures as fitness proxies, we found no evidence that resistance was constrained by genetic trade-offs. Our study demonstrates how genome-wide association studies of a global collection of pathogen strains can recapitulate the emergence of fungicide resistance. The distinct complement of resistance mutations found among populations illustrates how the evolutionary trajectory of fungicide adaptation can be complex and challenging to predict.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000457969",,"1759-6653",,"10.1093/gbe/evaa203","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/457969","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The Genetic Architecture of Emerging Fungicide Resistance in Populations of a Global Wheat Pathogen","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-12-22T03:42:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85097486564",,"000606568300003","Genome Biol Evol","12","Genome Biology and Evolution","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To date, however, it has been challenging to effectively untangle the mechanisms shaping such dynamics. One approach that has yet to be fully explored is to treat the varying structure of empirical communities—i.e. their network of interactions—as time series. Here, we follow this approach by applying a network-comparison technique to study the seasonal dynamics of plant-pollinator networks. We find that the structure of these networks is extremely variable, where species constantly change how they interact with each other within seasons. Most importantly, we find the holistic dynamic of plants and pollinators to be remarkably coherent across years, allowing us to reveal general rules by which species first enter, then change their roles, and finally leave the networks. Overall, our results disentangle key aspects of species’ interaction turnover, phenology, and seasonal assembly/disassembly processes in empirical plant-pollinator communities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000432237",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-020-17894-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432237","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Untangling the seasonal dynamics of plant-pollinator communities","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-08-22T02:57:13Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85089426475",,"000564154300008","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we show a steady rise in the spatial synchrony of annual tree growth from a global tree ring database over the past 50 years that is consistent across continents, species and environmental conditions and is unprecedented for the past millennium. Increasing growth synchrony coincided with warming trends and potentially rising synchrony in the temperature records.

Cross-feeding Escherichia coli strains, where one strain feeds on a carbon source excreted by another strain, rapidly emerge during experimental evolution in a chemically minimal environment containing glucose as the sole carbon source. Genome-scale metabolic modeling predicts that cross-feeding of 58 carbon sources can emerge in the same environment, but only cross-feeding of acetate and glycerol has been experimentally observed. Here we use metabolic modeling to ask whether acetate and glycerol cross-feeding are especially likely to evolve, perhaps because they require less metabolic change, and thus perhaps also less genetic change than other cross-feeding interactions. However, this is not the case. The minimally required metabolic changes required for acetate and glycerol cross feeding affect dozens of chemical reactions, multiple biochemical pathways, as well as multiple operons or regulons. The complexity of these changes is consistent with experimental observations, where cross-feeding strains harbor multiple mutations. The required metabolic changes are also no less complex than those observed for multiple other of the 56 cross feeding interactions we study. We discuss possible reasons why only two cross-feeding interactions have been discovered during experimental evolution and argue that multiple new cross-feeding interactions may await discovery.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000465966",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008433","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465966","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Acetate and glycerol are not uniquely suited for the evolution of cross-feeding in E. coli","Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-27T10:34:52Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,"84427218",,"85097148421",,"000595962300008","PLOS comput. biol.","11","PLoS Computational Biology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

An additional experiment assessed the strength of maternal effects by comparing plants derived from field-collected seeds with those derived from clones grown in the glasshouse. Introduced populations tended to be larger in size, but no trade-off of stress tolerance with performance was detected; introduced populations had either superior performance or equivalent trait values and survivorship in the treatment common gardens. We also detected evidence of parallel latitudinal clines of some traits in both the native and introduced ranges and associations with climate variables in some treatments, consistent with recent climate adaptation within the introduced range. Our results are consistent with rapid adaptation of introduced populations, but, contrary to predictions, the evolution of invasive traits did not come at the cost of reduced stress tolerance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450610",,,,"10.1016/j.xplc.2020.100116","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450610","en","Cell Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","biological invasion||EICA||adaptation||trait evolution||plasticity||Canada thistle","Genetically Based Trait Differentiation but Lack of Trade-offs between Stress Tolerance and Performance in Introduced Canada Thistle","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-10T14:20:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000654062200008",,"S 6","Plant Communications","1","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Ratios by their nature do not respond symmetrically to changes in the numerator and denominator and do not follow normal distributions; however, researchers frequently fail to consider these properties in their analyses, which has biased reported results. Calculating means, variance, or linear slopes based on untransformed ratios results in biased results. I demonstrate the consequences of these errors for inferences from stoichiometric analyses using simple examples and several large monitoring data sets. I then review 100 studies in ecological stoichiometry and find that misuse of ratio data is common, with 93% of studies containing at least one error. These errors may be problematic, particularly in large-scale meta-analyses summarizing data over large ranges. Fortunately, most of these mistakes can be easily avoided by first log transforming elemental ratios. I therefore recommend that, to ensure robust and reproducible results, researchers in ecological stoichiometry should adopt a convention of presenting stoichiometric ratio data as the logarithm of molar ratios in the future. The widespread use of untransformed nitrogen to phosphorus ratio as an indicator of nutrient limitation has likely exaggerated the importance of phosphorus limitation, particularly in freshwater systems.",,,,"0012-9658||1939-9170",,"10.1002/ecy.3153","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462686","en","Wiley",,,"ecological stoichiometry||log transformation||nitrogen to phosphorus ratio||ratio data||stoichiometric plasticity","The misuse of ratios in ecological stoichiometry","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-14T15:39:59Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85090163849",,"000565619400001","Ecol.","11","Ecology","101","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Its causative agent, the myxozoan parasite Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, exploits freshwater bryozoans as primary hosts and salmonids as intermediate hosts. Our experiments showed that the manipulation of exposure concentrations of infective malacospores had relatively minor impacts for the disease outcomes in the fish host. In this study, brown trout (Salmo trutta) were exposed to three different exposure concentrations of T. bryosalmonae malacospores: (a) a single low parasite concentration (LC), (b) a single high parasite concentration (HC) and (c) three times a low concentration (repeat exposure, RE). Parasite dynamics in the fish host and release of fish malacospores were quantified and fish kidney histopathology was evaluated to determine PKD pathogenesis. Infection prevalence was always lower in the LC group than in the other groups over the course of the study. While the parasite proliferation phase was slower in the LC group, the maximum parasite burden did not differ significantly amongst treatments. The onset of fish malacospore release (day 45 post-exposure), indicated by detection of T. bryosalmonae DNA in the tank water, occurred at the same time point for all groups. Reduced intensity of kidney pathological development was observed in the LC treatment indicating lower disease severity. While the LC treatment resulted in reduced outcomes across several infection parameters (infection prevalence, parasite proliferation, total fish malacospores released), the overall differences were small. The RE and HC treatment outcomes were for most parameters comparable. Our results suggest that repeated exposure, as is likely to occur in the wild during the summer months, might play a more important role in the dynamics of PKD as an emerging infectious disease than the actual concentration of spores.",,,,"1865-1674||1865-1682",,"10.1111/tbed.13615","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462697","en","Wiley",,,"disease ecology||disease transmission||host‐parasite interactions||proliferative kidney disease||salmonids||Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae","Effects of parasite concentrations on infection dynamics and proliferative kidney disease pathogenesis in brown trout (Salmo trutta)","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-14T15:42:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85085480184",,"000535009800001","Transbound Emerg Dis","6","Transboundary and Emerging Diseases","67","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While P. protegens protects plants against soilborne pathogens, it can also invade insects when orally ingested leading to the death of susceptible pest insects. The mechanism whereby pseudomonads effectively switch between lifestyles, plant-beneficial or insecticidal, and the specific factors enabling plant or insect colonization are poorly understood. We generated a large-scale transcriptomics dataset of the model P. protegens strain CHA0 which includes data from the colonization of wheat roots, the gut of Plutella xylostella after oral uptake and the Galleria mellonella hemolymph after injection. We identified extensive plasticity in transcriptomic profiles depending on the environment and specific factors associated to different hosts or different stages of insect infection. Specifically, motor-activity and Reb toxin-related genes were highly expressed on wheat roots but showed low expression within insects, while certain antimicrobial compounds (pyoluteorin), exoenzymes (a chitinase and a polyphosphate kinase), and a transposase exhibited insect-specific expression. We further identified two-partner secretion systems as novel factors contributing to pest insect invasion.

Here, we investigated whether similar or different sets of orthologous genes were involved in genetic adaptation of natural populations of three related plant species to similar environmental gradients in the Alps. We used whole-genome pooled population sequencing to study genome-wide SNP variation in 18 natural populations of three Brassicaceae (Arabis alpina, Arabidopsis halleri,andCardamine resedifolia) from the Swiss Alps. We first de novo assembled draft reference genomes for all three species. We then ran population and landscape genomic analyses with similar to 3 million SNPs per species to look for shared genomic signatures of selection and adaptation in response to similar environmental gradients acting on these species. Genes with a signature of convergent adaptation were found at significantly higher numbers than expected by chance. The most closely related species pair showed the highest relative over-representation of shared adaptation signatures. Moreover, the identified genes of convergent adaptation were enriched for nonsynonymous mutations, suggesting functional relevance of these genes, even though many of the identified candidate genes have hitherto unknown or poorly described functions based on comparison withArabidopsis thaliana. We conclude that adaptation to heterogeneous Alpine environments in related species is partly driven by convergent evolution, but that most of the genomic signatures of adaptation remain species-specific.",,,,"0962-1083||1365-294X",,"10.1111/mec.15648","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448266","en","Wiley",,,"adaptation||Alpine environment||Brassicaceae||environmental association||genome assembly||genome scans","Genomic signatures of convergent adaptation to Alpine environments in three Brassicaceae species","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-10-28T03:53:06Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85092458724",,"000577690000001","Mol Ecol","22","Molecular Ecology","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We isolated and genetically analysed 193 P. nodorum strains from three naturally infected wheat fields distributed across Iran using 11 neutral microsatellite loci. Compared to previous studies that included populations from North America, Europe, Africa, Australia, and China, the populations from Iran had the highest genetic diversity globally and also exhibited greater population structure over smaller spatial scales, patterns typically associated with the centre of origin of a species. Genes encoding the necrotrophic effectors SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3 were found at a high frequency in the Iranian population. By sequencing 96 randomly chosen Iranian strains, we detected new alleles for all three effector genes. Analysis of allele diversity showed that all three effector genes had higher diversity in Iran than in any population included in previous studies, with Iran acting as a hub for the effector diversity that was found in other global populations. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that P. nodorum originated either within or nearby the Fertile Crescent with a genome that already encoded all three necrotrophic effectors during its emergence as a pathogen on wheat. Our findings also suggest that P. nodorum was the original source of the ToxA genes discovered in the wheat pathogens Phaeosphaeria avenaria f. sp. tritici 1, Pyrenophora tritici‐repentis, and Bipolaris sorokiniana.",,,,"0032-0862||1365-3059",,"10.1111/ppa.13233","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/428063","en","Wiley",,,"Centre of origin||Microsatellites||Necrotrophic effectors||Population genetics||SSRs||Stagonospora nodorum","SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3 originated in Parastagonospora nodorum in the Fertile Crescent","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-07-23T05:22:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85087722741",,"000547292900001","Plant pathol.","8","Plant Pathology","69","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, a recent molecular phylogeny based on the 18S rRNA gene suggested it belonged to the Ichthyosporea, a class of protists closely related to animals within the Opisthokonta clade. The exact phylogenetic position of C. mesnili remained uncertain because it appeared in the 18S rRNA tree with a very long branch and separated from all other taxa, suggesting that its position could be artifactual. A better understanding of its phylogenetic position has been constrained by a lack of molecular markers and the difficulty of obtaining a suitable quantity and quality of DNA from in vitro cultures, as this intracellular parasite cannot be cultured without its host. We isolated and collected spores of C. mesnili and sequenced genomic libraries. Phylogenetic analyses of a newly generated multi-protein data set (22 proteins, 4998 amino acids) and of sequences from the 18S rRNA gene both placed C. mesnili within the Ichthyophonida sub-clade of Ichthyosporea, as sister-taxon to Abeoforma whisleri and Pirum gemmata.

To test a novel multi‐deposit methodology for defining environmental flows for activating the dynamics of the river morphology downstream of dams, a flood was released from Rossens Dam in Switzerland. This event was combined for the first time with a multi‐deposit configuration of sediment replenishment consisting of four artificial deposits allocated as alternate bars along the riverbanks as a restoration measure. To validate the sediment transport behaviour observed in laboratory tests, stones were equipped with radiofrequency identification (RFID) passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, a fixed antenna was installed at the river bed and a mobile antenna was used to enable the investigation of the erosion, transport and deposition of replenished sediments. The duration of the erosion period was determined for the tracked stones, and average transport velocities were found to be on the order of 10–3 m/s. To estimate the erosion efficiency of the flood, defined as the eroded tagged stones compared with the released water volume, the hydrograph was divided into different periods: rising limb, constant peak discharge, decreasing limb. During the rising limb of the flood, which lasted for 20% of the total flood duration, more than 40% of the PIT tags were transported. The defined erosion efficiency is a measure to support the hydrographic design of artificial flood releases from dams. The deposition of tagged stones resulted in a repeating cluster formation, as expected from previous laboratory experiments, creating an increase in hydraulic habitat diversity. Comparison of the results obtained in the field and from laboratory experiments confirmed the robustness of the multi‐deposit sediment replenishment method. Combined with the knowledge gained on the erosion efficiency, these results could motivate further applications and research into multi‐deposit sediment replenishment techniques as a habitat‐oriented river restoration measure. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,"0197-9337||1096-9837",,"10.1002/esp.4970","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462690","en","Wiley",,,"sediment transport||river morphology||RFID PIT tags||river restoration||sustainable hydropower management||artificial flood release","Erosion, transport and deposition of a sediment replenishment under flood conditions","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-14T15:40:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Earth Surf Process Landforms","13","Earth Surface Processes and Landforms","45","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

About 80% of their primaries are used for 2 yr and 20% for 3 yr. Primaries are replaced during the breeding season and are lost in synchronous blocks representing about half the primaries, suggesting that most adults probably can fly weakly during flight feather replacement. Cranes are large, aggressive birds, and this interesting, and undescribed mode of flight feather replacement seems adapted to the ability of adult cranes to defend their precocial chicks from predators. Strikingly, juvenile Sandhill Cranes showed no fault marks in their primaries, suggesting that their parents’ ability to protect them shields them from the fright of predator attacks, which, in most birds, causes fault bars to be more prevalent and strongly expressed in juveniles than adults. Adults show interesting variation in the number of primaries replaced annually, which seems likely related to whether or not they are caring for chicks. Further, single primaries may or may not be replaced preferentially, suggesting sensitivity to feather function. Evaluating these observations must await field studies of molting adults. © American Ornithological Society 2020.",,,,"0004-8038||1938-4254",,"10.1093/auk/ukaa058","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/464916","en","Allen Press",,,"Absence of fault marks in juvenile plumage||Fault bars||Predator attacks||Sandhill Crane primary replacement||Variability in extent of primary replacement","Life-history implications of migratory Lesser Sandhill Cranes replacing adjacent blocks of primaries synchronously","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-22T15:28:28Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4","The Auk","137","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Classic model systems of infectious disease dynamics, epidemiology and host population regulation by parasites present a diversity of examples where fundamental concepts are tested. The interaction between the New Zealand Mud Snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1843) and its trematode parasite Atriophallophorus winterbourni Blasco-Costa et al., 2019 is a good example. The system has become a model for research on the maintenance of sexual reproduction in natural populations. The core of earlier research on the system is focused on the co-evolutionary interaction between the host and its parasite in natural populations. This thesis features research on the epidemiological and ecological factors that underlie these co-evolutionary dynamics between the snail and the trematode. I expand the understanding of the key players in this interaction by presenting a comprehensive, large-scale study on the phylogeography of A. winterbourni in New Zealand. This study reveals that the parasite, which was thought to be one species, in fact consists of a complex of cryptic species. These species have overlapping distributions, while showing a strong intraspecific phylogeographic structure. At the local scale, within Lake Alexandrina in New Zealand, I provide experimental evidence for behavioural manipulation by the parasite. The parasite induces migration of its snail host toward the shallow-water margin, a form of behavioural manipulation that is likely to facilitate transmission to dabbling ducks. I then show how this manipulation conceals the relationship between risk of infection and prevalence of infected hosts. Risk of exposure is key factor for understanding epidemiology and evolution of host resistance. Spatial de-coupling of risk of exposure and prevalence of infection by host manipulation therefore presents a problem for assessment of spatial structure in selection for host resistance. I therefore tested if the frequency of multiple-genotype infections within single hosts can be used to identify areas with increased risk of exposure, instead of prevalence of infection. I show that the frequency of multiple-genotype infections resolves small-scale patterns in risk of exposure. Therefore, multiple genotype-infections can function as an indicator for risk of exposure and may have applications in evolutionary or epidemiological research and disease management. Finally, I examined the mating system of A. winterbourni. Clonal replication within the snail host leads to co-transmission of numerous, clonally identical, hermaphrodite parasite individuals to the same bird host. My results suggest that this opportunity for inbreeding in infrapopulations does not lead to inbred populations. Together, the chapters in this thesis contribute to the research on the fascinating interaction between P. antipodarum and A. winterbourni, while simultaneously addressing a diverse set of questions on behavioural manipulation, epidemiology, phylogeography and mating system evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460853",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460853","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Host-parasite co-evolution","Looking-glass parasites","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::590 - Zoological sciences","2021-01-09T13:23:34Z","2022-01-11",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"26942",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To constrain global warming, we must strongly curtail greenhouse gas emissions and capture excess atmospheric carbon dioxide1,2. Regrowing natural forests is a prominent strategy for capturing additional carbon3, but accurate assessments of its potential are limited by uncertainty and variability in carbon accumulation rates2,3. To assess why and where rates differ, here we compile 13,112 georeferenced measurements of carbon accumulation. Climatic factors explain variation in rates better than land-use history, so we combine the field measurements with 66 environmental covariate layers to create a global, one-kilometre-resolution map of potential aboveground carbon accumulation rates for the first 30 years of natural forest regrowth. This map shows over 100-fold variation in rates across the globe, and indicates that default rates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)4,5 may underestimate aboveground carbon accumulation rates by 32 per cent on average and do not capture eight-fold variation within ecozones. Conversely, we conclude that maximum climate mitigation potential from natural forest regrowth is 11 per cent lower than previously reported3 owing to the use of overly high rates for the location of potential new forest. Although our data compilation includes more studies and sites than previous efforts, our results depend on data availability, which is concentrated in ten countries, and data quality, which varies across studies. However, the plots cover most of the environmental conditions across the areas for which we predicted carbon accumulation rates (except for northern Africa and northeast Asia). We therefore provide a robust and globally consistent tool for assessing natural forest regrowth as a climate mitigation strategy.",,,,"0028-0836||1476-4687",,"10.1038/s41586-020-2686-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/443821","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Mapping carbon accumulation potential from global natural forest regrowth","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-10-01T07:24:13Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091432763",,"000572556300019",,"7826","Nature","585","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We report the draft genome sequence of Alexander Fleming’s original fungal isolate behind the discovery of penicillin, now classified as Penicillium rubens Biourge (1923) (IMI 15378). We compare the structure of the genome and genes involved in penicillin synthesis with those in two ‘high producing’ industrial strains of P. rubens and the closely related species P. nalgiovense. The main effector genes for producing penicillin G (pcbAB, pcbC and penDE) show amino acid divergence between the Fleming strain and both industrial strains, whereas a suite of regulatory genes are conserved. Homologs of penicillin N effector genes cefD1 and cefD2 were also found and the latter displayed amino acid divergence between the Fleming strain and industrial strains. The draft assemblies contain several partial duplications of penicillin-pathway genes in all three P. rubens strains, to differing degrees, which we hypothesise might be involved in regulation of the pathway. The two industrial strains are identical in sequence across all effector and regulatory genes but differ in duplication of the pcbAB–pcbC–penDE complex and partial duplication of fragments of regulatory genes. We conclude that evolution in the wild encompassed both sequence changes of the effector genes and gene duplication, whereas human-mediated changes through mutagenesis and artificial selection led to duplication of the penicillin pathway genes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478567",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-020-72584-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478567","en","Macmillan Publishers Limited","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Comparative genomics of Alexander Fleming’s original Penicillium isolate (IMI 15378) reveals sequence divergence of penicillin synthesis genes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-04-13T17:05:45Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The majority of studies have revealed phenological shifts using in-situ observations, some aided by citizen science efforts (e.g., National Phenology Network). Such investigations have been instrumental in quantifying phenological shifts but are challenged by the fact that limited resources often make it difficult to gather observations over large spatial scales and long-time frames. However, recent advances in finer scale satellite imagery may provide new opportunities to detect changes in phenology. These approaches have documented plot level changes in vegetation characteristics and leafing phenology, but it remains unclear whether they can also detect flowering in natural environments. Here, we test whether fine-resolution imagery (<10 m) can detect flowering and whether combining multiple sources of imagery improves the detection process. Examining alpine wildflowers at Mt. Rainier National Park (MORA), we found that high-resolution Random Forest (RF) classification from 3-m resolution PlanetScope (from Planet Labs) imagery was able to delineate the flowering season captured by ground-based phenological surveys with an accuracy of 70% (Cohen's kappa = 0.25). We then combined PlanetScope data with coarser resolution but higher quality imagery from Sentinel and Landsat satellites (10-m Sentinel and 30-m Landsat), resulting in higher accuracy predictions (accuracy = 77%, Cohen's kappa = 0.39). The model was also able to identify the timing of peak flowering in a particularly warm year (2015), despite being calibrated on normal climate years. Our results suggest PlanetScope imagery holds utility in global change ecology where temporal frequency is important. Additionally, we suggest that combining imagery may provide a new approach to cross-calibrate sensors to account for radiometric irregularity inherent in fine resolution PlanetScope imagery. The development of this approach for wildflower phenology predictions provides new possibilities to monitor climate change effects on flowering communities at broader spatiotemporal scales. In protected and tourist areas where the flowering season draws large numbers of visitors, such as Mt. Rainier National Park, the modeling framework presented here could be a useful tool to manage and prioritize park resources. © 2020 by the authors.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000445178",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/RS12182894","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/445178","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Detecting Montane Flowering Phenology with CubeSat Imagery","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-09T03:04:21Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091818644",,"000580713900001","Remote Sens.","18","Remote Sensing","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to enhance our knowledge about the effects of forest structure on albedo. Here, we present a global assessment of the links between forest structure and albedo at a 1-km spatial resolution using generalized additive models (GAMs). We used remotely sensed data to obtain variables representing forest structure, including forest density, leaf area index, and tree cover, during the peak growing season in 2005 with pure forest pixels that cover ~7% of the Earth's surface. Furthermore, we estimated black-sky albedo at a solar zenith angle of 38° using the most recent collection of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS; version 6) at shortwave, near-infrared, and visible spectral regions. In addition, for the first time, we mapped the magnitude of the relationship between forest structure and albedo at each pixel with a 0.5-degree spatial resolution. Our results suggested that forest structure may modulate albedo in most of the sub-biomes. The response of shortwave albedo was always positive to the leaf area index and negative to the tree cover (except for deciduous broadleaf forests in mediterranean and temperate regions), while the response to forest density varied across space in 2005. The spatial map affirmed that the links between forest structure and albedo vary over geographical locations. In sum, our study emphasized the importance of forest structure in the surface albedo regulation. This paper provides the first spatially explicit evidence of the magnitude of relationships between forest structure and albedo on a global scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000416241",,"0034-4257",,"10.1016/j.rse.2020.111854","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/416241","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Albedo||Forest structure||Forest density||Tree cover||Leaf area index","Quantitative analysis of the links between forest structure and land surface albedo on a global scale","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-22T02:33:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85084675482",,"000537691800014","Remote Sens.

Large-scale commercial farming produces crops for export to global markets on the one hand, and small-scale farming, on the other hand, provides for subsistence and local markets. In both systems, maize (Zea mays) is a key crop for these two countries. For the commercial system, maize is a commodity crop while for the small-scale system it is the prime staple crop. In commercial systems, farmers predominantly grow genetically modified (GM) hybrid maize. In small-scale systems, farmers rely on open pollinated varieties (OPVs) and/or landraces and are largely dependent on seed saving systems. The aim of this study was to understand the relationship between transgene expression rates, the resulting concentrations of the transgene product (Bt protein) and its bioactivity in insect pests following transgene flow from GM hybrid maize into non-genetically modified, non-GM near-isogenic maize hybrid (ISO) and OPVs. We modeled segregation patterns and measured cry1Ab transgene expression (mRNA quantification), Cry1Ab protein concentration and pest survival. Two groups of F1, F2 crosses and backcrosses with GM, ISO and OPV maize varieties from Brazil and South Africa were used. Bioassays with the larvae of two lepidopteran maize pest species, Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera littoralis, were carried out. Overall, the cry1Ab transgene outcrossed effectively into the genetic backgrounds tested. The cry1Ab transgene was stably expressed in both ISO and OPV genetic backgrounds. Transgene introgression led to consistent, though highly variable, concentrations of Cry1Ab toxins that were similar to those observed in GM parental maize. Most crosses, but not all, suggested the expected Mendelian segregation pattern. Transgene expression rates were significantly higher than expected from purely Mendelian segregation in the South African crosses. In South African materials, ISO and OPV crosses produced significantly lower Cry1Ab concentrations compared to the GM parental maize. The Cry1Ab toxins from crosses were bioactive and induced mortality rates of ≥92.19% in H. armigera and ≥40.63% in S. littoralis after a period of only 4 days. However, no correlations were observed between the quantitation of mRNA for cry1Ab and the corresponding Cry1Ab protein concentrations, nor between the Cry1Ab concentrations and insect mortality rates across different genetic backgrounds. We therefore suggest that while transcription of the cry1Ab transgene reliably determines the presence of Cry1Ab protein, mRNA levels do not reflect, by themselves, the end Cry1Ab protein concentrations found in the plant. Because predictably high Cry1Ab concentrations are a key prerequisite for effective insect resistance management (IRM) programs, this observation raises questions about the effectiveness of such programs in scenarios with complex crop genetic backgrounds. On the other hand, confirmed bioactivity in all crosses should be expected to impact small farmer’s selection behavior, unknowingly favoring the insecticidal trait. This may lead to a fixation of the trait in the wider population, and may influence the genetic diversity of varieties maintained by small-scale farmers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000442203",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0238523","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/442203","en","Public Library of Science","CC0 1.0 Universal","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/",,"Transgene behavior in Zea mays L. crosses across different genetic backgrounds: Segregation patterns, cry1Ab transgene expression, insecticidal protein concentration and bioactivity against insect pests","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-09-24T06:20:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85090818508",,"000571885900018","PLoS ONE","9","PLoS ONE","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the agricultural system, pathogen populations are under high selection pressure, and yet demonstrate high adaptive potential to overcome changing conditions. The genetic variation and genomic mechanisms underpinning the fast evolutionary rates in pathogen populations are poorly understood. In this thesis, I studied the genetic basis of adaptation in populations of Parastagonospora nodorum, a major pathogen wheat. We sequenced complete genomes of 172 isolates sampled from important wheat growing regions worldwide, including Oregon, Texas, and New York (United States), Switzerland, Iran, South Africa, and Australia. These populations were sampled between 1991 and 2010 and incorporate a wide range of climatic conditions and agricultural practices. First, I tested the hypothesis of natural selection causing population divergence for local adaptation. I performed a common-garden experiment to collect precise quantitative phenotypic estimates of growth rates and melanization under a range of fungicide concentrations and temperatures. Phenotypic variation was used to estimate population differentiation for quantitative traits among populations (QST). The population genetic differentiation (FST) was calculated based on 50,000 neutral single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) markers. Employing a QST – FST comparison, I found that growth rates at 30°C and fungicide resistance estimates were under diversifying selection among populations while balancing selection was predominant for growth rates at 18°C and 24°C, as well for melanization. I found evidence for phenotypic trade-offs between growth rates and melanization at 30°C. Next, I investigated the genetic basis underlying variation for fungicide resistance. I show that non-synonymous mutations in the target gene CYP51 are linked to increased fungicide resistance against demethylation inhibitors. Furthermore, I performed a genome-wide association study to map phenotypic variation to a SNP dataset of 436,365 genome-wide bi-allelic markers, which unveiled novel resistance determinants. I found 34 significantly associated SNPs, including CYP51 and a novel major facilitator superfamily (MFS) linked to fungicide variation. The increase in resistance as determined by the joint effects of the MFS and CYP51 mutations occurred in a non-additive manner. I found no evidence for genetic trade-offs constraining fungicide resistance evolution. Finally, I included additional genome sequences totalling 366 strains to resolve the population structure of P. nodorum and investigate transposable elements (TEs) as drivers of genetic variation. I corroborate that populations are highly admixed, harbor high genetic diversity, and show evidence for frequent sexual recombination. Interestingly, despite robust genomic defenses called repeat induced-point (RIP) mutations, I found evidence for recently inserted TEs across the genome. I found no support that genetic bottlenecks incurred a TE burst among populations in P. nodorum. Moreover, TE copy number expansion was driven by miniature TEs as shown by a high GC content indicating an escape from RIP mutations. Overall, this PhD thesis demonstrates the potential of population genomics in unveiling evolutionary forces driving pathogen adaptation, as well as the genetic basis of adaptation and different sources of genetic novelty among populations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000453101",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453101","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Adaptation||plant pathogen||genome-wide association studies (GWAS)||transposable elements||Fungicide resistance","Evolutionary and population genomics of the wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2020-11-25T18:55:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"26866",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous work has used synthetic genotype-phenotype landscapes to study how such mutation bias affects adaptive evolution. Here, we consider 746 empirical genotype-phenotype landscapes, each of which describes the binding affinity of target DNA sequences to a transcription factor, to study the influence of mutation bias on adaptive evolution of increased binding affinity. By using empirical genotype-phenotype landscapes, we need to make only few assumptions about landscape topography and about the DNA sequences that each landscape contains. The latter is particularly important because the set of sequences that a landscape contains determines the types of mutations that can occur along a mutational path to an adaptive peak. That is, landscapes can exhibit a composition bias—a statistical enrichment of a particular type of mutation relative to a null expectation, throughout an entire landscape or along particular mutational paths—that is independent of any bias in the mutation process. Our results reveal the way in which composition bias interacts with biases in the mutation process under different population genetic conditions, and how such interaction impacts fundamental properties of adaptive evolution, such as its predictability, as well as the evolution of genetic diversity and mutational robustness.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000446220",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008296","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446220","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Mutation bias interacts with composition bias to influence adaptive evolution","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-16T03:39:47Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Regulatory logic and the evolution of promoter complexity","170604","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,"85092216662",,"000576176400002","PLOS comput. biol.","9","PLoS Computational Biology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Given that guard cells possess several characteristics of sink tissues, their metabolic activities should largely depend on mesophyll-derived sugars. Early biochemical studies revealed sugar uptake into guard cells. However, the transporters that are involved and their relative contribution to guard cell function are not yet known. Here, we identified the monosaccharide/proton symporters Sugar Transport Protein 1 and 4 (STP1 and STP4) as the major plasma membrane hexose sugar transporters in the guard cells of Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that their combined action is required for glucose import to guard cells, providing carbon sources for starch accumulation and light-induced stomatal opening that are essential for plant growth. These findings highlight mesophyll-derived glucose as an important metabolite connecting stomatal movements with photosynthesis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000426918",,"1469-221X||1469-3178","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/426918||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438561","10.15252/embr.201949719","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/441415","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Glucose||Guard cells||Plant growth||Stomatal opening||Sugar transport protein","Glucose uptake to guard cells via STP transporters provides carbon sources for stomatal opening and plant growth","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-07-19T02:35:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,"IDP Bridging Plant Science and Policy||Mechanistic insights into the adaptive plasticity of plant starch metabolism||Rewiring starch metabolism for plant environmental adaptation||Boosting technology transfer and responsible research and innovation (RRI) in plant sciences","608422||166539||185241||722338","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","EC||SNF||SNF||EC","FP7||H2020||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85087460343",,"000545353400001||000559775700010","EMBO rep.","8","EMBO Reports","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Our results show that although pOXA-48 produced an overall reduction in bacterial fitness, the DFE was dominated by quasi-neutral effects, and beneficial effects were observed in several isolates. Incorporating these data into a simple population dynamics model revealed a new set of conditions for plasmid stability in bacterial communities, with plasmid persistence increasing with bacterial diversity and becoming less dependent on conjugation. Moreover, genomic results showed a link between plasmid fitness effects and bacterial phylogeny, helping to explain pOXA-48 epidemiology.

We estimated land surface black-sky albedo at shortwave, near-infrared and visible spectral regions at a fixed solar zenith angle (i.e., 38∘) during peak growing season in 2005 on a global scale. In addition, we estimated the links between albedo and forest structure variables including forest density [the number of trees/km2], tree cover [percent], and leaf area index [m2/m2] over pure forest pixels during peak growing season in 2005 on a global scale. We acquired and processed remotely sensed variables from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat satellite images. This article provides 1) dataset of black-sky albedo at fixed solar zenith angle at a 1-km spatial resolution, 2) comparison between black-sky albedos at fixed solar zenith angle and local noon at a 1-km spatial resolution that are grouped based on forest types with the classes of evergreen needleleaf, evergreen broadleaf, deciduous needleleaf, deciduous broadleaf, mixed and woody savannah forests, and also the major biome zones including boreal, mediterranean, temperate and tropical region. 3) the links between black-sky albedo at fixed solar zenith angle and forest structure using generalized additive models at a 0.5-degree spatial resolution during peak growing season in 2005. The pre-processing steps to enhance the accuracy of these datasets include: (1) identifying pure forest pixels, (2) excluding high slope pixels and those covered partially by water in the albedo product using high spatial resolution water (i.e., 30-m spatial resolution) and slope (i.e., 90-m spatial resolution) masks, and (3) using the most recent collection (collection 6) of MODIS satellite images.

In cranberries, phytoplasma infection causes false blossom disease, which is vectored by blunt-nosed leafhoppers (Limotettix vaccinii Van Duzee). We explored how phytoplasma infection of vegetative cranberry tissues affects the developmental performance and host preferences of L. vaccinii, and compared volatile emissions and phytohormone levels of infected and uninfected plants. In no-choice performance assays, L. vaccinii survival was similar on infected and uninfected cranberry plants. However, nymphs on infected plants took longer to reach adulthood, and produced larger adults, than those on uninfected plants. In oviposition tests, L. vaccinii females laid more eggs on uninfected than phytoplasma-infected cranberry plants. Olfactometer studies revealed preferences of L. vaccinii nymphs and adults for odors of uninfected plants when compared to clean air but not when compared to infected plants. Uninfected plants emitted higher amounts of volatiles than infected plants, particularly (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1, 3, 7-nonatriene, dodecane, and germacrene-D; however, we observed no effect of infection on phytohormone levels. Overall, our data show an oviposition preference of L. vaccinii for healthy plants, whereas our attraction data show no preference between infected and uninfected plants. While slower development on phytoplasma-infected cranberry plants led to larger adult size, there was no evidence for any beneficial effects of infection on other L. vaccinii performance parameters. Results from these studies are of relevance to understand tripartite plant-phytoplasma-insect vector interactions and are discussed in the context of the vector manipulation hypothesis. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,,,"0098-0331||1573-1561",,"10.1007/s10886-019-01137-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432233","en","Springer",,,"Vaccinium macrocarpon||Blunt-nosed leafhoppers||No-choice tests||Olfactometer assays||Volatile compounds||Phytohormones","Phytoplasma Infection of Cranberry Affects Development and Oviposition, but Not Host-Plant Selection, of the Insect Vector Limotettix vaccinii","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-08-22T02:56:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85076930388",,"000561062100009","J.

We performed a QST - FST comparison using 164 strains of Parastagonospora nodorum sampled from eight global field populations to disentangle the predominant evolutionary forces driving population divergence in a wheat pathogen. We used digital image analysis to obtain quantitative measurements of growth rate and melanization at different temperatures and under different fungicide concentrations in a common garden experiment. FST measures were based on complete genome sequences obtained for all 164 isolates. Our analyses indicated that all measured traits were under selection. Growth rates at 18 °C and 24 °C were under stabilizing selection (QST < FST), while diversifying selection (QST > FST) was the predominant evolutionary force affecting growth under fungicide and high temperature stress. Stabilizing selection (QST < FST) was the predominant force affecting melanization across the different environments. Melanin production increased at 30 °C but was negatively correlated with higher growth rates, consistent with a trade-off under heat stress. Our results demonstrate that global populations of P. nodorum possess significant evolutionary potential to adapt to changing local conditions, including warmer temperatures and applications of fungicides.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000417500",,"1087-1845||1096-0937",,"10.1016/j.fgb.2020.103398","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/417500","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Population genetics||Pathogen evolution||Thermal adaptation||Fungicide resistance||Diversifying selection||Parastagonospora nodorum","Natural selection drives population divergence for local adaptation in a wheat pathogen","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-30T03:18:51Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85085128432",,"000540713000001","Fungal genet. biol.",,"Fungal Genetics and Biology","141","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the current work, we have measured the persistence and growth of a multidrug resistant strain of Shigella flexneri 2a YSH6000 under a mock release of lethal concentration of oxytetracycline in microcosms of River Thames water. The water was sampled from upstream (lower levels of pollution) and downstream (higher levels of pollution) of London city centre. In our in-vitro microcosms, in the presence of 160 g/mL of oxytetracycline, growth of S. flexneri in the downstream sector was up to 2 log(cfu/mL) higher relative to the upstream sector. This difference in growth is a sum of undefined interactions of different chemicals with the antibiotic. We extrapolated the contribution of two abundant pollutants in downstream sector: iron and phenanthrene. In the presence of selection pressure, iron at a concentration of 6.49 mg/L was found to foster the growth of resistant bacteria while phenanthrene at concentration of 160 g/L reduced the growth of the resistant strain. In addition, label free proteomics analysis showed that there are 64 proteins that were differentially expressed by the bacteria exposed to the upstream section versus the downstream sector.

Infections by such pathogens are challenging to control as they often arise through complex interactions between plants, pathogens and the plant microbiome4,5. Experimental studies of this natural ecosystem at the microbiome-wide scale are rare, and consequently we have a poor understanding of how the taxonomic and functional microbiome composition and the resulting ecological interactions affect pathogen growth and disease outbreak. Here, we combine DNA-based soil microbiome analysis with in vitro and in planta bioassays to show that competition for iron via secreted siderophore molecules is a good predictor of microbe–pathogen interactions and plant protection. We examined the ability of 2,150 individual bacterial members of 80 rhizosphere microbiomes, covering all major phylogenetic lineages, to suppress the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum, a global phytopathogen capable of infecting various crops6,7. We found that secreted siderophores altered microbiome–pathogen interactions from complete pathogen suppression to strong facilitation. Rhizosphere microbiome members with growth-inhibitory siderophores could often suppress the pathogen in vitro as well as in natural and greenhouse soils, and protect tomato plants from infection. Conversely, rhizosphere microbiome members with growth-promotive siderophores were often inferior in competition and facilitated plant infection by the pathogen. Because siderophores are a chemically diverse group of molecules, with each siderophore type relying on a compatible receptor for iron uptake8,9,10,11,12, our results suggest that pathogen-suppressive microbiome members produce siderophores that the pathogen cannot use. Our study establishes a causal mechanistic link between microbiome-level competition for iron and plant protection and opens promising avenues to use siderophore-mediated interactions as a tool for microbiome engineering and pathogen control.",,,,"2058-5276",,"10.1038/s41564-020-0719-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551357","en","Nature",,,"Bacteria||Microbial ecology||Plant symbiosis||Soil microbiology","Competition for iron drives phytopathogen control by natural rhizosphere microbiomes","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-06-08T11:12:43Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000531783200001","Nat Microbiol","8","Nature Microbiology","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the rules governing the repertoire of traits encoded on MGEs remain unclear. In this study, we uncovered the central role of genetic dominance shaping genetic cargo in MGEs, using antibiotic resistance as a model system. MGEs are typically present in more than one copy per host bacterium, and as a consequence, genetic dominance favors the fixation of dominant mutations over recessive ones. In addition, genetic dominance also determines the phenotypic effects of horizontally acquired MGE-encoded genes, silencing recessive alleles if the recipient bacterium already carries a wild-type copy of the gene. The combination of these two effects governs the catalog of genes encoded on MGEs. Our results help to understand how MGEs evolve and spread, uncovering the neglected influence of genetic dominance on bacterial evolution. Moreover, our findings offer a framework to forecast the spread and evolvability of MGE-encoded genes, which encode traits of key human interest, such as virulence or antibiotic resistance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460913",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2001240117","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460913","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","mobile genetic elements||antibiotic resistance||evolution||genetic dominance","Genetic dominance governs the evolution and spread of mobile genetic elements in bacteria","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-10T22:46:37Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","27","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","117","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In serial-dilution evolution experiments, three key traits are the lag time when transitioning from starvation to growth, the exponential growth rate, and the yield (number of cells per unit resource). Here, we investigate how these traits evolve in laboratory evolution experiments using a minimal model of population dynamics, where the only interaction between cells is competition for a single limiting resource. We find that the fixation probability of a beneficial mutation depends on a linear combination of its growth rate and lag time relative to its immediate ancestor, even under clonal interference. The relative selective pressure on growth rate and lag time is set by the dilution factor; a larger dilution factor favors the adaptation of growth rate over the adaptation of lag time. The model shows that yield, however, is under no direct selection. We also show how the adaptation speeds of growth and lag depend on experimental parameters and the underlying supply of mutations. Finally, we investigate the evolution of covariation between these traits across populations, which reveals that the population growth rate and lag time can evolve a nonzero correlation even if mutations have uncorrelated effects on the two traits. Altogether these results provide useful guidance to future experiments on microbial evolution. © 2020 by the Genetics Society of America.",,,,"1943-2631",,"10.1534/genetics.120.303149","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/426892","en","Genetics Society of America",,,"Microbial evolution||Fixation probability||Adaptation rate","Evolution of Microbial Growth Traits Under Serial Dilution","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-07-18T03:03:44Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Molecular mechanisms and evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy and single-cell variation in microbial growth","180147","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,"85087731611",,"000548924000015",,"3","Genetics","215","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The other cheese population originated more recently from the selection of a single clonal lineage, was associated with all types of blue cheese worldwide except Roquefort, and displayed phenotypes more suited for industrial cheese production (high lipolytic activity, efficient cheese cavity colonization ability and salt tolerance).

Complex networks have been useful to link experimental data with mechanistic models, and have become widely used across many scientific disciplines. Recently, the increasing amount and complexity of data, particularly in biology, has prompted the development of multidimensional networks, where dimensions reflect the multiple qualitative properties of nodes, links or both. As a consequence, traditional quantities computed in single dimensional networks should be adapted to incorporate this new information. A particularly important problem is the detection of communities, namely sets of nodes sharing certain properties, which reduces the complexity of the networks, hence facilitating its interpretation. 2.	In this work, we propose an operative definition of ‘function’ for the nodes in multidimensional networks. We exploit this definition to show that it is possible to detect two types of communities: (a) modules, which are communities more densely connected within their members than with nodes belonging to other communities, and (b) guilds, which are sets of nodes connected with the same neighbours, even if they are not connected themselves. We provide two quantities to optimally detect both types of communities, whose relative values reflect their importance in the network. 3.	The flexibility of the method allowed us to analyse different ecological examples encompassing mutualistic, trophic and microbial networks. We showed that by considering both metrics we were able to obtain deeper ecological insights about how these different ecological communities were structured. The method mapped pools of species with properties that were known in advance, such as plants and pollinators. Other types of communities found, when contrasted with external data, turned out to be ecologically meaningful, allowing us to identify species with important functional roles or the influence of environmental variables. Furthermore, we found that the method was sensitive to community‐level topological properties like nestedness. 4.	In ecology there is often a need to identify groupings including trophic levels, guilds, functional groups or ecotypes. The method is therefore important in providing an objective means of distinguishing modules and guilds. The method we developed, functionInk (functional linkage), is computationally efficient at handling large multidimensional networks since it does not require optimization procedures or tests of robustness.

This process is activated via phototropin-mediated blue light signaling downstream of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase. It remains unknown how guard cell starch degradation integrates with light-regulated membrane transport processes in the fine control of stomatal opening kinetics. We report that H+, K+, and Cl− transport across the guard cell plasma membrane is unaltered in the amy3 bam1 mutant, suggesting that starch degradation products do not directly affect the capacity to transport ions. Enzymatic quantification revealed that after 30 min of blue light illumination, amy3 bam1 guard cells had similar malate levels as the wild type, but had dramatically altered sugar homeostasis, with almost undetectable amounts of Glc. Thus, Glc, not malate, is the major starch-derived metabolite in Arabidopsis guard cells. We further show that impaired starch degradation in the amy3 bam1 mutant resulted in an increase in the time constant for opening of 40 min. We conclude that rapid starch degradation at dawn is required to maintain the cytoplasmic sugar pool, clearly needed for fast stomatal opening. The conversion and exchange of metabolites between subcellular compartments therefore coordinates the energetic and metabolic status of the cell with membrane ion transport.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000431114",,"1040-4651||1531-298X||1532-298X",,"10.1105/tpc.18.00802","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/431114","en","American Society of Plant Physiologists","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Guard Cell Starch Degradation Yields Glucose for Rapid Stomatal Opening in Arabidopsis","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-08-12T03:02:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Mechanistic insights into the adaptive plasticity of plant starch metabolism||Rewiring starch metabolism for plant environmental adaptation","166539||185241","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85087443594",,,"Plant Cell","7","The Plant Cell","32","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Commensal bacteria such asEscherichia coli,Streptococcus pneumoniaeorStaphylococcus aureus, are also opportunistic pathogens causing a large fraction of the community-acquired and hospital-acquired bacterial infections. Multidrug resistance (MDR) makes these infections harder to treat with antibiotics and may thus cause substantial additional morbidity and mortality. Here, we develop an evolutionary epidemiology model to identify the factors favouring the evolution of MDR in commensal bacteria. The model describes the evolution of antibiotic resistance in a commensal bacterial species evolving in a host population subjected to multiple antibiotic treatments. We combine statistical analysis of a large number of simulations and mathematical analysis to understand the model behaviour. We find that MDR evolves more readily when it is less costly than expected from the combinations of single resistances (positive epistasis). MDR frequently evolves when bacteria are in contact with multiple drugs prescribed in the host population, even if individual hosts are only treated with a single drug at a time. MDR is favoured when the host population is structured in different classes that vary in their rates of antibiotic treatment. However, under most circumstances, recombination between loci involved in resistance does not meaningfully affect the equilibrium frequency of MDR. Together, these results suggest that MDR is a frequent evolutionary outcome in commensal bacteria that encounter the variety of antibiotics prescribed in the host population. A better characterization of the variability in antibiotic use across the host population (e.g. across age classes or geographical location) would help predict which MDR genotypes will most readily evolve.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000432115",,"1742-5689||1742-5662","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432115||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/439487","10.1098/rsif.2020.0105","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/441745","en","Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Antimicrobial resistance||Multidrug resistance||Mathematical modelling||Adaptation","Factors favouring the evolution of multidrug resistance in bacteria: Factors favouring the evolution of multidrug resistance in bacteria","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-08-20T09:43:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85090129758",,"000556902400003","J.

Understanding whether susceptibility to different types of antibacterials is non‐randomly associated across natural and clinical bacteria is therefore important for predicting the spread of resistance, yet there is no consensus about the extent of such associations or underlying mechanisms. We tested for associations between susceptibility phenotypes of 93 natural and clinical Escherichia coli isolates to various NAAs and antibiotics. Across all compound combinations, we detected a small number of non‐random associations, including a trio of positive associations among chloramphenicol, triclosan and benzalkonium chloride. We investigated genetic mechanisms that can explain such associations using genomic information, genetic knockouts and experimental evolution. This revealed some mutations that are selected for by experimental exposure to one compound and confer cross‐resistance to other compounds. Surprisingly, these interactions were asymmetric: selection for chloramphenicol resistance conferred cross‐resistance to triclosan and benzalkonium chloride, but selection for triclosan resistance did not confer cross‐resistance to other compounds. These results identify genetic changes involved in variable cross‐resistance across antibiotics and NAAs, potentially contributing to associations in natural and clinical bacteria.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000409060",,"1462-2912||1462-2920",,"10.1111/1462-2920.14986","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/409060","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Associations between sensitivity to antibiotics, disinfectants and heavy metals in natural, clinical and laboratory isolates of Escherichia coli","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-04-09T02:47:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85082328479",,"000521433400001","Environ. microbiol.","7","Environmental Microbiology","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Comparative genome analyses of several fungal pathogens revealed highly variable genomes, for many species characterized by specific repeat-rich genome compartments with exceptionally high sequence variability. Dynamic genome structure may enable fast adaptation to host genetics. The wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici with its highly variable genome, has emerged as a model organism to study genome evolution of plant pathogens. Here, we compared genomes of Z. tritici isolates and of sister species infecting wild grasses to address the evolution of genome composition and structure.  Results: Using long-read technology, we sequenced and assembled genomes of Z. ardabiliae, Z. brevis, Z. pseudotritici and Z. passerinii, together with two isolates of Z. tritici. We report a high extent of genome collinearity among Zymoseptoria species and high conservation of genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures of compartmentalization. We identify high gene content variability both within and between species. In addition, such variability is mainly limited to the accessory chromosomes and accessory compartments. Despite strong host specificity and non-overlapping host-range between species, predicted effectors are mainly shared among Zymoseptoria species, yet exhibiting a high level of presence-absence polymorphism within Z. tritici. Using in planta transcriptomic data from Z. tritici, we suggest different roles for the shared orthologs and for the accessory genes during infection of their hosts.  Conclusion: Despite previous reports of high genomic plasticity in Z. tritici, we describe here a high level of conservation in genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic composition and structure across the genus Zymoseptoria. The compartmentalized genome allows the maintenance of a functional core genome co-occurring with a highly variable accessory genome.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591922",,,,"10.21203/rs.2.19638/v4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591922","en","Research Square","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Genome compartmentalization predates species divergence in the plant pathogen genus Zymoseptoria","Working Paper","Open access",,,"2023-01-12T09:55:16Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,"97819827",,,,,,,"Research Square",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We take advantage of natural variations in permafrost melt to conduct a space-for-time study on Ellesmere Island in northern Canada. We demonstrate that phenological timing can be delayed in thermokarst areas when compared to stable ground, and that this change is a function of shifting species composition in these vegetation communities as well as delayed timing within species. These findings suggest that a warming climate could result in an overall broadening of blooming and leafing windows at the landscape level when these delayed timings are taken into consideration with the projected advance of phenological timings in ice-poor areas. We emphasize that the impacts of geomorphic processes on key phenological drivers are essential for enhancing our understanding of community response to climate warming in the high Arctic, with implications for ecosystem functioning and trophic interactions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429134",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2020.00759","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429134","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","leaf phenology||flower phenology||permafrost||geomorphology||ground stability||Arctic||plant ecology","The Importance of Incorporating Landscape Change for Predictions of Climate-Induced Plant Phenological Shifts","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-07-30T07:10:27Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000549232400001","Front.

Each has its own strengths and limitations (see the Timber Tracking Tool Infogram), but together they offer a broad range of methods that can assist us in identifying the botanical as well as the geographic origin (provenance) of most kinds of timber samples, even those smaller than 1 cm3. With this guide we want to provide an overview of the current best-practice methods used to analyse data derived from different wood identification methods, while presenting their respective strengths and limitations. We give advice on data analysis, from the development of reference data, through to the verification of identity and provenance of unknown samples against the reference database. We end with an expert view on combining methods for wood identification and discuss how timber identification possibilities could expand in the future. The guide is meant for all researchers doing identification work to support regular law enforcement measures, initiatives for transparent supply chains, and continued scientific research. Undertaking forensic casework is qualitatively different from undertaking scientific research (UNODC 2016)1. To support court cases, the chain of custody of evidence material must be tracked and reference material must be valid. How to fulfil all requirements for forensic timber identification will not be discussed here. Instead, we refer to the best practice guide of the UNODC (2016) and the standards and guidelines of the Society for Wildlife Forensic Sciences. We hope that this guide will be a first step towards the harmonisation of data analysis procedures within the global network of wood identification experts; and will facilitate collaborations, further innovations, and ensure reliable timber tracking methods.","application/pdf",,,,,"10.13140/RG.2.2.21518.79689","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454243","en","Global Timber Tracking Network (GTTN)",,,,"Overview of current practices in data analysis for wood identification","Other Publication","Metadata only",,,"2020-12-02T12:54:26Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Past work has often focused on pairs of interacting species, but observations of extant communities suggest that coevolution in nature occurs in networks of antagonism and mutualism. We discuss challenges for measuring coevolutionary dynamics in species-rich communities, and we suggest ways that established approaches used for two-species interactions can be applied. We propose ways that such data can be complemented by genomic information and linked back to extant communities via network structure, and we suggest avenues for new theoretical work to strengthen these connections. Quantifying coevolution in species-rich communities has several potential benefits, such as identifying coevolutionary units within networks and uncovering coevolutionary interactions among pathogens of humans, livestock, and crops.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000410978",,"0169-5347||1872-8383",,"10.1016/j.tree.2020.02.002","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/410978","en","Cell Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","coevolution||fluctuating selection||ecological networks||community structure||time-shift","Measuring Coevolutionary Dynamics in Species-Rich Communities","Review Article","Open access",,,"2020-04-21T15:20:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,"The role of bacteria-virus interactions in antimicrobial resistance","165803","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85080975964",,"000532680000010","Trends Ecol Evol","6","Trends in Ecology & Evolution","35","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we review the results and conclusions of ecometabolomic studies on the impacts of four main drivers of global change (increasing frequencies of drought episodes, heat stress, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and increasing nitrogen (N) loads) on plant metabolism. Ecometabolomic studies of drought effects confirmed findings of previous target studies, in which most changes in metabolism are characterized by increased concentrations of soluble sugars and carbohydrate derivatives and frequently also by elevated concentrations of free amino acids. Secondary metabolites, especially flavonoids and terpenes, also commonly exhibited increased concentrations when drought intensified. Under heat and increasing N loads, soluble amino acids derived from glutamate and glutamine were the most responsive metabolites. Foliar metabolic responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations were dominated by greater production of monosaccharides and associated synthesis of secondary metabolites, such as terpenes, rather than secondary metabolites synthesized along longer sugar pathways involving N-rich precursor molecules, such as those formed from cyclic amino acids and along the shikimate pathway. We suggest that breeding for crop genotypes tolerant to drought and heat stress should be based on their capacity to increase the concentrations of C-rich compounds more than the concentrations of smaller N-rich molecules, such as amino acids. This could facilitate rapid and efficient stress response by reducing protein catabolism without compromising enzymatic capacity or increasing the requirement for re-transcription and de novo biosynthesis of proteins.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000420676",,"2218-1989",,"10.3390/metabo10060239","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/420676","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","flavonoids||free amino acids||gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)||proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (1H-NMR)||isoflavonoids||liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)||phenolics||shikimate acid||soluble sugars||terpenes","Ecometabolomics for a better understanding of plant responses and acclimation to abiotic factors linked to global change","Review Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-16T11:35:08Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85086167989",,,,"6","Metabolites","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the characterization of the structure of spatial networks has not received nearly as much attention as networks of species interactions counterparts. Recent experiments show the dynamical implications of modularity to buffer perturbations, and theory shows that several other processes might be impacted if spatial networks were modular, from disease transmission to gene flow. Yet the question is, are spatial networks actually modular? Even though some case studies have found modular structures, we lack a general answer to that question. Here, I show that modularity is a naturally emergent property of spatial networks. This finding is further reinforced by analyzing real patchy habitats. Furthermore, I show that there is no need for any other biological process other than dispersal in order to generate a significantly modular spatial network. Modularity is explained by the spatial heterogeneity in the density of habitat fragments. The fact that spatial networks are intrinsically modular might have direct consequences for population and evolutionary dynamics. Modules define the spatial limits of populations and the role each habitat fragment plays in ecological dynamics; they become the relevant scale at which a multitude of processes occur.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000462698",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-020-65669-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462698","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Generic Emergence of Modularity in Spatial Networks","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-14T15:44:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85085362238",,"000540472300028","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using a unified framework, we simultaneously test prior hypotheses on rates of HGT and a key evolutionary covariate (duration of carriage) as determinants of resistance frequencies. We conclude that in this setting, there is little evidence of HGT playing a major role in determining resistance frequencies. Instead, observed resistance frequencies are best explained as the outcome of selection acting on a pool of variants, irrespective of the rate at which resistance determinants move between genetic lineages.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000420658",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.aaz6137","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/420658","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Horizontal gene transfer rate is not the primary determinant of observed antibiotic resistance frequencies in Streptococcus pneumoniae","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-16T11:21:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85086639487",,"000537235300025","Sci Adv","21","Science Advances","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A rapidly growing body of research now shows that many of these effects are driven by social interactions among the symbionts. For instance, microbes frequently cooperate by producing shareable “public goods” that can mediate both virulence and host-beneficial functions. Conversely, hosts often exert control over symbionts by targeting their social interactions. Despite this pivotal role, we have only started to uncover the full diversity of microbial interactions, and many of the factors that shape variation in their effects on host function and evolution across different symbioses remain elusive. Here, we (i) review the known diversity of microbial interactions across different symbioses, and (ii) argue that variation in their nature and impact is often determined by differences in symbiont diversity. In particular, we first give a primer on the social lives of microbes, and then discuss how intraspecific and interspecific interactions among microbial symbionts affect – and are affected by – their host. Subsequently, we move to the evolution of symbiosis, and discuss the role of microbial interactions in symbioses that feature only few versus many different symbiont species. We show that symbiont-rich symbioses are shaped by strong interspecific competition, which selects against many host-beneficial forms of microbial cooperation, and thereby limits the scope for the evolution of strong host-symbiont dependencies. Conversely, symbioses involving only few symbiont species are often characterized by forms of microbial cooperation that mediate host-beneficial services, a situation that increases the scope for the evolution of host-symbiont dependencies. Overall, we infer that the explicit consideration of social dynamics within symbiont communities of varying complexity is crucial to advance our understanding of how microbes shape animal function and evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000551335",,"2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2020.00132","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551335","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","symbiosis||microbiota||public goods||sociality||cooperation||competition","Cooperation and Conflict Within the Microbiota and Their Effects On Animal Hosts","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2022-06-08T10:55:37Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,"85085605555",,"000556726000001","Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The more essential to the emergence of the dynamical behavior of cancer growth these interactions are, the more effectively they may be used as mechanisms for interventions. Mathematical modeling can help unearth such connections, and help explain how they shape the dynamics of cancer growth. Here, we explored whether there exist simple, consistent properties of cancer-immune system interaction (CISI) models that might be harnessed to devise effective immunotherapy approaches. We did this for a family of three related models of increasing complexity. To this end, we developed a base model of CISI, which captures some essential features of the more complex models built on it. We find that the base model and its derivates can plausibly reproduce biological behavior that is consistent with the notion of an immunological barrier. This behavior is also in accord with situations in which the suppressive effects exerted by cancer cells on immune cells dominate their proliferative effects. Under these circumstances, the model family may display a pattern of bistability, where two distinct, stable states (a cancer-free, and a full-grown cancer state) are possible. Increasing the effectiveness of immune-caused cancer cell killing may remove the basis for bistability, and abruptly tip the dynamics of the system into a cancer-free state. Additionally, in combination with the administration of immune effector cells, modifications in cancer cell killing may be harnessed for immunotherapy without the need for resolving the bistability. We use these ideas to test immunotherapeutic interventions in silico in a stochastic version of the base model. This bistability-reliant approach to cancer interventions might offer advantages over those that comprise gradual declines in cancer cell numbers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000403160",,"0022-5193||1095-8541",,"10.1016/j.jtbi.2020.110185","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/403160","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Cancer||Mathematical modeling||Immunotherapy||Cancer-immune system interactions","Cancer-induced immunosuppression can enable effectiveness of immunotherapy through bistability generation: A mathematical and computational examination","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-03-05T03:20:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85079904253",,"000530652800002","J Theor Biol",,"Journal of Theoretical Biology","492","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, linking such empirical scaling laws to the critical regime of realistic individual-based model classes is difficult. Here, we reveal new empirical scaling evidence associated with a transition in the population and the chlorophyll dynamics of phytoplankton. We offer a possible explanation for these observations by deriving scaling laws in the vicinity of the critical point of a new universality class of non-local cell growth and division models. This ""criticality hypothesis"" can be tested through new scaling predictions derived for our model class, for the response of chlorophyll distributions to perturbations. The derived scaling laws may also be generalized to other cellular traits and environmental drivers relevant to phytoplankton ecology.",,,,"1054-1500||1089-7682",,"10.1063/1.5141755","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462699","en","American Institute of Physics",,,,"Second-order phase transition in phytoplankton trait dynamics","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-14T15:44:47Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85086008334",,"000531692100001","Chaos","5","Chaos","30","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As adapted pathogens including Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Tm) have evolved evasion strategies, it has remained unclear when and where inflammasomes restrict their dissemination. Bacterial population dynamics establish that the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome specifically restricts S. Tm migration from the gut to draining lymph nodes. This is solely attributable to NAIP/NLRC4 within intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), while S. Tm evades restriction by phagocyte NAIP/NLRC4. NLRP3 and Caspase-11 also fail to restrict S. Tm mucosa traversal, migration to lymph nodes, and systemic pathogen growth. The ability of IECs (not phagocytes) to mount a NAIP/NLRC4 defense in vivo is explained by particularly high NAIP/NLRC4 expression in IECs and the necessity for epithelium-invading S. Tm to express the NAIP1-6 ligands—flagella and type-III-secretion-system-1. Imaging reveals both ligands to be promptly downregulated following IEC-traversal. These results highlight the importance of intestinal epithelial NAIP/NLRC4 in blocking bacterial dissemination in vivo, and explain why this constitutes a uniquely evasion-proof defense against the adapted enteropathogen S. Tm.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000394274",,"1933-0219||1935-3456",,"10.1038/s41385-019-0247-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/394274","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Intestinal epithelial NAIP/NLRC4 restricts systemic dissemination of the adapted pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium due to site-specific bacterial PAMP expression","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-27T12:19:27Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Deciphering the initial steps that lead to Salmonella Typhimurium diarrhea||Multiscale model of bacterial cell-cell interactions||Assessing phylodynamic methods in silico and in vitro||How to resolve dysbiosis: Understanding and manipulating mechanisms of T cell-microbiota crosstalk||Self-assembling glycoprotein nanoparticle vaccines","173338||679209||179170||185128||180953","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||EC||SNF||SNF||SNF","H2020||Bridge - Discovery||Exzellenzbeitrag in Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85078245951",,"000508068400001","Mucosal Immunol","3","Mucosal Immunology","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02030 - Dep.

In this review, we discuss how microbial physiology and community assembly processes determine microbial growth rate and efficiency and, in turn, soil organic C cycling through the lens of community ecology. We introduce a conceptual framework cataloging life history (i.e., growth rate, resource acquisition, and stress tolerance) and assembly traits (i.e., competition, facilitation, and dispersal) that correspond with different growth efficiencies. We also compare how dominant mycorrhizal fungal type affects growth efficiency. We propose that further development and inclusion of specific community parameters in microbial-explicit Earth system models are needed for accurately predicting soil organic C responses to global change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450970",,"2590-3322",,"10.1016/j.oneear.2020.03.006","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450970","en","Cell Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","carbon sequestration||carbon use efficiency||growth efficiency||microbial physiology||soil organic matter","Distinct Assembly Processes and Microbial Communities Constrain Soil Organic Carbon Formation","Review Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-12T09:35:46Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Alternative stable states of the forest microbiome: causes and carbon-climate consequences of forest mycorrhizal game interactions","179900","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,"85086776074",,"000645246900013",,"4","One Earth","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Two fundamentally different processes shape the epidemiology of CPE in hospitals: the dissemination of CPE clones from patient to patient (between-patient transfer), and the transfer of carbapenemase-encoding plasmids between enterobacteria in the gut microbiota of individual patients (within-patient transfer). The relative contribution of each process to the overall dissemination of carbapenem resistance in hospitals remains poorly understood. Here, we used mechanistic models combining epidemiological data from more than 9,000 patients with whole genome sequence information from 250 enterobacteria clones to characterise the dissemination routes of the carbapenemase-encoding plasmid pOXA-48 in a hospital setting over a two-year period. Our results revealed frequent between-patient transmission of high-risk pOXA-48-carrying clones, mostly of Klebsiella pneumoniae and sporadically Escherichia coli. The results also identified pOXA-48 dissemination hotspots within the hospital, such as specific wards and individual rooms within wards. Using high-resolution plasmid sequence analysis, we uncovered the pervasive within-patient transfer of pOXA-48, suggesting that horizontal plasmid transfer occurs in the gut of virtually every colonised patient. The complex and multifaceted epidemiological scenario exposed by this study provides new insights for the development of intervention strategies to control the in-hospital spread of CPE.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000473472",,,,"10.1101/2020.04.20.050476","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473472","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Dissemination routes of the carbapenem resistance plasmid pOXA-48 in a hospital setting","Working Paper","Open access",,,"2021-03-08T15:59:44Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,"72590830",,,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Interactions with other microorganisms in such communities might suppress growth and resistance evolution of individual species (e.g., via resource competition) but could also potentially accelerate resistance evolution via horizontal transfer of resistance genes. It remains unclear how these different effects balance out, partly because it is difficult to observe them directly. Here, we used a gut microcosm approach to quantify the effect of three human gut microbiome communities on growth and resistance evolution of a focal strain of Escherichia coli. We found the resident microbial communities not only suppressed growth and colonisation by focal E. coli but also prevented it from evolving antibiotic resistance upon exposure to a beta-lactam antibiotic. With samples from all three human donors, our focal E. coli strain only evolved antibiotic resistance in the absence of the resident microbial community, even though we found resistance genes, including a highly effective resistance plasmid, in resident microbial communities. We identified physical constraints on plasmid transfer that can explain why our focal strain failed to acquire some of these beneficial resistance genes, and we found some chromosomal resistance mutations were only beneficial in the absence of the resident microbiota. This suggests, depending on in situ gene transfer dynamics, interactions with resident microbiota can inhibit antibiotic-resistance evolution of individual species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000410994",,"1544-9173||1545-7885","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/410976||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/410977","10.1371/journal.pbio.3000465","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/410994","en","PLoS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Resident microbial communities inhibit growth and antibiotic-resistance evolution of Escherichia coli in human gut microbiome samples","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-04-22T05:35:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,"The role of bacteria-virus interactions in antimicrobial resistance","165803","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85084204880",,"000531804900017","PLoS biol.","4","PLoS Biology","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Niche adaptation and ultimately the formation of ecotypes and speciation in this genus has been suggested to be mainly driven by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) through mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Our knowledge about the diversity and distribution of Vibrio MGEs is heavily biased towards human pathogens and our understanding of the distribution of core genomic signatures and accessory genes encoded on MGEs within specific Vibrio clades is still incomplete. We used nine different strains of the marine bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus isolated from pipefish in the Kiel-Fjord to perform a multiscale-comparative genomic approach that allowed us to investigate (1) those genomic signatures that characterize a habitat-specific ecotype and (2) the source of genomic variation within this ecotype.  Results We found that the nine isolates from the Kiel-Fjord have a closed-pangenome and did not differ based on core-genomic signatures. Unique genomic regions and a unique repertoire of MGEs within the Kiel-Fjord isolates suggest that the acquisition of gene-blocks by HGT played an important role in the evolution of this ecotype. Additionally, we found that ~90% of the genomic variation among the nine isolates is encoded on MGEs, which supports ongoing theory that accessory genes are predominately located on MGEs and shared by HGT. Lastly, we could show that these nine isolates share a unique virulence and resistance profile which clearly separates them from all other investigated V. alginolyticus strains and suggests that these are habitat-specific genes, required for a successful colonization of the pipefish, the niche of this ecotype.  Conclusion We conclude that all nine V. alginolyticus strains from the Kiel-Fjord belong to a unique ecotype, which we named the Kiel-alginolyticus ecotype. The low sequence variation of the core-genome in combination with the presence of MGE encoded relevant traits, as well as the presence of a suitable niche (here the pipefish), suggest, that this ecotype might have evolved from a clonal expansion following HGT driven niche-adaptation.",,,,,,"10.21203/rs.2.23653/v2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462582","en","Research Square",,,"Pangenome||Mega-plasmids||Mobile genetic elements||Horizontal gene transfer||Genomic islands||Niche-adaptation","Genomic variation among closely related Vibrio alginolyticus strains is located on mobile genetic elements","Working Paper","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-14T13:28:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"72138556",,,,,,,"Research Square",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The foraging of a large number of individuals may alter the chemical and bacterial composition of food and in turn affect individual's traits. Here we used Drosophila melanogaster to explore these assumptions. First, we used a wide larval density gradient to investigate the impact of crowding on phenotypical traits. We confirmed that high densities increased development time and pupation height, and decreased viability and body mass. Next, we measured concentrations of common metabolic wastes (ammonia, uric acid) and characterized bacterial communities, both in food and in larvae, for three contrasting larval densities (low, medium and high). Ammonia concentration increased in food from medium and high larval densities, but remained low in larvae regardless of the larval density. Uric acid did not accumulate in food but was detected in larvae. Surprisingly, bacterial composition remained stable in guts of larvae whatever their rearing density, although it drastically changed in the food. Overall, these results indicate that crowding deeply affects individuals, and also their abiotic and biotic surroundings. Environmental bacterial communities likely adapt to altered nutritional situations resulting from crowding, putatively acting as scavengers of larval metabolic wastes.",,,,"0168-6496||1574-6941",,"10.1093/femsec/fiaa055","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462701","en","Oxford University Press",,,"larval density||crowding||microbiota||metabolic wastes||Uric acid||ammonia","Larval density affects phenotype and surrounding bacterial community without altering gut microbiota in Drosophila melanogaster","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-14T15:45:04Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85083042405",,"000536495600018","FEMS microbiol. ecol.","4","FEMS Microbiology Ecology","96","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Climate change has the potential to shape the future of infectious diseases, both directly and indirectly. In aquatic systems, for example, elevated temperatures can modulate the infectivity of waterborne parasites and affect the immune response of zooplanktonic hosts. Moreover, lake warming causes shifts in the communities of primary producers towards cyanobacterial dominance, thus lowering the quality of zooplankton diet. This may further affect host fitness, resulting in suboptimal resources available for parasite growth.  2.    Previous experimental studies have demonstrated the respective effects of temperature and host diet on infection outcomes, using the zooplankter Daphnia and its microparasites as model systems. Although cyanobacteria blooms and heat waves are concurrent events in nature, few attempts have been made to combine both stressors in experimental settings.  3.    Here, we raised the zooplankter Daphnia (two genotypes) under a full factorial design with varying levels of temperature (the standard 19°C and elevated 23°C), food quality (Scenedesmus obliquus as high‐quality green algae, Microcystis aeruginosa and Planktothrix agardhii as low‐quality cyanobacteria) and exposed them to the parasitic yeast Metschnikowia bicuspidata. We recorded life history parameters of the host as well as parasite traits related to transmission.  4.    The combination of low‐quality cyanobacterial diets and elevated temperature resulted in additive detrimental effects on host fecundity. Low‐quality diets reduced parasite output, while temperature effects were context dependent. Overall, we argue that the combined effects of elevated water temperature and poor‐quality diets may decrease epidemics of a common fungal parasite under a climate change scenario.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000462688",,"0046-5070||1365-2427",,"10.1111/fwb.13464","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462688","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate change||cyanobacteria||Disease spreading||Metschnikowia||zooplankton","Temperature and host diet jointly influence the outcome of infection in a Daphnia‐fungal parasite system","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-14T15:40:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85076930887",,"000503759500001","Freshw. biol.","4","Freshwater Biology","65","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In eumetazoa, distal regulatory elements called enhancers play a key role in determining the structure of such networks, particularly the wiring diagram of “who regulates whom.” Mutations that affect enhancer activity can therefore rewire regulatory networks, potentially causing adaptive changes in gene expression. Here, we use whole-tissue and single-cell transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility data from mouse to show that enhancers play an additional role in the evolution of regulatory networks: They facilitate network growth by creating transcriptionally active regions of open chromatin that are conducive to de novo gene evolution. Specifically, our comparative transcriptomic analysis with three other mammalian species shows that young, mouse-specific intergenic open reading frames are preferentially located near enhancers, whereas older open reading frames are not. Mouse-specific intergenic open reading frames that are proximal to enhancers are more highly and stably transcribed than those that are not proximal to enhancers or promoters, and they are transcribed in a limited diversity of cellular contexts. Furthermore, we report several instances of mouse-specific intergenic open reading frames proximal to promoters showing evidence of being repurposed enhancers. We also show that open reading frames gradually acquire interactions with enhancers over macroevolutionary timescales, helping integrate genes—those that have arisen de novo or by other means—into existing regulatory networks. Taken together, our results highlight a dual role of enhancers in expanding and rewiring gene regulatory networks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000407129",,"0737-4038||1537-1719",,"10.1093/molbev/msz300","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/407129","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","enhancer||de novo gene||regulatory network||gene regulation||transcription","Enhancers Facilitate the Birth of De Novo Genes and Gene Integration into Regulatory Networks","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-03-30T04:04:59Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Regulatory logic and the evolution of promoter complexity","170604","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,"85082147789",,"000522248100017","Mol Biol Evol","4","Molecular Biology and Evolution","37","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Do pollination specialization and syndromes influence floral modularity?  In order to test these hypotheses and answer this question, we focused on the genus Erica: we gathered 3D data from flowers of 19 species with diverse syndromes via computed tomography, and for the first time tested the above‐mentioned hypotheses via 3D geometric morphometrics. To provide an evolutionary framework for our results, we tested the evolutionary mode of floral shape, size and integration under the syndromes regime, and – for the first time – reconstructed the high‐dimensional floral shape of their most recent common ancestor.  We demonstrate that the modularity of the 3D shape of generalist flowers depends on development and that of specialists is linked to function: modules of pollen deposition and receipt in bird syndrome, and access‐restriction to the floral reward in long‐proboscid fly syndrome. Only size and shape principal component 1 showed multiple‐optima selection, suggesting that they were co‐opted during evolution to adapt flowers to novel pollinators. Whole floral shape followed an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (selection‐driven) evolutionary model, and differentiated relatively late.  Flower shape modularity thus crucially depends on pollinator specialization and syndrome.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000382294",,"0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.16337","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/382294","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Developmental modularity||Functional modularity||Flower shape||Integration||Modularity||Pollination syndromes||Spandrel","Modularity and evolution of flower shape: the role of function, development, and spandrels in","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-12-03T12:08:41Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85077884423",,"000506066100001","New Phytol.","1","New Phytologist","226","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Vom Erreichen diese Ziele sind wir heute weit entfernt. In der Schweiz verfügen wir zurzeit weder über ein Konzept, wie genetische Vielfalt bzw. genetische Diversität erfasst werden kann, noch haben wir Indikatoren, an Hand derer wir in Zukunft Veränderungen der genetischen Vielfalt feststellen können. Die genetische Vielfalt ist eine der vier Ebenen der Biodiversität, also der Vielfalt des Lebens, welche aus der Vielfalt der Gene, Arten, Ökosysteme und deren Wechselbeziehungen besteht. Genetische Vielfalt ist das Rohmaterial für die Evolution, das für die Weiterentwicklung und Anpassung von Arten und Populationen notwendig ist. Somit ist sie eine Voraussetzung dafür, dass sich Organismen an ihre belebte und unbelebte Umwelt anpassen können. Genetische Vielfalt beeinflusst auch die Ökosystem-Stabilität. In dieser Machbarkeitsstudie zur Untersuchung des Zustands und der Veränderung der genetischen Vielfalt schlagen wir vor, dass für 50 Arten aus den drei grossen Reichen – Tiere, Pflanzen und Pilze – und rund 17'000 Individuen die genetische Vielfalt schweizweit in allen sechs biogeographischen Regionen untersucht wird. Die zu untersuchenden Arten müssen einer Vielfalt von Kriterien genügen, z.B. seltene und häufige Arten, sowie Arten welche durch anthropogene Faktoren, wie z.B. Klimawandel oder Habitat-Fragmentierung betroffen sind. Gleichzeitig sollten sie Synergien mit anderen Biodiversitäts-Monitorings ermöglichen. Der technische Fortschritt im Bereich der DNA-Sequenzierung erlaubt es heute das Erbgut (Genom) von hunderten von Individuen zu sequenzieren und sehr präzise Informationen zur genetischen Vielfalt von Individuen, Population und Arten zu erheben. Da sich die genetische Vielfalt meistens nicht kurzfristig verändert und mit dem hier vorgeschlagen Monitoring erst eine Basis für die Erfassung zukünftiger Veränderungen erarbeitet wird, empfehlen wir zusätzlich ein retrospektives Monitoring der genetischen Vielfalt durchzuführen. Dieses erlaubt es Informationen über den Zustand und die Veränderung der genetischen Vielfalt über die Zeit zu erhalten. Dank zahlreichen und gut dokumentierten Museum- und Herbarium-Proben ist es möglich, Informationen zur genetischen Vielfalt vor mehr als 100 Jahren in der Schweiz zu erhalten. Da es sich bei einem Monitoring der genetischen Vielfalt um ein sehr grosses und komplexes Projekt handelt, empfehlen wir, vorgängig eine 3-jährige Pilotstudie durchführen um Erfahrungen zu sammeln. Dabei würden für fünf Arten heutige Populationen schweizweit genetisch untersucht und zwei Arten auch in einer retrospektiven Analyse behandelt. Die Kostenberechnungen beinhalten drei mögliche Varianten und eine 3-jährige Pilotstudie. Variante 1: Ein vollständiges Monitoring der genetischen Vielfalt mit Stichprobennahme, genetischen und retrospektiven Analysen würde Kosten im Bereich von 9.7 Mio CHF pro 5-Jahres Zyklus generieren. Variante 2: Ein Monitoring der genetischen Vielfalt mit Stichprobennahme und genetischen Analysen ohne retrospektives Monitoring würde ungefähr 8.5 Mio CHF pro 5-Jahreszyklus kosten. Variante 3: Ein Monitoring der genetischen Vielfalt, welches im Moment nur die Stichprobennahme umfasst und die Sequenzierarbeiten erst zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt ausführen würde (z.B. nach einer zweiten Stichprobennahme nach 5 Jahren) würde Kosten im Bereich 4 von 3.9 Mio CHF verursachen. Eine 3-jährige Pilotstudie für fünf Arten (davon zwei Arten auch retrospektiv), würde 1.2 Mio CHF kosten. Der Einbezug von Stakeholdern vereinfacht eine transparente und effiziente Kommunikation und steigert die Akzeptanz von Prozessen. Deshalb wurde im Rahmen der Machbarkeitsstudie eine Stakeholderanalyse durchgeführt. Die Analyse erhob die Meinungen und Bedürfnisse von Schweizer Stakeholdern aus Verwaltung, Wirtschaft, NGOs, Museen und Wissenschaft, welche potenziell von einem Monitoring der genetischen Vielfalt profitieren würden. Zudem wurde untersucht, welche Stakeholder für die Entwicklung eines genetischen Monitorings besonders wichtig wären und welche Stakeholder zu diesem Thema bereits miteinander in Kontakt stehen. Experteninterviews und Online-Fragebögen zeigten, dass die befragten Stakeholder ein grosses Interesse an einem genetischen Monitoring haben. Sie sind sich der zurzeit fehlenden Grundlagen im Bereich genetische Vielfalt bewusst und sehen, dass ein Monitoring der genetischen Vielfalt für ihre Arbeitsbereiche gewinnbringend wäre. Dabei wurde besonders häufig die Überprüfung von Vernetzungsmassnahmen genannt. Stakeholder äusserten auch Bedenken gegenüber einem genetischen Monitoring. Dabei wurden die geringen zeitlichen und finanziellen Ressourcen der Kantone wie auch die Befürchtung, dass die erhobenen Daten in der Praxis zu wenig genutzt würden, genannt. Eine offene Kommunikation der Möglichkeiten und Grenzen eines genetischen Monitorings und ein enger Einbezug der Stakeholder sind somit für eine erfolgreiche Implementierung eines genetischen Monitorings in der Schweiz entscheidend. Aufgrund der vorliegenden Machbarkeitsstudie empfehlen wir zuerst eine Pilotstudie zur Untersuchung der genetischen Vielfalt in der Schweiz durchzuführen, um Erfahrungen zu sammeln und Wissenslücken zu schliessen. Die Pilotstudie kann später von einem umfangreichen genetischen Monitoring abgelöst werden bzw. in ein solches einbezogen werden.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000453093",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453093","de","ETH Zürich, Departement Umweltsystemwissenschaften","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Monitoring der genetischen Diversität","Machbarkeitsstudie zur Untersuchung des Zustands und der Veränderung der genetischen Vielfalt: Vernetzung, Inzucht und Anpassungsfähigkeit","Report","Open access",,,"2020-11-25T16:22:37Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Brassicaceae can still be colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), but species like Arabidopsis thaliana experience growth reductions following AMF colonization at similar magnitude to that of fungal pathogen infections and lack key genes necessary for nutrient exchange. Arabidopsis also produces specific secondary compounds via the modification of tryptophan, including indolic glucosinolates (IGs), which have anti‐fungal properties and may therefore be involved in reducing AMF colonization. This study therefore addressed whether the ability to produce IGs facilitates resistance to AMF colonization and growth suppression. We challenged with AMF inoculation transgenic Arabidopsis lines which produce no or enhanced IGs levels in comparison with the wild‐type. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculation suppressed the development of IG‐removed plants, activated their pathogen‐response defenses, and enhanced AMF vesicle colonization of their root systems. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi had no detrimental effects on wild‐type or IG‐enhanced plants. Using BLAST to identify IG orthologs across 29 Brassicales, we also show that non‐mycorrhizal species possess orthologous proteins for IG biosynthesis to Arabidopsis which AMF‐associated Brassicales lack. In conclusion, the IG production pathway appears to serve an important and previously unknown role in reducing AMF colonization in Arabidopsis and may serve similar functions in non‐host Brassicales more broadly.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000415869",,"2150-8925",,"10.1002/ecs2.3100","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/415869","en","ESA","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","Arabidopsis||arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi||Brassicaceae||glucosinolates||indolic glucosinolates","Indolic glucosinolate pathway provides resistance to mycorrhizal fungal colonization in a non‐host Brassicaceae","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-20T02:57:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85084443058",,"000536583400009",,"4","Ecosphere","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Grassland soils remain important reservoirs of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Herbivores may affect both C and N pools and these changes likely interact with increases in soil nutrient availability. Given the scale of grassland soil fluxes, such changes can have striking consequences for atmospheric C concentrations and the climate. Here, we use the Nutrient Network experiment to examine the responses of soil C and N pools to mammalian herbivore exclusion across 22 grasslands, under ambient and elevated nutrient availabilities (fertilized with NPK + micronutrients). We show that the impact of herbivore exclusion on soil C and N pools depends on fertilization. Under ambient nutrient conditions, we observed no effect of herbivore exclusion, but under elevated nutrient supply, pools are smaller upon herbivore exclusion. The highest mean soil C and N pools were found in grazed and fertilized plots. The decrease in soil C and N upon herbivore exclusion in combination with fertilization correlated with a decrease in aboveground plant biomass and microbial activity, indicating a reduced storage of organic matter and microbial residues as soil C and N. The response of soil C and N pools to herbivore exclusion was contingent on temperature – herbivores likely cause losses of C and N in colder sites and increases in warmer sites.

The genomes of individuals from the same population can exhibit different numbers of chromosomes and different organization of chromosomal segments, defining so-called accessory compartments that have been shown to be crucial to pathogenicity in plant-infecting fungi. This high level of structural variation confers a methodological challenge for population genomic analyses. Variant discovery from population sequencing data is typically achieved using established pipelines based on the mapping of short reads to a reference genome. These pipelines have been developed, and extensively used, for eukaryote genomes of both plants and animals, to retrieve single nucleotide polymorphisms and short insertions and deletions. However, they do not permit the inference of large-scale genomic structural variation, as this task typically requires the alignment of complete genome sequences. Here, we compare traditional variant discovery approaches to a pipeline based on de novo genome assembly of short read data followed by whole genome alignment, using simulated data sets with properties mimicking that of fungal pathogen genomes. We show that the latter approach exhibits levels of performance comparable to that of read-mapping based methodologies, when used on sequence data with sufficient coverage. We argue that this approach further allows additional types of genomic diversity to be explored, in particular as long-read third-generation sequencing technologies are becoming increasingly available to generate population genomic data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000463732",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2020.00626","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/463732","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","population genomics||fungal pathogens||next-generation sequencing||genome alignment||variant calling||genome assembly","On Variant Discovery in Genomes of Fungal Plant Pathogens","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-19T12:54:11Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Identifying the effect of changing DOC on phytoplankton nutrient limitation is complicated by spatial covariation between atmospheric N deposition and increasing DOC in areas where lake browning occurs. We conducted nutrient-limitation assays in 27 lakes from three sites along gradients of climate and atmospheric N deposition in Sweden. Within each site, lakes were selected to represent the range of DOC concentrations. We also conducted statistical analyses of large-scale lake survey data (n = 4768 lakes divided into 47 regions) to investigate relationships between DOC and nutrient stoichiometry while controlling for differences in N deposition. Our findings confirmed that most lakes were dual-limited by both N and P in the south, whereas northern lakes were primarily N-limited. Throughout Sweden the ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to total phosphorus (TP) declined with increasing DOC in most regions, suggesting that browner lakes are more likely to be N limited. These results were not supported by our nutrient limitation assays, which identified no relationship between DOC and relative strength of limitation by N or P. Increased DOC also resulted in significant increases in both total and inorganic N and P fractions, suggesting that other factors such as light limitation or increased top-down control become more important as DOC increases.",,,,"1015-1621||1420-9055",,"10.1007/s00027-020-00718-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462687","en","Springer",,,"Arctic lakes||Boreal lakes||Dissolved organic carbon||Nitrogen||Phosphorus||Phytoplankton Sweden","Does browning affect the identity of limiting nutrients in lakes?","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-14T15:40:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85082704352",,"000522418100001","Aquat.

To assess the degree of past and current hybridization, the level of genetic admixture in populations needs to be investigated. Ongoing hybridization and blurred species separation have made it challenging to assign European white oak taxa based on leaf morphology and/or genetic markers and to assess the level of admixture. Therefore, there is a need for powerful markers that differentiate between taxa. Here, we established a condensed set of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to reliably differentiate between the three most common oak species in temperate European forests (Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens) and to assess the degree of admixture in a large set of selected Swiss populations.  Methods A training set of 194 presumably pure reference samples from Switzerland and Europe was used to assign 633 test individuals with two different approaches (population genetic-based/Bayesian vs. assumption-free/discriminative classifier) using 58 selected SNPs from coding regions. Admixture was calculated at the individual and population level with the Shannon diversity index based on individual assignment probabilities.  Key Results Depending on the approach, 97.5–100 % of training individuals were assigned correctly, and additional analyses showed that the established SNP set could be further reduced while maintaining its discriminatory power. The two assignment approaches showed high overlap (99 %) in assigning training individuals and slightly less overlap in test individuals (84 %). Levels of admixture varied widely among populations. Mixed stands of Q. petraea and Q. pubescens revealed much higher degrees of admixture than mixed stands of the other two taxon pairs, accentuating high levels of gene flow between these two taxa in Switzerland.  Conclusions Our set of SNPs warrants reliable taxon discrimination with great potential for further applications. We show that the three European white oak taxa have largely retained their species integrity in Switzerland despite high levels of admixture.",,,,"1095-8290||0305-7364",,"10.1093/aob/mcaa001","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461199","en","Oxford University Press",,,"Admixture||Hybridization||Quercus||SNPs||Taxon assignment||White oaks","A species-discriminatory single-nucleotide polymorphism set reveals maintenance of species integrity in hybridizing European white oaks (Quercus spp.) despite high levels of admixture","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-11T12:07:03Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ann Bot","4","Annals of Botany","125","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

But few social systems afford sufficient control over group composition to precisely quantify its effects on individual and collective behavior. Here we combine experimental and theoretical approaches to study the effect of group composition on individual behavior and division of labor (DOL) in a social insect. Experimentally, we use automated behavioral tracking to monitor 120 colonies of the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi, with controlled variation in three key correlates of social insect behavior: genotype, age, and morphology. We find that each of these sources of heterogeneity generates a distinct pattern of behavioral organization, including the amplification or dampening of inherent behavioral differences in colonies with mixed types. Theoretically, we use a well-studied model of DOL to explore potential mechanisms underlying the experimental findings. We find that the simplest implementation of this model, which assumes that heterogeneous individuals differ only in response thresholds, could only partially recapitulate the empirically observed patterns of behavior. However, the full spectrum of observed phenomena was recapitulated by extending the model to incorporate two factors that are biologically meaningful but theoretically rarely considered: variation among workers in task performance efficiency and among larvae in task demand. Our results thus show that different sources of heterogeneity within social groups can generate different, sometimes non-intuitive, behavioral effects, but that relatively simple models can capture these dynamics and thereby begin to elucidate the basic organizational principles of DOL in social insects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000447997",,,,"10.1101/2020.03.05.963207","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/447997","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","collective behavior||division of labor||self-organization||response threshold model||clonal raider ant","Emergent behavioral organization in heterogeneous groups of a social insect","Working Paper","Open access",,,"2020-10-26T15:53:09Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, how networks of interacting species respond to these changes remains poorly understood. We described aquatic food webs using invertebrate and fish community composition, functional traits and stable isotopes from twelve agricultural streams along a landscape disturbance gradient. We predicted that excessive deposition of fine inorganic sediment (sedimentation) associated with agricultural activities would negatively influence aquatic trophic diversity (e.g. reduced vertical and horizontal trophic niche breadths). We hypothesized that multiple mechanisms might cause trophic niche 'compression', as indicated by changes in realized trophic roles. Food-web properties based on consumer stable isotope data (delta(13) C and delta(15) N) showed that increasing sediment disturbance was associated with reduced trophic diversity. In particular, the aquatic invertebrate community occupied a smaller area in isotopic niche space along the sedimentation gradient that was best explained by a narrowing of the invertebrate community delta(13) C range. Decreased niche partitioning, driven by increasing habitat homogeneity, environmental filtering and resource scarcity all seemingly lead to greater trophic equivalency caused by the collapse of the autochthonous food-web channel. Bayesian mixing-model analyses supported this contention with invertebrate consumers increasingly reliant on detritus along the sedimentation gradient, and predatory invertebrates relying more on the prey using these basal resources. The narrowing of the fish community delta(13) C range along the sedimentation gradient contributed to an apparent 'trophic shift' towards terrestrial carbon, further indicating the loss of the autochthonous food-web channel. On the vertical trophic niche axis, fish became increasingly separated from aquatic invertebrates with an increase in their estimated trophic position. In combination, these responses were most likely mediated through reduced fish densities and a diminished reliance on aquatic prey. Although species losses remain a major threat to ecosystem integrity, the functional roles of biota that persist dictate how food webs and ecosystem functioning respond to environmental change. Sedimentation was associated with nonlinear reductions in trophic diversity which could affect the functioning and stability of aquatic ecosystems. Our study helps explain how multiple mechanisms may radically reshape food-web properties in response to this type of disturbance.",,,,"0021-8790||1365-2656",,"10.1111/1365-2656.13142","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462705","en","Wiley",,,"agriculture||fine sediment||food webs||isotopic niche||sedimentation||stable isotopes||stream communities||trophic diversity","Mechanisms of trophic niche compression: Evidence from landscape disturbance","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-14T15:46:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85075744313",,"000498855200001","J. anim. ecol.","3","The Journal of Animal Ecology","89","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Furthermore, diet can affect gut microbiota composition and abundance, with indirect consequences for the host.

In each of these diets, we compared flies with conventional vs. artificially altered gut microbiota with antibiotics that reduced the bacterial load. The antibiotic treatment also had the surprising effect of increasing the amount of live yeast associated with the flies. We characterized flies from these ten treatments (5 dietsx2 microbiota) in terms of development, body mass, food preference, body reserves, metabolic rate and a range of stress tolerance traits (heat, cold, starvation and desiccation tolerance). Diets, and to a lesser extent antibiotic treatment, affected development rate, weight, and cold tolerance of adult flies. Other traits such as energy reserves, metabolic rate, food preference, or starvation tolerance were affected by diet alone. When detected, the effect of antibiotic treatment was stronger in yeast-poor diets, suggesting that gut bacterial community might help to counterbalance nutritional deficiencies.

The wheat genome is derived at 85% from TEs, and contains thousands of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs), whose sequences are particularly prone for domestication into miRNA precursors. In this study, we investigate the contribution of TEs to the wheat small RNA immune response to the lineage-specific, obligate powdery mildew pathogen. We show that MITEs of the Mariner superfamily contribute the largest diversity of miRNAs to the wheat immune response. In particular, MITE precursors of miRNAs are wide-spread over the wheat genome, and highly conserved copies are found in the Lr34 and QPm.tut-4A mildew resistance loci.

The frequency and duration of flow intermittency in running waters are increasing due to climate change and water demands for human use. Intermittency effects on stream biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are dramatic and are expected to become increasingly prevalent in alpine landscapes in the near future. This project used modified field sensors to measure flow intermittency, temperature, and water origin (groundwater, precipitation, glacier) at high spatio-temporal resolution throughout an alpine fluvial network (Val Roseg, Switzerland). We continuously recorded water presence in 30 tributary streams and validated sensor performance with field-collected measures. Three different flow regimes were observed in the network, including periodically intermittent, seasonally intermittent, and permanently flowing streams. Twenty-four streams (80% of recorded streams) dried at least once during the sampling period. Principal components analysis along with generalized additive models showed alpine streams with low average temperature and high conductivity (groundwater-fed) were prone to permanent flow, whereas streams with higher average temperature and low conductivity (glacier-fed) typically had intermittent flow. The field sensors proved precise for simultaneously measuring flow intermittency, temperature, and water origin at high resolution throughout the river network. Overall, this approach provides an effective way to develop eco-hydrological models that examine the effects of flow intermittency on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in riverine networks.",,,,"0024-3590||1939-5590",,"10.1002/lno.11324","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/370459","en","John Wiley & Sons",,,,"High stream intermittency in an alpine fluvial network: Val Roseg, Switzerland","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2019-10-15T02:20:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85073951494",,"000488200500001","Limnol. oceanogr.","3","Limnology and Oceanography","65","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, no country is systematically monitoring the levels of genetic diversity in natural populations of wild species to date. Even Switzerland, who included genetic diversity in its national biodiversity strategy, only mon- itors species and landscape diversity. To explore the circumstances of implementing a genetic diversity monitoring program in Switzerland, we carried out a stakeholder analysis in the course of a feasibility study on genetic monitoring. We collected the data through expert interviews and an online survey. Based on this, we present the opinions and needs of different Swiss stakeholders regarding a nation- wide genetic monitoring program for populations of wild species. Swiss stakeholders are overall aware of the lack of evidence regarding the status of genetic diversity in populations and species. Accordingly, a majority is interested in the development of a monitoring program and see opportunities to apply it in their work. Nevertheless, some stakeholders express concerns, such as limited resources of regional authorities and the fear that results may not be applied in practice. We propose to consider our findings in the future development of monitoring programs, which should be globally implemented at national levels in forthcoming years.

In Switzerland, no con- cept of how genetic diversity can be monitored and how changes in genetic diversity over time can be inferred has previously been developed. However, recent progress in sequencing technology now al- lows sequencing the genomes of hundreds of individuals at low cost, providing robust estimates of the genetic diversity of populations and species. In a feasibility study we explored how extant genetic diver- sity and possible changes over time could be assessed across a variety of organisms to initiate a mon- itoring of genetic diversity, as a first step to its conservation and sustainable use. We propose that ge- netic diversity be monitored for 50 species from all major taxonomic groups using whole-genome re- sequencing. The proposed sampling encompasses about 17,000 individuals from all biogeographical regions of Switzerland. The selected species should meet a variety of criteria and include, e.g. rare and common species as well as species affected by climate change or habitat fragmentation. Since genetic diversity usually changes over extended time intervals, we further recommend a retrospective genetic diversity monitoring using samples from scientific collections. With the study of museum and herbarium samples we anticipate to reconstruct changes in genetic diversity over at least one century.

Approach  We measured within-species variation in leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), branch wood density (WD), and allocation to stem area vs. leaf area in branches (branch Huber value, HV) across the aridity range of seven Australian eucalypts and an Acacia species to explore how traits and their variances change with aridity.  Results and Conclusions  Within-species, we found consistent increases in LMA, LDMC and WD, and HV with increasing aridity, resulting in consistent trait coordination across tissues. However, this coordination only emerged across sites with large climate differences. Unlike trait means, patterns of trait variance with aridity were mixed across populations and species and showed limited support for constrained trait variation in dryer populations or more xeric species.  Synthesis  Our results highlight that climate can drive consistent within-species trait patterns, but that these patterns might often be obscured by the complex nature of morphological traits and sampling incomplete species ranges or sampling confounded stress gradients.",,,,,,"10.1101/2020.02.03.932715","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/464919","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory",,,,"Aridity drives coordinated trait shifts but not decreased trait variance across the geographic range of eight Australian trees","Working Paper","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-22T15:32:29Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, little is known about how herbivory on maternal plants affects offspring fitness. Furthermore, while inbreeding is known to reduce plant reproductive output, previous studies have not explored whether and how such effects may extend across generations. Here, we addressed the transgenerational consequences of herbivory and maternal plant inbreeding on the reproduction of Solanum carolinense offspring.  Methods Manduca sexta caterpillars were used to inflict weekly damage on inbred and outbred S. carolinense maternal plants. Cross‐pollinations were performed by hand to produce seed from herbivore‐damaged outbred plants, herbivore‐damaged inbred plants, undamaged outbred plants, and undamaged inbred plants. The resulting seeds were grown in the greenhouse to assess emergence rate and flower production in the absence of herbivores. We also grew offspring in the field to examine reproductive output under natural conditions.  Results We found transgenerational effects of herbivory and maternal plant inbreeding on seedling emergence and reproductive output. Offspring of herbivore‐damaged plants had greater emergence, flowered earlier, and produced more flowers and seeds than offspring of undamaged plants. Offspring of outbred maternal plants also had greater seedling emergence and reproductive output than offspring of inbred maternal plants, even though all offspring were outbred. Moreover, the effects of maternal plant inbreeding were more severe when plant offspring were grown in field conditions.  Conclusions This study demonstrates that both herbivory and inbreeding have fitness consequences that extend across generations even in outbred progeny.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000405048",,"1914-2016:||0002-9122",,"10.1002/ajb2.1402","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/405048","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","fitness||flower and fruit production||herbivory||horsenettle||inbreeding depression||Manduca sexta||maternal effects||seed germination||Solanaceae||transgenerational effects","Transgenerational impacts of herbivory and inbreeding on reproductive output in Solanum carolinense","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-03-16T08:20:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85077977346",,"000517463600012","Am.

Most adult populations in the Seychelles exhibit biased sex ratios, but it is unknown whether this is due to different proportions of male and female plants being produced or to differential mortality. In this study, we developed sex-linked markers in Lodoicea using ddRAD sequencing, enabling us to reliably determine the gender of immature individuals. We screened 589 immature individuals to explore sex ratios across life stages in Lodoicea. The two sex-specific markers resulted in the amplification of male-specific bands (Lm123977 at 405 bp and Lm435135 at 130 bp). Our study of four sub-populations of Lodoicea on the islands of Praslin and Curieuse revealed that the two sexes were produced in approximately equal numbers, with no significant deviation from a 1:1 ratio before the adult stage. We conclude that sex in Lodoicea is genetically determined, suggesting that Lodoicea has a chromosomal sex determination system in which males are the heterogametic sex (XY) and females are homogametic (XX). We discuss the potential causes for observed biased sex ratios in adult populations, and the implications of our results for the life history, ecology and conservation management of Lodoicea.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000407051",,"2041-2851",,"10.1093/aobpla/plz079","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/407051","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Borasseae||Conservation management||ddRAD sequencing||Dioecy||Lodoicea maldivica||Palm||Reproductive ecology||Sex-linked markers||Sex ratios||Seychelles Islands","Identification of sex-linked markers in the sexually cryptic coco de mer: are males and females produced in equal proportions?","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-03-28T10:31:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85096579107",,"000519580100008",,"1","AoB Plants","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We currently know very little about the combined effects of these changes on the links between the community structure, dynamics and the resulting in situ CO2 concentrations in freshwater ecosystems. Here we aimed to determine both individual and combined effects of temperature and non-resource diversity (species inedible for a given consumer) on CO2 concentration. Our analysis further aimed to establish both direct effects on CO2 concentrations and potential indirect effects that occur via changes to the phytoplankton and zooplankton biomasses. Our results showed that there were no interactive effects of changes in temperature and diversity on CO2 concentration in the water. Instead, independent increases in either temperature or non-resource diversity resulted in a substantial reduction in CO2 concentrations, particularly at the highest non-resource diversity. The effects of non-resource diversity and warming on CO2 were indirect, resulting largely from the positive impacts on total biomass of primary producers.

The expression of such ‘public good’ traits can be interdependent, and studies on laboratory systems have shown that trait linkage affects eco-evolutionary dynamics within bacterial communities. Here, we examine whether linkage among social traits occurs in natural habitats by examining investment levels and correlations between five public goods (biosurfactants, biofilm components, proteases, pyoverdines and toxic compounds) in 315 Pseudomonas isolates from soil and freshwater communities. Our phenotypic assays revealed that (i) social trait expression profiles varied dramatically; (ii) correlations between traits were frequent, exclusively positive and sometimes habitat-specific; and (iii) heterogeneous (specialised) trait repertoires were rarer than homogeneous (unspecialised) repertoires. Our results show that most isolates lie on a continuum between a ‘social’ type producing multiple public goods, and an ‘asocial’ type showing low investment into social traits. This segregation could reflect local adaptation to different microhabitats, or emerge from interactions between different social strategies. In the latter case, our findings suggest that the scope for competition among unspecialised isolates exceeds the scope for mutualistic exchange of different public goods between specialised isolates. Overall, our results indicate that complex interdependencies among social traits shape microbial lifestyles in nature.",,,,"0168-6496||1574-6941",,"10.1093/femsec/fiz185","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551330","en","Oxford University Press",,,"public goods||bacterial communities||pleiotropy||competition||mutualism||regulatory linkage","Positive linkage between bacterial social traits reveals that homogeneous rather than specialised behavioral repertoires prevail in natural Pseudomonas communities","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-06-08T10:49:42Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,"85077298846",,"000506803700006","FEMS microbiol. ecol.","1","FEMS Microbiology Ecology","96","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Soil microorganisms are central to the conversion of plant organic matter into SOC, yet the relationship between plant diversity, soil microbial growth, turnover as well as carbon use efficiency (CUE) and SOC accumulation is unknown. As heterotrophic soil microbes are primarily carbon limited, it is important to understand how they respond to increased plant‐derived carbon inputs at higher plant species richness (PSR). We used the long‐term grassland biodiversity experiment in Jena, Germany, to examine how microbial physiology responds to changes in plant diversity and how this affects SOC content. The Jena Experiment considers different numbers of species (1–60), functional groups (1–4) as well as functional identity (small herbs, tall herbs, grasses, and legumes). We found that PSR accelerated microbial growth and turnover and increased microbial biomass and necromass. PSR also accelerated microbial respiration, but this effect was less strong than for microbial growth. In contrast, PSR did not affect microbial CUE or biomass‐specific respiration. Structural equation models revealed that PSR had direct positive effects on root biomass, and thereby on microbial growth and microbial biomass carbon. Finally, PSR increased SOC content via its positive influence on microbial biomass carbon. We suggest that PSR favors faster rates of microbial growth and turnover, likely due to greater plant productivity, resulting in higher amounts of microbial biomass and necromass that translate into the observed increase in SOC. We thus identify the microbial mechanism linking species‐rich plant communities to a carbon cycle process of importance to Earth's climate system.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000365575",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.14777","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/365575","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Microbial activity||Microbial carbon use efficiency||Microbial necromass||Microbial turnover||Plant diversity||Soil organic carbon","Increased microbial growth, biomass, and turnover drive soil organic carbon accumulation at higher plant diversity","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-09-20T12:50:13Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Glob.

To address this gap, we collated 80 datasets from trait-based studies into a global database for metaCommunity Ecology: Species, Traits, Environment and Space; ""CESTES"". Each dataset includes four matrices: species community abundances or presences/absences across multiple sites, species trait information, environmental variables and spatial coordinates of the sampling sites. The CESTES database is a live database: it will be maintained and expanded in the future as new datasets become available. By its harmonized structure, and the diversity of ecosystem types, taxonomic groups, and spatial scales it covers, the CESTES database provides an important opportunity for synthetic trait-based research in community ecology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000462702",,"2052-4463",,"10.1038/s41597-019-0344-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462702","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A global database for metacommunity ecology, integrating species, traits, environment and space","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-14T15:45:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85077695167",,"000511432600001","Sci Data","1","Scientific Data","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These selective pressures are expected to leave a signature on the genetic material. However, exactly how selective pressures are imprinted on the genome is not yet fully understood. Especially when selection pressures are weak, sequencing data can show some patterns consistent with neutral evolution. This can lead to the application of methods that assume neutral evolution, which might produce biased results.  Several patterns of mutations, both within and between samples, are expected to contain information about the selective pressures present over the course of evolution in these systems. Parallel evolution -- where the same mutations appear independently in two or more lineages -- can be an indication for positive selection, while the consistent absence of mutations at certain sites can indicate purifying selection.  In this thesis, I present several avenues to understanding selection from sequencing data by combining simulations of sequence evolution with population genetic models and advanced statistical methods.  Using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) techniques to fit simulations to sequencing data from 97 patients in early HIV infection, I estimate a global mutational fitness effects distribution for early HIV infection.  Similarly, patterns of presence and absence across evolutionary lines in a long-term evolution experiment with HIV are used to detect the role of environment and history on the evolutionary dynamics of the virus in vitro. These results can then be used to determine characteristics of the underlying fitness landscape.  Unfortunately, patterns of mutations in viral populations can be difficult to interpret due to the complex evolutionary dynamics in these systems. I therefore also explore the use of neutral genetic tags in evolutionary experiments to directly quantify selection in an affordable and straightforward way.  With sequencing technologies getting better every day, the techniques presented here provide a piece in the puzzle to fully understand the evolutionary dynamics of viruses within their hosts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000468530",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468530","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","evolutionary biology","Estimating the Evolutionary Dynamics of Viruses from Sequencing Data","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2021-02-09T09:57:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27033",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Many years of research of mutualistic and antagonistic plant symbioses have provided insight into the complex interactions of plants with their symbionts. Manipulation of the plant immune system is crucial in the establishment of both mutualism and parasitism. Antagonistic and mutualistic microbial symbionts produce an arsenal of effector molecules that interact with the plant immune system to allow plant colonization. Accumulating evidence suggests that the plant immune system and effector molecules also are instrumental in determining the composition of the plant microbiota.

Consistent with this idea we identified six distinct community classes that contained samples collected from distant locations. Structural equation models showed there was a functional signature associated with each community class. We obtained a more mechanistic understanding of the classes using metagenomic predictions (PiCRUST). This approach allowed us to show that the classes contained distinct genetic repertoires reflecting community-level ecological strategies.

Using Myxococcus xanthus, a bacterium possessing two motility systems differing in effectiveness on hard vs. soft surfaces, we test (i) whether and how evolution while swarming on one surface—the selective surface—latently alters motility on the alternative surface type and (ii) whether patterns of such latent-phenotype evolution depend on the complexity of ancestral motility, specific ancestral motility genotypes and/or the selective surface of evolution. We analysze an experiment in which populations established from three ancestral genotypes—one with both motility systems intact and two others with one system debilitated—evolved while swarming across either hard or soft agar in six evolutionary treatments. We then compare motility-phenotype patterns across selective vs. alternative surface types.  Results Latent motility evolution was pervasive but varied in character as a function of the presence of one or two functional motility systems and, for some individual-treatment comparisons, the specific ancestral genotype and/or selective surface. Swarming rates on alternative vs. selective surfaces were positively correlated generally among populations with one functional motility system but not among those with two. This suggests that opportunities for pleiotropy and epistasis generated by increased genetic complexity underlying behavior can alter the character of latent-phenotype evolution. No tradeoff between motility performance across surface types was detected in the dual-system treatments, even after adaptation on a surface on which one motility system dominates strongly over the other in driving movement, but latent-phenotype evolution was instead idiosyncratic in these treatments. We further find that the magnitude of stochastic diversification at alternative-surface swarming among replicate populations greatly exceeded diversification of selective-surface swarming within some treatments and varied across treatments.  Conclusion Collectively, our results suggest that increases in the genetic and mechanistic complexity of behavior can increase the complexity of latent-phenotype evolution outcomes and illustrate that diversification manifested during evolution in one environment can be augmented greatly by diversification of latent phenotypes manifested later.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450216",,"1471-2148",,"10.1186/s12862-020-01707-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450216","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Dual motility||Indirect evolution||Pleiotropy||Social bacteria||MyxoEE-3","Hidden paths to endless forms most wonderful: Complexity of bacterial motility shapes diversification of latent phenotypes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-09T04:14:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85094974759",,"000590550500002","BMC evol. biol.","1","BMC Evolutionary Biology","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Knowledge about the population genetic structure of the pathogen in Asia is useful in identifying sources of infection and formulating sustainable management strategies for rice sheath blight. From a total of 717 isolates, 423 unique multilocus genotypes were detected based on nine microsatellite loci. The three country populations of R. solani AG-1 IA exhibited a mixed reproductive system, which included both sexual and asexual components. A moderate degree of clonality indicated that the asexual sclerotia represent important source of inoculum. Population subdivision varied within and among countries, fitting the isolation by distance model. While no subdivision was found among populations within Japan or within the Philippines, subdivision was detected among populations within China. Historic migration indicated high influx of immigrants from Japan into Northern, Central and Eastern China populations.

This enhanced thermal tolerance, which was associated with differential upregulation of three heat-shock protein genes, allowed aphids to occupy higher and warmer regions of infected host plants when displaced from cooler regions by competition with a larger aphid species, R. maidis. Infection thereby led to an expansion of the fundamental niche of the vector.

Prominent is the chemical defence of plant tissues, suggesting that condensed tannins can also be an important factor affecting litter decomposition, including through their capacity to precipitate proteins such as degradative exoenzymes. This chapter presents the acid butanol assay to quantify condensed tannins in decomposing leaf litter. It is based on the oxidative depolymerisation of condensed tannins under strongly acidic conditions in alcohols. This reaction yields anthocyanidins as cleavage products, which absorb light in the visible range and can thus be quantified spectrophotometrically. Condensed tannins in dried and ground litter are extracted in 50% methanol. A small aliquot of the extract is mixed with a ferrous sulphate solution in n-butanol containing HCl. Absorbance is immediately measured at 550 nm before heating the mix for 50 min. Absorbance is then measured again, the difference to the first measurement being due to the colour reaction of anthocyanidins.

Quantifying production rates is hence important for addressing many ecological questions. This chapter describes a method for estimating rates of bacterial production and growth rates by measuring the incorporation of [3H]leucine into bacterial protein. Decomposing plant litter is incubated with [3H]leucine for a given time, typically 30 min. Leucine incorporation is stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid and the resulting precipitated protein is extracted, successively washed, and collected on a membrane filter. The partially purified protein adhering to the filter and residual litter are combined, and the protein is dissolved in hot alkaline solution and radioassayed. Bacterial production is calculated as the amount of bacterial biomass produced per gram of plant litter dry mass, ash-free dry mass or carbon per unit time, or per stream, marsh or soil surface area if the amount of litter per square metre is known. In conjunction with estimates of bacterial biomass, BSP also allows calculating bacterial growth rate as another key variable describing bacterial population dynamics on decomposing litter.",,,"978-3-030-30514-7||978-3-030-30515-4",,,"10.1007/978-3-030-30515-4_30","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462684","en","Springer",,,"Bacterial growth rate||Chemical and physical properties||Enzymatic analysis||Forests||ecosystem||environment||Litter","Growth and Production of Litter-Associated Bacteria","Book Chapter","Metadata only","Methods to Study Litter Decomposition.

To facilitate the transition from conventional farming to agroecological farming, adequate methods and concepts to measure and assess impact and productivity of agroecological farming systems (AFSs) are needed, which consider their multifunctionality and other specific characteristics, here called agroecological sustainability assessment frameworks and tools (ASAFTs). In the past years, many agricultural sustainability assessment tools and frameworks were developed but their suitability and applicability to AFSs was not investigated. To close this knowledge gap, we aimed at identifying, reviewing, and discussing published ASAFTs in the context of international cooperation, providing an overview of the current challenges, needs, and requirements in assessing AFSs at the farm level with the means of indicators. Desktop and scientific database research was conducted to identify and discuss published indicator-based ASAFTs at the farm level. The analysis was based on the following four framework elements that the authors considered to be essential for ASAFTs: (1) the adaptability to local conditions all over the world, (2) the involvement of farmers in the development process, (3) the consideration of the multiple functions of an agroecosystem in the definition and measurement of its productivity, and (4) the accounting for interactions between multiple agroecosystem functions and their measurement. Only a few analyzed assessment frameworks at least partly consider these essential elements and were designed specifically for AFSs. However, our study also showed that these frameworks were (1) restricted in their geographical application scope, (2) quite heterogeneous and barely comparable, and (3) based on productivity indicators that do not fully capture the multiple functions of AFSs. Therefore, we identified the need for the development of appropriate agroecological productivity indicators and common standard or reference frameworks for assessing AFSs, which will be crucial for upscaling agroecology.",,,,"1708-3087",,"10.5751/ES-11774-250325","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446707","en","Resilience Alliance Publications",,,"agroecological assessment frameworks||agroecological transition||farmers' involvement||indicator interaction||multifunctionality","Main challenges and key features of indicator-based agroecological assessment frameworks in the context of international cooperation","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-10-20T04:48:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000575578700022",,"3","Ecology and Society","25","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Breakpoints of chromosome rearrangements are frequently in close proximity to transposable elements (TEs). TEs are known to mediate chromosome rearrangements through their own activity or through ectopic recombination. During this PhD we aimed to better understand the causes and consequences of chromosome rearrangements in Zymoseptoria tritici, an important pathogen of wheat. To study the origins of chromosome rearrangements the first chapter focusses on the de-repression of TEs, which is stress induced during a wheat infection cycle as well as in nutrient limited media. Stress was shown to drive epigenetic changes and trigger TE de-repression in multiple organisms. We find that TEs respond differently to stresses. Furthermore, effector genes in close proximity to TEs show a de-repression during early infection suggesting that TEs and effectors may be under the same epigenetic control. De-repressed TEs can place a mutational burden on the genome. Therefore, in the second chapter we aimed to quantify the number of chromosome rearrangements occurring in all 21 chromosomes in hundreds of progeny through a single round of meiosis. We find that the fidelity with which chromosomes go through meiosis differs between chromosomes. Chromosomes with a higher repeat content and lower synteny were less stable. In the final chapter we focused on a single rearranged chromosome that was generated by a self-fusion. We hypothesized that such a fused chromosome would go through degenerative breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles. Here we show the exact process whereby the highly unstable fused chromosome was created through ectopic recombination between a specific repeat family. We trace the fate of the novel chromosome through five rounds of meiosis and show that degenerative cycles occur through repeated ectopic recombination and non-disjunction. The ability of Z. tritici to tolerate chromosome duplications, losses and rearrangements makes this species a great model to observe and investigate the interplay between TE dynamics and chromosome rearrangements.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000425971",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/425971","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Drivers of genome evolution in a fungal pathogen of wheat","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2020-07-12T18:10:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"26555",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In particular in biodiversity hotspots, major knowledge gaps exist regarding the numbers of species, their morphological distinction, ecology, distribution and risk of extinction, as well as their possible commercial value and use. The pantropical genus Dalbergia L.f. (Fabaceae) includes precious timber species known as rosewoods or palisanders, many of which are threatened by habitat degradation and often illegal selective logging. The use of existing species circumscriptions and application of available identification keys is particularly challenging in Madagascar, where a large number of closely related species co-occur and where the reliance on flower and fruit characters for identification is high, even though these structures are often absent on living specimens. The resulting taxonomic uncertainties have important implications for national and international trade regulations and impede the setting of conservation priorities. The aim of this Ph.D. thesis was to increase our understanding of the number, morphological distinction and phylogenetic relationships between the Dalbergia species present in Madagascar. Towards this goal, I developed a genome-wide DNA analysis approach that I used in combination with morphological and eco-geographic analyses. In the first chapter, my collaborators and I explored the utility of target enrichment sequencing to assess genetic variation in Dalbergia at the level of populations and closely related species, and between divergent species within the genus. Specifically, we assessed the sequence capture sensitivity and specificity of 7,201 candidate genomic regions with a conserved core across available genomes of Papilionoideae, and identified 2,396 regions that can be efficiently recovered for genomic analyses across Dalbergia. We also explored the performance of the 7,201 candidate regions across legumes, and identified 1,005 target regions that can be efficiently recovered for analyses at the family level. These confirmed high levels of gene tree discordance, previously reported also by other authors, especially near the root of the family. Furthermore, our analyses resulted in the development of a general-purpose bioinformatics pipeline for scalable, streamlined and reproducible analysis of such genome-wide and complex datasets. In the second chapter, we employed the developed genomic and bioinformatic resources for species discovery within the genus Dalbergia from Madagascar and the Comoros. This led to the confirmation of 46 out of 49 already described and accepted species as separately evolving lineages, while three currently accepted species were identified as potential synonyms. Furthermore, we discovered 49 new candidate species, of which 14 could be delimited as separately evolving from one another and from the confirmed described species. Lineage separation could not be conclusively assessed for the remaining 35 candidate species because of a currently insufficient availability of high-quality collections. Phylogenomic analysis confirmed the existence of two diverse clades of Malagasy Dalbergia, one of which appears to be associated with a clade of species from continental Africa, as well as an isolated lineage, which also occurs in continental East Africa. It further revealed a fourth lineage present in Madagascar, which is connected to another clade of species from continental Africa, and a biogeographic connection between species of West Madagascar and the Comoros. In the third chapter, we completed the integrative taxonomic workflow for three confirmed evolutionary species of high conservation concern. Specifically, we newly described D. pseudomaritima Crameri, Phillipson & N. Wilding and D. razakamalalae Crameri, Phillipson & N. Wilding as distinct species occurring in littoral and low-elevation evergreen humid forests in southeast Madagascar, and emended the description of D. maritima R. Vig. from central-east Madagascar to exclude the two south-eastern species, with which it had previously been confused. For all three species we also performed conservation assessments according to the IUCN Red List categories and criteria, and assigned the category Endangered (EN) to all of them. A major result from this dissertation is the finding that the diversity of Dalbergia species in Madagascar has hitherto been vastly underestimated. Thanks to major recent efforts to sample and document Dalbergia species, and the developed sequence capture and high-throughput DNA sequencing approach, which provides unprecedented phylogenomic resolution, part of the species diversity existing in Madagascar could be uncovered. In combination with morphological and eco-geographic data we were able to show that several threatened species are not currently represented in existing protected areas and that some highly exploited species with presumably large distribution ranges are actually composed of several species with much narrower distribution ranges. These findings call for further investigations and conservation action, and provide scientific evidence that will hopefully foster science-based conservation efforts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000487274",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/487274","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Phylogenomics||Population genomics||Species delimitation||Next-generation sequencing||Taxonomy||FABACEAE (BOTANY)||Dalbergia (botany)||Leguminosae||Rosewood||Palisander||Madagascar||IUCN Red List of Threatened Species","Phylogenomics, Species Discovery and Integrative Taxonomy in Dalbergia (Fabaceae) Precious Woods from Madagascar","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2021-05-28T09:21:54Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27241",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Diversification of host-parasite interactions is frequently studied in the context of intrinsically selective coevolution, but the potential for host-parasite interaction phenotypes to diversify latently during parasite-blind evolution is rarely considered. Here we use a social bacterium experimentally adapted to several environments in the absence of phage to analyse allopatric diversification of latent host quality - the degree to which a host population supports a viral epidemic. Phage-blind evolution reduced host quality overall, with some bacteria becoming completely resistant to growth suppression by phage. Selective-environment differences generated only mild divergence in host-quality. However, selective environments nonetheless played a major role in shaping evolution by determining the degree of stochastic diversification among replicate populations within treatments. Ancestral motility genotype was also found to strongly shape patterns of latent hostquality evolution and diversification. These outcomes show that adaptive landscapes can differ in how they constrain stochastic diversification of a latent phenotype and that major effects of selection on biological diversification can be missed by focusing on trait means. Collectively, our findings suggest that latent-phenotype evolution (LPE) should inform host-parasite evolution theory and that diversification should be conceived broadly to include latent phenotypes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000465073",,,,"10.1101/2020.12.23.424158","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465073","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","adaptive landscape||bacteriophages||byproduct evolution||cryptic genetic variation||MyxoEE||phenotypic plasticity||pleiotropy","Hidden paths to endless forms most wonderful: Parasite-blind diversification of host quality","Working Paper","Open access",,,"2021-01-25T06:39:47Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In many pathogens, genes associated with virulence, such as effector genes, are located in regions of the genome that are rich in transposable elements and heterochromatin. The contribution of chromatin modifications to gene expression in pathogens remains largely unknown. Using a combination of a reporter gene-based approach and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that the heterochromatic environment of effector genes in the fungal plant pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici is a key regulator of their specific spatiotemporal expression patterns. Enrichment in trimethylated lysine 27 of histone H3 dictates the repression of effector genes in the absence of the host. Chromatin decondensation during host colonization, featuring a reduction in this repressive modification, indicates a major role for epigenetics in effector gene induction. Our results illustrate that chromatin modifications triggered during host colonization determine the specific expression profile of effector genes at the cellular level and, hence, provide new insights into the regulation of virulence in fungal plant pathogens.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000462066",,"2150-7511||2161-2129",,"10.1128/mbio.02343-20","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462066","en","American Society for Microbiology","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Chromatin||Effector gene||Filamentous fungi||Histone methylation||Plant pathogens||Reporter gene||Virulence||Wheat","Chromatin Dynamics Contribute to the Spatiotemporal Expression Pattern of Virulence Genes in a Fungal Plant Pathogen","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-13T11:37:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Genomics of quantitative traits and chromosome instability in Zymoseptoria tritici","155955","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,,,"5","mBio","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous studies in a number of fungal species have identified the requirement of several signaling pathways for anastomosis, including the so far best characterized soft (So) gene, and the MAPK pathway components MAK-1 and MAK-2 of Neurospora crassa. Despite the observations of hyphal fusions’ involvement in pathogenicity and host adhesion, the connection between cell fusion and fungal lifestyles is still unclear. Here, we address the role of anastomosis in fungal development and asexual reproduction in Zymoseptoria tritici, the most important fungal pathogen of wheat in Europe.  Results We show that Z. tritici undergoes self-fusion between distinct cellular structures, and its mechanism is dependent on the initial cell density. Contrary to other fungi, cell fusion in Z. tritici only resulted in cytoplasmic mixing but not in multinucleated cell formation. The deletion of the So orthologous ZtSof1 disrupted cell-to-cell communication affecting both hyphal and germling fusion. We show that Z. tritici mutants for MAPK-encoding ZtSlt2 (orthologous to MAK-1) and ZtFus3 (orthologous to MAK-2) genes also failed to undergo anastomosis, demonstrating the functional conservation of this signaling mechanism across species. Additionally, the ΔZtSof1 mutant was severely impaired in melanization, suggesting that the So gene function is related to melanization. Finally, we demonstrated that anastomosis is dispensable for pathogenicity, but essential for the pycnidium development, and its absence abolishes the asexual reproduction of Z. tritici.  Conclusions We demonstrate the role for ZtSof1, ZtSlt2, and ZtFus3 in cell fusions of Z. tritici. Cell fusions are essential for different aspects of the Z. tritici biology, and the ZtSof1 gene is a potential target to control septoria tritici blotch (STB) disease.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000432117",,"1741-7007",,"10.1186/s12915-020-00838-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432117","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Cell-to-cell communication||Anastomosis||Vegetative growth||Melanization||Asexual reproduction","The role of vegetative cell fusions in the development and asexual reproduction of the wheat fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-08-20T10:01:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85089359987",,"000561855300002","BMC Biol","1","BMC Biology","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In turn, many fungal pathogens secrete LysM effectors that prevent chitin recognition by the host through scavenging of chitin oligomers. We previously showed that intrachain LysM dimerization of the Cladosporium fulvum effector Ecp6 confers an ultrahigh-affinity binding groove that competitively sequesters chitin oligomers from host immune receptors. Additionally, particular LysM effectors are found to protect fungal hyphae against chitinase hydrolysis during host colonization. However, the molecular basis for the protection of fungal cell walls against hydrolysis remained unclear. Here, we determined a crystal structure of the single LysM domain-containing effector Mg1LysM of the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici and reveal that Mg1LysM is involved in the formation of two kinds of dimers; a chitin-dependent dimer as well as a chitin-independent homodimer. In this manner, Mg1LysM gains the capacity to form a supramolecular structure by chitin-induced oligomerization of chitin-independent Mg1LysM homodimers, a property that confers protection to fungal cell walls against host chitinases.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000424379",,"1553-7374||1553-7366",,"10.1371/journal.ppat.1008652","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424379","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A secreted LysM effector protects fungal hyphae through chitin-dependent homodimer polymerization","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-07-04T02:58:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85088207536",,"000544971300001","PLoS Pathog","6","PLoS Pathogens","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A species is therefore defined by both core genes shared between all individuals and accessory genes segregating presence-absence variation. There is growing evidence that eukaryotes, similar to bacteria, show intra-specific variability in gene content. However, it remains largely unknown how functionally relevant such a pangenome structure is for eukaryotes and what mechanisms underlie the emergence of highly polymorphic genome structures.  Results Here, we establish a reference-quality pangenome of a fungal pathogen of wheat based on 19 complete genomes from isolates sampled across six continents. Zymoseptoria tritici causes substantial worldwide losses to wheat production due to rapidly evolved tolerance to fungicides and evasion of host resistance. We performed transcriptome-assisted annotations of each genome to construct a global pangenome. Major chromosomal rearrangements are segregating within the species and underlie extensive gene presence-absence variation. Conserved orthogroups account for only ~ 60% of the species pangenome. Investigating gene functions, we find that the accessory genome is enriched for pathogenesis-related functions and encodes genes involved in metabolite production, host tissue degradation and manipulation of the immune system. De novo transposon annotation of the 19 complete genomes shows that the highly diverse chromosomal structure is tightly associated with transposable element content. Furthermore, transposable element expansions likely underlie recent genome expansions within the species.  Conclusions Taken together, our work establishes a highly complex eukaryotic pangenome providing an unprecedented toolbox to study how pangenome structure impacts crop-pathogen interactions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000400871",,"1741-7007",,"10.1186/s12915-020-0744-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/400871","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A 19-isolate reference-quality global pangenome for the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-02-21T03:21:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Genomics of quantitative traits and chromosome instability in Zymoseptoria tritici","155955","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85079334098",,"000514915100001","BMC Biol","1","BMC Biology","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we study the effects of gene expression stochasticity on efflux and enzymatic resistance. We construct an agent-based model that stochastically simulates multiple biochemical processes in the cell and we observe the growth and survival dynamics of the cell population. Resistance-enhancing mutations are introduced by varying parameters that control the enzyme expression or efficacy. We find that stochastic gene expression can cause complex dynamics in terms of survival and extinction for these mutants. Regulatory mutations, which augment the frequency and duration of resistance gene transcription, can provide limited resistance by increasing mean expression. Structural mutations, which modify the enzyme or efflux efficacy, provide most resistance by improving the binding affinity of the resistance protein to the antibiotic; increasing the enzyme’s catalytic rate alone may contribute to resistance if drug binding is not rate limiting. Overall, we identify conditions where regulatory mutations are selected over structural mutations, and vice versa. Our findings show that stochastic gene expression is a key factor underlying efflux and enzymatic resistances and should be taken into consideration in future antibiotic research.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000397045",,"0737-4038||1537-1719",,"10.1093/molbev/msz199","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/397045","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","antibiotic resistance||Mutation||gene expression||stochastic transcription","Stochastic Gene Expression Influences the Selection of Antibiotic Resistance Mutations","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-02-05T03:26:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,"A microscale analysis of the causes and consequences of the spatial arrangement of biological functions in microbial consortia||Infectious disease dynamics: spread along contact networks and experimental evolution of antibiotic resistance||The population biology of drug resistance: Key principles for a more sustainable use of drugs","169978||176401||268540","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||SNF||EC","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)||FP7||Exzellenzbeitrag in Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85077667650",,"000515121200007","Mol Biol Evol","1","Molecular Biology and Evolution","37","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Stomata are turgordriven valves enclosed by a pair of highly specialized guard cells allowing the exchange of carbon dioxide, oxygen and water between the leaf interior and the environment. The reversible changes in guard cell turgor result from the uptake and release of a variety of osmotically active solutes. Much of the guard cell research conducted over the past 80 years focused on transmembrane ion transport. Although its importance for stomatal movement regulation is inarguably, adjustment of the stomatal pore size requires a complex network of interactions between ion transport, metabolism and solute partitioning. Carbon metabolism has been implicated with stomatal aperture control ever since von Mohl (1856) and Lloyd (1908) observed the presence of starch granules in guard cells. However, the lack of suitable experimental techniques imposed by the microscopic size of guard cells has long hindered the investigation of metabolic rearrangements during stomatal movements. We only recently resolved the diurnal temporal dynamics of starch turnover in guard cells. Substantial amounts of stomatal starch are present throughout the majority of day and night. After dawn, this starch gets transiently fully hydrolyzed by the concerted action of the glucan hydrolases a-amylase 3 (AMY3) and b-amylase 1 (BAM1) accelerating stomatal opening. This process is directly triggered by the bluelight- dependent activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, which activity links membrane ion transport to guard cell carbon metabolism. However, one big unresolved question was how guard cell starch degradation integrates with light-induced ion transport processes in the control of stomatal opening kinetics. In Chapter I of this thesis, we demonstrate that guard cell starch degradation does not directly affect the capacity for the transport of H+, K+ and Cl- ions across the plasma membrane, suggesting that starch degradation does not directly affect the ability for ion transport. Moreover, we examined a long-lasting hypothesis that malate accumulates upon guard cell starch mobilization. Using newly developed enzymatic quantification assays, we revealed that the major end product of blue light-induced starch breakdown in the guard cells of Arabidopsis thaliana is glucose and not malate. The rapid generation of glucose from starch is thus essential for fast stomatal opening and contributes to the coordination between photosynthesis and transpiration. Although guard cell starch plays this essential role during stomatal opening, starch synthesis in guard cells is poorly understood. In Chapter I, we further demonstrate that the capacity of guard cells for autonomous CO2 fixation is limited and starch synthesis largely depends on the supply of mesophyll-derived substrates. Along this line of evidence, the two proton-coupled hexose carriers Sugar Transport Proteins 1 and 4 (STPs) were identified as the major plasma membranelocalized monosaccharide transporters in guard cells in Chapter II. Using a large set of physiological and biochemical techniques, along with phenotyping technology, allowed us to show that their combined activity is required for glucose uptake to guard cells at dawn, delivering carbon substrates for starch synthesis and light-induced stomatal opening. In Chapter III, in a review under revision for the “New Phytologist”, we provide a critical summary of the latest research about guard cell carbon metabolism and identify remaining knowledge gaps. Chapter IV reveals that in addition to the STPs, three members (1, 4 and 5) of the hexose facilitators from the Sugars Will Eventually be Exported (SWEET) family are highly expressed in guard cells and supply them with sugar precursors for starch synthesis. We further provide evidence that guard cell starch acts as a sink for osmolytes during high CO2-induced stomatal closure. We identified the three responsible vacuolar exporters involved in this process: the Aluminum-activated Malate Transporter 4 (ALMT4), the Early Response to Dehydration Like 6 (ERDL6) and the Sucrose-H+ symporter SUC4. Chapter V deals with the enzymatic pathway(s) of guard cell starch synthesis as guard cells show traits of both auto- and heterotrophic tissues. We demonstrate that the enzymes of the classical leaf pathway of starch synthesis play also a significant role in guard cells. Concomitant with hexose uptake to guard cells for starch synthesis, we identified the Glucose-6-phosphate/Phosphate Translocator 1 (GPT1), which catalyzes glucose uptake into chloroplasts, as an essential player of starch accumulation in guard cells. Given the largely heterotrophic nature of guard cells, in Chapter VI, we conducted research in collaboration with the lab of Dr. Boon-Leong Lim (University of Hong Kong) to uncover how guard cell chloroplasts obtain energy for metabolic processes. We used genetically encoded ATP and NADPH biosensors and demonstrated that guard cell chloroplasts surprisingly import cytosolic ATP via the Nucleotide Transporter 1 (NTT1), which is used among other processes for the formation of starch.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000476514",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/476514","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Guard cells","Starch Metabolism in Guard Cells and its Impact on Stomatal Function","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2021-03-26T10:09:46Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27310",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Cells preserved in buffered formalin are detached from the litter with an ultrasonic probe, trapped on an Anodisc membrane filter (0.2 μm pore size), stained with a fluorescent dye (SYBR Green II), and observed under an epifluorescence microscope. At least 400 cells are enumerated in a total of 10–20 randomly selected microscopic fields. Preferable, however, are semiautomated counts on digital images taken with a charged coupled device (CCD) microscope camera. Images are processed with image analysis software such as ImageJ. Steps include contrast enhancement; sharpening of cell edges; definition of a cell-size limit such as 3 μm, taking into account the halo surrounding stained cells; conversion to and editing of the resulting binary image; determination of cell biovolumes and finally conversion of biovolumes to biomass.

While members of this serotype can acquire resistance to antimicrobials, the temporal dynamics of this acquisition is not well understood. Using New York State (NYS) and its dairy cattle farms as a model system, 87 S. Typhimurium strains isolated from 1999 to 2016 from either human clinical or bovine-associated sources in NYS were characterized using whole-genome sequencing. More than 91% of isolates were classified into one of four major lineages, two of which were largely susceptible to antimicrobials but showed sporadic antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene acquisition, and two that were largely multidrug-resistant (MDR). All four lineages clustered by presence and absence of elements in the pan-genome. The two MDR lineages, one of which resembled S. Typhimurium DT104, were predicted to have emerged circa 1960 and 1972. The two largely susceptible lineages emerged earlier, but showcased sporadic AMR determinant acquisition largely after 1960, including acquisition of cephalosporin resistance-conferring genes after 1985. These results confine the majority of AMR acquisition events in NYS S.

During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, policy makers and public health officials are using Rt to assess the effectiveness of interventions and to inform policy. However, estimation of Rt from available data presents several challenges, with critical implications for the interpretation of the course of the pandemic. The purpose of this document is to summarize these challenges, illustrate them with examples from synthetic data, and, where possible, make recommendations. For near real-time estimation of Rt, we recommend the approach of Cori and colleagues, which uses data from before time t and empirical estimates of the distribution of time between infections. Methods that require data from after time t, such as Wallinga and Teunis, are conceptually and methodologically less suited for near real-time estimation, but may be appropriate for retrospective analyses of how individuals infected at different time points contributed to the spread. We advise caution when using methods derived from the approach of Bettencourt and Ribeiro, as the resulting Rt estimates may be biased if the underlying structural assumptions are not met. Two key challenges common to all approaches are accurate specification of the generation interval and reconstruction of the time series of new infections from observations occurring long after the moment of transmission. Naive approaches for dealing with observation delays, such as subtracting delays sampled from a distribution, can introduce bias. We provide suggestions for how to mitigate this and other technical challenges and highlight open problems in Rt estimation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000458325",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008409","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458325","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Practical considerations for measuring the effective reproductive number, Rt","Review Article","Open access",,,"2020-12-23T08:46:33Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85097684474",,"000600142000001","PLOS comput. biol.","12","PLoS Computational Biology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This trade-off is strongly influenced by dynamic interactions with biotic and abiotic factors. Yet, understanding how these interactions influence the balance between growth and defence remains one of the key challenges in the field of plant evolutionary ecology. In this study, we investigated how resource availability, competition pressure and insect herbivore pressure drive selection on the balance between the acquisition and protection of resources. To this end, we developed a novel simulation model that combines a functional-structural plant (FSP) model of plant growth in a 3D light climate with a model of natural selection. This mechanistic modelling approach simulates plant growth, competition for above- and below-ground resources, and natural selection to investigate selection pressures on traits related to growth and defence as imposed by different levels of plant density, nitrogen availability and herbivory. The model presented in this study was able to recreate the functional equilibria predicted by principal ecological theories on the effects of resource availability and resource-driven trade-offs. This illustrates the potential of mechanistic modelling approaches such as the one presented here for future research on plant responses to dynamic and variable environments. Our results further showed a three-way interaction between plant competition for light, competition for nitrogen and herbivory that determined the optimal balance between the acquisition and protection of resources. This shows that the value of investing in the acquisition or the protection of resources is a dynamic problem that is influenced by multiple ecological interactions, trade-offs and tragedies of the commons, and therefore requires an eco-evolutionary context to be fully understood.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000465724",,"2517-5025",,"10.1093/insilicoplants/diaa008","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465724","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Competition||Evolutionary ecology||Functional-structural plant modelling||Growth-defence trade-off||Plant–herbivore interactions||Plant–plant interactions||Plant traits||Tragedy of the commons","Optimal plant defence under competition for light and nutrients: an evolutionary modelling approach","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-26T15:27:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","in silico Plants","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We focus on the approach of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to assessing GMO risks to public and environmental health. An historical account informs our critical appraisal of the current practices of EFSA’s GMO panel, and helps to explain how and why it fails to satisfy the objectives of the EU’s GMO legislation. While those legislative texts set appropriate objectives, their concrete implementation has fallen far short of the legislative goals. EFSA’s prevailing approach to GM crop and food risk assessment starts from what it terms a ‘comparative safety assessment’. Those comparisons require the scrutiny of sets of molecular, chemical and phenotypic data from GM plants and non-GM varieties (many of which may be only remotely related to the GM variety). Those data are, however, inadequate for predicting adverse biological, toxicological and ecological effects. EFSA’s ‘comparative safety assessments’ draw over-optimistic conclusions from too little data from too few studies. When GM products are deemed to have passed a ‘comparative safety assessment’, EFSA has interpreted that as grounds for conducting only very narrowly circumscribed risk assessments, which have not required meaningful data from studies of ecological or eco-toxicological impacts. This is a reductionist approach to risk assessment, when a more inclusive and comprehensive approach, which we outline, is scientifically available, and also more likely to meet the specified legislative aims. Instead, however, the reductionist choice is systematically applied, but never justified nor acknowledged as such. Indeed, it is concealed, by EFSA and by its main policy client the European Commission, as if it were only for specialist expert scientific deliberation. Thus, key questions that sound scientific assessments should ask about potential harm are not even posed, let alone answered—or at least, they are ‘answered’ only by default, given that the implicit burden of proof requires harm to be demonstrated. Furthermore, and a key point of this paper, we show how the problematic features of EFSA’s approach have been premised on a set of evaluative policy judgements, rather than purely scientific considerations. Responsibility for selecting how EFSA frames its scientific approach should however lie with European Commission risk managers, and not with EFSA. These problems might have been and could be avoided if explicit commitments entered into by the EU at the Codex Alimentarius Commission were implemented by the European Commission and EFSA were instructed accordingly.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000411167",,"2190-4715||2190-4707",,"10.1186/s12302-020-00325-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/411167","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","GMO||Regulation||Risk assessment||Biosafety||EFSA||Cartagena Protocol||EU Directive 2001/18||Codex Alimentarius Commission||Risk assessment policy","GMO regulations and their interpretation: how EFSA's guidance on risk assessments of GMOs is bound to fail","Review Article","Open access",,,"2020-04-23T02:32:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85085069589",,"000524526200001","Environ Sci Eur","1","Environmental Sciences Europe","32","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Bacteria belonging to the Pseudomonas fluorescens group are excellent root-colonizers with many plant beneficial effects. These bacteria can promote plant growth through the production of hormones and increase the availability of certain soil nutrients. Fluorescent Pseudomonas are also able to control the emergence of soilborne diseases mainly by the production of antimicrobial secondary metabolites and to induce systemic resistance in the plant host rendering it ready for the attack of pathogens or predators. Intriguingly, two species within the fluorescent pseudomonads, P. chlororaphis and P. protegens, possess the ability to colonize and kill Lepidopteran insects in addition to all these plant beneficial activities. In the last decade, several factors contributing to the insecticidal activity of these fascinating bacteria were identified, and insecticidal pseudomonads have emerged as promising candidates for the biological control of soil-derived insect pests for which no satisfactory control methods exist. The major aims of this thesis were to study the nature of Pseudomonas-insect interactions and its ecological significance, and to investigate, in a susceptible insect species, the pathogenicity process and the factors required at different phases during insect colonization and killing.  In the first part of the thesis, we investigated whether the inability, of model strain P. protegens CHA0, to kill certain insect species, is due to its failure to persist in the animals. Based on feeding assays in combination with bacterial monitoring we showed that P. protegens CHA0 is highly lethal to larvae of Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera) and Pieris brassicae (Lepidoptera) while being pathogenic, but less effective against larvae of Delia radicum (Diptera). P. protegens CHA0 had no effect on larvae of Otiorhynchus sulcatus (Coleoptera). However, P. protegens CHA0 persisted from larval to adult stage in all these species and was transmitted to a new plant host by D. radicum flies. These findings indicate that insecticidal pseudomonads can establish different relationships with insects ranging from exploiting insects as food source to using them as vectors for dispersal. A central part of the thesis concentrated on identifying the specific sets of genes a pseudomonad needs when colonizing a plant or an insect hosts, and to identify the specific role of individual factors during insect colonization and throughout disease progression. To this end, a large-scale transcriptomics dataset of P. protegens strain CHA0 was generated which includes data from the colonization of wheat roots, the gut of P. xylostella after oral uptake and the Galleria mellonella hemolymph after injection. The transcriptomic profiles strongly varied depending on the environment. Furthermore, we could associate specific factors to different hosts or different stages of insect infection. In addition, new traits contributing to insecticidal activity were identified, such as effector proteins (toxins) released by two-partner secretion systems (TPS). Their role during infection of P. xylostella was verified using a mutational approach. Altogether, this data allowed us to propose a comprehensive insect colonization and pathogenesis model for P. protegens CHA0. The ecological relevance of non-pathogenic interactions with insects described in the first part of the thesis, and the natural association of P. protegens and P. chlororaphis to insects, still remains unknown. To address these questions, we searched for insecticidal Pseudomonas in arthropods collected from a wheat field, a potato field and neighbouring grassland. We found that P. protegens and P. chlororaphis are naturally present in healthy insects and myriapods and isolated a set of new strains from arthropods, soil and roots. Although all strains, independently of their host of origin or their phylogenetic position, had oral activity against P. xylostella, the insecticidal capacities of different P. chlororaphis isolates were not as homogeneous as observed for P. protegens. Phylogenetically closely related P. chlororaphis strains differed in insect killing speed and efficiency. We hypothesize that the lower insecticidal activity observed for two Coleoptera isolates could be related to mutations in key insecticidal factors, such as the Fit toxin and TPSA proteins, that we discovered using a single nucleotide polymorphism analysis based on the whole genomes. These findings point towards an order-specificity or adaptation to certain insect hosts and show the ubiquitous nature of these special pseudomonads. This thesis substantially improves our knowledge about the pathogenesis of insect infecting Pseudomonas and the ecology of arthropod-Pseudomonas relationships. The novel information we gained is of great scientific, but also agricultural and environmental value, since it is highly important for the development of new biocontrol tools within the frame of a sustainable agriculture relying on environmentally friendly pest control methods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000445991",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/445991","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Pseudomonas protegens||PSEUDOMONAS (MICROBIOLOGY)||Pseudomonas chlororaphis||biocontrol||Pest insect||Host pathogen interactions","Plant-Beneficial Fluorescent Pseudomonads with Insecticidal Activity: Molecular Traits and Ecology of Insect-Associated Lifestyles","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2020-10-14T17:36:06Z","2022-10-15",,,"yes",,,,"Molecular determinats contributing to insect and plant associated lifestyles of beneficial pseudomonads||Insecticidal activity in root-colonizing plant-beneficial pseudomonads: Molecular mechanisms and exploitation for pest control","159520||138248","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)","26822",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Comparative genome analyses of several fungal pathogens revealed highly variable genomes, for many species characterized by specific repeat-rich genome compartments with exceptionally high sequence variability. Dynamic genome structure may enable fast adaptation to host genetics. The wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici with its highly variable genome, has emerged as a model organism to study genome evolution of plant pathogens. Here, we compared genomes of Z. tritici isolates and of sister species infecting wild grasses to address the evolution of genome composition and structure.  Results Using long-read technology, we sequenced and assembled genomes of Z. ardabiliae, Z. brevis, Z. pseudotritici and Z. passerinii, together with two isolates of Z. tritici. We report a high extent of genome collinearity among Zymoseptoria species and high conservation of genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures of compartmentalization. We identify high gene content variability both within and between species. In addition, such variability is mainly limited to the accessory chromosomes and accessory compartments. Despite strong host specificity and non-overlapping host-range between species, predicted effectors are mainly shared among Zymoseptoria species, yet exhibiting a high level of presence-absence polymorphism within Z. tritici. Using in planta transcriptomic data from Z. tritici, we suggest different roles for the shared orthologs and for the accessory genes during infection of their hosts.   Conclusion Despite previous reports of high genomic plasticity in Z. tritici, we describe here a high level of conservation in genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic composition and structure across the genus Zymoseptoria. The compartmentalized genome allows the maintenance of a functional core genome co-occurring with a highly variable accessory genome.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000463745",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-020-06871-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/463745","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Genome evolution||Orphan genes||Effectors||Genome architecture||Accessory genes","Genome compartmentalization predates species divergence in the plant pathogen genus Zymoseptoria","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-19T13:22:02Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"BMC Genomics","1","BMC Genomics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Niche adaptation and ultimately the formation of ecotypes and speciation in this genus has been suggested to be mainly driven by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) through mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Our knowledge about the diversity and distribution of Vibrio MGEs is heavily biased towards human pathogens and our understanding of the distribution of core genomic signatures and accessory genes encoded on MGEs within specific Vibrio clades is still incomplete. We used nine different strains of the marine bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus isolated from pipefish in the Kiel-Fjord to perform a multiscale-comparative genomic approach that allowed us to investigate [1] those genomic signatures that characterize a habitat-specific ecotype and [2] the source of genomic variation within this ecotype.  Results We found that the nine isolates from the Kiel-Fjord have a closed-pangenome and did not differ based on core-genomic signatures. Unique genomic regions and a unique repertoire of MGEs within the Kiel-Fjord isolates suggest that the acquisition of gene-blocks by HGT played an important role in the evolution of this ecotype. Additionally, we found that ~ 90% of the genomic variation among the nine isolates is encoded on MGEs, which supports ongoing theory that accessory genes are predominately located on MGEs and shared by HGT. Lastly, we could show that these nine isolates share a unique virulence and resistance profile which clearly separates them from all other investigated V. alginolyticus strains and suggests that these are habitat-specific genes, required for a successful colonization of the pipefish, the niche of this ecotype.  Conclusion We conclude that all nine V. alginolyticus strains from the Kiel-Fjord belong to a unique ecotype, which we named the Kiel-alginolyticus ecotype. The low sequence variation of the core-genome in combination with the presence of MGE encoded relevant traits, as well as the presence of a suitable niche (here the pipefish), suggest, that this ecotype might have evolved from a clonal expansion following HGT driven niche-adaptation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000416199",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-020-6735-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/416199","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Pangenome||Mega-plasmids||Mobile genetic elements||Horizontal gene transfer||Genomic islands||Niche-adaptation","Genomic variation among closely related Vibrio alginolyticus strains is located on mobile genetic elements","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-21T02:44:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85084566198",,"000534339300007","BMC Genomics","1","BMC Genomics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the climate is warming rapidly, concomitant with intense and diversified types of human influence in these cold environments. Consequently, many plant species, both native and nonnative, are now moving or expanding their ranges to higher elevations and latitudes, creating new species interactions and assemblages that challenge biodiversity conservation. Based on our synthesis, many of the same nonnative species invade multiple cold environments, and many more could move up or over from adjoining warmer areas. Transportation networks and the disturbances associated with burgeoning development are responsible for many movements. Prevention and monitoring for nonnative plant species is of paramount importance, and management should be directed toward species that negatively impact ecosystem function or human well-being. Management of native range shifters is more complicated; most movements will be desirable, but some may be locally undesirable. Overall, plant movements into alpine, arctic, and Antarctic areas are going to increase, and management will need to be adaptive because species movements and assemblages of the past will not reflect those of the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000461859",,"1523-0430||1938-4246",,"10.1080/15230430.2020.1845919","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461859","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Invasive species||Range expansion||Mountains||Arctic||Antarctic","Moving up and over: redistribution of plants in alpine, Arctic, and Antarctic ecosystems under global change","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-13T06:06:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Novel`interactions and species’ responses to climate change","678841","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,"000601401000001","Arct.
