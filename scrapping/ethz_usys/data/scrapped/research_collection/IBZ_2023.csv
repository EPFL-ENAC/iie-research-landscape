Moreover, broad spectrum insecticides are or will soon be banned due to their negative effects on non-target organisms. In this study, we have developed a biological control method for the cabbage maggot Delia radicum (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), a significant pest of Brassicacean crops, based on a consortium of three biocontrol agents (BCAs). We chose the bacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis because it can be used in a dual strategy against insect pests and fungal plant diseases, and combined it with the nematode Steinernema feltiae and the fungus Metarhizium brunneum that have a long history of commercial use against different pest insects. Our aim was to combine BCAs with different modes of action in order to achieve a stable and reliable biocontrol effect. We first tested double combinations of the bacterium with either the nematode or the fungus for improved potential to kill D. radicum in laboratory assays. We then evaluated the effect of double and triple combinations on D. radicum development and maggot-induced damage on radish bulbs in a series of pot experiments with artificial cabbage maggot infection performed in the greenhouse and outdoors and finally in a field trial with a natural infestation. Our results show that i) insecticidal pseudomonads are highly efficient in D. radicum control, ii) the three BCAs are compatible and neither inhibit each other's infectiousness nor survival in the soil or on the roots, iii) synergistic effects of Pseudomonas-nematode and Pseudomonas-fungus combinations on maggot killing are possible, and iv) the triple combination reduced both pest survival in greenhouse experiments and maggot-induced damage on radish bulbs in the field by 50% each. The strategy we present here is a promising step forward to a reliable and efficient environmentally friendly biological control method for the cabbage maggot, which can also be adapted to other problematic below-ground pests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000601606","0167-8809||1873-2305",,"10.1016/j.agee.2023.108414","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/601606","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biocontrol consortium||Insecticidal pseudomonads||Entomopathogenic nematodes||Entomopathogenic fungi||Cabbage maggot or cabbage root fly Delia radicum","Combining entomopathogenic Pseudomonas bacteria, nematodes and fungi for biological control of a below-ground insect pest","Journal Article","Open access",,"2023-03-06T06:59:39Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,"85148946160",,"Agric. ecosyst. environ.",,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","348","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Hybridizing white oak species (Quercus sect. Quercus) represent an ideal study system to elucidate which environmental factors determine their relative abundance and admixture levels within admixed forest stands. To elaborate these relationships, we used 58 species-diagnostic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and high-resolution topographic and soil data to identify the environmental factors associated with taxonomic composition of individuals and populations in 15 mixed stands of Q. petraea and Q. pubescens in the Valais, an inner-Alpine valley in Switzerland. At the individual tree level, generalized linear models (GLMs) explained a relatively small part of variation (R-2 = 0.32). At the population level, GLMs often explained a large part of variation (R-2 = 0.54-0.69) of the taxonomic indices. Mean taxonomic composition of the sites depended mainly on altitude and geographic position. Moreover, the more within-site variation we found in predictors related to topographic position, the higher was the average genetic admixture of single trees. Our results show that a multitude of topographic and edaphic factors affect the taxonomic composition and admixture levels of these two hybridizing oak species on local scale and that regional heterogeneity of these factors promote taxonomic diversity and admixture. Overall, our study highlights the prospects of using tailored genetic resources and high-resolution environmental data to understand and predict taxonomic composition in response to changing environments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000608873","1614-2950||1614-2942",,"10.1007/s11295-023-01598-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/608873","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bayesian model averaging||Linear models||Soil||Stepwise model selection||Taxonomic diversity||Topography","Abiotic factors predict taxonomic composition and genetic admixture in populations of hybridizing white oak species (Quercus sect.

Adult banded cucumber beetles (Diabrotica balteata), a common pest of maize and cucurbits, sequester cucurbitacins, presumably as a defensive mechanism against their natural enemies, which might reduce the efficacy of biological control agents. Whether the larvae also sequester and are protected by cucurbitacins is unclear. We profiled cucurbitacin levels in four varieties of cucumber, Cucumis sativus, and in larvae fed on these varieties. Then, we evaluated larval growth and resistance against common biocontrol organisms including insect predators, entomopathogenic nematodes, fungi and bacteria. We found considerable qualitative and quantitative differences in the cucurbitacin levels of the four cucumber varieties. While two varieties were fully impaired in their production, the other two accumulated high levels of cucurbitacins. We also observed that D. balteata larvae sequester and metabolize cucurbitacins, and although the larvae fed extensively on both belowground and aboveground tissues, the sequestered cucurbitacins were mainly derived from belowground tissues. Cucurbitacins had no detrimental effects on larval performance and, surprisingly, did not provide protection against any of the natural enemies evaluated. Our results show that D. balteata larvae can indeed sequester and transform cucurbitacins, but sequestered cucurbitacins do not impact the biocontrol potential of common natural enemies used in biocontrol. Hence, this plant trait should be conserved in plant breeding programs, as it has been demonstrated in previous studies that it can provide protection against plant pathogens and generalist insects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576564","1612-4758||1612-4766",,"10.1007/s10340-022-01568-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576564","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Diabroticina||Biological control||Plant defense||Sequestration||Tritrophic interactions","Sequestration of cucurbitacins from cucumber plants by Diabrotica balteata larvae provides little protection against biological control agents","Journal Article","Open access",,"2022-10-18T09:35:12Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,"000864996300001","J Pest Sci","3","Journal of Pest Science","96","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We used molecular genetic tools to determine how natural sequence polymorphisms of the avirulence factor Avr3D1 in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici contributed to adaptive changes in virulence. We showed that there is a continuous distribution in the magnitude of resistance triggered by different Avr3D1 isoforms and demonstrated that natural variation in an Avr gene can lead to a quantitative resistance phenotype. We further showed that homologues of Avr3D1 in two nonpathogenic sister species of Z. tritici are recognized by some wheat cultivars, suggesting that Avr-R gene-for-gene interactions can contribute to nonhost resistance. We suggest that the mechanisms underlying host range, qualitative resistance, and quantitative resistance are not exclusive.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000595600","0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.18690","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/595600","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","gene-for-gene interactions||nonhost resistance||quantitative resistance||Septoria tritici blotch (STB)||wheat pathogen","Natural variation in Avr3D1 from Zymoseptoria sp. contributes to quantitative gene-for-gene resistance and to host specificity","Journal Article","Open access",,"2023-01-30T04:11:37Z",,,"yes","Genomics of quantitative traits and chromosome instability in Zymoseptoria tritici","155955","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,"85146254417","000911845600001","New Phytol.","4","New Phytologist","238","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the relative roles of these different drivers for microbial community assembly on human-associated surfaces are not clear. Here, we used a combination of sampling, sequencing (16S rRNA) and culturing to show that the composition of banknote-associated bacterial communities varies depending on the local collection environment. Using banknotes collected from various locations and types of shops across Switzerland, we found taxonomic diversity dominated by families such as Pseudomonadaceae and Staphylococcaceae, but with banknote samples from particular types of shops (especially butcher shops) having distinct community structure. By contrast, we found no evidence of geographic structure: similarity of community composition did not decrease with increasing distance among sampled locations. These results show that microbial communities associated with banknotes, one of the most commonly encountered and exchanged human-associated surfaces, can reflect the local environmental conditions (in this case, the type of shop), and the signal for this type of variation was stronger than that for geographic structure among the locations sampled here.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000546685","0962-1083||1365-294X",,"10.1111/mec.16456","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/546685","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","16S rRNA||banknote||community assembly||microbiome","Community composition of bacteria isolated from Swiss banknotes varies depending on collection environment","Journal Article","Open access",,"2022-05-12T02:59:26Z",,,"yes","The role of bacteria-virus interactions in antimicrobial resistance","165803","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,"85128538729","000789522700001","Mol Ecol","10","Molecular Ecology","32","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we show these parameters evolve in a strain-specific way among clinical plasmids and bacteria, and this occurs rapidly enough to alter the relative likelihoods of different bacterium-plasmid combinations spreading. We used experiments with Escherichia coli and antibiotic-resistance plasmids isolated from patients, paired with a mathematical model, to track long-term plasmid stability (beyond antibiotic exposure). Explaining variable stability across six bacterium-plasmid combinations required accounting for evolutionary changes in plasmid stability traits, whereas initial variation of these parameters was a relatively poor predictor of long-term outcomes. Evolutionary trajectories were specific to particular bacterium-plasmid combinations, as evidenced by genome sequencing and genetic manipulation. This revealed epistatic (here, strain-dependent) effects of key genetic changes affecting horizontal plasmid transfer. Several genetic changes involved mobile elements and pathogenicity islands. Rapid strain-specific evolution can thus outweigh ancestral phenotypes as a predictor of plasmid stability.

Genetic resistance is required to ensure yield stability and reduce the use of insecticides, yet the available resistance sources are limited. In this study, three common bean populations containing a total of 559 genotypes were evaluated in different yield and BLCrV resistance trials under natural infection in the field. A genome-wide association study identified the locus BLC7.1 on chromosome Pv07 at 3.31 Mbp, explaining between 8.22% to 16.08% of the phenotypic variation for BLCrV resistance. Comparatively, whole-genome regression models explained 51% to 78% of the variation and identified the same region on Pv07 to confer the resistance. The most significantly associated markers were located within the gene model Phvul.007G040400, which encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase subfamily III member and is likely involved in the innate immune response against the virus. The allelic diversity within this gene revealed five different haplotype groups, one of which was significantly associated with BLCrV resistance. As the same genome region was previously reported with resistance against other geminiviruses affecting common bean, our study highlights the role that historical breeding for virus resistance has played in the accumulation of positive alleles against newly emerging viruses. In addition, we provide novel diagnostic SNP markers for marker-assisted selection to exploit BLC7.1 for breeding against geminivirus diseases in one of the most important food security crops worldwide.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591610","0960-7412||1365-313X",,"10.1111/tpj.15810","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591610","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Begomovirus||Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)||Disease resistance||Genomic  prediction||Leucine-rich  repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK)||Marker-assisted selection (MAS)||Bean leaf crumple virus (BLCrV)","Genetic analysis of resistance to bean leaf crumple virus identifies a candidate LRR-RLK gene","Journal Article","Open access",,"2023-01-11T11:41:17Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,"85143230742","000936963700001","Plant j.","1","The Plant Journal","114","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Parallel evolution-the independent evolution of similar phenotypes in different populations-provides a powerful framework to investigate the evolutionary potential of populations, the constraints of evolution, its repeatability and therefore its predictability. Here, we quantified the degree of gene expression and functional parallelism across replicated ecotype formation in Heliosperma pusillum (Caryophyllaceae), and gained insights into the architecture of adaptive traits. Population structure analyses and demographic modelling support a previously formulated hypothesis of parallel polytopic divergence of montane and alpine ecotypes. We detect a large proportion of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) underlying divergence within each replicate ecotype pair, with a strikingly low number of shared DEGs across pairs. Functional enrichment of DEGs reveals that the traits affected by significant expression divergence are largely consistent across ecotype pairs, in strong contrast to the nonshared genetic basis. The remarkable redundancy of differential gene expression indicates a polygenic architecture for the diverged adaptive traits. We conclude that polygenic traits appear key to opening multiple routes for adaptation, widening the adaptive potential of organisms.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000535673","0962-1083||1365-294X",,"10.1111/mec.16393","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/535673","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","altitudinal adaptation||demography||ecotypes||Heliosperma pusillum||parallel divergence||polygenic architecture||RNA-seq","Polygenic routes lead to parallel altitudinal adaptation in Heliosperma pusillum (Caryophyllaceae)","Journal Article","Open access",,"2022-03-07T07:48:20Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,"85125095247","000759992600001","Mol Ecol","8","Molecular Ecology","32","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Don) Endl. leaves by crossing the cuticle, and show that surface-trait acclimation alters the kinetic parameters of foliar water uptake. Under our experimental conditions, the cuticle was the primary pathway for water entry into the leaf. Exposure to climatic variation may induce surface acclimations, such as increased waxiness, that reduce water-film formation over stomata at the expense of dry-season foliar uptake rates. We found that water uptake is negatively associated with the interaction of leaf-surface wax coverage and stomatal density, and provide an accessible protocol to measure these key traits in Sequoia.

Although species' eco-physiological properties determine their response to environmental change, most trait-based studies focus on a small subset of easily measured morphological traits as proxies for physiology. This choice may limit our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on species' demography, and obscure the underlying mechanisms. We conducted a transplantation experiment along a 1000-m elevation gradient in the Alps to quantify the degree to which changes in plant abundance due to climate warming were predicted by eco-physiological performance versus common morphological traits. Physiological measurements revealed that warming favoured species with a conservative leaf-level water use strategy whereas species whose leaf-level water use was more ‘wasteful’ were more likely to suffer from the warmer and drier climate. Nevertheless, the predictive power of physiological traits did not exceed that of morphological traits. Our results, therefore, show that while easily measured morphological traits can successfully predict plant abundance responses to climate, eco-physiological approaches are needed to understand the underlying mechanism.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000587865","0269-8463||1365-2435",,"10.1111/1365-2435.14228","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587865","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","alpine||altitude||climate change||ecophysiology||functional traits||plant||translocation||water-use efficiency","Eco-physiological and morphological traits explain alpine plant species' response to warming","Journal Article","Open access",,"2022-12-17T08:54:31Z",,,"yes","Timescales of changing species interactions under warming climate||Novel`interactions and species’ responses to climate change","173210||678841","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||H2020",,"85142244952","000888825100001","Funct.

Under climate change, flow intermittency is becoming more prevalent in glaciated alpine catchments, but the effects of increasing dryness on aquatic biodiversity remain largely unknown.  We characterised flow intermittency patterns in 30 streams of a glaciated alpine catchment over 15 months and separated these streams into four intermittency categories: perennial streams, winter-drying streams, moderately intermittent streams with occasional drying in summer, and periodically intermittent streams with extensive dry periods throughout the year. We then examined how these drying patterns affected structural and functional properties of benthic macroinvertebrate communities, and whether these changes were primarily deterministic or stochastic.  At the taxonomic level, we observed a response at the highest intermittency levels, with α diversity lower and β diversity higher in periodically intermittent streams than in other stream types. This result suggested that local biota were well adapted to intermediate intermittency levels (mostly during winter) but not to high intermittency during summer. In contrast, functional diversity indices at the α and β levels (based on trait abundances) did not differ across intermittency categories. Considering the moderate level of functional redundancy, we interpreted this as an indication that changes in taxonomic diversity may have resulted primarily from stochastic processes.  Analysis of community and trait composition indicated that deterministic selection may indeed have occurred with increased intermittency, but this process was likely to be minor in comparison to stochastic extinctions. Notably, community evenness was highest in periodically intermittent streams and lowest in perennial streams, suggesting that frequent drying prevented competitive exclusion.  Our results suggested that most macroinvertebrate populations are resilient to intermediate intermittency levels but are filtered at high intermittency, irrespective of their resilience capacities. However, more research is needed to clarify the specific roles of different facets of flow regimes, specifically frequency, duration, and timing of intermittency. Understanding the consequences of responses in diversity and community evenness with increasing intermittency on the functional properties of communities will allow better prediction of the future ecological status of alpine stream networks to ongoing environmental change.",,,"0046-5070||1365-2427","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587483||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/584666","10.1111/fwb.14018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587765","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,,"alpine streams||aquatic insects||diversity||functional traits||intermittency","Flow intermittency affects structural and functional properties of macroinvertebrate communities in alpine streams","Journal Article","Metadata only",,"2022-12-04T03:54:04Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,"85142440684","000888082700001","Freshw. biol.","2","Freshwater Biology","68","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The recent release of man-made substances into the environment provides a dynamic testing ground for observing biocatalytic innovation at play. Phosphate triesters, used as pesticides, have only recently been introduced into the environment, where they have no natural counterpart. Enzymes have rapidly evolved to hydrolyze phosphate triesters in response to this challenge, converging onto the same mechanistic solution, which requires bivalent cations as a cofactor for catalysis. In contrast, the previously identified metagenomic promiscuous hydrolase P91, a homologue of acetylcholinesterase, achieves slow phosphotriester hydrolysis mediated by a metal-independent Cys-His-Asp triad. Here, we probe the evolvability of this new catalytic motif by subjecting P91 to directed evolution. By combining a focused library approach with the ultrahigh throughput of droplet microfluidics, we increase P91’s activity by a factor of ≈360 (to a kcat/KM of ≈7 × 105 M–1 s–1) in only two rounds of evolution, rivaling the catalytic efficiencies of naturally evolved, metal-dependent phosphotriesterases. Unlike its homologue acetylcholinesterase, P91 does not suffer suicide inhibition; instead, fast dephosphorylation rates make the formation of the covalent adduct rather than its hydrolysis rate-limiting. This step is improved by directed evolution, with intermediate formation accelerated by 2 orders of magnitude. Combining focused, combinatorial libraries with the ultrahigh throughput of droplet microfluidics can be leveraged to identify and enhance mechanistic strategies that have not reached high efficiency in nature, resulting in alternative reagents with novel catalytic machineries.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590940","0002-7863||1520-5126",,"10.1021/jacs.2c10673","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590940","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ultrahigh-Throughput Directed Evolution of a Metal-Free α/β-Hydrolase with a Cys-His-Asp Triad into an Efficient Phosphotriesterase","Journal Article","Open access",,"2023-01-09T10:26:29Z",,,"no",,,,,,,,"000907793600001","J.

Models of this response, such as the widely used Monod model, are generally characterized by a maximum growth rate and a half-saturation concentration of the resource. What values should we expect for these half-saturation concentrations, and how should they depend on the environmental concentration of the resource? We survey growth response data across a wide range of organisms and resources. We find that the half-saturation concentrations vary across orders of magnitude, even for the same organism and resource. To explain this variation, we develop an evolutionary model to show that demographic fluctuations (genetic drift) can constrain the adaptation of half-saturation concentrations. We find that this effect fundamentally differs depending on the type of population dynamics: Populations undergoing periodic bottlenecks of fixed size will adapt their half-saturation concentrations in proportion to the environmental resource concentrations, but populations undergoing periodic dilutions of fixed size will evolve half-saturation concentrations that are largely decoupled from the environmental concentrations. Our model not only provides testable predictions for laboratory evolution experiments, but it also reveals how an evolved half-saturation concentration may not reflect the organism's environment. In particular, this explains how organisms in resource-rich environments can still evolve fast growth at low resource concentrations. Altogether, our results demonstrate the critical role of population dynamics in shaping fundamental ecological traits.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591864","0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2207295120","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591864","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","microbial evolution||Monod model||resource competition||half-saturation concentration||selection–drift balance","Microbial population dynamics decouple growth response from environmental nutrient concentration","Journal Article","Open access",,"2023-01-12T08:12:45Z",,,"yes","Molecular mechanisms and evolutionary consequences of pleiotropy and single-cell variation in microbial growth","180147","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,"85145641721",,"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","2","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","120","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, surprisingly, little work has examined how biotic interactions in soil may impact CUE. Here, we review the theoretical and empirical lines of evidence exploring how biotic interactions affect CUE through the lens of life history strategies. Fundamentally, the CUE of a microbial population is constrained by population density and carrying capacity, which, when reached, causes species to grow more quickly and less efficiently. When microbes engage in interspecific competition, they accelerate growth rates to acquire limited resources and release secondary chemicals toxic to competitors. Such processes are not anabolic and thus constrain CUE. In turn, antagonists may activate one of a number of stress responses that also do not involve biomass production, potentially further reducing CUE. In contrast, facilitation can increase CUE by expanding species realized niches, mitigating environmental stress and reducing production costs of extracellular enzymes. Microbial interactions at higher trophic levels also influence CUE. For instance, predation on microbes can positively or negatively impact CUE by changing microbial density and the outcomes of interspecific competition. Finally, we discuss how plants select for more or less efficient microbes under different contexts. In short, this review demonstrates the potential for biotic interactions to be a strong regulator of microbial CUE and additionally provides a blueprint for future research to address key knowledge gaps of ecological and applied importance for carbon sequestration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000586208","0343-8651||1432-0991",,"10.1007/s00284-022-02979-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/586208","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Biotic Interactions in Soil are Underestimated Drivers of Microbial Carbon Use Efficiency","Review Article","Open access",,"2022-12-11T18:09:01Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,"85143270595","000910882600011","Curr Microbiol","1","Current Microbiology","80","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Low-altitude aerial imagery obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has shown significant potential for weed detection in crops. However, most studies focused on wide-spaced row crops such as maize and sunflower and evaluated proposed methods on single or few well-characterized experimental sites at specific points in time representing a limited range of application scenarios. This study evaluated the feasibility of weed detection in on-farm wheat fields characterized by a narrow row spacing, throughout the early and late developmental stages using UAV imagery and ground-based high-resolution imagery. Image data was obtained for nine sites, representing a wide range of management and pedoclimatic conditions. These sites can be seen as a representative sample of scenarios that would be encountered in practice. A high within- and across-site as well as temporal variation was observed for weed infestation levels and weed population species composition, highlighting the need for spatially and temporally resolved weed mapping. Image-based classification of vegetation objects as crop or weed plants was achieved with an accuracy of 0.88 and 0.72 in ground-based high-resolution images and UAV-based aerial images captured from an altitude of 10 m, respectively. The accuracy of pixel-wise, vegetation-index-based weed infestation estimation during the late vegetative stages varied strongly across sites. Our results highlight the critical importance of a high ground resolution for weed detection using object-based image analysis during the critical growth stages of wheat and of robust methods that are applicable across a range of scenarios. This suggested that future research aiming at a rapid implementation of site-specific weed management in wheat should focus on the development of ground-based systems. Yet, aerial monitoring of wheat stands during late developmental stages using currently available equipment offers significant potential for reducing weed pressure with site-specific weed control measures in the context of crop rotations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591868","0168-1699||1872-7107",,"10.1016/j.compag.2022.107558","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591868","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Precision agriculture||Object-based image analysis||OBIA||Vegetation index||Site-specific management||Remote sensing","On-farm evaluation of UAV-based aerial imagery for season-long weed monitoring under contrasting management and pedoclimatic conditions in wheat","Journal Article","Open access",,"2023-01-12T08:12:59Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,"85145668148","000911206700001","Comput. electron. agric.",,"Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","204","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Fluorescent pseudomonads are well-known for their abilities to promote plant growth, suppress pathogens and induce systemic resistance. In the last decade, research focused on the mechanisms underlying oral insecticidal activity of P. chlororaphis and P. protegens subgroups as well as their ecological interactions with insects. We aimed at exploiting the insecticidal activity of pseudomonads for controlling below-ground insect pests alone and in combination with entomopathogenic nematodes and fungi. Furthermore, we explored the phyllosphere competence of fluorescent pseu- domonads, a prerequisite to control foliar pests and pathogens. In the first part of this thesis, we investigated the potential of P. chlororaphis and P. pro- tegens strains to control the cabbage maggot Delia radicum, an important pest of Brassicacean crops for which no satisfactory control exists. We then combined the most potent strain, P. chlororaphis PCLRT03, with the entomopathogenic nematode Stein- ernema feltiae RS5 and the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum Bip5 in screening, greenhouse, semi-field experiments and a field trial. The consortium of P. chlororaphis, S. feltiae and M. brunneum could successfully reduce D. radicum damage in the field trial and the individual members had no impact on the survival of each other on roots and in the soil. The biocontrol agents applied alone were also effective, yet the Pseudomonas strain was more efficient than the nematode and the fungus. Under screening and semi-field conditions, combinations of pseudomonads with either nematodes or fungi resulted in synergistic interactions. In a next step, the consortium was applied in laboratory assays against the leaf-feeding large cabbage white Pieris brassicae and the root-feeding banded cucumber beetle Diabrotica balteata and the interaction between the three biocontrol agents inside the larvae was investigated. The triple consortium was the most lethal and fastest killing treatment against both insects. A combination of plating and qPCR approaches allowed us to simultaneously monitor all biocontrol agents including the nematode-associated bacterium Xenorhabdus bovienii in the same insect. After simultaneous application, all three agents as well as the xenorhabds established inside the larvae in the early stages of the infection. P. chlororaphis seems to profit from the other BCA and reached the highest colonisation densities in co-infections in both insects. S. feltiae and M. brunneum, however, seemed to be mutually exclusive in double applications of nematodes and fungi. Interestingly, all four insecticidal organisms could be detected in several individual larvae. These results suggest that P. chlororaphis, S. feltiae and M. brunneum can indeed co-infect the same insect. In the last part of this thesis, fluorescent pseudomonads were isolated from radish leaves and screened for their abilities to kill insects, suppress pathogens and persist in the phyllosphere. Unfortunately, no P. chlororaphis and P. protegens strains were discovered, but strains from the subgroups P. fluorescens, P. koreensis and the group P. putida. Several strains showed insecticidal activity upon injection into Galleria mellonella larvae. Two leaf isolates of the P. fluorescens subgroup showed potent oral insecticidal activity against the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella, comparable to P. chlororaphis PCLRT03 and P. protegens CHA0. Furthermore, the new leaf isolates persisted better in the phyllosphere than the tested P. chlororaphis and P. protegens strains. The results obtained in this thesis suggest that insecticidal pseudomonads from the P. chlororaphis subgroup can be used to control below-ground insect pests. Furthermore, our findings show that insecticidal pseudomonads are compatible and co-operate with entomopathogenic nematodes and fungi. The consortium of P. chlororaphis, S. feltiae and M. brunneum can potentially be used to control a variety of below-ground insect pests. Applying the consortium might improve efficacy or stability of biocontrol. How- ever, further research on performance in the field and efficacy against different insect pests is needed. The approaches used in this thesis can be used to build and evaluate further consortia against other pests. Finally, the insights gained in this thesis are highly valuable for the development of biocontrol strategies based on insecticidal pseudomonads and consortia of biocontrol agents.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000602628",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/602628","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Exploring the Biocontrol Potential of Insecticidal Fluorescent Pseudomonads Applied Alone and in Combination with Entomopathogenic Nematodes and Fungi","Doctoral Thesis","Open access","DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2023-03-10T10:48:10Z",,,"yes",,,,,,"28966",,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We monitored the infection course in a leaf- (Pieris brassicae) and a root-feeding (Diabrotica balteata) pest insect after simultaneous application of the three BCA as well as their interactions inside the larvae in a laboratory setting. The triple combination caused the highest mortality and increased killing speed compared to single applications against both pests. Improved efficacy against P. brassicae was mainly caused by the pseudomonad-nematode combination, whereas the nematode-fungus combination accelerated killing of D. balteata. Co-monitoring of the three BCA and the nematode-associated Xenorhabdus symbionts revealed that the four organisms are able to co-infect the same larva. However, with advancing decay of the cadaver there is increasing competition and cadaver colonization is clearly dominated by the pseudomonads, which are known for their high competitivity in the plant rhizosphere.

In this thesis, I combine field and laboratory experiments using the water flea Daphnia to investigate the role of host microbiomes in host-parasite interactions. In Chapter I, I surveyed with my co-authors the bacterial communities of eight Daphnia galeata genotypes isolated from Lake Greifensee and found host genotype-specific variation. We additionally found no correlation between host genetic distances based on whole genome sequencing of the hosts, and bacterial community composition, suggesting that host genetic distances do not predict divergence in bacterial communities. In Chapter II, we compared the bacterial communities of Daphnia sp. in Lake Greifensee between hosts infected or not infected with the virulent, eukaryotic gut parasite Caullerya mesnili. We found that infection associates with reduced alpha diversity in the gut (the site of infection) and altered community composition in both the gut and body. In Chapter III we tested long-term dynamics of host-parasite-bacterial community associations between Daphnia and Caullerya in Lake Greifensee. For this, we compared infected and uninfected Daphnia across six natural epidemics spanning 13 years. Here we found that Daphnia bacterial community composition showed substantial temporal variation in both dominant bacterial taxa as well as rare taxa, but that infection by Caullerya only altered the composition of rare taxa. Host bacterial community composition also correlated with parasite infection prevalence, i.e. years with larger epidemics had distinct host bacterial communities than those with smaller epidemics. We further found that the environmental abiotic conditions temperature, dissolved oxygen content and cyanobacterial abundance in lake water, all previously known to drive epidemics all associated with distinct host bacterial community compositions. In Chapter IV, we tested the directionality of infection and host microbiome interaction in a laboratory experiment with Daphnia magna and the fungal parasite Metschnikowia bicuspidata. We found that initial parasite exposure drives host genotype specific changes in bacterial community compositions that correlate with the parasite’s life stage. We also found that successful infection drives a loss of bacterial community diversity and abundance shifts in dominant bacterial taxa in the host gut. Overall, the results of this thesis indicate that Daphnia bacterial communities play a significant role in host-parasite interaction.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000608900",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/608900","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Microbiome||Daphnia||aquatic ecology||Host-parasite interaction","Integrating host-microbiota dynamics with disease ecology in the model Daphnia","Doctoral Thesis","Open access","DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2023-04-22T17:13:19Z",,,"yes",,,,,,"29044",,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We developed an experimental regime facilitating this approach, featuring the bacterial broad-spectrum predator Myxococcus xanthus and the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We demonstrate that Z. tritici, a major cause of crop loss and fungicide use worldwide, both fuels growth of and is killed by M. xanthus on wheat straw, a probable source of seedling infection. M. xanthus was found capable of growth on moistened straw alone, unaided by Z. tritici, in a manner dependent on both M. xanthus initial density and on how long straw was moistened before M. xanthus inoculation. Such growth of non-cellulolytic myxobacteria on plant detritus may have implications for understanding their roles in nutrient cycling. However, straw with Z. tritici was found to fuel greater M. xanthus growth than straw alone under many conditions. After shorter moistening periods, growth by low-density M. xanthus populations was found to be fully dependent on Z. tritici. Such pathogen-dependent M. xanthus populations could be sustained with population replacement over five 1-week growth cycles, indicating the feasibility of conducting long-term experimental evolution with this system. Furthermore, M. xanthus was found to kill majorities of Z. tritici populations on both buffered agar and straw. Our results suggest that myxobacteria may serve as effective biocontrol agents of Z. tritici and are amenable to long-term experimental selection for enhanced killing of this pathogen, an approach broadly applicable to many potential biocontrol agents and target pathogens.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000609684","0032-0862||1365-3059",,"10.1111/ppa.13716","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/609684","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","myxobacteria||Myxococcus xanthus||predator-prey interactions||predatory bacteria||Septoria tritici blotch||Zymoseptoria tritici","Bacterial predation of a fungal wheat pathogen: Prelude to experimental evolution of enhanced biocontrol agents","Journal Article","Open access",,"2023-04-27T04:21:19Z",,,"yes","Experimental evolution of microbial predation on a major wheat pathogen||Mechanisms and indirect effects of adaptation by actively motile populations of Myxococcus xanthus","ETH-25 21-2||182830","10.13039/501100003006||10.13039/501100001711","ETHZ||SNF","ETH Grants||Exzellenzbeitrag in Lebenswissenschaften",,,"000963117200001","Plant pathol.",,"Plant Pathology",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
