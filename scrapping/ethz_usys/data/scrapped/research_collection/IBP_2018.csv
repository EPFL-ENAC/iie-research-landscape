We grew ice in an experimental seawater tank (1 m3) under abiotic conditions at three different air temperatures (−40°C, −25°C, −15°C) to determine how different ice growth rates affect the allocation of carbon to ice, water, or air. Carbonate system parameters were determined by discrete sampling of ice cores and water, as well as continuous measurements by multiple sensors deployed mainly in the water phase. A budgetary approach revealed that of the initial total inorganic carbon (TIC) content of the water converted to ice, only 28–29% was located in the ice phase by the end of the experiments run at the warmest temperature, whereas for the coldest ambient temperature, 46–47% of the carbon remained in the ice. Exchange with air appeared to be negligible, with the majority of the TIC remaining in the under-ice water (53–72%). Along with a good correlation between salinity and TIC in the ice and water samples, these observations highlight the importance of brine drainage to TIC redistribution during ice formation. For experiments without mixing of the under-ice water, the sensor data further suggested stronger stratification, likely related to release of denser brine, and thus potentially larger carbon sequestration for ice grown at a colder temperature and faster growth rate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000313822",,"2296-6463",,"10.3389/feart.2018.00234","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/313822","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","sea ice||growth rates||CO2 system||brine drainage||tank experiment","Carbon Dynamics During the Formation of Sea Ice at Different Growth Rates","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-01-05T03:23:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000454157000002","Front.

Of particular relevance is the competitive interaction between coccolithophores and diatoms, with the former being prevalent along the ""Great Calcite Belt"" (40–60°S), while diatoms tend to dominate the regions south of 60°S. To address the factors controlling coccolithophore distribution and the competition between them and diatoms, we use a regional high-resolution model (ROMS–BEC) for the Southern Ocean (24–78°S) that has been extended to include an explicit representation of coccolithophores. We assess the relative importance of bottom-up (temperature, nutrients, light) and top-down (grazing by zooplankton) factors in controlling Southern Ocean coccolithophore biogeography over the course of the growing season. In our simulations, coccolithophores are an important member of the Southern Ocean phytoplankton community, contributing 17% to annually integrated net primary productivity south of 30°S. Coccolithophore biomass is highest north of 50°S in late austral summer, when light levels are high and diatoms become limited by silicic acid. Furthermore, we find top-down factors to be a major control on the relative abundance of diatoms and coccolithophores in the Southern Ocean. Consequently, when assessing potential future changes in Southern Ocean coccolithophore abundance, both abiotic (temperature, light, and nutrients) and biotic factors (interaction with diatoms and zooplankton) need to be considered.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000307938",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-15-6997-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/307938","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Factors controlling coccolithophore biogeography in the Southern Ocean","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-12-02T05:29:47Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"SOGate: Phytoplankton ecosystem control of the Southern Ocean biogeochemical gate","153452","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,"85057156516",,"000450887500001",,"22","Biogeosciences","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Little is known about eDNA in marine human-modified environments, such as commercial ports, which are key sites to monitor for anthropogenic impacts on coastal ecosystems. To optimise an eDNA metabarcoding protocol in these environments, seawater samples were collected in a commercial port and methodologies for concentrating and purifying eDNA were tested for their effect on eukaryotic DNA yield and subsequent richness of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Different filter materials [Cellulose Nitrate (CN) and Glass Fibre (GF)], with different pore sizes (0.5 µm, 0.7 µm and 1.2 µm) and three previously published liquid phase extraction methods were tested. The number of eukaryotic OTUs detected differed by a factor of three amongst the method combinations. The combination of CN filters with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extractions recovered a higher amount of eukaryotic DNA and OTUs compared to GF filters and the chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction method. Pore size was not independent of filter material but did affect the yield of eukaryotic DNA. For the OTUs assigned to a highly successful non-indigenous species, Styela clava, the two extraction methods with phenol significantly outperformed the extraction method without phenol; other experimental treatments did not contribute significantly to detection. These results highlight that careful consideration of methods is warranted because choice of filter material and extraction method create false negative detections of marine eukaryotic OTUs and underestimate taxonomic richness from environmental samples.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000502267",,"2534-9708",,"10.3897/mbmg.2.28963","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502267","en","Pensoft Publishers","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","eDNA||18S ribosomal||seawater||high-throughput-sequencing||metazoan eukaryotes||non-indigenous species","Optimising the detection of marine taxonomic richness using environmental DNA metabarcoding: the effects of filter material, pore size and extraction method","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-26T09:39:58Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85073643329",,,,,"Metabarcoding and Metagenomics","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Therefore, an assessment of comprehensive continuous surface O_3 measurements performed at four sites in continental South Africa was conducted. The regional O_3 problem was evident, with O_3 concentrations regularly exceeding the South African air quality standard limit, while O_3 levels were higher compared to other background sites in the Southern Hemisphere. The temporal O_3 patterns observed at the four sites resembled typical trends for O_3 in continental South Africa, with O_3 concentrations peaking in late winter and early spring. Increased O_3 concentrations in winter were indicative of increased emissions of O_3 precursors from household combustion and other low-level sources, while a spring maximum observed at all the sites was attributed to increased regional biomass burning. Source area maps of O_3 and CO indicated significantly higher O_3 and CO concentrations associated with air masses passing over a region with increased seasonal open biomass burning, which indicated CO associated with open biomass burning as a major source of O3 in continental South Africa. A strong correlation between O_3 on CO was observed, while O_3 levels remained relatively constant or decreased with increasing NOx, which supports a VOC-limited regime. The instantaneous production rate of O_3 calculated at Welgegund indicated that  ∼ 40% of O_3 production occurred in the VOC-limited regime. The relationship between O_3 and precursor species suggests that continental South Africa can be considered VOC limited, which can be attributed to high anthropogenic emissions of NOx in the interior of South Africa. The study indicated that the most effective emission control strategy to reduce O_3 levels in continental South Africa should be CO and VOC reduction, mainly associated with household combustion and regional open biomass burning.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302452",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-18-15491-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302452","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Seasonal influences on surface ozone variability in continental South Africa and implications for air quality","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-11-09T05:50:28Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85055875352",,"000448591500002","Atmos. chem. phys.","20","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Bridging the gap between the micro-scale at which ecological interactions between bacteria unfold and the orders-of-magnitude larger ecosystem-scale is one of the major challenges in microbial ecology. Here, we address this gap by investigating how communities of bacteria assemble on and degrade model particulate organic matter, a crucial process in biological carbon cycling in the marine environment. We aim to answer a central question in microbial ecology: how microbial communities reproducibly self-organize and if those dynamics can be predicted. We first track the taxon dynamics of bacteria attached to different types of model marine particles and demonstrate that particle-attached communities undergo reproducible successions. Moreover, we discover two ecological strategies of particle attached bacteria: in one, bacteria attach to all particle types alike and, in the other, they selectively colonize one particle type. The partitioning into ecological strategies reveals simple, modular design principles in community assembly dynamics during particulate organic matter decomposition.  We next link micro-scale ecology –the interactions between microbes that coexist in close proximity– of model marine microbial communities to community function, in this case turnover of particulate organic matter. We find that interactions between two major functional classes of bacteria, primary particle degraders and secondary, non-degrading consumers, regulate particulate organic matter turnover. Secondary consumers decrease particle degradation rates as they compete for available resources such as carbon or physical space, thereby altering the dynamics of carbon cycling and remineralization in the ocean. The demonstrated regulation of particulate organic matter turnover by ecological interactions between two major groups of bacteria and the observed taxonomic shifts during the successional transitions that shape particle attached microbial communities contribute to our understanding of the effect of microbial ecology at the micro-scale on global-scale ecosystem processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000316558",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316558","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Life at the Micro-Scale - Marine Microbial Ecology on Model Particulate Organic Matter","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences",,"2019-01-16T21:55:34Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"24940",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The sensor system is based on the measurement of EMF between two solid-contact ion selective electrodes (SC-ISEs), a hydrogen ion selective and a carbonate selective sensor. Since it relies on SC-ISEs, it is insensitive to changes in pressure, thus suitable for in situ studies. Also, as it offers a response time (t95%) of <10 s, it allows for profiling applications at high spatial resolution. The proposed optimum in situ protocol accounts for the continuous drift and change in offset that remains a challenge during profiling in natural waters. The fast response resolves features that are usually missed by standard methods like the classical Severinghaus CO2 probe. In addition, the insensitivity of the presented setup to dissolved sulfide allows also for measurements in anoxic zones of eutrophic systems. Highly resolved CO2 concentration profiles obtained by the novel and robust SC-ISE setup along with the developed optimum in situ protocol allow investigating hotspots of biogeochemical processes, such as mineralization and primary production in the water column and help improving estimates for CO2 turnover in freshwater systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302283",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.8b02969","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302283","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Fast Potentiometric CO2 Sensor for High-Resolution in Situ Measurements in Fresh Water Systems","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-11-09T05:09:45Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85053712092",,"000446542100040","Environ.

Previous research revealed that the transpiration-to-evapotranspiration ratio (T/ET) is well constrained across ecosystems and is nearly independent of vegetation characteristics and climate. Here we investigated the reasons for such a global constancy in present-day T/ET by jointly analysing observations and process-based model simulations. Using this framework, we also quantified how the ratio T/ET could be influenced by changing climate. For present conditions, we found that the various components of land surface evaporation (bare soil evaporation, below canopy soil evaporation, evaporation from interception), and their respective ratios to plant transpiration, depend largely on local climate and equilibrium vegetation properties. The systematic covariation between local vegetation characteristics and climate, resulted in a globally constrained value of T/ET = ~70 ± 9% for undisturbed ecosystems, nearly independent of specific climate and vegetation attributes. Moreover, changes in precipitation amounts and patterns, increasing air temperatures, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and specific leaf area (the ratio of leaf area per leaf mass) was found to affect T/ET in various manners. However, even extreme changes in the aforementioned factors did not significantly modify T/ET.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302302",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aae267","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302302","en","IOP","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","T/ET||evapotranspiration partitioning||ecohydrology||modelling||climate change","Covariation of vegetation and climate constrains present and future T/ET variability","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-11-09T05:11:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85055816082",,"000446692100003","Environ.

From this angle, policy questions like whether an implemented policy to reduce chemical exposure has had an effect over time, whether the health of people in specific regions or subpopulations is at risk, or whether the body burden of chemical substances (the internal exposure) varies with, for example, time, country, sex, age, or socio-economic status, need to be answered. Indicators can help to synthesize complex scientific information into a few key descriptors with the purpose of providing an answer to a non-expert audience. Human biomonitoring (HBM) indicators at the European Union (EU) level are unfortunately lacking. Within the Horizon2020 European Human Biomonitoring project HBM4EU, an approach to develop European HBM indicators was worked out. To learn from and ensure interoperability with other European indicators, 15 experts from the HBM4EU project (German Umweltbundesamt (UBA), Flemish research institute VITO, University of Antwerp, European Environment Agency (EEA)), and the World Health Organization (WHO), European Core Health Indicator initiative (ECHI), Eurostat, Swiss ETH Zurich and the Czech environmental institute CENIA, and contributed to a workshop, held in June 2017 at the EEA in Copenhagen. First, selection criteria were defined to evaluate when and if results of internal chemical exposure measured by HBM, need to be translated into a European HBM-based indicator. Two main aspects are the HBM indicator’s relevance for policy, society, health, and the quality of the biomarker data (availability, comparability, ease of interpretation). Secondly, an approach for the calculation of the indicators was designed. Two types of indicators were proposed: ‘sum indicators of internal exposure’ derived directly from HBM biomarker concentrations and ‘indicators for health risk’, comparing HBM concentrations to HBM health-based guidance values (HBM HBGVs). In the latter case, both the percentage of the studied population exceeding the HBM HBGVs (PE) and the extent of exceedance (EE), calculated as the population’s exposure level divided by the HBM HBGV, can be calculated. These indicators were applied to two examples of hazardous chemicals: bisphenol A (BPA) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), which both have high policy and societal relevance and for which high quality published data were available (DEMOCOPHES, Swedish monitoring campaign). European HBM indicators help to summarize internal exposure to chemical substances among the European population and communicate to what degree environmental policies are successful in keeping internal exposures sufficiently low. The main aim of HBM indicators is to allow follow-up of chemical safety in Europe.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000295695",,"1660-4601||1661-7827",,"10.3390/ijerph15102085","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/295695","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Indicator||Human biomonitoring||HBM||Science-policy translation||HBM4EU||Health-based guidancevalue||Groups of substance","Development of Policy Relevant Human Biomonitoring Indicators for Chemical Exposure in the European Population","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-10-13T10:07:12Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85053854468",,"000448818100027","Int J Environ Res Public Health","10","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Redox transformations of electron-donating phenols and electron-accepting quinones in peat organic matter are increasingly recognized as key processes that govern carbon cycling in peat soil, including the release of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane from these systems. First, phenolic dissolved organic matter (DOM) in peat is considered to inhibit the activity of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes, thus decreasing peat decomposition rates. Increasing oxygenation events as a result of changing climatic conditions may lead to enzymatic oxidation of these phenols and thus loss of their inhibitory pressure, leading to accelerated decomposition of peat organic matter. Second, quinone moieties in peat organic matter in water-saturated, anoxic peat are considered to serve as terminal electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration. Respiration to quinones under formation of the corresponding hydroquinones is considered to suppress methane emissions from peatlands, provided that the electron-accepting quinones are regularly regenerated through oxidation with O2. Despite the importance of phenols and quinones to peatland carbon cycling, little information was available on the concentration ranges of these moieties in peatlands as well as on their redox transformations in oxidative and reductive environments. This lack of information reflected analytical challenges associated with the quantification of these moieties in organic matter. The goal of my dissertation research, summarized herein, was to overcome existing knowledge gaps by (i) developing analytical approaches to quantify the redox properties of peat organic matter, (ii) providing a systematic characterization of the redox properties of peat organic matter and (iii) elucidating changes in the redox properties of peat organic matter during key reduction and oxidation processes that occur in peatlands. The research involved both field and laboratory studies. In the first part my PhD research, I developed and validated a flow-injection analysis (FIA) system coupled to electrochemical detection to accurately determine the redox properties of dilute DOM under defined EH and pH conditions. This novel system has significantly higher sensitivity to oxidizable and reducible moieties than previously employed analytical techniques. Furthermore, the system allows for automated sample analysis which was not previously possible. The development of this method was instrumental to the characterization of the redox properties of peat DOM in the next part of my PhD research. In the second part of my PhD work, I used the FIA system to quantify the number of electron-donating and electron-accepting moieties in peat DOM collected from pristine ombrotrophic bogs in Värmland, Sweden. DOM sampled from anoxic peat pore water in these bogs had high phenol contents as compared to a diverse set of model DOM isolates from different aquatic and terrestrial environments. Analysis of DOM collected from oxic pools located in the same bogs rather than anoxic pore water revealed that the pool DOM had lower phenol contents, suggesting oxidative processes in the pools that resulted in a loss of phenolic moieties. Consistently, incubating peat DOM with phenol oxidase under oxic conditions resulted in irreversible oxidation of phenols. The finding of oxidative removal of phenols in peat DOM supports that oxygenation events remove phenols in peat organic matter and thus possibly also their inhibitory role in peat organic matter decomposition. The FIA analysis further demonstrated, for the first time, the presence of electron-accepting quinones in peat DOM from both, peat pore water and pool water. Electron transfer to peat DOM over a cycle of electrochemical reduction and subsequent O2 reoxidation was fully reversible, supporting the hypothesized role of quinone moieties in DOM as regenerable terminal electron acceptors. In the third part of my PhD research, I switched focus from DOM to particulate organic matter (POM) in bogs. More specifically, we studied the redox state and reactivity of POM in anoxic peat with dissolved O2 directly in the field. Using push-pull tests with dissolved O2 as reactant, we demonstrated rapid and complete consumption of dissolved oxygen injected in anoxic peat as a result of abiotic electron transfer from reduced moieties in POM to O2. We thereby demonstrated that POM was in a highly reduced state and that the reduced moieties in POM rapidly transfer electrons to oxygen, consistent with the hypothesized role of peat POM as a regenerable terminal electron acceptor in temporarily anoxic parts of peats. Finally, we highlighted the potential of using consecutive oxygen push-pull tests to quantify the total reducing capacity of POM directly in the field. In the last part of my PhD research, we demonstrated the applicability of the developed FIA system to monitor changes in the redox state of DOM also in the context of chemical water treatment. To this end, treated DOM samples and DOM isolates with increasing specific doses of chlorine and ozone and subsequently quantified the resulting decrease in electron-donating phenols in the DOM samples. The results from this work highlight the potential of the FIA system to be employed in routine analysis during chemical water treatment to monitor changes in the redox state of DOM. Taken together, my PhD research summarized in this thesis advances analytical methods to quantify phenols and quinones in organic matter in environmental and engineered systems and contributes to a more holistic understanding of the role of these moieties in the carbon cycling of peatlands.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000325988",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/325988","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Quantification and Redox Dynamics of Phenols and Quinones in Organic Matter from Northern Peatlands","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,"2019-02-19T08:38:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25256",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, the overall indirect photodegradation rates of diarylamines in the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were enhanced in D_2O to a greater extent than expected based on their reactivity with ^1O_2. For each diarylamine, the relative contribution of reaction with ^1O_2 to the observed KSIE was determined from high resolution data of ^1O_2 lifetimes by time-resolved infrared luminescence spectroscopy. The additional enhancement in D_2O beyond reaction with ^1O_2 contributed significantly to the observed KSIE for diarylamines (8–65%) and diclofenac (100%). The enhancement was ascribed to slower reduction of transient radical species of the diarylamines due to H/D exchange at DOM’s phenolic antioxidant moieties. A slower second-order reaction rate constant with a model antioxidant was verified for mefenamic acid radicals using transient absorption spectroscopy. Changes in lifetime and reactivity with triplet sensitizers were not responsible for the additional KSIE. Other pollutants with quenchable radical intermediates may also be susceptible to such an additional KSIE, which has to be considered when using the KSIE as a diagnostic tool.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000289918",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.8b01512","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/289918","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Non-Singlet Oxygen Kinetic Solvent Isotope Effects in Aquatic Photochemistry","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-09-17T08:49:30Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Electron transfer properties of photoexcited natural organic matter","156198","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85052299896",,"000444061100039","Environ.

To better understand the kinetic behavior and reactivity of 3CDOM*, we have developed an indirect observation method based on monitoring time-resolved singlet oxygen (1O2) phosphorescence kinetics. The underpinning principle of our approach relies on the fact that O2 quenches almost all triplets with near diffusion limited rate constants, resulting in the formation of 1O2, which is kinetically linked to the precursors. A kinetic model relating 1O2 phosphorescence kinetics to triplet excited states produced from isolated humic substances and in whole natural-water samples (hereafter referred to as 3CDOM*) was developed and used to determine rate constants governing 3CDOM* natural lifetimes and quenching by oxygen and 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (TMP), a common triplet probe molecule. 3CDOM* was found to exhibit smaller O2 and TMP quenching rate constants, ∼9 × 108 and ∼8 × 108 M–1 s–1, respectively, compared with model sensitizers, such as aromatic ketones. Findings from this report shed light on the fundamental photochemical properties of CDOM in organic matter isolates and whole waters and will help refine photochemical models to more accurately predict pollutant fate in the environment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000285931",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.8b02379","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/285931","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Singlet Oxygen Phosphorescence as a Probe for Triplet-State Dissolved Organic Matter Reactivity","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-31T07:05:16Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Electron transfer properties of photoexcited natural organic matter","156198","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85050600000",,"000442706700019","Environ.

Furthermore, we show that in arid-zone soils, some primary mineral P remains even after 150 ky of soil development, whereas in humid-zone soils of the same age, all P in all pools has been biologically cycled.

In particular, a transition from ductile-to-brittle failure behavior with increasing load rate is observed. The rate-dependent behavior can partly be explained with the existence of a unique healing mechanism in snow that stems from its high homologous temperature (temperature close to melting point). As soon as broken elements in the ice matrix get in contact, they start sintering and the structure may regain strength. Moreover, the ice matrix is subjected to viscous deformation, inducing a relaxation of local load concentrations and, therefore, further counteracting the damage process. Ideal tools for studying the failure process of heterogeneous materials are the fiber-bundle models (FBMs), which allow investigating the effects of basic microstructural characteristics on the general macroscopic failure behavior. We present an FBM with two concurrent time-dependent healing mechanisms: sintering of broken fibers and relaxation of load inhomogeneities. Sintering compensates damage by creating additional intact, load-supporting fibers which lead to an increase of the bundle strength. However, the character of the failure is not changed by sintering alone. With combined sintering and load relaxation, load is distributed from old stronger fibers to new fibers that carry fewer load. So as we additionally incorporated load redistribution to the FBM, the failure occurred suddenly without decrease of the order parameter—describing the amount of damage in the bundle—and without divergence of the fiber failure rate. Moreover, the b value, i.e., the power-law exponent of frequency-magnitude statistics of fibers breaking in load redistribution steps, at failure converged to b≈2, a value higher than that of a classical FBM without healing (b=32). These results indicate that healing, as the combined effect of sintering and load relaxation, changes the type of the phase transition at failure. This change of the phase transition is important for quantifying or predicting the failure (e.g., by monitoring acoustic emissions) of snow or other materials for which healing plays an important role.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000284322",,"1539-3755||1063-651X||1095-3787||1550-2376",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.98.023002","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/284322","en","American Physical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Fiber-bundle model with time-dependent healing mechanisms to simulate progressive failure of snow","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-24T08:23:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85051480059",,"000441720300005","Phys. rev., E","2","Physical Review E","98","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To this end, we identify over 100000 mesoscale eddies with diameters of 50km and more in the Southern Ocean and determine the associated phytoplankton biomass anomalies using satellite-based chlorophyll-a (Chl) as a proxy. The mean Chl anomalies, δChl, associated with these eddies, comprising the upper echelon of the oceanic mesoscale, exceed ±10% over wide regions. The structure of these anomalies is largely zonal, with cyclonic, thermocline lifted, eddies having positive anomalies in the subtropical waters north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and negative anomalies along its main flow path. The pattern is similar, but reversed for anticyclonic, thermocline deepened eddies. The seasonality of δChl is weak in subtropical waters, but pronounced along the ACC, featuring a seasonal sign switch. The spatial structure and seasonality of the mesoscale δChl can be explained largely by lateral advection, especially local eddy-stirring. A prominent exception is the ACC region in winter, where δChl is consistent with a modulation of phytoplankton light exposure caused by an eddy-induced modification of the mixed layer depth. The clear impact of mesoscale eddies on phytoplankton may implicate a downstream effect on Southern Ocean biogeochemical properties, such as mode water nutrient contents.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000283963",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-15-4781-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/283963","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Imprint of Southern Ocean mesoscale eddies on chlorophyll","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-23T07:36:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85051569854",,"000441391700001",,"15","Biogeosciences","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To date,over 4,000 unique PFASs have been used in technical applications and consumer products, and some of them have been detected globally in humanand wildlife biomonitoring studies. Because of their extraordinary persistence, human and environmental exposure to PFASs will be a long-termsource of concern. Some PFASs such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) have been investigated extensivelyand thus regulated, but for many other PFASs, knowledge about their current uses and hazards is still very limited or missing entirely. To addressthis problem and prepare an action plan for the assessment and management of PFASs in the coming years, a group of more than 50 internationalscientists and regulators held a two-day workshop in November, 2017. The group identified both the respective needs of and common goals sharedby the scientific and the policy communities, made recommendations for cooperative actions, and outlined how the science–policy interfaceregarding PFASs can be strengthened using new approaches for assessing and managing highly persistent chemicals such as PFASs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000295561",,"1552-9924||0091-6765",,"10.1289/EHP4158","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/295561","en","National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Zürich Statement on Future Actions on Per - and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs)","Other Journal Item","Open access",,,,"2018-10-12T16:58:35Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85055423819",,"000444417500009","Environ Health Perspect","8","Environmental Health Perspectives","126","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02020 - Dep.

This study evaluates the potential of aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to detect Arctic coastal biodiversity changes and characterizes the local spatio-temporal distribution of eDNA in two locations. We extracted and amplified eDNA using two COI primer pairs from ~80 water samples that were collected across two Canadian Arctic ports, Churchill and Iqaluit, based on optimized sampling and preservation methods for remote regions surveys. Results demonstrate that aquatic eDNA surveys have the potential to document large-scale Arctic biodiversity change by providing a rapid overview of coastal metazoan biodiversity, detecting nonindigenous species, and allowing sampling in both open water and under the ice cover by local northern-based communities. We show that DNA sequences of ~50% of known Canadian Arctic species and potential invaders are currently present in public databases. A similar proportion of operational taxonomic units was identified at the species level with eDNA metabarcoding, for a total of 181 species identified at both sites. Despite the cold and well-mixed coastal environment, species composition was vertically heterogeneous, in part due to river inflow in the estuarine ecosystem, and differed between the water column and tide pools. Thus, COI-based eDNA metabarcoding may quickly improve large-scale Arctic biomonitoring using eDNA, but we caution that aquatic eDNA sampling needs to be standardized over space and time to accurately evaluate community structure changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000502270",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.4213","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502270","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"eDNA metabarcoding as a new surveillance approach for coastal Arctic biodiversity","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-26T09:45:13Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecol Evol","16","Ecology and Evolution","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The net impact of sunlight depends on the solar spectral irradiance, the susceptibility of the specific microorganism to each mechanism, and the water quality; inactivation rates can vary by orders of magnitude depending on the organism and environmental conditions. Natural organic matter (NOM) has a large influence, as it can attenuate radiation and thus decrease inactivation by endogenous mechanisms. Simultaneously NOM sensitizes the formation of reactive intermediates that can damage microorganisms via exogenous mechanisms. To accurately predict inactivation and design engineered systems that enhance solar inactivation, it is necessary to model these processes, although some details are not yet sufficiently well understood. In this critical review, we summarize the photo-physics, -chemistry, and -biology that underpin sunlight-mediated inactivation, as well as the targets of damage and cellular responses to sunlight exposure. Viruses that are not susceptible to exogenous inactivation are only inactivated if UVB wavelengths (280–320 nm) are present, such as in very clear, open waters or in containers that are transparent to UVB. Bacteria are susceptible to slightly longer wavelengths. Some viruses and bacteria (especially Gram-positive) are susceptible to exogenous inactivation, which can be initiated by visible as well as UV wavelengths. We review approaches to model sunlight-mediated inactivation and illustrate how the environmental conditions can dramatically shift the inactivation rate of organisms. The implications of this mechanistic understanding of solar inactivation are discussed for a range of applications, including recreational water quality, natural treatment systems, solar disinfection of drinking water (SODIS), and enhanced inactivation via the use of sensitizers and photocatalysts. Finally, priorities for future research are identified that will further our understanding of the key role that sunlight disinfection plays in natural systems and the potential to enhance this process in engineered systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000285256",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/c8em00047f","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/285256","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Sunlight-mediated inactivation of health-relevant microorganisms in water: a review of mechanisms and modeling approaches","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-29T06:05:10Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85052062887",,"000441765000001","Environ Sci Process Impacts","8","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Assessing risks and possible remediation strategies must consider the chemical forms of Hg, as different Hg species exhibit vastly different environmental behaviors and toxicities. Here, we present a study on Hg speciation and potential mobility in sediments from a chemical factory site, and soils from nearby settlement areas in the canton of Valais, Switzerland. Total Hg ranged from 0.5 to 28.4 mg/kg in the soils, and 3.5 to 174.7 mg/kg in the sediments, respectively. Elemental Hg(0) was not detectable in the soils by thermal desorption analysis. Methylmercury, the most toxic form of Hg, was present at low levels in all soils (<0.010 mg/kg; <0.8% of total Hg). Sequential extractions and thermal desorption analyses suggested that most of the Hg in the soils was present as “matrix-bound Hg(II)”, most likely associated with soil organic matter. For factory sediments, which contained less organic matter, the results suggested a higher fraction of sulfide-bound Hg. Batch extractions in different CaCl2 solutions revealed that Hg solubility was low overall, and there was no Hg-mobilizing effects of Ca2+ or Cl− in solution. Only in some of the factory sediments did high CaCl2 concentrations result in increased extractability of Hg, due to the formation of Hg-chloride complexes. Additional experiments with soil redox reactors showed that even mildly reducing conditions led to a sharp release of Hg into solution, which may be highly relevant in soils that are prone to periodic water saturation of flooding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000309572",,,,"10.3390/soilsystems2030044","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/309572","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","mercury||pollution||contamination||toxicity||risk assessment||solubility||extraction||redox","Speciation and mobility of mercury in soils contaminated by legacy emissions from a chemical factory in the Rhone Valley in Canton of Valais, Switzerland","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-12-10T08:59:11Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Soil Systems","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The use of biodegradable instead of nonbiodegradable polymers in single-use agricultural applications, including plastic mulching, promises to reduce plastic accumulation in the environment. We present a novel approach that allows tracking of carbon from biodegradable polymers into CO2 and microbial biomass. The approach is based on 13C-labeled polymers and on isotope-specific analytical methods, including nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). Our results unequivocally demonstrate the biodegradability of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), an important polyester used in agriculture, in soil. Carbon from each monomer unit of PBAT was used by soil microorganisms, including filamentous fungi, to gain energy and to form biomass. This work advances both our conceptual understanding of polymer biodegradation and the methodological capabilities to assess this process in natural and engineered environments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000280881",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.aas9024","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/280881","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Biodegradation of synthetic polymers in soils: Tracking carbon into CO2 and microbial biomass","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-08-06T18:23:15Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85050810983",,"000443176100038","Sci Adv","7","Science Advances","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, quantifying crop drought vulnerability is often not straightforward, because components of vulnerability are not defined in a standardized and spatially comparable quantity in most cases and it must be defined on a fine spatial resolution. This study aims to develop a physical crop drought vulnerability index through linking the drought exposure index (DEI) with the crop sensitivity index (CSI) in sub-Saharan Africa. Two different DEIs were compared. One was derived from the cumulative distribution functions fitted to precipitation and the other from the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. DEIs were calculated for one, three, six, nine, and twelve-month time scales. Similarly, CSI was calculated by fitting a cumulative distribution function to maize yield simulated using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model. Using a power function, curves were fitted to CSI and DEI relations resulting in different shapes explaining the severity of vulnerability. The results indicated that the highest correlation was found between CSI and DEI obtained from the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in one, three, and six-month time scales. Our findings show that southern African countries and some regions of the Sahelian strip are highly vulnerable to drought due to experiencing more water stress, whereas vulnerability in Central African countries pertains to temperature stresses. The proposed methodology provides complementary information on quantifying different degrees of vulnerabilities and the underlying reasons. The methodology can be applied to different regions and spatial scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000275750",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aacb37","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/275750","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","EPIC||Potential evapotranspiration||vulnerability classes||power function","Spatial assessment of maize physical drought vulnerability in sub-Saharan Africa: Linking drought exposure with crop failure","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-07-14T04:03:10Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85056503292",,"000436996100001","Environ.

However, the impact of geodynamic processes on the distributions and carbon-cycling activities of subseafloor life remains poorly constrained. We explore a submarine mud volcano of the Nankai accretionary complex by drilling down to 200 m below the summit. Stable isotopic compositions of water and carbon compounds, including clumped methane isotopologues, suggest that ~90% of methane is microbially produced at 16° to 30°C and 300 to 900 m below seafloor, corresponding to the basin bottom, where fluids in the accretionary prism are supplied via megasplay faults. Radiotracer experiments showed that relatively small microbial populations in deep mud volcano sediments (102 to 103 cells cm−3) include highly active hydrogenotrophic methanogens and acetogens. Our findings indicate that subduction-associated fluid migration has stimulated microbial activity in the mud reservoir and that mud volcanoes may contribute more substantially to the methane budget than previously estimated.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000274400",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.aao4631","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/274400","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Deep-biosphere methane production stimulated by geofluids in the nankai accretionary complex","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-07-06T16:10:19Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85049221503",,"000443175500004","Sci Adv","6","Science Advances","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, sampling effort must be considered when interpreting results from these surveys. We explored how sampling effort influenced biodiversity patterns and nonindigenous species (NIS) detection in an eDNA metabarcoding survey of four commercial ports. Overall, we captured sequences from 18 metazoan phyla with minimal differences in taxonomic coverage between 18 S and COI primer sets. While community dissimilarity patterns were consistent across primers and sampling effort, richness patterns were not, suggesting that richness estimates are extremely sensitive to primer choice and sampling effort. The survey detected 64 potential NIS, with COI identifying more known NIS from port checklists but 18 S identifying more operational taxonomic units shared between three or more ports that represent un-recorded potential NIS. Overall, we conclude that eDNA metabarcoding surveys can reveal global similarity patterns among ports across a broad array of taxa and can also detect potential NIS in these key habitats. However, richness estimates and species assignments require caution. Based on results of this study, we make several recommendations for port eDNA sampling design and suggest several areas for future research.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000496741",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-018-27048-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/496741","en","Macmillan Publishers","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Effects of sampling effort on biodiversity patterns estimated from environmental DNA metabarcoding surveys","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-21T08:26:07Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In stream networks, the accuracy of eDNA-based biodiversity assessment depends on whether the upstream eDNA influx affects downstream detection. Biodiversity assessment in low-discharge streams should be less influenced by eDNA transport than in high-discharge streams. We estimated α- and β-diversity of the fish community from eDNA samples collected in a small Michigan (USA) stream from its headwaters to its confluence with a larger river. We found that α-diversity increased from upstream to downstream and, as predicted, we found a significant positive correlation between β-diversity and physical distance (stream length) between locations indicating species turnover along the longitudinal stream gradient. Sample replicates and different genetic markers showed similar species composition, supporting the consistency of the eDNA metabarcoding approach to estimate α- and β-diversity of fishes in low-discharge streams.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000502271",,"2534-9708",,"10.3897/mbmg.2.24262","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502271","en","Pensoft Publishers","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","eDNA||biodiversity assessment||biomonitoring||α-diversity||β-diversity||high throughput sequencing","Estimating fish alpha- and beta-diversity along a small stream with environmental DNA metabarcoding","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-26T09:47:27Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85062322591",,,,,"Metabarcoding and Metagenomics","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Such interfacial instabilities are undesirable in many natural and engineered displacement processes. We report a phenomenon whereby gradual and monotonic variation of pore sizes along the front path suppresses viscous fingering during immiscible displacement, that seemingly contradicts conventional expectation of enhanced instability with pore size variability. Experiments and pore-scale numerical simulations were combined with an analytical model for the characteristics of displacement front morphology as a function of the pore size gradient. Our results suggest that the gradual reduction of pore sizes act to restrain viscous fingering for a predictable range of flow conditions (as anticipated by gradient percolation theory). The study provides insights into ways for suppressing unwanted interfacial instabilities in porous media, and provides design principles for new engineered porous media such as exchange columns, fabric, paper, and membranes with respect to their desired immiscible displacement behavior.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000265139",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.1800729115","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/265139","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","suppressed viscous fingering||structured porous media||microfluidics||direct numerical simulation||analytical model","Suppressing viscous fingering in structured porous media","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-05-18T16:50:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85046629783",,"000431639100038","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","19","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","115","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This review paper was developed as part of the activities of the IWWG ENMs in Waste Task Group. The specific objectives of this review paper are to assess the current knowledge associated with the fate of ENMs in commonly used waste management processes, including key processes and mechanisms associated with ENM fate and transport in each waste management process, and to use that information to identify the data gaps and research needs in this area. Literature associated with the fate of ENMs in wastes was reviewed and summarized. Overall, results from this literature review indicate a need for continued research in this area. No work has been conducted to quantify ENMs present in discarded materials and an understanding of ENM release from consumer products under conditions representative of those found in relevant waste management process is needed. Results also indicate that significant knowledge gaps associated with ENM behaviour exist for each waste management process investigated. There is a need for additional research investigating the fate of different types of ENMs at larger concentration ranges with different surface chemistries. Understanding how changes in treatment process operation may influence ENM fate is also needed. A series of specific research questions associated with the fate of ENMs during the management of ENM-containing wastes have been identified and used to direct future research in this area. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,"0956-053X||1879-2456",,"10.1016/j.wasman.2018.02.012","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/469893","en","Elsevier",,,"Engineered nanomaterials||Waste management||Landfills||Recycling||Incineration||Biological treatment","A review of the fate of engineered nanomaterials in municipal solid waste streams","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-02-17T08:57:18Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Waste Manag",,"Waste Management","75","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The highly complex nature of the interactions between DOM and ENPs and other particulate matter (PM) requires investigating a wide range of material types under different conditions. However, despite repeated calls for an increased diversity of the DOM and PM studied, researchers increasingly focus on certain subsets of DOM and PM. Considering the discrepancy between the calls for more diversity and the research actually carried out, we hypothesize that materials that were studied more often are more visible in the scientific literature and therefore are more likely to be studied again. To investigate the plausibility of this hypothesis, we developed an agent-based model simulating the material choice in the experiments studying the interaction between DOM and PM between 1990 and 2015. The model reproduces the temporal trends in the choice of materials as well as the main properties of a network that displays the DOM and PM types investigated experimentally. The results, which support the hypothesis of a positive reinforcing material choice, help to explain why calls to increase the diversity of the materials studied are repeatedly made and why recent criticism states that the selection of materials is unbalanced.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000267251",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0196549","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/267251","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The influence of past research on the design of experiments with dissolved organic matter and engineered nanoparticles","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-06-02T05:38:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85046686481",,"000431481700019","PLoS ONE","5","PLoS ONE","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02020 - Dep.

This interdisciplinary and exploratory research on four mining sites in the Center North region of Burkina Faso investigates the impact on soil and water caused by the widespread use of mercury and cyanide in the extraction process. Hotspots of contamination are found at the processing and tailing sites. Further, it quantifies the health burden of the mining community due to cyanide exposure. The results show elevated cyanide concentrations and related health patterns for workers exposed to cyanide. Finally, the socio-economic analysis reveals different mechanisms how agriculture and ASGM activities interact at the household level and how labor and capital is allocated. The findings suggest to expand development support from a predominantly agricultural focus towards an explicit livelihood approach that includes ASGM reality. This includes engagement on the ASGM work site for awareness rising in health and environmental issues as well as supporting means to more effectively and sustainably combine mining and agriculture.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000282708",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/282708","en","NADEL Center for Development and Cooperation, ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Mining contamination||Cyanide||Burkina Faso||Gold||Health||Rural development||Mercury||Environmental impact","Small-scale gold mining in Burkina Faso: Health effects, environmental burden and socio-economic interactions with agriculture","Report","Open access",,,,"2018-08-15T14:10:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although they can be dechlorinated by microorganisms, reductive dehalogenases, and their corrinoid cofactor, biochemical reaction mechanisms remain unsolved. This study uncovers a mechanistic shift revealed by contrasting compound-specific carbon (ε13C) and chlorine (ε37Cl) isotope effects between perchloroethene, PCE (ε37Cl = −4.0‰) and cis-dichloroethene, cis-DCE (ε37Cl = −1.5‰), and a pH-dependent shift for trichloroethene, TCE (from ε37Cl = −5.2‰ at pH 12 to ε37Cl = −1.2‰ at pH 5). Different pathways are supported also by pH-dependent reaction rates, TCE product distribution, and hydrogen isotope effects. Mass balance deficits revealed reversible and irreversible cobalamin-substrate association, whereas high-resolution mass spectrometry narrowed down possible structures to chloroalkyl and chlorovinyl cobalamin complexes. Combined experimental evidence is inconsistent with initial electron transfer or alkyl or vinyl complexes as shared intermediates of both pathways. In contrast, it supports cobalamin chlorocarbanions as key intermediates from which Cl– elimination produces vinyl complexes (explaining rates and products of TCE at high pH), whereas protonation generates less reactive alkyl complexes (explaining rates and products of TCE at low pH). Multielement isotope effect analysis holds promise to identify these competing mechanisms also in real dehalogenases, microorganisms, and even contaminated aquifers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000258198",,"2155-5435",,"10.1021/acscatal.7b02945","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/258198","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","outer-sphere single-electron transfer||reductive dehalogenation||kinetic isotope effect||groundwater contamination||chlorinated ethenes||trichloroethene||mechanistic study||cobalamin","Chlorinated Ethene Reactivity with Vitamin B12 Is Governed by Cobalamin Chloroethylcarbanions as Crossroads of Competing Pathways","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-04-16T04:07:51Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85045097954",,"000430154100050","ACS Catal.","4","ACS Catalysis","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Of particular relevance is the interaction between coccolithophores and diatoms, with the former being prevalent along the ""Great Calcite Belt"" (40–60°S), while diatoms tend to dominate the regions south of 60°S. To address the factors controlling coccolithophore distribution and the competition between them and diatoms, we use a regional high-resolution model (ROMS-BEC) for the Southern Ocean (24–78°S) that has been extended to include an explicit representation of coccolithophores. We assess the relative importance of bottom-up (temperature, nutrients, light) and top-down (grazing by zooplankton) factors in controlling Southern Ocean coccolithophore biogeography over the course of the growing season. In our simulations, coccolithophores are an important member of the Southern Ocean phytoplankton community, contributing 15% to annually integrated net primary productivity south of 30°S. Coccolithophore biomass is highest north of 50°S in late austral summer, when light levels are high and diatoms become silicate limited. Furthermore, we find top-down factors to be a major control on the relative abundance of diatoms and coccolithophores in the Southern Ocean. Consequently, when assessing potential future changes in Southern Ocean coccolithophore abundance, both abiotic (temperature, light, nutrients, pH) and biotic factors (interaction with diatoms and zooplankton) need to be considered.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000304764",,"1810-6277||1810-6285",,"10.5194/bg-2018-157","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/304764","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Factors controlling coccolithophore biogeography in the Southern Ocean","Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2018-11-20T08:46:29Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"SOGate: Phytoplankton ecosystem control of the Southern Ocean biogeochemical gate","153452||153452||153452||153452||153452","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,,"Biogeosci. discuss.",,"Biogeosciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

When determining which aging processes are most relevant, a life cycle perspective can be useful to gain insight into how ENMs will be used, released from products and move through technical and environmental systems. While there are a few pristine nanomaterial standards or test materials available, procedures to create appropriate aged or released ENM standards for subsequent fate or effect studies are more rare. Whereas the aging and release processes of ENMs are studied to quite some extent, procedures for the production of these materials for further testing are still in the initial phases. Here we review the available aging and release procedures representing various stages of the product life cycle that were developed in order to collect the aged and released materials for further use. There are three main groups of aged/released materials: 1) laboratory aging of pristine ENM, 2) collection of ENMs released from nano-products, and 3) fragmentation of the product matrix combined with aging. Here, the various aging and release paradigms that may be followed are presented, each of which comes with pros and cons in terms of how close the aging parameters are to simulating real world situations and how applicable they are to different product matrices or release mechanisms. The further use of the aged/released materials in fate or effect studies is also presented when possible. We can conclude that some aging/release procedures exist which have applicability for different research questions and specific ENM/matrix/product combinations and life cycle stages, but additional research is warranted to expand the procedures for producing synthetically aged and product released ENMs to cover additional areas of interest.",,,,"2452-0748",,"10.1016/j.impact.2017.12.001","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/469869","en","Elsevier",,,,"Procedures for the production and use of synthetically aged and product released nanomaterials for further environmental and ecotoxicity testing","Review Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-02-17T08:23:57Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NanoImpact","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Demonstrating their degradation under field conditions is difficult because changes in compound concentration can be subscribed to concurrent processes . In contrast, changes of the isotope ratios, which is monitored by compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA), offers conclusive evidence of (bio)degradation of the contaminant. Unfortunately, due to the high detection limits for analysis by gas- or liquid chromatography / isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (GC/IRMS or LC/IRMS) and the low occurrence of these contaminants in environmental waters, ng/L to µg/L1, large volumes of water need to be processed to obtain the required analyte masses for analysis. While enrichment of the required analyte masses is often possible using conventional solid-phase extraction (SPE) methods, the lack of selectivity towards the target analytes leads to inevitable co-enrichment of organic matrices, which compromises the acquired isotopic signatures. Synthetic polymers with selective binding sites can be obtained by molecular-imprinting techniques that are engineered to specifically enrich certain target analytes, but their application to stable-isotope analysis has not been studied. Therefore, it was the goal of this dissertation to investigate the effectiveness of increasing the overall selectivity of sample preparation workflows for GC/IRMS and LC/IRMS using molecularly-imprinted polymers (MIP).   Carbon- and nitrogen isotope analysis of 1H-benzotriazole, a typical corrosion inhibitor in dishwashing detergents, was investigated in different environmental samples as an example of a ubiquitous polar organic micropollutant. Procedures for the treatment of > 10 L water samples were developed in this work. The synthesis of MIP enabled the selective cleanup of the analyte in organic solvent, which was obtained by previous enrichment by conventional SPE. Through an assessment of imprinting factors, interaction enthalpies, and δ15N isotope effects, it was determined hydrogen bonding between the traziole ring of 1H-benzotriazole and the produced MIP were responsible for the selective interactions. The procedure was applied successfully without inducing isotope fractionation of the analyte to river water samples, as well as influent and effluent samples of a wastewater treatment plant containing 4 µg/L 1H-benzotriazole and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loads of up to 28 mg C/L.  Interferences caused by organic matter from surface waters on the GC/IRMS measurements were investigated for varying loads of DOC compared to constant amount of atrazine. A DOC:micropollutant ratio of 10 in the extracted sample was the maximum limit of GC/IRMS for accurate and precise δ13C, which corresponds to river water containing 7 µg/L atrazine and 0.3 mg C/L DOC. A cleanup procedure of the river water extracts using MIP allowed accurate and precise δ13C in samples with an initial DOC:micropollutant ratio up to 100. Presence of traces of protic solvents in the environmental extract prior to the cleanup with MIP caused complete loss of atrazine, desethyl-atrazine, and desisopropyl-atrazine. The DOC:micropollutant ratio was found to be a useful apriori indicator for assessing effectiveness of GC/IRMS measurements of contaminants in environmental waters.  Direct extraction of the herbicide glyphosate and its transformation product AMPA was performed without chemical derivatization from different environmental waters using a MIP based on ionic interactions. A method for quantification of the analytes was successfully developed and optimized using ion chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Method quantification limits ranged from 17 to 82 ng/L for glyphosate and from 37 to 54 ng/L for AMPA with recoveries from 26 to 97% and from 63 to 105%, respectively. Complexation of glyphosate with leaching organic carbon from the MIP was initially responsible for loss of 80% of the analyte, for which sodium hydroxide was used to break the complex and recover the analyte. Natural organic matter in water that bound to the investigated MIP was efficiently removed by percolation of the MIP extract over reversed-phase cartridge with no loss of the analytes. δ13C measurements of the analytes on LC/IRMS at different steps of the sample preparation showed no isotope fractionation.  The results from this work demonstrate that molecular-imprinting techniques prior to CSIA are an e ective tool for the selective extraction/cleanup of polar organic micropollutants from different environmental waters. Two approaches for the implementation of MIP in sample preparation are possible: (i) Organic extracts of aquatic samples after reversed-phase SPE can be used for a further selective cleanup step with MIP, whereas, (ii) water-compatible MIP can be used for the direct extraction of ionized organic contaminants from water samples. The coupling of MIP with either of these two approaches to GC/IRMS and LC/IRMS broadens the reach of CSIA by enabling the measurement of environmental samples. For future work on CSIA, the developed approaches can be used and expanded to many other polar organic micropollutants to investigate their sources and fate in the field- and catchment-scale studies, offering thereby new perspectives to CSIA.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000269006",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/269006","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA)||Molecularly-imprinted polymers (MIP)||Sample preparation||Solid-phase extraction (SPE)||Selectivity||Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS)||Gas chromatography-isotope-ratio mass spectrometry||Liquid chromatography-isotope-ratio mass spectrometry||1H-benzotriazole||Triazines||Glyphosate||Micropollutants","Molecularly-imprinted polymers for compound-specific isotope analysis of polar organic micropollutants in aquatic environments","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment",,"2018-06-11T08:25:04Z","2019-06-11",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"24753",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As the lake is above the natural colonization zone of the species, it is presumed that trout were first stocked here in the Middle Ages. Extremely low heterozygosity underscores a small effective population size reflecting a genetic bottleneck. This highly unique population should be protected.

Phenotypic delay in bacteria is widely assumed to be negligible, despite the lack of direct evidence. Here, we revisited the question using recombineering to introduce antibiotic resistance mutations into E. coli at defined time points and then tracking expression of the corresponding mutant phenotype over time. Contrary to previous assumptions, we found a substantial median phenotypic delay of three to four generations. We provided evidence that the primary source of this delay is multifork replication causing cells to be effectively polyploid, whereby wild-type gene copies transiently mask the phenotype of recessive mutant gene copies in the same cell. Using modeling and simulation methods, we explored the consequences of effective polyploidy for mutation rate estimation by fluctuation tests and sequencing-based methods. For recessive mutations, despite the substantial phenotypic delay, the per-copy or per-genome mutation rate is accurately estimated. However, the per-cell rate cannot be estimated by existing methods. Finally, with a mathematical model, we showed that effective polyploidy increases the frequency of costly recessive mutations in the standing genetic variation (SGV), and thus their potential contribution to evolutionary adaptation, while drastically reducing the chance that de novo recessive mutations can rescue populations facing a harsh environmental change such as antibiotic treatment. Overall, we have identified phenotypic delay and effective polyploidy as previously overlooked but essential components in bacterial evolvability, including antibiotic resistance evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000251070",,,,"10.1371/journal.pbio.2004644","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/251070","en","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Effective polyploidy causes phenotypic delay and influences bacterial evolvability","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-03-20T02:27:37Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The population biology of drug resistance: Key principles for a more sustainable use of drugs||Evolution and spread of drug resistance: A combined computational and experimental approach","268540||155866||268540||155866","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF||EC||SNF","FP7||Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)||FP7||Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,"85043693418",,"000426253300019",,"2","PLoS Biology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Dissolved organic matter optical properties have been attributed to a charge-transfer model in which donor–acceptor complexes play a primary role. This model was evaluated by measuring the absorbance and fluorescence response of organic matter isolates to changes in solvent temperature, viscosity, and polarity, which affect the position and intensity of spectra for known donor–acceptor complexes of organic molecules. Absorbance and fluorescence spectral shape were largely unaffected by these changes, indicating that the distribution of absorbing and emitting species was unchanged. Overall, these results call into question the wide applicability of the charge-transfer model for explaining organic matter optical properties and suggest that future research should explore other models for dissolved organic matter photophysics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000236024",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.7b03589","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/236024","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The Case Against Charge Transfer Interactions in Dissolved Organic Matter Photophysics","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-01-29T11:22:33Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85041362589",,"000423012200004","Environ.

Yet, experimental studies linking oxide reduction kinetics to thermodynamics remain scarce. Here, we used mediated electrochemical reduction (MER) to directly quantify the extents and rates of ferrihydrite, goethite, and hematite reduction over a range of negative reaction free energies, ΔrG, that were obtained by systematically varying pH (5.0 to 8.0), applied reduction potentials (−0.53 to −0.17 V vs SHE), and Fe2+ concentrations (up to 40 μM). Ferrihydrite reduction was complete and fast at all tested ΔrG values, consistent with its comparatively low thermodynamic stability. Reduction of the thermodynamically more stable goethite and hematite changed from complete and fast to incomplete and slow as ΔrG values became less negative. Reductions at intermediate ΔrG values showed negative linear correlations between the natural logarithm of the reduction rate constants and ΔrG. These correlations imply that thermodynamics controlled goethite and hematite reduction rates. Beyond allowing to study iron oxide reduction under defined thermodynamic conditions, MER can also be used to capture changes in iron oxide reducibility during phase transformations, as shown for Fe2+-facilitated transformation of ferrihydrite to goethite.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000235669",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.7b04411","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/235669","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Mediated Electrochemical Reduction of Iron (Oxyhydr-)Oxides under Defined Thermodynamic Boundary Conditions","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-01-28T11:34:37Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85041435443",,"000423012200020","Environ.

It emphazises the effects of transport processes on noble gases dissolved in the sediment pore water. In general, the noble gas concentrations in lacustrine sediments agree with the concentrations in the overlying lake water column. In turn, the noble gas concentrations in the overlying water column, i.e. air saturated water (ASW) concentrations, are determined by the partitioning between atmosphere and lake water. Due to their biogeochemical inertness, any deviation of noble gas concentrations in sediment pore water from ASW concentration is attributed to physical processes. Therefore, noble gases have been established as excellent tracers for the characterization of gas dynamics and transport processes in lacustrine sediments. However, there are still open questions regarding the mechanism of the noble gas transport in the sediment pore water: (1) The behaviour of noble gas isotopes during molecular diffusion in water lacks of a sound physical basis. (2) The gas transport in lacustrine sediments varies extremely depending on the sediment properties. In three case studies noble gases were used to investigate on one hand the gas dynamics in supersaturated sediments (Lake Rotsee and Lake Lungern) and on the other hand the suppressed noble gas transport in highly compacted sediments (Lake Zurich). The details, on how these questions were addressed, are explained in the following: (1) Molecular diffusion is the key transport process for noble gases dissolved in the sediment pore water. Noble gas diffusion in water is commonly expected to cause a fractionation of noble gas isotopes in accordance with the square root relation, which describes the isotope fractionation to be inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their atomic mass. However recent studies challenge the applicability of the square root relation, derived from the kinetic theory of gases, to predict the fractionation of noble gas isotope by reason of molecular diffusion in water. Therefore the fractionation of the noble gas isotopes (Ne, Ar, Kr Xe) due to molecular diffusion in water was determined in a laboratory experiment. Surprisingly, only the fractionation of Ar isotopes can be adequately described by the square root relation. The fractionation of Ne, Kr and Xe isotopes was found to be much lower and even negligible. The results from the laboratory experiments provide a robust basis for studies that use the fractionation of the noble gas isotope ratios to assess molecular diffusion in water bodies, e.g. to investigate diffusive transport of noble gases dissolved in the pore water to gas bubbles formed in the sediment pore space. (2) In sediments characterised by an active microbial gas production in their pore waters and hence supersaturated with reactive gases (e.g. CH4), the transport of noble gases through the pore space is enhanced relative to the diffusion of noble gases in the pore water. The enhanced transport of noble gases results from their interaction with gas bubbles that are formed in the sediment pore space and which are eventually released. Methods that are commonly used to determine CH4 concentrations in the sediment pore water do not prevent gas exchange with the atmosphere during sampling and are therefore not suitable to quantify CH4 in supersaturated sediments. To improve the accuracy of CH4 measurements a new method for the analysis of CH4 concentrations in sediment pore waters has been developed in the framework of this thesis. This newly developed method was combined with noble gas analysis and applied to the sediments of two lakes, Lake Rotsee and Lake Lungern, which are characterised by an active bubble ebullition (mostly CH4) from their sediments. The continuous CH4 ux from the sediments of Lake Rotsee was determined using the noble gas concentration gradient, showing an increasing depletion relative to air saturated water (ASW) concentration with increasing sediment depth. The zone of active bubble ebullition from the sediment was indicated by the CH4 concentration peak determined in the pore water, which exceeds the local saturation concentration by one order of magnitude. Lake Lungern is subject to extreme water level variations, which induce bubble formation in the sediment pore water and emission of CH4 together with the bubbles leaving the sediment. Furthermore, parts of the sediment fall dry during low water level. The noble gas excess relative to ASW determined in this zone was used to estimate the oxygen supply to the ""dry falling"" sediment. In a pilot study on a glacial clay sediment of Lake Zurich a noble gas excess relative to ASW was determined as well. This excess might originate from in owing glacial melt water as a strong 4He enrichment and the noble gas pattern in the pore water of the sediment are interpreted to indicate that noble gases have been quantitatively trapped in the clay for a period of several thousand years. Overall the results of the laboratory experiments on noble gas isotope diffusion in water represent an important step towards establishing the ratio of 36Ar/40Ar as isotopic tracer for diffusive transport in unconsolidated sediments. Furthermore, this thesis gives a specific insight into the interaction of dissolved noble gases and reactive gas bubbles in the sediment pore water of gas supersaturated sediments, and the method developed for the determination of real in situ CH4 concentrations contributes to the further investigation of such sediments. To summarize, this thesis illustrates that noble gases are ideal tracers for the gas dynamics in a wide range of lacustrine sediments, from gas supersaturated sediments to highly compacted clay sediments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000273789",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/273789","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Dynamics of gas transport in pore waters of lacustrine sediments","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::560 - Paleontology, paleozoology||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2018-07-03T16:54:40Z","2020-04-11",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"24838",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Lateral fluxes of organic carbon out of their region of production, especially from coastal regions, may explain the large rates of remineralization in regions of low productivity, but they are currently unaccounted by export and budget estimates. Here I quantify and characterize this lateral offshore transport of organic carbon from the north-western African coast of the Canary Upwelling System (CanUS) up to the middle of the oligotrophic North Atlantic Gyre. To this aim, I run the physical Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) coupled with the biogeochemical-ecosystem Nutrient Phytoplankton Zooplankton Detritus (NPZD) model on an Atlantic telescopic grid. This newly developed grid covers the entire Atlantic basin, allowing to study the lateral transport on very large spatial scales, and is eddy resolving in the region of interest thanks to a strong grid refinement towards the north-western African coast. With the use of climatological model simulations I study the magnitude, reach, pattern and impact of the total long range offshore flux of organic carbon, and study in detail the special role of mesoscale eddies and filaments in this transport, with a particular attention to the evolution of the eddy organic carbon budget. The results of my work indicate that, on average, more than 1/3 of the net community production of the first 100 km from the CanUS coast is laterally exported away from this region towards the open waters in the euphotic layer (100 m depth). On average in the CanUS, the divergence of this offshore flux is the largest lateral input of organic carbon in the open waters up to 1500 km from the coast and represents up to 1/3 of the large-scale mean offshore production in the open waters. This divergence even exceeds half of the mean offshore production in the euphotic layer of the central CanUS subregion, a key zonal band for the alongshore collection and offshore redistribution of the biogeochemical tracers. In the 100 m - 200 m depth layer, the offshore transport continues to dominate the lateral fluxes of organic carbon, displacing it further towards the center of the north Atlantic gyre. The long-range offshore transport of organic carbon results in a spatial decoupling of its sources and sinks, corresponding to a strongly net autotrophic watercolumn on the shelf, and a net heterotrophic watercolumn offshore, the latter stemming from the fueling of extra deep heterotrophic activity. My results demonstrate also that mesoscale activity has a fundamental role in the offshore redistribution of the organic carbon in the euphotic layer. Coastal upwelling filaments, identified with a newly developed algorithm, contribute 80% to the zonal fluxes at 100 km offshore and are the main advective source of organic carbon in the first 500 km from the coast, but their contribution declines to zero at 1000 km offshore.   Mesoscale eddies, instead, represent about 20% of the offshore flux between 500 km from the coast and the middle of the North Atlantic gyre. Despite their slow drift, eddies account for 30 % of the of the total organic carbon of the offshore euphotic layer (2/3 found in cyclonic eddies), thus contributing significantly to the carbon reservoir in the open ocean. In the eddy-rich northern region of the CanUS, the long lasting organic carbon reservoir of cyclonic eddies is sustained in large part by the efficient trapping of organic carbon and nutrients at formation. These core-centric and laterally-isolated structures lose organic carbon along their way to the open ocean via sinking, while rejunevating the organic carbon reservoir through local recycling and through the use of the trapped nutrients. Anticyclonic eddies, instead, are high in organic carbon at their rim; new production in this kind of eddies is allowed by the lateral stirring of the large scale regional gradient of nutrients combined with substantial vertical mixing.   Overall, the results of this work demonstrate the importance of accounting for the three-dimensionality of the marine biological pump, and highlight the essential role of the coastal ocean in the global carbon cycle. Moreover, they clarify the role of mesoscale activity in the lateral redistribution of the organic carbon from the coast, identifying the diversity of underlying mechanisms that regulate the organic carbon budget of mesoscale eddies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000277475",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/277475","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Oceanography||Ocean modeling||Organic carbon cycling||Mesoscale eddies||Upwelling","Long range offshore transport of organic carbon from the Canary Upwelling System, an eddy-resolving modeling study","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2018-07-23T11:55:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"CALNEX: Quantifying the exchange of carbon and nutrients between the coastal and open seas: A comparative modeling study of the California and Canary Current Systems","149384||149384","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)","25034",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This method builds on the extended multiple linear regression (eMLR) approach [Friis et al., 2005] to identify the anthropogenic CO2 signal, but in order to improve the robustness of this method, we fit C* [Gruber and Sarmiento, 2002] rather than dissolved inorganic carbon and use a probabilistic method for the selection of the predictors. In order to account for the multi-year nature of the surveys, we adjust all C* observations of a particular observing period to a common reference year by assuming a transient steady-state. We finally use the eMLR models together with global gridded climatological distributions of the predictors to map the estimated change in anthropogenic CO2 to the global ocean. Testing this method with synthetic data generated from a hindcast simulation with an ocean model reveals that the method is able to reconstruct the change in anthropogenic CO2 with only a small global bias (<5%). Within ocean basins, the errors can be larger, mostly driven by changes in ocean circulation. Overall, we conclude from the model that the method has an accuracy of retrieving the column integrated change in anthropogenic CO2 of about 10% at the scale of whole ocean basins. We expect that this uncertainty needs to be doubled to about 20% when the change in anthropogenic CO2 is reconstructed from observations.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/243986","en","ETH Zurich, Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics (IBP)",,,,"Data supporting The eMLR(C*) method to determine decadal changes in the global ocean storage of anthropogenic CO2","Dataset","Metadata only",,,,"2018-02-23T22:21:25Z",,"10 years","2030-03-05T08:25:18Z","This data set contains the relevant data and information associated with the publication by Clement and Gruber in Global Biogeochemical Cycles.

Unfortunately, these are either missing for many regions or are not available at the desired spatial resolution or down to the required soil depth. The field-based generation of large soil datasets and conventional soil maps remains costly. Meanwhile, legacy soil data and comprehensive sets of spatial environmental data are available for many regions.Digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches relating soil data (responses) to environmental data (covariates) face the challenge of building statistical models from large sets of covariates originating, for example, from airborne imaging spectroscopy or multi-scale terrain analysis. We evaluated six approaches for DSM in three study regions in Switzerland (Berne, Greifensee, ZH forest) by mapping the effective soil depth available to plants (SD), pH, soil organic matter (SOM), effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), clay, silt, gravel content and fine fraction bulk density for four soil depths (totalling 48 responses). Models were built from 300–500 environmental covariates by selecting linear models through (1) grouped lasso and (2) an ad hoc stepwise procedure for robust external-drift kriging (georob). For (3) geoadditive models we selected penalized smoothing spline terms by component-wise gradient boosting (geoGAM). We further used two tree-based methods: (4) boosted regression trees (BRTs) and (5) random forest (RF). Lastly, we computed (6) weighted model averages (MAs) from the predictions obtained from methods 1–5.Lasso, georob and geoGAM successfully selected strongly reduced sets of covariates (subsets of 3–6 % of all covariates). Differences in predictive performance, tested on independent validation data, were mostly small and did not reveal a single best method for 48 responses. Nevertheless, RF was often the best among methods 1–5 (28 of 48 responses), but was outcompeted by MA for 14 of these 28 responses. RF tended to over-fit the data. The performance of BRT was slightly worse than RF. GeoGAM performed poorly on some responses and was the best only for 7 of 48 responses. The prediction accuracy of lasso was intermediate. All models generally had small bias. Only the computationally very efficient lasso had slightly larger bias because it tended to under-fit the data. Summarizing, although differences were small, the frequencies of the best and worst performance clearly favoured RF if a single method is applied and MA if multiple prediction models can be developed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000228435",,"2199-3971||2199-398X",,"10.5194/soil-4-1-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/228435","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Evaluation of digital soil mapping approaches with large sets of environmental covariates","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-01-15T07:53:35Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85045835727",,"000457375200001",,"1","Soil","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we show that this is the case across many shelf regions, implying a tendency for enhanced shelf uptake of atmospheric CO2. This result is based on analysis of long-term trends in the air–sea pCO2 gradient (ΔpCO2) using a global surface ocean pCO2 database spanning a period of up to 35 years. Using wintertime data only, we find that ΔpCO2 increased in 653 of the 825 0.5° cells for which a trend could be calculated, with 325 of these cells showing a significant increase in excess of +0.5 μatm yr−1 (p < 0.05). Although noisier, the deseasonalized annual data suggest similar results. If this were a global trend, it would support the idea that shelves might have switched from a source to a sink of CO2 during the last century.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000239866",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-017-02738-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/239866","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Continental shelves as a variable but increasing global sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-02-10T03:11:59Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85041356143",,"000423674100010","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Evidence suggests that bacterial spatial organization contributes to the persistence of anoxic hotspots even in unsaturated soils. Such processes are difficult to observe in situ at the microscale, hence mechanisms and time scales relevant for bacterial spatial organization remain largely qualitative. Here we develop an experimental platform based on glass-etched micrometric pore networks that mimics resource gradients postulated in soil aggregates to observe spatial organization of fluorescently tagged aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria. Two initially intermixed bacterial species, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas veronii, segregate into preferential regions promoted by opposing gradients of carbon and oxygen (such persistent coexistence is not possible in well-mixed cultures). The study provides quantitative visualization and modeling of bacterial spatial organization within aggregate-like hotspots, a key step towards developing a mechanistic representation of bacterial community organization in soil pores.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000246245",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-018-03187-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/246245","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Spatial organization of bacterial populations in response to oxygen and carbon counter-gradients in pore networks","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-03-06T03:59:51Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85042531861",,"000425787500010","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The initial crack is caused by a sudden surface load in the case of artificially triggered avalanches by e.g. a skier or an explosion, whereas in the case of natural release the processes leading to initial crack formation are not fully understood. It is commonly assumed that a gradual damage process at the micro-scale leads to failure localization and the formation of the initial crack. Moreover, the failure behavior of snow depends strongly on the imposed loading rate. The goal of this thesis was to exploit the acoustic emissions (AE) produced by the release of strain energy (microscopic cracking) to shed light on the damage process preceding failure and the mechanisms controlling the loading rate dependence. Moreover, we intended to investigate the occurrence of features in the AE signal indicating imminent failure and to analyze these precursors with respect to the rate of loading. Eventually, we were interested in the applicability of AE for snowpack instability evaluation. Knowing the speed and attenuation of acoustic waves in snow is a necessary prerequisite for describing the evolution of acoustic signals from emission to detection, for a correct interpretation of the AE signals and for designing field applications. Therefore, we measured the speed and attenuation in laboratory experiments for snow with different densities and applied Biot’s model for wave propagation in porous media to our experimental results. From the speed we also calculated the elastic modulus and showed that it increased with time of sintering. The frequency dependent acoustic attenuation coefficient was determined for the frequency range 8 to 35 kHz and yielded values between 0.3 and 1.6 dB/cm. For frequencies higher than 35 kHz the attenuation was much higher and we attribute the increased attenuation to scattering at the snow microstructure. The Biot’s model and the experimental results were in good agreement and indicated that the acoustic signals propagated as a mixture of Biot’s slow and fast waves and that the majority of the energy was carried by the dispersive and highly attenuated Biot’s slow waves. To study the damage process preceding snow failure we analyzed the AE from load controlled snow failure experiments with different loading rates on samples including a weak layer. At high loading rates (400 and 168 Pa/s), we observed low strain and brittle fracture, whereas the samples showed higher strains and mostly did not fail up to the maximum load of 20 kPa if loaded slowly (32 Pa/s). The AE emissions preceding failure depended strongly on the loading rate. At high loading rates, the AE response was characterized by a gradual decrease of the exponent of the AE energy distribution (b-value), and an exponential increase of the energy rate and AE frequency with increasing load. These changes in the AE indicate a transition in the event size statistics and an acceleration of the damage process. At low loading rates, these changes in the AE were not or just partially present, indicating therefore a different damage process and failure type. To link the observed loading rate dependence of failure and AE signatures to the micro-mechanical mechanisms governing the damage process we developed a new version of a fiber bundle model (FBM). We included two healing mechanisms in the FBM that oppose the damage process: (a) sintering or regenerating broken fibers with time dependent probability, and (b) viscous deformation with resulting time dependent relaxation of load inhomogeneities. These mechanisms reproduce two essential properties of ice, namely the immediate sintering once two ice particles are put in contact, and the viscous deformation or creep of ice. First, we analyzed the influence of the two healing mechanisms on the failure behavior of the bundle. Sintering compensates the damage process by restoring the strength of broken fibers, which support additional load, and leads to an increase of the bundle strength. The type of failure is however not influenced by sintering alone. If sintering and load relaxation are included in the FBM, load is redistributed from older fibers carrying more load to the healed new fibers created by sintering. So, the failure occurred suddenly without divergence of the damage rate and the b-value at failure converged to a value higher than for the FBM without healing. Hence, the combined effect of sintering and load relaxation changes the type of phase transition at failure. In a second step, we tried to directly reproduce the AE features observed in the experiments. The FBM reproduced the loading rate dependence of the stress-strain relation and part of the AE features observed for the snow failure experiments. This behavior can only be obtained if both sintering and load relaxation are included in the model. Therefore, we conclude that the damage process preceding snow failure can be described as a combination of damage accumulation and healing (sintering and load relaxation), and that these processes cause the observed rate dependence of the mechanical behavior of snow. Our results provide new insights in the damage process preceding snow failure and its dependence on the loading rate. Our findings are particularly useful for improving numerical modelling of snow failure, especially for slab avalanche release models aiming to reproduce natural avalanche release where slow loading conditions are involved. Moreover, we showed that typical precursors that would allow the prediction of failure in snow are just partly present and that at low loading rates the failure can occur without precursors – clearly questioning the application of AE for snow stability assessment. However, the observed differences in the AE features could be used to study the exact mechanisms involved in the formation of slab avalanches.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000292791",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/292791","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Acoustic Emissions from Progressive Failure of Snow","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::530 - Physics",,"2018-10-01T17:57:13Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25274",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The main goal of this thesis was to address some of these questions. Specifically, we aimed at expanding our understanding of two central themes that are difficult to explore in traditional microbiological approaches. The first theme is about how antibiotics affect the basic components of bacterial growth: cell division and death. We exposed bacterial populations to various concentrations of antibiotics and analyzed how the population growth patterns that we observed emerged from the interplay between cell division and cell death. The second theme is non-genetic factors that contribute to differences in the response and survival to antibiotics, either between individual cells or between environments with plenty or limited resources. We used Escherichia coli and ribosome-binding antibiotics as our model systems and employed microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy to investigate the effects of antibiotics at the level of individual cells. In Chapter 2, we addressed the effect of antibiotic pulses on bacterial cells. We focused on a range of antibiotic doses where, in batch experiments, a net positive or negative population growth rate would mask death or division rates, respectively. Our single-cell approach allowed us to quantify the division events occurring for each cell. This revealed that antibiotics around what is considered the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in batch experiments or higher sometimes have no discernible effect on the rate of cell division during the pulse. Informed by this finding and in combination with bulk experiments, we explored the role of time, concentration and total dose (the product of time and concentration) on the probability that bacterial cells would survive an antibiotic pulse. One of our main observations was that total dose had the strongest effect on cell survival, but short pulses of high concentrations or long pulses of low concentrations led to slightly higher mortality than equivalent total doses of intermediate duration and concentration. In Chapter 3, we asked whether we would be able to predict that a given bacterial cell would survive a pulse of antibiotic, based on features of this cell that we could measure previous, during and immediately after antibiotic exposure. We did not find evidence that the interdivision time previous to exposure (as a proxy for growth rate) neither the time that had elapsed since the last division before the pulse (as a proxy for cell cycle position at the onset of the stress) predicted cell fate. We found, however, that potential persisters (cells not dividing at all in the time monitored previous to exposure) showed higher chances of survival in conditions with high mortality. We also found that cell division patterns immediately after the pulse can predict survival. In Chapter 4 we investigated how two different ribosome-targeting antibiotics affect bacterial growth in a limited-nutrient environment, particularly disentangling the role of division on the growth dynamics observed at the population level. We further focused on the effect of gentamicin as we found that cells exposed to low concentrations of this drug entered stationary phase earlier. The results of our experiments suggest that bacteria exposed to antibiotics might be depleting resources faster during exponential phase. It is likely that this phenomenon is specifically related to amino acid consumption. In summary, this work highlights the relevance of improving our understanding of how antibiotics affect individual bacterial cells. The questions, results and discussions presented in this thesis suggest that single-cell approaches are key to understand bacterial growth dynamics under stress and to fill important gaps related to non-genetic factors that affect survival and response to antibiotic treatment. Such understanding can potentially help in the development of new antibiotics, and help using existing antibiotics more effectively.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000309075",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/309075","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Effects of antibiotics on individual bacterial cells","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::610 - Medical sciences, medicine||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences",,"2018-12-05T20:14:07Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25160",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Pore fluids from the Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California), a sedimentary basin with recent magmatic activity, were investigated to constrain the link between sill intrusions and fluid seepage as well as the timing of sill-induced hydrothermal activity. Sampling sites were close to a hydrothermal vent field at the northern rift axis and at cold seeps located up to 30km away from the rift. Pore fluids close to the active hydrothermal vent field showed a slight imprint by hydrothermal fluids and indicated a shallow circulation system transporting seawater to the hydrothermal catchment area. Geochemical data of pore fluids at cold seeps showed a mainly ambient diagenetic fluid composition without any imprint related to high temperature processes at greater depth. Seep communities at the seafloor were mainly sustained by microbial methane, which rose along pathways formed earlier by hydrothermal activity, driving the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and the formation of authigenic carbonates.  Overall, our data from the cold seep sites suggest that at present, sill-induced hydrothermalism is not active away from the ridge axis, and the vigorous venting of hydrothermal fluids is restricted to the ridge axis. Using the sediment thickness above extinct conduits and carbonate dating, we calculated that deep fluid and thermogenic gas flow ceased 28 to 7kyr ago. These findings imply a short lifetime of hydrothermal systems, limiting the time of unhindered carbon release as suggested in previous modeling studies. Consequently, activation and deactivation mechanisms of these systems need to be better constrained for the use in climate modeling approaches.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000295468",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-15-5715-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/295468","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"On the formation of hydrothermal vents and cold seeps in the Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-10-12T14:43:16Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85054181017",,"000445782700001",,"18","Biogeosciences","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Efficient mitigation efforts should prioritize retrofitting sections of glass exhibiting the highest mortality of birds. Most collision studies, however, record location meta-data at a spatial scale too coarse (i.e., compass direction of facing façade) to be useful for large buildings with complex geometries. Through spatial analysis of three seasons of survey data at a large building at a university campus, we found that GPS data were able to identify collision hotspots while compass directions could not. To demonstrate the broad applicability and utility of this georeferencing approach, we identified collision hotspots at two additional urban areas in North America. The data for this latter exercise were collected via the citizen science database, iNaturalist, which we review for its potential to generate the georeferenced data necessary for directing building retrofits and mitigating a major source of anthropogenic bird mortality.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000248948",,"2167-8359",,"10.7717/peerj.4215","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/248948","en","PeerJ","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bird window collisions||Citizen science||Georeferencing||Bird conservation||Urban ecology","Geo-referencing bird-window collisions for targeted mitigation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2018-03-11T01:49:04Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000419200900008","PeerJ","1","PeerJ","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A 1995 pioneering book, resulting from a series of workshops among model developers and users, reported the main advantages and identified needs for research in the field of multimedia fate models. Considerable efforts were devoted to their improvement in the past 25 years and many aspects were refined; notably the inclusion of nanomaterials among the modelled substances, the development of models at different spatial and temporal scales, the estimation of chemical properties and emission data, the incorporation of additional environmental media and processes, the integration of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis in the simulations. However, some challenging issues remain and require research efforts and attention: the need of methods to estimate partition coefficients for polar and ionizable chemical in the environment, a better description of bioavailability in different environments as well as the requirement of injecting more ecological realism in exposure predictions to account for the diversity of ecosystem structures and functions in risk assessment. Finally, to transfer new scientific developments into the realm of regulatory risk assessment, we propose the formation of expert groups that compare, discuss and recommend model modifications and updates and help develop practical tools for risk assessment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000239877",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/c7em00568g","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/239877","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Environmental fate and exposure models: advances and challenges in 21st century chemical risk assessment","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2018-02-10T04:16:33Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85041220203",,"000423485500007","Environ Sci Process Impacts","1","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02020 - Dep.
