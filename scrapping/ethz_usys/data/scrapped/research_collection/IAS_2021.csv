However, there is a paucity of information on the fate of Zn that derives from complex organic fertilizers in soil–plant systems and the contribution of these fertilizers to the Zn nutrition of crops. To answer these questions, we grew Italian ryegrass in the presence of ZnSO4, sewage sludge, and cattle and poultry manure in an acidic soil from Heitenried, Switzerland, and an alkaline soil from Strickhof, Switzerland, where the isotopically exchangeable Zn had been labeled with 67Zn. This allowed us to calculate the fraction of Zn in the shoots that was derived from fertilizer, soil, and seed over 4 successive cuts. In addition, we measured the 67Zn:66Zn isotope ratio with the diffusive gradients in thin films technique (DGT) on soils labeled with 67Zn and incubated with the same fertilizers. After 48 days of growth, the largest fraction of Zn in the ryegrass shoots was derived from the soil (79–88%), followed by the Zn-containing fertilizer (11–20%); the least (<2.3%) came from the seed. Only a minor fraction of the Zn applied with the fertilizer was transferred to the shoots (4.7–12%), which indicates that most of the freshly added Zn remained in the soil after one crop cycle and may thereby contribute to a residual Zn pool in the soil. The 67Zn:66Zn isotope ratios in the DGT extracts and the shoots measured at cut 4 were identical, suggesting that the DGT and plant took up Zn from the same pool. The proportion of Zn derived from the fertilizers in the DGT extracts was also identical to that measured in ryegrass shoots at cut 4. In conclusion, this work shows that stable Zn isotope labeling of the soil available Zn can be used to precisely quantify the impact of complex organic fertilizers on the Zn nutrition of crops. It also demonstrates that DGT extractions on labeled soils could be used to estimate the contribution of Zn fertilizers to plant nutrition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522882",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2021.730679","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522882","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Manure||Sewage sludge||Plant nutrition||Source tracing||DGT (diffusive gradients in thin films)","The Use of Stable Zinc Isotope Soil Labeling to Assess the Contribution of Complex Organic Fertilizers to the Zinc Nutrition of Ryegrass",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-04T07:31:32Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85122182269",,"000739014400001","Front.

It has been suggested that a CO2-induced long-term increase in global photosynthesis, a process known as CO2 fertilization, is responsible for a large proportion of the current terrestrial carbon sink4–7. The estimated magnitude of the historic increase in photosynthesis as result of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, however, differs by an order of magnitude between long-term proxies and terrestrial biosphere models7–13. Here we quantify the historic effect of CO2 on global photosynthesis by identifying an emergent constraint14–16 that combines terrestrial biosphere models with global carbon budget estimates. Our analysis suggests that CO2 fertilization increased global annual photosynthesis by 11.85 ± 1.4%, or 13.98 ± 1.63 petagrams carbon (mean ± 95% confidence interval) between 1981 and 2020.

Phytoremediation strategies are a new suggestion to effectively reduce soil legacy P but until now, there is a lack of estimates on the time such strategies should take. With a rainfall-runoff model, spatial information on the hydrological risk of the catchment of Lake Baldegg (Switzerland) was generated and combined with a soil test P (CO2-saturated water extraction) map. Based on these results, two potential soil target test P values (2.0 mg P (kg soil)−1 target-P 1 and 1.6 mg P (kg soil)−1 target-P 2) were set. A simple nonlinear mixed effects model was used to compare different balance and cropping scenarios to decrease soil test P. The relationship between P-balance (input - output) and soil test P was found to be exponential. The confidence interval for the predicted time necessary to reach target-P 2 after a cessation of P-fertilization on intensively managed grassland was 2 to 9 years depending on the initial soil test P. If fertilization is completely ceased, the predicted P-decline times were longer (8 to 32 years). The decline-time for the balance that is recommended for farmers in the catchment of a P-fertilization that covers 80% of the demand was predicted to be 11 to 47 years. The study emphasizes that P phytoextraction can be an effective and time and resource efficient mitigation strategy for catchments with high legacy P.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000489582",,"0016-7061||1872-6259",,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115257","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/489582","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Soil legacy P||Eutrophication||Phytoextraction||Artificial drainage||Hydrological risk||Modelling","The time it takes to reduce soil legacy phosphorus to a tolerable level for surface waters: What we learn from a case study in the catchment of Lake Baldegg, Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-15T06:29:31Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85107788731",,"000671591200020","Geoderma",,"Geoderma","403","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Plot-level land-use intensity is strongly and negatively associated with aboveground trophic groups, but positively or not associated with belowground trophic groups. Meanwhile, both above- and belowground trophic groups respond to landscape-level land use, but to different drivers: aboveground diversity of grasslands is promoted by diverse surrounding land-cover, while belowground diversity is positively related to a high permanent forest cover in the surrounding landscape. These results highlight a role of landscape-level land use in shaping belowground communities, and suggest that revised agroecosystem management strategies are needed to conserve whole-ecosystem biodiversity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000491232",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-021-23931-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491232","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Contrasting responses of above- and belowground diversity to multiple components of land-use intensity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-24T13:53:14Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85108893043",,"000669481900005","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Advances in crop modeling as well as high-throughput field phenotyping (HTFP) hold promise to provide such insights. Processing HTFP data is an interdisciplinary task that requires broad knowledge on experimental design, measurement techniques, feature extraction, dynamic trait modeling, and prediction of genotypic values using statistical models. To get an overview of sources of variation in HTFP, we develop a general plot-level model for repeated measurements. Based on this model, we propose a seamless step-wise procedure that allows for carry on of estimated means and variances from stage to stage. The process builds on the extraction of three intermediate trait categories; (1) timing of key stages, (2) quantities at defined time points or periods, and (3) dose-response curves. In a first stage, these intermediate traits are extracted from low-level traits’ time series (e.g., canopy height) using P-splines and the quarter of maximum elongation rate method (QMER), as well as final height percentiles. In a second and third stage, extracted traits are further processed using a stage-wise linear mixed model analysis. Using a wheat canopy growth simulation to generate canopy height time series, we demonstrate the suitability of the stage-wise process for traits of the first two above-mentioned categories. Results indicate that, for the first stage, the P-spline/QMER method was more robust than the percentile method. In the subsequent two-stage linear mixed model processing, weighting the second and third stage with error variance estimates from the previous stages improved the root mean squared error. We conclude that processing phenomics data in stages represents a feasible approach if estimated means and variances are carried forward from one processing stage to the next. P-splines in combination with the QMER method are suitable tools to extract timing of key stages and quantities at defined time points from HTFP data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000510292",,"0378-4290||1872-6852",,"10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108314","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510292","en","Elsevier BV","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","High-throughput field phenotyping||Dynamic modeling||Stage-wise processing||Canopy height","Phenomics data processing: A plot-level model for repeated measurements to extract the timing of key stages and quantities at defined time points",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-18T07:33:02Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85116796102",,"000709914800010","Field crops res.",,"Field Crops Research","274","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In particular, high spatial and temporal resolution rainfall data are essential as precipitation is the driving force of soil erosion. In this study, we evaluated to what extent high temporal resolution data from the TAHMO network (with poor spatial and long-term coverage) can be combined with low temporal resolution data (with a high spatial density covering long periods of time) to improve rainfall erosivity assessments. To this end, 5 minute rainfall data from TAHMO stations in the Lake Kivu region, representing ca. 37 observation-years, were analyzed. The analysis of the TAHMO data showed that rainfall erosivity was mainly controlled by rainfall amount and elevation and that this relation was different for the dry and wet season. By combining high and low temporal resolution databases and a set of spatial covariates, an environmental regression approach (GAM) was used to assess the spatiotemporal patterns of rainfall erosivity for the whole region. A validation procedure showed relatively good predictions for most months (R-2 between 0.50 and 0.80), while the model was less performant for the wettest (April) and two driest months (July and August) (R-2 between 0.24 and 0.38). The predicted annual erosivity was highly variable with a range between 2000 and 9000 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) yr(-1) and showed a pronounced east-west gradient which is strongly influenced by local topography. This study showed that the combination of high and low temporal resolution rainfall data and spatial prediction models can be used to improve the assessments of monthly and annual rainfall erosivity patterns that are grounded in locally calibrated and validated data.",,,,"0309-1333||1477-0296",,"10.1177/03091333211001793","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495179","en","SAGE Publications",,,"Rainfall||erosivity||Lake Kivu||NLS||GAM","Spatial and seasonal patterns of rainfall erosivity in the Lake Kivu region: Insights from a meteorological observatory network",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-07-15T10:52:49Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102772112",,"000630564300001","Prog. phys. geogr.","6","Progress in Physical Geography","45","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, experimental confirmation of this potential is lacking. The aim of this pilot experiment was to develop a method for producing and delivering water kefir to weaned piglets at farm scale, assess its palatability and identify potential side effects in piglets varying in weight.  Results The method described here is applicable to farm practice, as it could produce >50 L water kefir per day with little investment and time. The lactic acid concentration and pH in the water kefir remained stable between batches, while the acetic acid concentration was more variable. Piglets consumed the total quantity offered, which represented about 1 L per piglet per day. No clinical signs of disease were observed requiring medication administration to the piglets. However, a trend of reduced growth was observed when water kefir was offered, especially in the lighter piglets.  Conclusions In addition to its applicability on farms, the water kefir production method facilitates experiments in young livestock under farm-scale conditions. The health-promoting potential of water kefir may be increased by elevating the nutrient supply in the culture medium. No critical issue was identified that would prevent the distribution of water kefir to weaned piglets. However, the reason for the trend toward reduced growth and whether this trend would be reversed in situations with greater disease pressure remain unclear.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000520925",,"2573-5098",,"10.1002/jsf2.22","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/520925","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Acetic acid||Lactic acid||Post-weaning health||Probiotic bacteria||Yeast","Water kefir for weaned piglets: A pilot study on its farm‐scale production, its palatability and its effects on growth performance",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-16T08:29:37Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","JSFA Reports","1","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study aims to add another approach for methane mitigation by manipulation of the rumen microbiome. Effects of choline supplementation on methane formation were quantified in vitro using the Rumen Simulation Technique. Supplementing 200 mM of choline chloride or choline bicarbonate reduced methane emissions by 97–100% after 15 days. Associated with the reduction of methane formation, metabolomics analysis revealed high post-treatment concentrations of ethanol, which likely served as a major hydrogen sink. Metagenome sequencing showed that the methanogen community was almost entirely lost, and choline-utilizing bacteria that can produce either lactate, ethanol or formate as hydrogen sinks were enriched. The taxa most strongly associated with methane mitigation were Megasphaera elsdenii and Denitrobacterium detoxificans, both capable of consuming lactate, which is an intermediate product and hydrogen sink. Accordingly, choline metabolism promoted the capability of bacteria to utilize alternative hydrogen sinks leading to a decline of hydrogen as a substrate for methane formation. However, fermentation of fibre and total organic matter could not be fully maintained with choline supplementation, while amino acid deamination and ethanolamine catabolism produced excessive ammonia, which would reduce feed efficiency and adversely affect live animal performance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515046",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-021-01031-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515046","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The rumen microbiome inhibits methane formation through dietary choline supplementation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-13T08:10:51Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85118534900",,"000714977900016","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While multiple studies have demonstrated how landscape-scale strategies can minimise the trade-off between agricultural production and biodiversity conservation, little is known about which land-use strategies maximise the landscape-level supply of multiple ecosystem services (landscape multifunctionality), a common goal of stakeholder communities.  We combine comprehensive data collected from 150 German grassland sites with a simulation approach to identify landscape compositions, with differing proportions of low-, medium-, and high-intensity grasslands, that minimise trade-offs between the six main grassland ecosystem services prioritised by local stakeholders: biodiversity conservation, aesthetic value, productivity, carbon storage, foraging, and regional identity. Results are made accessible through an online tool that provides information on which compositions best meet any combination of user-defined priorities (https://neyret.shinyapps.io/landscape_composition_for_multifunctionality/).  Results show that an optimal landscape composition can be identified for any pattern of ecosystem service priorities. However, multifunctionality was similar and low for all landscape compositions in cases where there are strong trade-offs between services (e.g. aesthetic value and fodder production), where many services were prioritised, and where drivers other than land use played an important role. We also found that if moderate service levels are deemed acceptable, then strategies in which both high and low intensity grasslands are present can deliver landscape multifunctionality. The tool presented can aid informed decision-making by predicting the impact of future changes in landscape composition, and by allowing for the relative roles of stakeholder priorities and biophysical trade-offs to be understood by scientists and practitioners alike.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000512576",,"2212-0416",,"10.1016/j.ecoser.2021.101366","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/512576","en","Elsevier",,,"Land management||Ecosystem services||Multifunctionality||Grasslands||Land use||Simulation modelling","Assessing the impact of grassland management on landscape multifunctionality",,"Journal Article","Embargoed",,,,"2021-10-29T10:09:34Z","2023-10-22",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85117734037",,"000712864300001",,,"Ecosystem Services","52","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In wheat, dehydration avoidance can be associated with a maintained canopy cooling during dry periods. However, in an average year under temperate conditions, drought periods are rather short which makes it difficult to routinely screen for drought avoidance using canopy temperature (CT). Furthermore, confounding factors such as differences in height, shoot biomass, canopy structure and phenology complicate the interpretation of differences in CT. We aimed to use temporal trends in CT and canopy greenness during short-term drought and heat events in the early grain filling phase to circumvent these problems. During this phase, evaporative demand is high and phenology-driven senescence has yet little effect on CT. Diverse sets of 354 and 71 wheat genotypes where grown in the field phenotyping platform of ETH Zurich in 2018 and 2019, respectively. CT was repeatedly measured during early grain filling by means of drone-based imaging. The temporal trends in CT during early grain filling showed a moderate to high within-year heritability (h2 = 0.35 and h2 = 0.88 in 2018 and 2019, respectively). These trends were largely independent of confounding factors when compared to single time point measurements and likely represent genotype-specific reactions to decreasing water availability more directly than absolute CT. CT trends were also largely independent of the temporal trends in stay-green indices. Therefore, we used a combination of time-resolved CT and stay-green trends to identify genotypes combining both traits. Significant differences were observed in the combined time-resolved index among three replicated check varieties. We therefore propose to use the combined time-resolved index to identify genotypes with improved drought avoidance and functional stay green.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000511772",,"0378-4290||1872-6852",,"10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108311","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/511772","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","High-throughput field phenotyping||Remote sensing||Thermal imaging||Canopy reflectance||UAV","Temporal trends in canopy temperature and greenness are potential indicators of late-season drought avoidance and functional stay-green in wheat",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-26T02:57:04Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85117324914",,"000709914800002","Field crops res.",,"Field Crops Research","274","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This is because shade trees in agroforests may buffer growing conditions by creating favorable microclimates (climate-change adaptation), and because shade trees can sequester additional carbon from the atmosphere (climate-change mitigation). However, a major challenge for agroforestry is to maximize these potential benefits while minimizing costs to production as a consequence of resource competition between shade trees and the primary crop. While the effects of shade-tree density and canopy cover on the costs and benefits of agroforests are increasingly well understood, the effects of the traits of shade trees on the effectiveness of agroforests have received less attention. Here, we assess how shade trees with different crown architecture influence production, adaptation, and mitigation goals in a major cocoa growing region in Ghana, West Africa. We quantified the effects of shade trees from nine different species across two classes of height-to-crown-base (low vs. elevated canopies) on yield, microclimate, and carbon storage. We show that shade trees with elevated crowns had large positive effects on carbon storage and neutral effects on yield, while shade trees with low crowns had smaller effects on carbon storage and simultaneously caused larger reductions in incoming light, which was associated with lower yield. Trees of both crown classes were equally effective at buffering sub-canopy temperatures and vapor pressure deficit, although trees with low crowns maintained higher relative humidity. Taken together, our results suggest that shade-tree species with elevated crowns improve the effectiveness of cocoa agroforests by providing maximum benefits for climate-change adaptation and mitigation, while minimizing short-term costs to cocoa production.",,,,"0167-8809||1873-2305",,"10.1016/j.agee.2021.107676","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507997","en","Elsevier",,,"Climate-change adaptation||Climate-change mitigation||Climate-smart agriculture||Traits||Microclimate||Shade-tree species","The effectiveness of cocoa agroforests depends on shade-tree canopy height",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-10-02T02:44:01Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85115748581",,"000706984200002","Agric. ecosyst. environ.",,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","322","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Economic valuation of ES further translates their biophysical values into monetary values, which are then comparable across different ES and easily understandable to decision makers. However, a comprehensive synthesis of methods to measure ES indicators in grasslands, a central element of many landscapes around the globe, is still lacking, hampering the implementation of grassland ES-multifunctionality surveys. To identify suitable and recommendable methods, we reviewed the literature and evaluated labor intensiveness, equipment costs and predictive power of all methods. To facilitate the translation of biophysical ES into monetary terms, we further provide an overview of available methods for the economic valuation of ES.  This review resulted in a toolbox comprising 85 plot-scale methods for assessing 29 different ES indicators for 21 provisioning, regulating, supporting or cultural ES. The available methods to measure ES indicators vary widely in labor intensiveness, costs, and predictive power. Based on this synthesis, we recommend 1) to choose direct over indirect methods and ES indicators, 2) to use the most accurate methods to estimate ES indicators, 3) to take into account that one ES indicator can have implications for more than one final ES, and 4) to utilize the wealth of available methods and indicators to assess as many ES for ES-multifunctionality studies as possible, especially including cultural ES. Moreover, the overview of approaches that can be used for the economic valuation of different grassland ES shall facilitate economic ES-multifunctionality assessments. Thus, this methodological guidance will considerably support researchers and stakeholders in setting up ES comprehensive assessments and monitoring schemes in grasslands and shall ultimately help overcome incomplete or superficial surveys based on single or few ES only.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515401",,"2212-0416",,"10.1016/j.ecoser.2021.101376","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515401","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A guide to assess and value ecosystem services of grasslands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-16T08:13:15Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85119087589",,"000729946400002",,,"Ecosystem Services","52","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

High nitrogen (N) inputs make agriculture one of the largest contributors to N pollution. There might be a potential to reduce this losses with an output tax on animal products, as they have low N use efficiency and a tax has the potential to reduce the consumption of this products.  OBJECTIVE We want to assess the potential of a food tax on animal products to reduce the N surplus of Swiss agriculture.  METHODS We implemented a tax on meat and a tax on milk and meat in the agent-based model SWISSland. The model combines an agent-based model with a microeconomic model at the farm scale. To better understand the low response of the food tax, we applied in a second step a robust two-step global sensitivity analysis of abatement costs of individual model agents.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Imposing a tax led to an N surplus reduction of 2.1% where only meat was taxed and 2.3% where both milk and meat were taxed. The sensitivity analysis showed that distinct agents reacted non-uniformly to changing prices, so that the effect of the tax was sometimes even cancelled out. This calls for more differentiated policies to reduce the negative impact of N losses.  SIGNIFICANCE The overall impact of the food tax was minor as the distinct agents react not uniformly to lower producer prices.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000508002",,"0308-521X",,"10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103271","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/508002","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nitrogen surplus||Abatement cost||Food tax||Sensitivity analysis||Sobol indices||Spearman's correlation||Agent-based modelling","A food tax only minimally reduces the N surplus of Swiss agriculture",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-02T02:44:23Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85115622726",,"000700923600002",,,"Agricultural Systems","194","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, many organisms experience environmental conditions that differ substantially from those captured by these macroclimatic (i.e. free air) temperature grids. In forests, the tree canopy functions as a thermal insulator and buffers sub-canopy microclimatic conditions, thereby affecting biological and ecological processes. To improve the assessment of climatic conditions and climate-change-related impacts on forest-floor biodiversity and functioning, high-resolution temperature grids reflecting forest microclimates are thus urgently needed. Combining more than 1200 time series of in situ near-surface forest temperature with topographical, biological and macroclimatic variables in a machine learning model, we predicted the mean monthly offset between sub-canopy temperature at 15 cm above the surface and free-air temperature over the period 2000-2020 at a spatial resolution of 25 m across Europe. This offset was used to evaluate the difference between microclimate and macroclimate across space and seasons and finally enabled us to calculate mean annual and monthly temperatures for European forest understories. We found that sub-canopy air temperatures differ substantially from free-air temperatures, being on average 2.1 degrees C (standard deviation +/- 1.6 degrees C) lower in summer and 2.0 degrees C higher (+/- 0.7 degrees C) in winter across Europe. Additionally, our high-resolution maps expose considerable microclimatic variation within landscapes, not captured by the gridded macroclimatic products. The provided forest sub-canopy temperature maps will enable future research to model below-canopy biological processes and patterns, as well as species distributions more accurately.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000508946",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15892","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/508946","en","Wiley-Blackwell","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","biodiversity||boosted regression trees||climate change||ecosystem processes||forest microclimate||SoilTemp||Species Distributions||thermal buffering","ForestTemp – Sub-canopy microclimate temperatures of European forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-11T02:45:42Z","2022-10-02",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"ICOS-CH: Integrated Carbon Observation System in Switzerland||ICOS-CH Phase 2||Forest Vulnerability to Extreme and Repeated Climatic Stress (FEVER)","148992||173691||ETH-27 19-1","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100003006","SNF||SNF||ETHZ","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Forschungsinfrastrukturen||ETH Grants",,,"85116281596",,"000702962900001","Glob.

It has been difficult to estimate RM dry deposition, because RM concentrations, compounds, and their deposition velocities are ill-defined. Here, we investigate RM concentrations sampled with membrane-based methods and find these to exceed denuder-based RM detection by 5 times at the Zeppelin Observatory on Svalbard (March 26–July 24, 2019). Measured dry deposition of gaseous oxidized Hg was about half of the modeled RM deposition, demonstrating that particulate-bound Hg was an important component of dry deposition. Using thermal membrane desorption, RM chemistry was found to be dominated by Hg–Cl/Br (51%) and Hg–N (45%) compounds. Back-trajectory analysis indicated that Hg–Br/Cl compounds were predominantly advected from within the marine boundary layer (sea ice exposure), while Hg–N originated from the free troposphere. Weekly average RM compound-specific dry deposition velocities ranged from 0.12 to 0.49 cm s–1, with a net RM dry deposition of 1.9 μg m–2 (1.5–2.5 μg m–2; 95% confidence interval) that exceeds the mean annual Hg wet deposition flux in Svalbard. Overall, we find that springtime atmospheric RM deposition has been underestimated in the Arctic marine environment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000512564",,"2472-3452",,"10.1021/acsearthspacechem.1c00299","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/512564","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Aerohead||Arctic||Pollution||RMAS||Speciation||Thermal desorption","Fate of Springtime Atmospheric Reactive Mercury: Concentrations and Deposition at Zeppelin, Svalbard",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-29T09:27:54Z","2022-10-17",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85118612926",,"000726641700003","ACS earth space chem.","11","ACS Earth and Space Chemistry","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We evaluated the dynamics of temporal rainfall attributes – the strength of seasonality, the date of onset, cessation, and duration of the rainy season – over RFA areas across Ethiopia for the period 1981-2010 and explored their impacts on cereal crop production (including maize, teff, sorghum, wheat, barley, millet, oats and rice) between 1995 and 2010. First, we quantified the rainfall seasonality using an entropy-based seasonality index, defined the onset and cessation dates of rainy seasons, computed the rainy season duration, and analyzed their interannual variability and trends. Second, we correlated de-trended total cereal production during the Meher (i.e., long rainy) season (April to September) with the anomalies of the temporal rainfall attributes, and we used a univariate linear regression model to estimate the influence of changes in these attributes on crop production. We show that RFA areas in northern Ethiopia are characterized by a highly seasonal and unimodal rainfall regime. The southern parts of the RFA areas are characterized by less seasonal rainfall of bimodal and erratic nature. Cereal crop production during the Meher season, especially in teff and maize-dominated regions, is found to be correlated to both the onset (median ρ=-0.32 and -0.37, respectively) and duration (ρ=0.34 and 0.19) of the rainy season in the unimodal rainfall regime, whereas it is correlated with the rainfall seasonality (ρ=0.21) in regions with a bimodal rainfall. We estimate that on average over RFA areas, a late-onset and shorter rainy season lead to ∼1.5% and 1.1% crop production losses per pentad (5-day period), respectively.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505416",,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108633","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505416","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Rainfall seasonality||Rainy season onset||Rainy season duration||Rainfed agriculture||Cereal crop production||Ethiopia","Rainfall seasonality and timing: implications for cereal crop production in Ethiopia",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-14T02:45:40Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85114501609",,"000698753900019","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","310","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Livestock production and the consumption of livestock-based foods such as meat, cheese, and milk is, however, under global scrutiny for its contribution to global warming, deforestation, biodiversity loss, water use, pollution, and land/soil degradation. This paper argues that, although the environmental footprint of livestock production presents a real threat to planetary sustainability, also in the global south, this is highly contextual. Under certain context-specific management regimes livestock can deliver multiple benefits for people and planet. We provide evidence that a move toward sustainable intensification of livestock production is possible and could mitigate negative environmental impacts and even provide critical ecosystem services, such as improved soil health, carbon sequestration, and enhanced biodiversity on farms. The use of cultivated forages, many improved through selection or breeding and including grasses, legumes and trees, in integrated crop-tree-livestock systems is proposed as a stepping stone toward agroecological transformation. We introduce cultivated forages, explain their multi-functionality and provide an overview of where and to what extent the forages have been applied and how this has benefited people and the planet alike. We then examine their potential to contribute to the 13 principles of agroecology and find that integrating cultivated forages in mixed crop-tree-livestock systems follows a wide range of agroecological principles and increases the sustainability of livestock production across the globe. More research is, however, needed at the food system scale to fully understand the role of forages in the sociological and process aspects of agroecology. We make the case for further genetic improvement of cultivated forages and strong multi-disciplinary systems research to strengthen our understanding of the multidimensional impacts of forages and for managing agro-environmental trade-offs. We finish with a call for action, for the agroecological and livestock research and development communities to improve communication and join hands for a sustainable agri-food system transformation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519659",,"2571-581X",,"10.3389/fsufs.2021.742842","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519659","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","tropical forages||improved forages||cultivated forages||agroecology||mixed crop-tree-livestock systems||environmental co-benefits","Tapping Into the Environmental Co-benefits of Improved Tropical Forages for an Agroecological Transformation of Livestock Production Systems",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-09T04:13:43Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85120406804",,"000726048500001","Front.

The extent of heat stress for agricultural crops depends on the co-occurrence of heat periods and heat sensitive phenological stages. Using the Wang and Engel phenology model and the most recent climate change projections for four sites across the Swiss Central Plateau, we estimated future heat stress exposure in Swiss wheat production and tested the potential of winter wheat genotypes with differing phenological characteristics to escape future heat periods. Across all genotypes, heat stress days (Tmax ≥ 30 °C) during the temperature sensitive stages of flowering and early grain filling increased from an average of 1.5 heat days in 1982−2006 to 2.1 by 2075−2099 with RCP2.6 (with climate change mitigation) and to 3.6 by 2075−2099 with RCP8.5 (without climate change mitigation), respectively. Across all genotypes and locations, a considerable escape from future heat periods was modelled due to a mainly temperature-driven advancement in the phenological development. Under both RCP scenarios, we predicted lower exposure to heat stress for early varieties than for late varieties. However, under the RCP8.5 scenario, for each location, heat stress exposure for early varieties was still projected to be higher by 2075−2099 than for late varieties under current conditions. Further, heat stress exposure was considerably increased at locations with cooler spring conditions, slowing down the early season phenological development and resulting in late heading dates. Our findings imply needs for a regionally adequate cultivar selection as well as for phenological adaptions and heat tolerance traits in Swiss wheat breeding to adapt to future climate change and regional climatic differences. Different strategies of breeding adaptations and their trade-offs are discussed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507063",,"1161-0301||1873-7331",,"10.1016/j.eja.2021.126394","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507063","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Wheat||Switzerland||Climate change adaption||Phenology||Heat stress||Heat escape","Can Swiss wheat varieties escape future heat stress?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-27T03:15:22Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85115342392",,"000703666800002","Eur.

Soil microbial community coalescence, where entire microbial communities mix and interact under new conditions, is a widespread phenomenon whose applicability for targeted root microbiome assembly has not been studied. Whether soil mixing can lead to predictable outcomes for community assembly and functioning of specific functional groups, for example, N2-fixing rhizobia, remains unknown.  2. Using a legume shrub adapted to nutrient-poor soils, we tested the effects of community coalescence on plant nutrition and growth, and its influence on the rhizobial root nodule symbiosis. We grew seedlings of rooibos [Aspalathus linearis (Burm.f.) Dahlg.] in individual rhizosphere soils collected from cultivated and wild rooibos plants and their mixtures, and included a fertilization treatment. Portions of the taxonomic gyrB and the symbiotic nodA gene makers were sequenced to characterize rhizobial communities present in rooibos root nodules under the different soil conditions.  3. Overall, community coalescence by soil mixing had positive effects on plant nutrition and growth, and interacted with fertilizer addition to concurrently change rhizobial taxonomic evenness and promote higher relative N2 fixation. We identified particular rhizobia preferentially associated with rooibos plants that showed higher N fractions from N2 fixation, raised in mixed fertilized soils.  4. These findings indicate that soil bacterial community coalescence and fertilization can have synergistic effects on plant performance, while promoting the assembly of alternative symbiotic rhizobial communities that provide improved nutritional benefits to host plants.  5. Synthesis and applications. The combination of soil mixing and fertilizer addition may be an important, but hitherto overlooked measure to improve the functioning of rhizobium symbioses in legume crops. Microbial community coalescence should gain recognition as a potentially effective mechanism to improve the functioning of plant microbiomes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504191",,"0021-8901||1365-2664",,"10.1111/1365-2664.13995","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504191","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","biological nitrogen fixation||community coalescence||microbial community assembly||plant microbiomes||rhizobia||rooibos||soil mixing||symbiosis","Soil microbial community coalescence and fertilization interact to drive the functioning of the legume-rhizobium symbiosis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-06T02:45:45Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113719512",,"000690879500001","J.

We tested the hypothesis that the populations of a predominantly bee-pollinated plant are pollen-limited along elevations and examined whether this is related to bee visitation rate. For two years, we studied flower visitation, pollen limitation and mating system using five populations of Stachys germanica L. occurring between 327 and 1936 m a.s.l. on Mt. Olympus, Greece. S. germanica showed moderate to high self-compatibility, low spontaneous self-pollination and low pollen limitation across all altitudes and years. Bumblebees were the dominant pollinators; their visitation increased with altitude and was positively correlated with seed set and negatively correlated with pollen limitation. The opposite trend was found for the visitation by other pollinators. Seed mass was independent of visitation. Low pollen limitation is evidently due to high bumblebee visitation along the altitude, whereas seed mass could be linked to resource availability or environmental conditions. Our findings underline the functional role of bumblebees on Mediterranean mountains, and the need to focus on bumblebee conservation on this legendary mountain.",,,,"0024-4066||1095-8312",,"10.1093/biolinnean/blab113","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517259","en","Oxford University Press",,,"altitude||Mediterranean||Pollen limitation||Pollination effectiveness||Pollination treatments","Bumblebees, the proficient mountain pollinators: evidence from Stachys germanica (Lamiaceae) along the altitudinal gradient of Mount Olympus, Greece",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-11-27T04:07:54Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85119346066",,"000715341100017","Biol.

Some benefits are expected to operate through biodiversity-driven insurance effects, whereby enhanced diversity increases the chance that a system component can compensate for the impacts of adverse environmental conditions. Studies of insurance effects in natural and agricultural systems have provided equivocal results. As insurance effects are expected to play a key role in helping to maintain crop production in more variable future climates (for example under periodic drought), it is essential to know when and how they operate and interact with other potentially beneficial biodiversity-function effects. Using barley as a model crop, and pot-based plant communities, we studied the interactive effects of barley cultivar diversity and drought stress on plant productivity and the response of agricultural weeds, fungal disease, and aphids. Drought reduced barley and weed biomass, but there were no interactive effects of drought and cultivar diversity on plant productivity. Increased cultivar diversity enhanced weed suppression, potentially as a result of reduced functional space availability, and reduced disease severity on a susceptible cultivar; these effects were consistent irrespective of drought. Aphid responses were more complex, with idiosyncratic response patterns on individual cultivars. Overall, we found no evidence of an insurance effect of enhanced cultivar diversity for the negative impact of drought on crop productivity, but our results indicate that other positive biodiversity effects (weed and disease suppression) are maintained under drought. However, it is clear that not all potentially-beneficial biodiversity effects respond in the same manner. Field trials are now needed to explore whether a range of responses also occur in crop field settings, whether these can be expected to occur predictably under a range of environmental conditions, and how these then impact on crop production.",,,,"1439-1791||1618-0089",,"10.1016/j.baae.2021.05.001","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/512197","en","Elsevier",,,"Biodiversity-function relationships||Genetic diversity||Drought||Crops||Barley||Arable weeds||Aphids||Crop disease","Does crop genetic diversity support positive biodiversity effects under experimental drought?",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-10-28T03:10:22Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85107115516",,"000712042300006","Basic Appl.

Most long chain saturated and PUFA were higher at 72 hpm than at mating, while MUFA were higher at mating. SFA, MUFA and PUFA were high and positively correlated. Correlation was 0.643 between MUFA at mating and ovulation rate, and 0.781 between MUFA and normal embryos, respectively. Compacted morulae were slightly correlated with SFA at mating (0.465).

This paper explains the key working steps from the installation of sensors in the field to data acquisition, data transmission, data processing, and online visualization. Moreover, we discuss the underlying premises to convert dynamic stem size changes into relevant biological information. Every 10 min, the stem radii of about 420 trees from 13 species at 61 sites in Switzerland are measured electronically with micrometer precision, in parallel with the environmental conditions above and below ground. The data are automatically transmitted, processed and stored on a central server. Automated data processing (R-based functions) includes screening of outliers, interpolation of data gaps, and extraction of radial stem growth and water deficit for each tree. These long-term data are used for scientific investigations as well as to calculate and display daily indicators of growth trends and drought levels in Switzerland based on historical and current data. The current collection of over 100 million data points forms the basis for identifying dynamics of tree-, site- and species-specific processes along environmental gradients. TreeNet is one of the few forest networks capable of tracking the diurnal and seasonal cycles of tree physiology in near real-time, covering a wide range of temperate forest species and their respective environmental conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000513563",,"2624-893X",,"10.3389/ffgc.2021.776905","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/513563","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Early-warning||Radial wood and bark growth||Forest dynamics||Research infrastructure||Tree water relations||Observation system||Near real-time monitoring||Nowcast","TreeNet–The Biological Drought and Growth Indicator Network",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-04T09:57:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"ICOS-CH: Integrated Carbon Observation System in Switzerland||ICOS-CH Phase 2||ICOS-CH Phase 3","148992||173691||198227","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Forschungsinfrastrukturen||Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,"85119529827",,"000720143700001",,,"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The rate of leaf-level CO2 assimilation per unit stomatal conductance, i.e., intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi), is thus a key characteristic of terrestrial ecosystem functioning that is central to the global hydroclimate system. Empirical evidence and theory suggest a positive response of forest water-use efficiency to increased CO2 levels globally. Although evidence exists for a positive effect of ecosystem nitrogen (N) inputs on WUEi, it is not clear how trends in atmospheric N deposition have affected WUEi in the past. Here we combine twentieth-century climate and nitrogen deposition with stable isotope signature in tree rings and document a WUEi trend reversal at two sites in Switzerland, that matches the timing of a trend reversal in atmospheric N deposition. Using Generalized Additive Models, we fitted observed WUEi time series to multiple environmental covariates. This suggested N deposition to have a significant effect on long-term WUEi at the site that was exposed to higher N deposition levels. The ratio of the increase in WUEi in response to increase in CO2 (dWUEi/dCO2) declined by 96% after 1980 (from 0.53 to 0.02) in the beech forest and declined by 72% in the spruce forest (from 0.46 to 0.13) concurrent with a sharp decline in N deposition. Using the GAM model for two scenarios, we show that had N deposition levels not declined after 1980s, WUEi would have increased more strongly in response to increasing CO2. Although the increase in N deposition was limited to the 1950-1980 decades and the signals have declined with improvements in air quality across Europe, the role of atmospheric pollution must be reconsidered in interpretation of tree ring studies and for building environmental proxies that are pivotal to understanding future sink capacity of terrestrial ecosystems in response to climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000511114",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ac30f9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/511114","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Photosynthesis||Transpiration||Stable carbon isotopes||Tree rings||Climate change","Effect of nitrogen deposition on centennial forest water-use efficiency",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-21T20:54:54Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"ICOS-CH Phase 2||iTREE-Long-term variability of tree growth in a changing environment - identifying physiological mechanisms using stable C and O isotopes in tree rings.","173691||136295","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen||Sinergia",,,"85119653831",,"000714207400001","Environ.

Despite increasing reports of severe drought and heat impacts on forest ecosystems, community-level processes, which could potentially modulate tree responses to climatic stress, are rarely accounted for. While numerous studies indicate a positive effect of species diversity on a wide range of ecosystem functions and services, little is known about how species interactions influence tree responses to climatic variability.  2. We quantified the intraspecific variation in 16 leaf and wood physiological, morphological and anatomical traits in mature beech trees (Fagus sylvatica L.) at six sites located along a climatic gradient in the French Alps. At each site, we studied pure beech and mixed stands with silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) or downy oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.). We tested how functional traits differed between the two species mixtures (pure vs. mixed stands) within each site and along the climatic gradient.  3. We found significant changes in many traits along the climatic gradient as conditions progressively got drier and warmer. Independent of the mixture, reduced leaf-level CO2 assimilation, stomatal size and thicker leaf cuticles, consistent with a more conservative resource use strategy, were found. At the drier sites, higher foliar stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13C), thicker mesophyll tissues and lower specific leaf area (SLA) in pure stands suggest that beech had more acquisitive traits there compared to mixed stands. At the wetter sites, trees in beech-silver fir mixtures had higher chlorophyll concentration, lower δ13C, larger xylem vessels and higher SLA, suggesting a more acquisitive resource use strategy in mixed stands than in pure stands.  4. Our work revealed that species interactions are significant modulators of functional traits, and that they can be just as important drivers of intraspecific trait variation as climatic conditions. We show that downy oak mixtures lead to an adaptive drought response by common beech in dry environments. In contrast, in milder climates, interactions with silver fir seem to increase beech resource acquisition and productivity. These findings highlight a strong context dependency and imply that incorporating local interspecific interactions in research on climate impacts could improve our understanding and predictions of forest dynamics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000502759",,"0269-8463||1365-2435",,"10.1111/1365-2435.13898","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502759","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","anatomy||climatic stress||functional traits||morphology||phenotypic plasticity||species composition","Interactive effects of tree species mixture and climate on foliar and woody trait variation in a widely distributed deciduous tree",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-29T03:25:25Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113171433",,"000686946800001","Funct.

Soil is a key interface that holds P and regulates its onward flow to plants or leakage to waters. Often overlooked are a ubiquitous group of P compounds that exist in alternative oxidation states to that of phosphate (+5). Redox cycling, and the behaviour that chemically reduced P compounds exhibit in soils, introduces alternative routes of cycling P that may become more important as the soil system itself alters, especially due to the external pressures of climate change, bringing about critical dynamics in rainfall and runoff and also wetting and drying. All of these factors are known to affect soil redox potential and consequently the oxidation state of soil P. This review considers the chemically reduced species in the P cycle, exploring their sources and sinks, while considering their importance within the primary global biogeochemical cycling of P and how this may be impacted by climate change in the temperate climate of the northern hemisphere.  Highlights - This paper addresses how climate change will affect soil phosphorus cycling. - This review is novel as it considers the reduced phosphorus forms when discussing P transfer in soils. - Climate change is likely to increase prevalence of reduced P and free phosphate in northern hemisphere temperate soils. - Phosphorus cycling relies partly on redox P processes. Their importance will increase as climate alters soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000495040",,"1351-0754||1365-2389",,"10.1111/ejss.13121","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495040","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate change||cycling||phosphorus||redox||soil","Cycling of reduced phosphorus compounds in soil and potential impacts of climate change",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T10:41:48Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85104940449",,"000646066900001","Eur.

Looking at the development during the past decades and the predictions for the ones to come, ruminant-derived food production will however still rather increase than decrease. The impressively enhanced production efficiency via breeding strategies in ruminants contributes to covering the growing demand for meat and milk on most continents. The flip side of this progress is an increased prevalence of oxidative stress and inflammation-related production diseases, promoting fertility problems and impaired productivity. These are at least in part modulated by drastic changes in the nutrition of high-yielding dairy cows and beef cattle e.g., intake of maize silage and concentrate at the expense of grass-based feeds. This has concomitantly shifted dietary nutrient composition and particularly resulted in a decreased supply with bioactive feed components such as the essential fatty acid (FA) α-linolenic acid (ALA) and various plant secondary compounds (PSC). The ALA is the only n–3 FA present in original ruminant diets and serves as a precursor for the long-chain n–3 FA eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid. All three n–3 FA possess distinct functions in the modulation of cell signaling, inflammatory processes, and gene expression. Bioactive properties are also described for PSC, a chemically diverse group produced in the secondary metabolism of plants, comprising thousands of different molecules. Some PSC including polyphenols and carotenoids may induce antioxidant and anti-inflammatory processes. The tannins are especially associated with antinutritional effects such as a decreased nutrient digestibility but in turn may reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with the latter property also having been reported for dietary n–3 FA. Knowledge on the bioactive properties of these dietary components in monogastrics (especially humans and rodents, but also livestock species such as pigs and chicken) is more advanced than in ruminants but overall, effects and underlying mechanisms are not entirely known.  This thesis presents an overview and results from various own studies on the effects of bioactive n–3 FA and PSC from feed supplements and alternative sustainably produced feedstuffs on a range of factors relevant for ruminant livestock production. In particular, effects on rumen fermentation, greenhouse gas emissions, tissue partitioning of FA, oxidative stress, inflammation, reproduction-related parameters, productivity, as well as meat and milk quality were investigated. The research was performed in a set of in vitro and in vivo experiments involving cattle, sheep, and goats, investigating mostly direct but also intergenerational effects. The results show that most of the tested alternative feedstuffs rich in bioactive components e.g., food industry by-products and microalgae were suitable to maintain rumen fermentation processes and animal productivity. Replacement of the critically discussed soybean meal by more sustainable protein sources rich in bioactive components was successful in dairy cows and beef cattle without impairing productivity or meat and milk quality. The supply with bioactive components e.g., via fish oil and microalgae partially improved the nutritional value of meat and milk even though the sensory meat quality was impaired following fish oil supplementation. Importantly, differential effects of   n–3 versus n–6 FA as well as hydrolysable versus condensed tannins were observed on the mechanisms and the effectiveness of methane mitigation, respectively, which need to be further investigated in the future to exploit the full potential of these bioactive components. The detected differential partitioning of dietary n–3 and n–6 FA into a large range of different body tissues and fluids point towards tissue-specific requirements and functions of these FA that need to be further elucidated on a molecular level. A remarkable observation was the promotion of preimplantation embryo elongation with maternal fish oil supplementation, adding another aspect of how n–3 FA may beneficially affect reproduction. The herein presented antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects observed in the studies with ruminants following intake of bioactive feeds differ from those observed in monogastrics but still indicate potential for beneficially modifying symbiotic microorganisms and ruminant host physiology.  Overall, the work presented in this thesis extended the scarce knowledge about the biofunctionality of n–3 FA and selected PSC and their synergistic effects in ruminant molecular physiology. The variable results reported here and in the literature require further experiments that control for a broader range of factors with known or assumed influence on study results e.g., the type, dose, matrix, and duration of bioactive component supply, composition of the basal diet, animal species, sex, and age. Particularly interactions among bioactive components from the same or different categories are of relevance. Future research should compare long- and short-term effects to determine whether or not there is an adaptation of the rumen microbiome to bioactive feed components, thereby modulating their effects. Future advances in molecular ruminant nutrition will provide valuable insights to understand the underlying mechanisms of effects mediated by bioactive feed components to improve environmental, ethical, animal welfare, and human health aspects of ruminant livestock systems. The current body of evidence indicates that most of these aspects would benefit from increasing the ruminants' intake of n–3 FA (particularly ALA) and PSC through modification of their diets.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516031",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516031","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","RUMINANT NUTRITION, RUMINANT FEEDING AND FEEDSTUFFS (ANIMAL NUTRITION)||Bioactive components||Oxidative stress||METABOLISM (ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY)||REPRODUCTION (ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY)||Meat Quality||Milk quality||Omega-3 fatty acids||Plant secondary compounds||Polyphenols||Carotenoids||Sustainable agriculture||Greenhouse gas emission||Rumen fermentation","Strategic use of the bioactive properties of n–3 fatty acids and plant secondary compounds in the diet of ruminant farm animals",,"Habilitation Thesis","Open access",,,,"2021-11-19T08:34:26Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we identify a 13C signal (i.e., systematic 13C/ 12C variation) at tree-ring glucose C-4 and report an experimentally testable theory on its origin. We propose the signal is introduced by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases in the cytosol of leaves. It conveys two kinds of (potentially convoluted) information: (i) commitment of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate vs. fructose 1,6-bisphosphate metabolism, and (ii) the contribution of non-phosphorylating vs. phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to catalysing the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate forward reaction of glycolysis. Theory is supported by 13C fractionation modelling. Modelling results provide first evidence in support of the cytosolic oxidation-reduction (COR) cycle, a carbon-neutral mechanism supplying NADPH at the expense of ATP and NADH which may help to maintain leaf-cytosolic redox balances. In line with expectations related to COR cycling, we found a positive correlation between air vapour pressure deficit and 13C discrimination at glucose C-4. Overall, 13C-4 signal analysis may enable an improved understanding of leaf carbon and energy metabolism.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493415",,"1460-2431||0022-0957",,"10.1093/jxb/erab316","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493415","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Carbon allocation||Carbon flux||Carbon stable isotopes||COR cycle||Cytosolic oxidationreduction cycle||Energy metabolism||Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase||Intramolecular isotope analysis||Isotope fractionation model||Primary carbon metabolism","Carbon flux around leaf-cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase introduces a 13C signal in plant glucose",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-07T11:40:28Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85114315982",,"000715558300026","J.

Ecosystem functions depend on environmental conditions and the traits of species that comprise the ecological communities4. However, the axes of variation of ecosystem functions are largely unknown, which limits our understanding of how ecosystems respond as a whole to anthropogenic drivers, climate and environmental variability4,5. Here we derive a set of ecosystem functions6 from a dataset of surface gas exchange measurements across major terrestrial biomes. We find that most of the variability within ecosystem functions (71.8%) is captured by three key axes. The first axis reflects maximum ecosystem productivity and is mostly explained by vegetation structure. The second axis reflects ecosystem water-use strategies and is jointly explained by variation in vegetation height and climate. The third axis, which represents ecosystem carbon-use efficiency, features a gradient related to aridity, and is explained primarily by variation in vegetation structure. We show that two state-of-the-art land surface models reproduce the first and most important axis of ecosystem functions. However, the models tend to simulate more strongly correlated functions than those observed, which limits their ability to accurately predict the full range of responses to environmental changes in carbon, water and energy cycling in terrestrial ecosystems7,8.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507398",,"0028-0836||1476-4687",,"10.1038/s41586-021-03939-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507398","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biogeography||Ecosystem ecology","The three major axes of terrestrial ecosystem function",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-28T10:08:40Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"ICOS-CH: Integrated Carbon Observation System in Switzerland||ICOS-CH Phase 2","148992||173691","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,"85115297278",,"000698366900004",,"7881","Nature","598","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Gap-filling methane fluxes is challenging because of high variability and complex responses to multiple drivers. To date, there is no widely established gap-filling standard for wetland methane fluxes, with regards both to the best model algorithms and predictors. This study synthesizes results of different gap-filling methods systematically applied at 17 wetland sites spanning boreal to tropical regions and including all major wetland classes and two rice paddies. Procedures are proposed for: 1) creating realistic artificial gap scenarios, 2) training and evaluating gap-filling models without overstating performance, and 3) predicting half-hourly methane fluxes and annual emissions with realistic uncertainty estimates. Performance is compared between a conventional method (marginal distribution sampling) and four machine learning algorithms. The conventional method achieved similar median performance as the machine learning models but was worse than the best machine learning models and relatively insensitive to predictor choices. Of the machine learning models, decision tree algorithms performed the best in cross-validation experiments, even with a baseline predictor set, and artificial neural networks showed comparable performance when using all predictors. Soil temperature was frequently the most important predictor whilst water table depth was important at sites with substantial water table fluctuations, highlighting the value of data on wetland soil conditions. Raw gap-filling uncertainties from the machine learning models were underestimated and we propose a method to calibrate uncertainties to observations. The python code for model development, evaluation, and uncertainty estimation is publicly available. This study outlines a modular and robust machine learning workflow and makes recommendations for, and evaluates an improved baseline of, methane gap-filling models that can be implemented in multi-site syntheses or standardized products from regional and global flux networks (e.g., FLUXNET).",,,,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108528","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495419","en","Elsevier",,,"Machine learning||time series||imputation||gap-filling||methane||flux||wetlands","Gap-filling eddy covariance methane fluxes: Comparison of machine learning model predictions and uncertainties at FLUXNET-CH4 wetlands",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-07-15T16:06:21Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The role of diffuse radiation for a long-term arable crop rotation at Oensingen, Switzerland (Acronym: DiRad Oensingen)||Reconciling innovative farming practices and networks to enable sustainable development of smart Swiss farming systems","146373||172433","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||NFP 73: Gesuch",,,"85109612362",,"000692679900002","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","308-309","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These periods shortly enhanced vegetation growth and microbial activity, which must have utilized major nutrients such as phosphorus (P). However, any biological cycling of P involves an oxygen exchange with water, which should now reside in the hyperarid soils as tracer of life. In order to identify such evidences, we performed sequential P fractionation and analyzed the oxygen isotope composition of HCl-extractable phosphate (δ18OHCl–P) in the surface soil (0–15 cm) of a climatic gradient along the rising alluvial fans of the Central Depression to the Precordillera, Chile. At the driest sites, the δ18OHCl-P values were constant with depth and deviated from biologically-driven isotopic equilibrium. In contrast, we observed a considerable increase of δ18OHCl-P values below the soil surface at less arid sites, where some isotope values were even within the range of full isotopic equilibrium with biologically cycled phosphate. For the latter sites, this points to most efficient biological P cycling right below the uppermost surface of the desert. Critically, the absolute concentrations of this biologically cycled P exceeded those of P potentially stored in living microbial cells by at least two orders of magnitude. Therefore, our data provides evidence that δ18OHCl-P values trace not recent but past biological activity, making it a powerful tool for assessing the existence, pathways and evolution of life in such arid ecosystems on Earth and, thus, potentially on other planets such as Mars.",,,,"0016-7037||1872-9533",,"10.1016/j.gca.2021.07.027","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500960","en","Elsevier",,,"The Atacama Desert||Hyperarid soils||Sequential P fractionation||Oxygen isotope composition of HCl-extractable phosphate (d18OHCl P)||Past biological activity","Phosphate oxygen isotope fingerprints of past biological activity in the Atacama Desert",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-08-14T02:52:34Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85112019688",,"000693337600001","Geochim.

Domain experts in agriculture work with crop type labels that are organised in a hierarchical tree structure, where coarse classes (like orchards) are subdivided into finer ones (like apples, pears, vines, etc.). We develop a crop classification method that exploits this expert knowledge and significantly improves the mapping of rare crop types. The three-level label hierarchy is encoded in a convolutional, recurrent neural network (convRNN), such that for each pixel the model predicts three labels at different level of granularity. This end-to-end trainable, hierarchical network architecture allows the model to learn joint feature representations of rare classes (e.g., apples, pears) at a coarser level (e.g., orchard), thereby boosting classification performance at the fine-grained level. Additionally, labelling at different granularity also makes it possible to adjust the output according to the classification scores; as coarser labels with high confidence are sometimes more useful for agricultural practice than fine-grained but very uncertain labels. We validate the proposed method on a new, large dataset that we make public. ZueriCrop covers an area of 50 km × 48 km in the Swiss cantons of Zurich and Thurgau with a total of 116′000 individual fields spanning 48 crop classes, and 28,000 (multi-temporal) image patches from Sentinel-2. We compare our proposed hierarchical convRNN model with several baselines, including methods designed for imbalanced class distributions.

We explored how several strains of Hamiltonella defensa and Regiella insecticola influence the CHC profiles of host aphids (Aphis fabae) and the ability of aphid-tending ants (Lasius niger) to distinguish the profiles of aphids hosting different endosymbionts. We found significant compositional differences between the CHCs of aphids with different infections. Some endosymbionts changed the proportions of odd-chain linear alkanes, while others changed primarily methyl-branched compounds, which may be particularly important for communication. Behavioural assays, in which we trained ants to associate CHC profiles of endosymbiont infected or uninfected aphids with food rewards, revealed that ants readily learned to distinguish differences in aphid CHC profiles associated with variation in endosymbiont strains. While previous work has documented endosymbiont effects on aphid interactions with antagonists, the current findings support the hypothesis that endosymbionts also alter traits that influence communicative interactions with ant mutualists.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000509326",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-021-98098-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/509326","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Chemical ecology||Ecology","Aphids harbouring different endosymbionts exhibit differences in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles that can be recognized by ant mutualists",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-12T20:32:30Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85116372188",,"000702752900042","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Two multiallelic loci, called S and Z, control the gametophytic SI system of the grass family (Poaceae), which contains all major forage grasses. Loci independent from S and Z have been reported to disrupt SI and lead to self-compatibility (SC). A locus causing SC in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was previously mapped on linkage group (LG) 5 in an F2 population segregating for SC. Using a subset of the same population (n = 68), we first performed low-resolution quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to exclude the presence of additional, previously undetected contributors to SC. The previously reported QTL on LG 5 explained 38.4% of the phenotypic variation, and no significant contribution from other genomic regions was found. This was verified by the presence of significantly distorted markers in the region overlapping with the QTL. Second, we fine mapped the QTL to 0.26 centimorgan (cM) using additional 2,056 plants and 23 novel sequence-based markers. Using Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) genome assembly as a reference, the markers flanking SC were estimated to span a ~3 Mb region encoding for 57 predicted genes. Among these, seven genes were proposed as relevant candidate genes based on their annotation and function described in previous studies. Our study is a step forward to identify SC genes in forage grasses and provides diagnostic markers for marker-assisted introgression of SC into elite germplasm.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000510750",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2021.707901","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510750","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","self-incompatibility (SI)||self-compatibility (SC)||perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)||quantitative trait locus (QTL)||segregation distortion||fine mapping||candidate genes","Identification of Candidate Genes for Self-Compatibility in Perennial Ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-20T08:57:46Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Boosting technology transfer and responsible research and innovation (RRI) in plant sciences||Unravelling self-incompatibility in Poaceae species","722338||197708","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF","H2020||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85118259716",,"000715984500001","Front.

To untangle the causal agents of the pea root rot complex and determine the role of the plant genotype in shaping its own detrimental or beneficial microbiome, fungal and oomycete root rot pathogens, as well as previously identified beneficials, i.e., arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and Clonostachys rosea, were qPCR quantified in diseased roots of eight differently resistant pea genotypes grown in four agricultural soils under controlled conditions. We found that soil and pea genotype significantly determined the microbial compositions in diseased pea roots. Despite significant genotype x soil interactions and distinct soil-dependent pathogen complexes, our data revealed key microbial taxa that were associated with plant fitness. Our study indicates the potential of fungal and oomycete markers for plant health and serves as a precedent for other complex plant pathosystems.

Carbon accrues in grassland soil restored from cultivation, but the amount of physically protected C (here measured as microaggregate-within-macroaggregate C) and predominant mechanisms of accrual are not well understood. We modeled the rate of physically protected carbon accrued in three mesic temperate perennial restored grasslands from cross-continental regions using datasets with a wide range of restoration ages from northeast Kansas, USA; southeast Nebraska, USA; and northeast Free State, South Africa. Further, we investigated major controls on the amount of physically protected C in each site using structural equation modeling. Variables in the structural equation model were root biomass, root C:N ratio, soil structure (indicated by bulk density, percent of macroaggregates on a per whole soil mass basis, and percent of microaggregate-within-macroaggregates on a per macroaggregate mass basis), microbial composition (indicated by microbial biomass C, total phospholipid fatty acid [PLFA] biomass, and PLFA biomass of arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi [AMF] biomass), and microaggregate-within-macroaggregate C on a per whole soil mass basis. Across all sites, physically protected C accrued at a rate of 16 +/- 5 gm(-2) year(-1). Data from South Africa fit an a priori metamodel developed for northeast KS that hypothesized physically protected C could be explained as a function of microbial composition, soil structure, root C:N ratio, and root biomass (listed in order of strength of direct effect on physically protected C). In contrast to the model-based hypothesis, root C:N ratio was the strongest influence (negative) on physically protected C in South Africa. The lesser effect of AMF on physically protected C in South Africa was consistent with lower AMF biomass in arid environments. The hypothesized model did not fit southeast Nebraska data possibly due to high (similar to 30%) clay content. Overall, these results suggest that physically protected C in soil with moderate amounts of clay (more than 10% and less than 30%) can be predicted with knowledge of roots (biomass and C:N ratio), microbial biomass, and soil aggregation.",,,,"0168-2563||1573-515X",,"10.1007/s10533-021-00774-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495141","en","Springer",,,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi||Conservation Reserve Program||Microaggregate‐within‐macroaggregate||Microbial biomass||Roots||Soil organic matter||Soil structure","Mechanisms influencing physically sequestered soil carbon in temperate restored grasslands in South Africa and North America",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-07-15T10:48:48Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102601332",,"000627684100002","Biogeochemistry (Dordrecht)","1","Biogeochemistry","156","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Therefore, agricultural systems have to be more productive, sustainable, and resilient in the context of global change. Organic farming and conservation tillage have been widely implemented as means of ecological intensification due to their ecological benefits, such as enhancing biodiversity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and improving soil fertility. However, how these cropping systems can potentially compensate drought effects on food production and functioning of ecosystems was scarcely reported in arable lands. Therefore, as introduced in Chapter 1, this doctoral thesis focuses on the capability of different cropping systems to mitigate drought effects on ecosystem functioning, including crop yields and total N uptake, crop phenology, plant water uptake, litter decomposition, and soil nitrate availability. As introduced in Chapter 2, all the experiments in this thesis were conducted using the FAST (Farming Systems and Tillage Experiment) trial, which compares organic farming vs. conventional farming with different tillage depth, resulting in a total of four cropping systems, i.e. i) organic farming with intensive tillage, ii) organic farming with reduced tillage, iii) conventional farming with intensive tillage, and iv) conventional farming with no-tillage. During major crop growth stages, summer drought treatments were applied with portable rain shelters for all four cropping systems.  Crop phenology helps schedule management practices and acts as a biological indicator integrating the information from both environmental drivers and management options. However, the study on crop phenology as affected by smallholder management practices is often limited by the temporal and spatial resolution of phenological observations. Therefore, the goal of Chapter 3 was to investigate the feasibility of PhenoCams, i.e. time-lapse cameras, for tracking crop phenology and to assess how cropping systems affect crop phenology and estimating yields at harvest with phenology observations. During the years 2018 and 2019, we monitored vegetation changes among four cropping systems during two crop growing seasons, i.e. pea-barley mixture and winter wheat monoculture. The results indicated that early-season phenological differences established by cropping systems in winter wheat can be well translated into changes in crop yields and total N uptake under ambient rainfall conditions. The response of crops to drought can be very different depending on the crop species and growth stages. Timely observation of vegetation changes can monitor drought effects on crop development over time. In Chapter 4, the crop yields, total N uptake and phenology in response to drought among different cropping systems were investigated. The drought response of phenology was not consistent among crops, with up to 6 days earlier onset of several phenological metrics in pea-barley, but no such shifts of these metrics in winter wheat. Temporal interactions of systems with drought on phenology were shown for both pea-barley and winter wheat. Compare to control, drought treatments caused 20–27% and 16–21% reductions of grain yields and total N uptake for pea-barley mixture and winter wheat, respectively. The findings of this chapter indicate that cropping systems cannot compensate the negative effects of drought on phenology nor crop yields or total N uptake. Plants can shift their growth stages to escape from unfavorable conditions (drought escape mechanism), or avoid drought by developing deeper roots or utilizing water in a deeper soil layer (drought avoid mechanism), or can be both. To better understand the mechanisms of crops in response to drought, in Chapter 5, the soil depths of pea-barley water sources among all cropping systems combined with drought treatment were investigated using stable water isotopes. Pea plants prefer shallower soil water as compared to barley plants. As affected by drought, both pea and barley relied more on shallower soil water (0-20 cm) across all cropping systems than the control treatment, but cropping systems did not shift the soil water sources of both pea and barley. Thus, adapting cropping systems could not mitigate the drought effect on plant water use strategy.  Drought can not only lead to phenological shifts and physiological failures on plant-level but also inhibit ecosystem processes and functions in soil. Litter decomposition releases nutrients from organic matter to the atmosphere, soil organisms and crops and can be primarily inhibited under drought. However, it is unclear to what extent organic farming and conservation tillage can alleviate drought effects on litter decomposition. Therefore, in Chapter 6, the effect of drought on litter decomposition was examined in four cropping systems across three crop growing seasons, including pea-barley mixture, maize monoculture, and winter wheat monoculture. Using two standard tea litters with distinct quality, i.e., high-quality green tea with a narrow C: N ratio and low-quality rooibos tea with a wide C: N ratio, it was possible to assess the effects of cropping systems on litter decomposition and especially on the resistance (i.e., the ability to withstand a disturbance) and the resilience (i.e., the ability to return to undisturbed conditions). Cropping systems had no effect on litter decomposition, regardless of litter quality and drought treatment. The decomposition of high-quality litter was less resistant but more resilient to drought, and vice versa for low-quality litter. Soil nitrate availability was also strongly decreased by drought (by 32 to 86%). The positive correlation of soil nitrate availability with litter decomposition was significant for pea-barley but not for winter wheat during drought, but this correlation disappeared upon rewetting. In summary, the results of this chapter reveal neither adaptation of organic farming nor conservation tillage can sustain early-stage litter decomposition in response to severe drought.  As synthesized in Chapter 7, this doctoral thesis studied the resistance and resilience of ecosystem functions of different cropping systems to drought, in terms of crop productivity, crop phenology, plant water uptake pattern, litter decomposition and soil nitrate availability. The results suggest that stabilizing crop yields and ecosystem functioning in response to drought may not be possible when applying organic farming and conservation tillage for short terms (less than 10 years). For further study, as PhenoCams observe crop phenology in real time, also regarding phases that are not visible for human observers, it is possible to test various management options, such as cover crops or precise irrigation or fertilization on specific crop growth phases to improve current cropping systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000517403",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517403","en","ETH Zurich",,,"arable lands||climate change||organic farming||crop phenology||crop water uptake||litter decomposition||near surface imagery","Ecosystem functioning of arable land in response to cropping systems and drought",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences",,"2021-11-28T21:21:09Z","2024-11-28",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27794",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous studies have focused on the role of spring and autumn phenology in regulating carbon sequestration in forest stands, but few on the impact of physiological status in summer. However, plant accumulated the most carbon in summer compared with spring and autumn, therefore, it is of great significance to explore the role of summer phenological metrics on the variability of carbon sequestration. Using 514 site-years of flux data obtained at 40 FLUXNET sites including three forest ecosystems (i.e. evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF), deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) and mixed forest (MF)) in Europe and North America, we compared the potential of physiological and phenological metrics of Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (RECO) in explaining the interannual and spatial variability (IAV and SV) of forest net ecosystem production (NEP). In view of the better performance of physiological metrics, we developed the maximum carbon uptake index (MCUI), which integrated the physiology metrics of photosynthesis and respiration in summer, and further explored its ability in explaining the IAV and SV of NEP. The results suggest that the MCUI had a better ability than respiration-growth length ratio (RGR) in predicting NEP for all three forest types. The interpretation of MCUI based on meteorological variables illustrated that the controlling meteorological factors of MCUI differed substantially among ecosystems. The summer shortwave radiation had the greatest influence on MCUI at DBF sites, while the soil water content played an important but opposite role at ENF and DBF sites, and no significant meteorological driver was found at MF sites. The higher potential of MCUI in explaining IAV and SV of NEP highlights the importance of summer physiology in controlling the forest carbon sequestration, and further confirms the significant role of peak plant growth in regulating carbon cycle of forest ecosystems. Understanding the drivers of peak plant growth is therefore of a great significance for further improving the precious of ecosystem model in the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000497961",,"1470-160X||1872-7034",,"10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107982","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/497961","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Physiology||Phenology||Forest||Flux||Net ecosystem production","Interannual and spatial variability of net ecosystem production in forests explained by an integrated physiological indicator in summer",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-28T03:14:28Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85110171757",,"000683742500003",,,"Ecological Indicators","129","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, investigations on the impacts of residue quality and soil texture on aggregation pathways are lacking. In this study, easily, moderately and slowly decomposable residues with different qualities (milk vetch, C/N = 16.7; maize, C/N = 35.5; and decomposed maize, C/N = 30.8) were applied to four types of red soils (Red clay, Basalt, Sandstone and Granite) with a range of soil textures. Aggregate fractions of each soil were labelled by different REOs. The soil respiration (CO2), mean weight diameter (MWD) and REOs concentrations were measured after 0, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days of incubation. The results showed that except for Basalt soil, the incorporation of organic residues increased the formation but decreased the breakdown of macroaggregates in the order of milk vetch > maize > decomposed maize in the first two weeks, thus leading to a greater standardized MWD in higher-quality residue-incorporated soils. In the mid-to-late incubation time (28–56 d), the standardized MWD and relative formation of macroaggregates in the milk vetch and maize treatments converged regardless of soil types. An exponential relation between the standardized MWD and accumulated CO2 (P < 0.05) indicated that the residue quality-dependent MWD dynamics were further driven by microbial activity. The two coarse-textured soils (Sandstone and Granite) presented a more rapid response of aggregation to microbial activity than the two fine-textured soils (Red clay and Basalt) did. The relative formation of 2–5 mm aggregates was significantly greater in Sandstone soil at a given residue incorporation, thus leading to a faster increase in the standardized MWD compared with fine-textured soils. However, a similar result was not observed in Granite soil. A positive linear relationship between the standardized MWD and 2–5 mm aggregate formation in all investigated soils (P < 0.001) suggested that MWD dynamics mainly depended on the newly formed large macroaggregate rate.

Assessing the influence of annual forage crop species on net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) is key to develop management strategies that can help to mitigate climate change, while optimizing productivity of these systems. However, little is known about the effect of annual forage crop species on CO2 exchange fluxes, considering separately net CO2 balances during the growth and fallow periods, and species ecophysiological responses. Our study assesses the influence of cereal monocultures vs. cereal‑legume mixtures on (1) ecosystem‑scale CO2 fluxes, for the whole crop season and separately for the two periods of growth and fallow; and (2) potential sensitivities of CO2 exchange related to short-term variations in light, temperature, and soil water content. This is the first mid‑term (seven years) ecosystem‑scale CO2 fluxes assessment of an intensively managed forage system in the Pyrenees region. Our results provide strong evidence that cereal‑legume mixtures lead to higher net CO2 uptake than cereal monocultures, as a result of higher gross CO2 uptake, while respiratory fluxes did not significantly increase. Also, cereal-legume mixtures favoured a higher voluntary regrowth during the fallow period, which was decisive for the cumulative net CO2 uptake of the entire crop season. Overall, cereal‑legume mixtures enhanced net CO2 sink capacity of the forage crop, while ensuring productivity and forage quality.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504199",,"0378-4290||1872-6852",,"10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108262","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504199","en","Elsevier",,,"Ecosystem respiration||Gross primary production||Light response||Management||Net ecosystem CO2 exchange","Cereal-legume mixtures increase net CO2 uptake in a forage crop system in the Eastern Pyrenees",,"Journal Article","Embargoed",,,,"2021-09-06T02:56:35Z","2023-08-19",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113767805",,"000709961600002","Field crops res.",,"Field Crops Research","272","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In Morocco, the Green Moroccan Plan steered the promotion of groundwater-based drip irrigation. Over the last decade, the Plan encouraged producers to shift to cash crop production. This is how tomato became a main agri-food export commodity mostly produced in greenhouses in the Souss-Massa region and produced intensively in open-fields for local demand in the Northern part of the country. However, water resources are expected to become particularly scarce over the next decades, increasing the vulnerabilities of tomato farmers in face of unforeseen changes and shocks. The main purpose of this study is to show a) how global and local tomato value chains respond to irrigation schemes and b) what the environmental consequences are. By means of a system dynamics model, and a survey conducted among a sample of 244 producers, we describe and outline the major interactions between agricultural, ecological and socio-economic dimensions of the tomato production systems. The results of the model simulations highlight how overexploitation of groundwater tables negatively affects crop production and farmers’ welfare. The model shows that in the near future, water scarcity will have long-lasting consequences on the producers, such as reduced productivity and losses in cash flow. Our model results highlight that measures need to be taken in the coming years in order to prevent the predicted irremediable water shortage in 2030. We conclude that the current groundwater management will, in the long-term, lead to irreversible groundwater depletion which will enhance already existing inequalities between the two types of producers. Urgent actions have to be taken in order to sustainably manage water while supporting farmers in the long-term.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504147",,"0378-3774||1873-2283",,"10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107082","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504147","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Agricultural-food system||System dynamics simulation||Groundwater management","Agricultural intensification can no longer ignore water conservation – A systemic modelling approach to the case of tomato producers in Morocco",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-05T02:44:01Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113624908",,"000691096300006","Agric. water manag.",,"Agricultural Water Management","256","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study investigates the fate of P fertilizer derived Cd (Cddff) in soil-wheat systems using a novel combination of enriched stable Cd isotope mass balances, sequential extractions, and Bayesian isotope mixing models. We applied an enriched 111Cd labeled mineral P fertilizer to arable soils from two long-term field trials with distinct soil properties (a strongly acidic pH and a neutral pH) and distinct past mineral P fertilizer application rates. We then cultivated wheat in a pot trial on these two soils. In the neutral soil, Cd concentrations in the soil and the wheat increased with increasing past mineral P fertilizer application rates. This was not the case in the strongly acidic soil. Less than 2.3% of freshly applied Cddff was taken up by the whole wheat plant. Most of the Cddff remained in the soil and was predominantly (>95% of freshly applied Cddff) partitioned into the easily mobilizable acetic acid soluble fraction (F1) and the potentially mobile reducible fraction (F2). Soil pH was the determining factor for the partitioning of Cddff into F1, as revealed through a recovery of about 40% of freshly applied Cddff in F1 in the neutral pH soil compared with about 60% in the strongly acidic soil. Isotope mixing models showed that F1 was the predominant source of Cd for wheat on both soils and that it contributed to over 80% of the Cd that was taken up by wheat. By tracing the fate of Cddff in entire soil-plant systems using different isotope source tracing approaches, we show that the majority of Cddff remains mobilizable and is potentially plant available in the subsequent crop cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484969",,"0269-7491||1878-2450||1873-6424",,"10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117314","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484969","en","Elsevier BV","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cadmium||Phosphorus fertilizer||Wheat||Stable isotope labeling||Source tracing","Tracing the fate of phosphorus fertilizer derived cadmium in soil-fertilizer-wheat systems using enriched stable isotope labeling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-19T12:47:14Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Stable metal isotopes as tools to assess enrichment and sources of trace metals in soils and crops to improve sustainability of agricultural systems","145195","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 69: Gesuch",,,"85105780144",,"000696990100006","Environ Pollut",,"Environmental Pollution","287","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It provides food security and early access to income from the maize component. However, yields of both crops are commonly low in farmers’ fields. Multi-locational trials were conducted in Southern Nigeria in 2016 and 2017 to investigate options to increase productivity and profitability through increased cassava and maize plant densities and fertilizer application. Trials with 4 and 6 treatments in 2016 and 2017, respectively were established on 126 farmers’ fields over two seasons with a set of different designs, including combinations of two levels of crop density and three levels of fertilizer rates. The maize crop was tested at low density (LM) with 20,000 plants ha−1 versus high density (HM) with 40,000 plants ha−1. For cassava, low density (LC) had had 10,000 plants ha−1 versus the high density (HC) with 12,500 plants ha−1.; The fertilizer application followed a regime favouring either the maize crop (FM: 90 kg N, 20 kg P and 37 kg K ha−1) or the cassava crop (FC: 75 kg N, 20 kg P and 90 kg K ha−1), next to control without fertilizer application (F0). Higher maize density (HM) increased marketable maize cob yield by 14 % (3700 cobs ha−1) in the first cycle and by 8% (2100 cobs ha−1) in the second cycle, relative to the LM treatment. Across both cropping cycles, fertilizer application increased cob yield by 15 % (5000 cobs ha−1) and 19 % (6700 cobs ha−1) in the FC and FM regime, respectively. Cassava storage root yield increased by 16 % (4 Mg ha−1) due to increased cassava plant density, and by 14 % (4 Mg ha−1) due to fertilizer application (i.e., with both fertilizer regimes) but only in the first cropping cycle. In the second cycle, increased maize plant density (HM) reduced cassava storage root yield by 7% (1.5 Mg ha−1) relative to the LM treatment. However, the negative effect of high maize density on storage root yield was counteracted by fertilizer application. Fresh storage root yield increased by 8% (2 Mg ha−1) in both fertilizer regimes compared to the control without fertilizer application. Responses to fertilizer by cassava and maize varied between fields. Positive responses tended to decline with increasing yields in the control treatment. The average value-to-cost ratio (VCR) of fertilizer use for the FM regime was 3.6 and higher than for the FC regime (VCR = 1.6), resulting from higher maize yields when FM than when FC was applied. Revenue generated by maize constituted 84–91% of the total revenue of the cropping system. The highest profits were achieved with the FM regime when both cassava and maize were grown at high density. However, fertilizer application was not always advisable as 34 % of farmers did not realize a profit. For higher yields and profitability, fertilizer recommendations should be targeted to responsive fields based on soil fertility knowledge.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504430",,"0378-4290||1872-6852",,"10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108283","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504430","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cassava maize intercropping||Plant density||Fertilizer||Value cost ratio||Profitability||Southern Nigeria","Developing recommendations for increased productivity in cassava-maize intercropping systems in Southern Nigeria",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-07T04:06:59Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113968850",,"000709961600004","Field crops res.",,"Field Crops Research","272","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We performed RNA-sequencing to characterise and compare transcriptomic changes involved in herbivory-induced defences and flower development, in tomato leaves and flowers, respectively. We found that both the herbivory-induced responses and flower development involved alterations in jasmonic acid signalling, suppression of primary metabolism and reprogramming of secondary metabolism. We identified 411 genes that were involved in both processes, a number significantly higher than expected by chance. Genetic manipulation of key regulators of induced defences also led to the expression changes in the same genes in both leaves and flowers. Targeted metabolomic analysis showed that among closely related tomato species, jasmonic acid and alpha-tomatine are correlated in flower buds and herbivory-induced leaves.

Despite its importance to land-surface modeling, variations of S0 across space are largely unknown as they cannot be observed directly. We developed a method to diagnose global variations of S0 from the relationship between vegetation activity (measured by sun-induced fluorescence and by the evaporative fraction) and the cumulative water deficit (CWD). We then show that spatial variations in S0 can be predicted from the assumption that plants are adapted to sustain CWD extremes occurring with a return period that is related to the life form of dominant plants and the large-scale topographical setting. Predicted biome-level S0 distributions, translated to an apparent rooting depth (zr) by accounting for soil texture, are consistent with observations from a comprehensive zr dataset. Large spatial variations in S0 across the globe reflect adaptation of zr to the hydroclimate and topography and implies large heterogeneity in the sensitivity of vegetation activity to drought. The magnitude of S0 inferred for most of the Earth’s vegetated regions and particularly for those with a large seasonality in their hydroclimate indicates an important role for plant access to water stored at depth - beyond the soil layers commonly considered in land-surface models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507551",,,,"10.1101/2021.09.17.460332","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507551","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Global distribution of the rooting zone water storage capacity reflects plant adaptation to the environment",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2021-09-29T08:20:24Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"next-generation Modelling of the biosphere - Including New Data streams and optimality approaches","181115","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Eccellenza",,"100205960",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We used principal component regression to analyze data from 147 eddy flux sites to disentangle effects of climatic variables, soil properties and plant traits on the spatial variation in annual NEE and its components (GPP and ecosystem respiration (RE)) across global forests and grasslands. Our results showed that the largest unique contribution (proportion of variance only explained by one class of variables) to NEE variance came from climatic variables for forests (24%-30%) and soil properties for grasslands (41%-54%). Specifically, mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were the most important climatic variables driving forest NEE, whereas available soil water capacity, clay content and cation exchange capacity mainly influenced grassland NEE. Plant traits showed a small unique contribution to NEE in both forests and grasslands. However, leaf phosphorus content strongly interacted with soil total nitrogen density and clay content, and these combined factors represented a major contribution for grassland NEE. For GPP and RE, the majority of spatial variance was attributed to the common contribution of climate, soil and plant traits (50% - 62%, proportion of variance explained by more than one class of variables), rather than their unique contributions. Interestingly, those factors with only minor influences on GPP and RE variability (e.g., soil properties) have significant contributions to the spatial variability in NEE. Such emerging factors and the interactions between climatic variables, soil properties and plant traits are not well represented in current terrestrial biosphere models, which should be considered in future model improvement to accurately predict the spatial pattern of carbon cycling across forests and grasslands globally.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000490841",,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108506","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/490841","en","Elsevier",,,"Carbon||Climatic variables||Net ecosystem exchange||Plant traits||Soil properties||Spatial variability","Relative importance of climatic variables, soil properties and plant traits to spatial variability in net CO2 exchange across global forests and grasslands",,"Journal Article","Embargoed",,,,"2021-06-23T03:13:29Z","2023-06-14",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"ICOS-CH Phase 2","173691","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,"85107968565",,"000682515100024","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","307","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In contrast, dietary polyphenols may have adverse effects on the bioavailability of nutrients and palatability of the feed which might impair growth performance. The beneficial and adverse effects might differ between different ruminant species as well as between direct intake and intake of polyphenol metabolites via suckling when supplemented to lactating dams. This study investigated the effects of maternal and direct polyphenol supplementation via grape seed extract in sheep and goats on growth, slaughter performance, meat quality and fatty acid profile. The diet of lactating East Friesian Dairy sheep (n = 11) and Saanen goats (n = 9) and of their lambs (n = 16) and kids (n = 13), respectively, was supplemented either with grape seed extract (dams: 7.4% and offspring: 5.6%, P) or without (C). This resulted in four groups per species, namely maternalC/offspringC, maternalC/offspringP, maternalP/offspringC, and maternalP/offspringP. In lambs but not in goats, maternalP increased average daily gain and improved slaughter performance whereas offspringP had no effect. Maternal and offspring diet did not affect physicochemical meat quality in lambs, but direct intake of grape seed extract increased rancid aroma of burger patties. In goat kids, both maternal and offspring diets slightly affected meat colour. While groups of meat fatty acids (FAs) were not affected by diet in both species, maternalP in lambs as well as maternalP and offspringP in goat kids increased the meat n–6 to n–3 FA ratio compared to the respective control groups. In goat kid but not in lamb meat, direct intake of polyphenols affected the proportions of several rumen biohydrogenation intermediates. In conclusion, grape seed extract can be applied in both the maternal and offspring diets in sheep and goats while maintaining or even improving offspring growth performance and carcass quality. Only few species-specific effects of grape seed extract supplementation were observed, and additive effects were scarce. Larger studies are required to confirm the observed species-specific growth response to maternalP during lactation. The underlying reasons for this differential response need to be further evaluated.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000500281",,"1751-7311||1751-732X",,"10.1016/j.animal.2021.100333","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500281","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Fatty acid||grape seed extract||Lamb||Longissimus thoracis et lumborum||Sensory analysis","Maternal and direct dietary polyphenol supplementation affect growth, carcass and meat quality of sheep and goats",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-10T08:47:36Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Suitability of phytogenic compounds in the diet of ruminants to improve animal and ecological health","149976","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,,"85112400002",,"000719438000001",,"9","Animal","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A high VPD strictly limits radial stem growth and allows little growth during daylight hours, except in the early morning. Surprisingly, trees also grow in moderately dry soil when the VPD is low. Species-specific differences in diel growth dynamics show that species able to grow earlier during the night are associated with the highest number of hours with growth per year and the largest annual growth increment. - We conclude that species with the ability to overcome daily water deficits faster have greater growth potential. Furthermore, we conclude that growth is more sensitive than carbon uptake to dry air, as growth stops before stomata are known to close.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494401",,"0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.17552","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494401","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","cell turgor threshold||climate change||day-night radial stem growth||dendrometer||ecophysiology||photoperiod||wood and bark formation||xylogenesis","Why trees grow at night",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-14T02:22:56Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"ICOS-CH Phase 2||ICOS-CH: Integrated Carbon Observation System in Switzerland","173691||148992","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,"85109149634",,"000670341300001","New Phytol.","6","New Phytologist","231","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They are often the only form of agriculture that can be practised due to unfavourable climate and soil fertility levels that prevent crop cultivation. Pastoralism can have negative impacts on the environment, including land degradation, greenhouse gas emissions and other gases to the atmosphere, soil erosion, water pollution and biodiversity loss. Here, we review the current knowledge on nitrogen (N) cycling, storage and loss pathways, with an emphasis on identification of N emission hotspots.  Our review reports a large uncertainty in the amount of N lost as ammonia from excreta and manure storage, as well as N losses via nitrate and DON leaching. We also found that another major N loss pathway (18%) ‐ soil N2 emissions ‐ has not yet been measured. In order to summarize the available information, we use a virtual pastoral farm, with characteristics and management practices obtained from a real farm, Kapiti Research Station in Kenya. For outlining N flows at this virtual farm, we used published data, data from global studies, satellite imagery and geographic information system (GIS) tools. Our results show that N inputs in pastoral systems are dominated by atmospheric N deposition (approx. 80 %), while inputs due to biological nitrogen fixation seems to play a smaller role. A major N loss pathway is nitrogen leaching (nitrate > DON) from pastures (33%). Cattle enclosures (bomas), where animals are kept during night, represent N emissions hotspots, representing 16 % of the total N losses from the system. N losses via ammonia volatilization and N2O were four and three orders of magnitude higher from bomas than from the pasture, respectively. Based on our results, we further identify future research requirements and highlight the urgent need for experimental data collection to quantify nitrogen losses from manure in animal congregation areas. Such information is needed to improve our understanding on N cycling in pastoral systems in semi‐arid regions and to provide practical recommendations for managers that can help with decision‐making on management strategies in pastoral systems in semi‐arid savannas.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484334",,"1051-0761||1939-5582",,"10.1002/eap.2368","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484334","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Savanna||Greenhouse gas emissions||Leaching||Ammonia||Pastoralism||Rangelands||Knowledge gaps","Nitrogen cycling in pastoral livestock systems in Sub‐Saharan Africa: knowns and unknowns",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-17T09:06:44Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85107472941",,"000659725000001","Ecol.

In this study, we combine life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology and data envelopment analysis to calculate environmental efficiency scores (i.e., agricultural output divided by environmental impacts) for eight product groups (Milk, Cattle, Pig fattening, Cereals, Beets, Potatoes, Vegetables, Fruits) in Switzerland. First, LCA is used to calculate ""cradle to farm-gate"" environmental impacts. These impacts are then used as inputs in a data envelopment analysis, with the amount of produced agricultural products as outputs. The resulting environmental efficiency scores reflect the relative efficiency (i.e., related to the best-observed performance) of the observed product groups. We find large differences in environmental impacts and environmental efficiency score distribution between the product groups. While we find some variability of environmental efficiency between farming systems (Organic and Proof of Ecological Performance) within a product group (difference in coefficient of variation between farming systems: Fruits = 48%, Vegetables = 13%, Cereals, Potatoes = 8%), we did not find any significant differences in environmental efficiency between organic and integrated farming systems for any of the considered product groups. Furthermore, we did not find a negative effect of multifunctionality of Swiss farms (i.e., multiple simultaneously produced product groups), but found a small positive effect for Milk in the presence of other product groups. However, the high within product group variance of environmental efficiency suggests the potential for improvements (notably >40% for Fruits and >30% for Cattle and Potatoes).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000508923",,"2073-4395",,"10.3390/agronomy11091862","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/508923","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","product groups||life cycle assessment||environmental efficiency||data envelopment analysis||agriculture||product groups","Assessing between and within Product Group Variance of Environmental Efficiency of Swiss Agriculture Using Life Cycle Assessment and Data Envelopment Analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-10T03:14:00Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85116602237",,"000699196000001",,"9","Agronomy","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These microscopic structures regulate the exchange of gases with the atmosphere and are essential for plant survival on land (Raven, 2002). There is an enduring fascination with stomata because of their specialized nature: from their unique development out of undifferentiated epidermal cells; to the environmental and internal signals they respond to; and the impacts their function have on climate and global change. These key themes have been the topic of many classical compendiums and scientific conferences (Jarvis and Mansfield, 1981; Ziegler et al., 1987; Roelfsema and Kollist, 2013). Research in the past two decades has accelerated our understanding of stomatal function, particularly through the accumulation of a critical mass of knowledge on the genetic underpinnings of stomatal development and physiology in the model angiosperm Arabidopsis (Assmann and Jegla, 2016; Qi and Torii, 2018). In this Frontiers eBook, we sought to bring together the latest research and reviews on stomatal biology that span a vast continuum: from cells to ecosystems. The articles were solicited with four key themes in mind: (1) The coordination of stomatal development with plant growth, development, and environmental signaling; (2) The role of stomatal development in plant acclimation and adaptation to the environment; (3) The influence of stomatal development and function on plant resource use, ecosystem processes, and global climate; and (4) The selection for stomatal traits in plant evolution, crop domestication and breeding, and designing food for the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000510754",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2021.743964","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510754","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","stomata/guard cells||gas exchange","Editorial: Linking Stomatal Development and Physiology: From Stomatal Models to Non-model Species and Crops",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-20T09:34:12Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85117110328",,"000710467900001","Front.

Cattle are more susceptible to drought than camels and rely on grass, while camels are primarily browsers. Diet selection can influence the quality of the milk, especially of the milk fat. Little is known about differences in milk fatty acid profile of camels compared to cattle, especially under free-grazing conditions. Camels and two cattle types were compared on Kenyan rangelands in a rainy season and a transition period. Seventy-two lactating animals (12 per animal type per season each) were used. Half of each group received a urea-molasses supplement at night. Intakes of nutrients and phenols were estimated through scan sampling. Milk was collected at the end of each season and analyzed for phenols and fatty acids. Phenol intakes varied between seasons in cattle but not in camels. Different from animal type, season had an effect on milk phenol concentration. Phenol excretion with the milk of cattle correlated with phenol intake. Proportions of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids were higher in camel milk than cattle milk. Cattle milk contained more conjugated linoleic acids than camel milk in the rainy season. Proportions of oleic, linoleic, α-linolenic and eicosapentaenoic acid were higher, whereas n-6-to-n-3 fatty acid ratio was lower in camel milk than cattle milk. Camels may have developed control mechanisms limiting adverse effects and transfer of phenols to milk in response to their higher intake of phenol-rich browse. In conclusion, camel milk seems to be more beneficial for human health and nutrition than cattle milk by its characteristic fatty acid profile. This can be another motivation for switching from cattle to camels in arid/semi-arid areas affected by climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505483",,,,"10.1016/j.sciaf.2021.e00896","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505483","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Animal species||Fatty acid||Season||Rangeland||Supplementation","Camels and cattle respond differently in milk phenol excretion and milk fatty acid profile to free ranging conditions in East-African rangelands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-14T09:14:20Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Camel versus cattle – the role of plant secondary compounds in forages on plant selection and microbial and physicochemical milk quality","152966","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,,"85115996270",,"000704939100007",,,"Scientific African","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

One suspected mechanism behind this is a higher infiltration capacity (νB) and hydraulic conductivity (K) of the soil on species-rich grasslands. However, in established and agriculturally managed grasslands, biodiversity effects cannot be studied independent of land-use effects. Therefore, we investigated in established grassland systems how land-use intensity and associated biodiversity of plants and soil animals affect νB and K at and close to saturation. On 50 grassland plots along a land-use intensity gradient in the Biodiversity Exploratory Schwäbische Alb, Germany, we measured νB with a hood infiltrometer at several matrix potentials and calculated the saturated and unsaturated K. We statistically analysed the relationship between νB or K and land-use information (e.g., fertilising intensity), abiotic (e.g., soil texture) and biotic data (e.g., plant species richness, earthworm abundance). Land-use intensity decreased and plant species richness increased νB and K, while the direction of the effects of soil animals was inconsistent. The effect of land-use intensity on νB and K was mainly attributable to its negative effect on plant species richness. Our results demonstrate that plant species richness was a better predictor of νB and K at and close to saturation than land-use intensity or soil physical properties in the established grassland systems of the Schwäbische Alb.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494779",,"1936-0592||1936-0584",,"10.1002/eco.2301","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494779","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Biodiversity Exploratories||land use||plant diversity||ROSETTA||soil animals","Land-use intensity and biodiversity effects on infiltration capacity and hydraulic conductivity of grassland soils in southern Germany",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T10:20:12Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"When trees die: Understanding how plants and microbes interact and influence soil biogeochemical processes","180030","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,"85107979728",,"000661851600001",,"6","Ecohydrology","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Xylem vulnerability to cavitation of both species was estimated by measuring the pressure inducing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (P50), while the water stress plants experienced in the field was assessed using native percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity (nPLC). Pea and barley showed contrasting hydraulic behaviours: pea was less vulnerable to xylem cavitation and less stressed than barley; cropping systems affected xylem vulnerability of barley, but not of pea. Barley grown under conventional farming with no tillage was more vulnerable and stressed than under organic farming with intensive tillage. nPLC proved to be a valuable indicator for plant water stress. Our results highlight the impact of cropping systems on crop xylem vulnerability and drought resistance, thus plant hydraulic traits, for protecting food security under future climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478138",,"0140-7791||1365-3040",,"10.1111/pce.14054","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478138","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Cavitation||Conservation tillage||Organic farming||Xylen vulnerability","Cropping Systems Alter Hydraulic Traits of Barley but not Pea Grown in Mixture",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-11T09:21:40Z","2022-03-24",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85110682184",,"000754990900007","Plant cell environ.","9","Plant, Cell & Environment","44","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We assessed the impact of faidherbia (Faidherbia albida, Fabaceae) and mango (Mangifera indica, Anacardiaceae) trees on AMF and soil fertility in smallholder farmers’ maize fields. Along distance-from-tree gradients (1, 4, 10, 15 m), we collected soil to assess AMF hyphal density, soil aggregation, and aggregate-associated carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) at the end of the non-cropping season. Further, we determined maize biomass and yield. The impact of faidherbia on maize N nutrition was assessed using the 15N natural abundance methodology. Our results show that hyphal density was largest at 4 and 10 m from trees and greater around faidherbia than mango. Soil aggregation decreased with distance from mango and was greater around faidherbia than mango. Macroaggregate-associated C, N, and P decreased with distance-from-tree, due to differences in aggregate distribution. Maize biomass was smallest at 1 m from trees and did not differ when under faidherbia versus mango. On average 69 ± 14, 24 ± 9, 20 ± 6, and 12 ± 5% of total foliar N of maize grown at 1, 4, 10, and 15 m from faidherbia trees was tree-derived. Our results suggest that faidherbia and mango trees can maintain AMF mycelia and combat declining soil fertility. Faidherbia is particularly suited to enhance measured soil parameters commonly associated with soil fertility and alleviate soil mining for N via improved internal N cycling. As such, agroforestry trees can contribute to a more sustainable agriculture positively affecting the environment via mitigating soil degradation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493928",,"0167-8809||1873-2305",,"10.1016/j.agee.2021.107487","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493928","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Faidherbia albida||Mangifera indica||Soil carbon||Nutrient retention||Nitrogen cycling||Subsistence farming","Trees enhance abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, soil structure, and nutrient retention in low-input maize cropping systems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-12T04:59:18Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Trees for the enhancement of mycorrhizal functioning in low-input cropping systems","163460","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85110454352",,"000662680300006","Agric. ecosyst. environ.",,"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","318","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this review, focusing on core plant functions in the terrestrial carbon and water cycles, we show how unifying hypotheses derived from eco-evolutionary optimality (EEO) principles can provide novel, parameter-sparse representations of plant and vegetation processes. We present case studies that demonstrate how EEO generates parsimonious representations of core, leaf-level processes that are individually testable and supported by evidence. EEO approaches to photosynthesis and primary production, dark respiration and stomatal behaviour are ripe for implementation in global models.

This nexus of population growth and ecological impact will continue to exacerbate landscape degradation in the coming decades. To quantify the effects of land-use intensity on soil nutrient stocks and the functional composition of young regrowth forest in the Congo Basin, we used fallows of different ages that had been subjected to a varying number of clearing cycles. We show that repeated clearing substantially affected soil cation stocks, reducing total K, Mg and Ca in the upper 20 cm of soil by roughly 20% per clearing cycle. Additionally, we show that plant-available nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate) and phosphorus decline in the topsoil with increasing land-use intensity. Furthermore, the tree functional composition of young fallows changed after repeated clearing cycles: we observed a decrease in abundance of pioneer species and an increase in nitrogen fixing species early in succession. Variation in soil total nutrient stocks was decoupled from changes in vegetation, and soil plant-available nutrients only marginally explained tree functional composition changes. We conclude that land-use intensity substantially affects both soil total and plant-available nutrients in a shifting cultivation system, as well as the functional composition of the regenerating vegetation. However, compositional changes of the tree community are only partly driven by land-use intensity effects on soil plant-available nutrients.",,,,"1432-9840||1435-0629","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468473||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526248","10.1007/s10021-020-00593-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539038","en","Springer",,,"Secondary forests||Forest recovery||Congo basin||Slash-and-burn||Shifting agriculture||Swidden agriculture||Tropical forest","Soil Nutrient Depletion and Tree Functional Composition Shift Following Repeated Clearing in Secondary Forests of the Congo Basin",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-02-09T07:57:48Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099906938",,"000612608500008",,"6","Ecosystems","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Root anatomy plays key roles in soil resource acquisition. In this article we summarize evidence that root anatomical phenotypes present opportunities for crop breeding. Scope Root anatomical phenotypes influence soil resource acquisition by regulating the metabolic cost of soil exploration, exploitation of the rhizosphere, the penetration of hard soil domains, the axial and radial transport of water, and interactions with soil biota including mycorrhizal fungi, pathogens, insects, and the rhizosphere microbiome. For each of these topics we provide examples of anatomical phenotypes which merit attention as selection targets for crop improvement. Several cross-cutting issues are addressed including the importance of phenotypic plasticity, integrated phenotypes, C sequestration, in silico modeling, and novel methods to phenotype root anatomy including image analysis tools. Conclusions An array of anatomical phenes have substantial importance for the acquisition of water and nutrients. Substantial phenotypic variation exists in crop germplasm. New tools and methods are making it easier to phenotype root anatomy, determine its genetic control, and understand its utility for plant fitness. Root anatomical phenotypes are underutilized yet attractive breeding targets for the development of the efficient, resilient crops urgently needed in global agriculture.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000497409",,"0032-079X||1573-5036",,"10.1007/s11104-021-05010-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/497409","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Root||Anatomy||Water||Nutrients||Transport||Insects||Pathogens||Mycorrhiza||Carbon sequestration||Modeling||Image analysis||Plasticity","Root anatomy and soil resource capture",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-24T02:34:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"INTERACTIONS OF ROOT PHENOTYPES AND ROOT-MICROBIOME IN MAIZE UNDER NITROGEN","839235","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85109362566",,"000670727500002","Plant Soil","1","Plant and Soil","466","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we present data on the response of soil microbial diversity to a single compaction event and its temporal evolution under different agricultural management systems during four growing seasons. Crop yield was reduced (up to −90%) in the first two seasons after compaction, but mostly recovered in subsequent seasons. Soil compaction increased soil bulk density (+15%), and decreased air permeability (−94%) and gas diffusion (−59%), and those properties did not fully recover within four growing seasons. Soil compaction induced cropping system-dependent shifts in microbial community structures with little resilience over the four growing seasons. Microbial taxa sensitive to soil compaction were detected in all major phyla. Overall, anaerobic prokaryotes and saprotrophic fungi increased in compacted soils, whereas aerobic prokaryotes and plant-associated fungi were mostly negatively affected. Most measured properties showed large spatial variability across the replicated blocks, demonstrating the dependence of compaction effects on initial conditions.

To reduce the environmental pressure from agriculture, sustainable practices are urgently in need of evaluation and implementation. In croplands, organic farming and conservation tillage can reduce energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and pollutant production as well as increase carbon sequestration, hence are considered more environmental-friendly and sustainable than conventional farming and intensive tillage. Moreover, organic farming and conservation tillage are shown to improve soil health such as physical structure, chemical conditions, and microbial functionalities. Therefore, these practices are also recommended as beneficial to mitigate climate change effects, such as crop drought stress. However, if organic farming and conservation tillage are truly climate-smart adaptations for cropping systems is still to be tested in different climate conditions.  Extreme weathers, increasing in frequency and severity due to climate change, are posing extra challenges on food security in addition to the growing population. Drought as a top threat causes intense damage in agroecosystems, especially in rainfed agriculture. Crop water relations are highly responsive to drought stress, and directly linked to growth and productivity. Therefore, understanding crop water relations in response to drought can provide insights on assessing cropping systems for future climate.  As introduced in Chapter 1, this thesis aims to bring insights on the effects of cropping systems and drought on plant water relations along the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. This includes root water uptake patterns, stem xylem vulnerability and anatomy, leaf water status and physiological processes, phenology, growth, and yield. Combining different management practices, four cropping systems are studied: conventional intensive tillage, conventional no-tillage, organic intensive tillage, and organic reduced tillage. Simulated drought periods with portable shelters were carried out in Swiss rainfed cropland under temperate climate. During the 2018 growing season pea-barley mixture, an important fodder crop, was studied. Winter wheat, a globally important food source, was studied during 2019.   Root water uptake depths of crops provide important information on drought response and therefore may provide insight based on differential outcomes in cropping systems under drought. The foci in Chapter 2 are on root water uptake patterns of pea and barley grown in a mixture under the targeted cropping systems and different water availabilities. The water uptake patterns of winter wheat are included in Chapter 4. Stable water isotopes were used to estimate the water uptake patterns of these three species with a Bayesian framework. In all cropping systems, when subjected to the experimental drought, both pea and barley shifted their water uptake patterns to shallower depths without niche differentiation, whereas winter wheat went for deeper water uptake. Moreover, due to the natural drought period in summer 2018, we also observed responses of pea and barley to this more moderate drought compared to our treatment, where only barley shifted up in water uptake depths, but pea did not.  Plant hydraulics greatly determines water transport, and it is shown to be affected by environments including soil conditions. The hydraulic traits of pea and barley in response to cropping systems as well as their links to growth and productivity are presented in Chapter 3. Xylem vulnerability to cavitation of both species was evaluated with the cavitron technique, and percentage loss of conductivity derived with xylem water potential in situ was used to assess the drought stress of these two species. Once again, different species showed inconsistent responses. Although grown in a mixture, cropping systems only affected the hydraulic traits of barley but not pea.  Crop growth and productivity are shaped by various physiological processes with great complexities among regulation and compensation responses. Integrating crop traits along the entire continuum into a trait space helps to draw a clear picture on changes responding to the environment and managements. Winter wheat traits about crop water relations are presented in Chapter 4. In the trait space, cropping systems only changed growth trait space, which differed between organic and conventional systems but not between conversation and intensive tillage systems. Meanwhile, the drought treatment dominated water trait space, irrelevant to cropping systems.  Other than the traits investigated on individual plant, visual changes in crop phenology can also help reveal cropping system effects. PhenoCams were used to track phenology of pea-barley mixture and winter wheat. Crop phenology was not affected by cropping systems for pea-barley mixture, but for winter wheat, showing differences consistent with the trait space (i.e., differed between organic and conventional systems). Because I contributed to data collection and analysis as well as revising the manuscript, this work is included in the Appendix. Our results show that cropping systems can affect certain hydraulic, physiological, and growth traits, as well as phenology of crops, which could link to yield traits. However, the responses and outcomes largely depend on species. These results emphasise that using different cropping systems to alleviate drought stress for plants might not be as effective as previously assumed, at least in temperate areas, hence compromising the expectation to counteract or compensate the aggravating drought threats under the changing climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504901",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504901","en","ETH Zurich",,,"Organic farming||Conservation tillage||Drought||Plant traits||Stable water isotopes||Pea||Barley||barley||Winter wheat||Water uptake depth","Plant Water Relations in Response to Drought and Different Cropping Systems",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences",,"2021-09-09T09:43:49Z","2023-09-08",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27780",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the consequences of land conversion on biogeochemical cycles are still largely unknown as they are not studied in a landscape context that defines the geomorphic, geochemical, and pedological framework in which biological processes take place. Thus, the response of tropical soils to disturbance by erosion and land conversion is one of the great uncertainties in assessing the carrying capacity of tropical landscapes to grow food for future generations and in predicting greenhouse gas fluxes from soils to the atmosphere and, hence, future earth system dynamics.  Here we describe version 1.0 of an open-access database created as part of the project “Tropical soil organic carbon dynamics along erosional disturbance gradients in relation to variability in soil geochemistry and land use” (TropSOC). TropSOC v1.0 (Doetterl et al., 2021, https://doi.org/10.5880/fidgeo.2021.009) contains spatially and temporally explicit data on soil, vegetation, environmental properties, and land management collected from 136 pristine tropical forest and cropland plots between 2017 and 2020 as part of monitoring and sampling campaigns in the eastern Congo Basin and the East African Rift Valley system. The results of several laboratory experiments focusing on soil microbial activity, C cycling, and C stabilization in soils complement the dataset to deliver one of the first landscape-scale datasets to study the linkages and feedbacks between geology, geomorphology, and pedogenesis as controls on biogeochemical cycles in a variety of natural and managed systems in the African Tropics.  The hierarchical and interdisciplinary structure of the TropSOC database allows linking of a wide range of parameters and observations on soil and vegetation dynamics along with other supporting information that may also be measured at one or more levels of the hierarchy. TropSOC's data mark a significant contribution to improve our understanding of the fate of biogeochemical cycles in dynamic and diverse tropical African (agro-)ecosystems.

The Swiss Plateau experiences many days with FLS in winter. Most NWP models employ terrain-following vertical coordinates. As a consequence, the typically flat cloud top is intersected by sloping coordinate surfaces above hilly terrain such as the Swiss Plateau. Horizontal advection across the sloping coordinate surfaces leads to spurious numerical diffusion which promotes erroneous FLS dissipation. To address this problem, we propose a new vertical coordinate formulation which features a local smoothing of the model levels. We demonstrate the positive impact of the new vertical coordinate formulation on a case study in detail and for a full month using the COSMO model. The improved vertical coordinate formulation is not yet sufficient to obtain perfect FLS forecasts, it is however a crucial aspect to consider on the way thereto.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504062",,"1942-2466","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/513455||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504062","10.1029/2020MS002437","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/513473","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"A Locally Smoothed Terrain-Following Vertical Coordinate to Improve the Simulation of Fog and Low Stratus in Numerical Weather Prediction Models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-04T17:00:31Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Towards an operational fog forecasting system (Fog4Cast)","ETH-17 16-2","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,"85113354488",,"000688471600010",,"8","Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, agricultural systems are usually evaluated on their productivity and economic performance, and a systematic and quantitative assessment of the multifunctionality of agroecosystems including environmental services is missing. Using a long-term farming system experiment, we evaluated and compared the agronomic, economic, and ecological performance of the most widespread arable cropping systems in Europe: organic, conservation, and conventional agriculture. We analyzed 43 agroecosystem properties and determined overall agroecosystem multifunctionality. We show that organic and conservation agriculture promoted ecosystem multifunctionality, especially by enhancing regulating and supporting services, including biodiversity preservation, soil and water quality, and climate mitigation. In contrast, conventional cropping showed reduced multifunctionality but delivered highest yield. Organic production resulted in higher economic performance, thanks to higher product prices and additional support payments. Our results demonstrate that different cropping systems provide opposing services, enforcing the productivity-environmental protection dilemma for agroecosystem functioning.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000503125",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.abg6995","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/503125","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Organic and conservation agriculture promote ecosystem multifunctionality",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-31T02:40:00Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113354692",,"000689732700012","Sci Adv","34","Science Advances","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For this purpose, we developed a national Swiss soil spectral library (SSL; n = 4374) in the mid-infrared (mid-IR), calibrating 16 properties from legacy measurements on soils from the Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring program (BDM; n = 3778; 1094 sites) and the Swiss long-term Soil Monitoring Network (NABO; n = 596; 71 sites). General models were trained with the interpretable rule-based learner CUBIST, testing combinations of {5, 10, 20, 50, and 100} ensembles of rules (committees) and {2, 5, 7, and 9} nearest neighbors used for local averaging with repeated 10-fold cross-validation grouped by location. To evaluate the information in spectra to facilitate long-term soil monitoring at a plot level, we conducted 71 model transfers for the NABO sites to induce locally relevant information from the SSL, using the data-driven sample selection method RS - LOCAL. In total, 10 soil properties were estimated with discrimination capacity suitable for screening (R-2 >= 0.72; ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) >= 2.0), out of which total carbon (C), organic C (OC), total nitrogen (N), pH and clay showed accuracy eligible for accurate diagnostics (R-2 > 0.8; RPIQ >= 3.0). CUBIST and the spectra estimated total C accurately with the root mean square error (RMSE) = 8.4 g kg(-1) and the RPIQ = 4.3, while the measured range was 1-583 g kg(-1) and OC with RMSE = 9.3 g kg(-1) and RPIQ = 3.4 (measured range 0-583 g kg(-1)). Compared to the general statistical learning approach, the local transfer approach - using two respective training samples - on average reduced the RMSE of total C per site fourfold. We found that the selected SSL subsets were highly dissimilar compared to validation samples, in terms of both their spectral input space and the measured values. This suggests that data-driven selection with RS - LOCAL leverages chemical diversity in composition rather than similarity. Our results suggest that mid-IR soil estimates were sufficiently accurate to support many soil applications that require a large volume of input data, such as precision agriculture, soil C accounting and monitoring and digital soil mapping. This SSL can be updated continuously, for example, with samples from deeper profiles and organic soils, so that the measurement of key soil properties becomes even more accurate and efficient in the near future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000503124",,"2199-3971||2199-398X",,"10.5194/soil-7-525-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/503124","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Developing the Swiss mid-infrared soil spectral library for local estimation and monitoring",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-31T02:40:00Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113783885",,"000687057900001",,"2","Soil","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that elicitors of plant defenses interact with pathogen infection to influence crop resistance against vector and nonvector herbivores. To do so, we employed a trophic system comprising of cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon), the phytoplasma that causes false blossom disease, and two herbivores-the blunt-nosed leafhopper (Limotettix vaccinii), the vector of false blossom disease, and the nonvector gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). We tested four commercial elicitors, including three that activate mainly SA-related plant defenses (Actigard, LifeGard, and Regalia) and one activator of JA-related defenses (Blush). A greenhouse experiment in which phytoplasma-infected and uninfected plants received repeated exposure to elicitors revealed that both phytoplasma infection and elicitor treatment individually improved L. vaccinii and L. dispar mass compared to uninfected, untreated controls; however, SA-based elicitor treatments reduced L. vaccinii mass on infected plants. Regalia also improved L. vaccinii survival. Phytoplasma infection reduced plant size and mass, increased levels of nitrogen (N) and SA, and lowered carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios compared to uninfected plants, irrespective of elicitor treatment. Although none of our elicitor treatments influenced transcript levels of a phytoplasma-specific marker gene, all of them increased N and reduced C/N levels; the three SA activators also reduced JA levels. Taken together, our findings reveal positive effects of both phytoplasma infection and elicitor treatment on the performance of L. vaccinii and L. dispar in cranberries, likely via enhancement of plant nutrition and changes in phytohormone profiles, specifically increases in SA levels and corresponding decreases in levels of JA. Thus, we found no evidence that the tested elicitors of plant defenses increase resistance to insect herbivores or reduce disease incidence in cranberries.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000502092",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2021.700242","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502092","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","false blossom disease||blunt-nosed leafhoppers||gypsy moth||carbon/nitrogen ratios||phytohormones||plant-phytoplasma-herbivore interactions","Application of Plant Defense Elicitors Fails to Enhance Herbivore Resistance or Mitigate Phytoplasma Infection in Cranberries",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-25T02:41:40Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113462590",,"000684955500006","Front.

Here, we used an artificial miRNA-based system (amiRSUL) in Arabidopsis thaliana to explore the still elusive mechanisms of inter-cellular miRNA movement via forward genetics. This screen identified many mutant alleles of HASTY (HST), the ortholog of mammalian EXPORTIN5 (XPO5) with a recently reported role in miRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis. In both epidermis-peeling and grafting assays, amiRSUL levels were reduced much more substantially in miRNA-recipient tissues than in silencing-emitting tissues. We ascribe this effect to HST controlling cell-to-cell and phloem-mediated movement of the processed amiRSUL, in addition to regulating its biogenesis. While HST is not required for the movement of free GFP or siRNAs, its cell-autonomous expression in amiRSUL-emitting tissues suffices to restore amiRSUL movement independently of its nucleo-cytosolic shuttling activity. By contrast, HST is dispensable for the movement and activity of amiRSUL within recipient tissues. Finally, HST enables movement of endogenous miRNAs that display mostly unaltered steady-state levels in hst mutant tissues. We discuss a role for HST as a hitherto unrecognized regulator of miRNA movement in relation to its recently assigned nuclear function at the nexus of MIRNA transcription and miRNA processing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000491626",,"0261-4189||1460-2075",,"10.15252/embj.2020107455","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491626","en","EMBO Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Arabidopsis||Argonaute||HASTY||miRNA||Movement","HASTY, the Arabidopsis EXPORTIN5 ortholog, regulates cell-to-cell and vascular microRNA movement",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-28T07:25:00Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"High resolution and chemical genetic approaches to RNA silencing mechanisms","323071","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,"85108351158",,"000663866800001","EMBO J","15","The EMBO Journal","40","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02030 - Dep.

Many performance indicators have been proposed to track and measure the increase in productivity while minimizing environmental degradation. However, their use has lagged behind theory, and has not been uniform across crops in different geographies. The consequence is an uneven understanding of opportunities for sustainable intensification. Simple but robust key performance indicators (KPIs) are needed to standardize knowledge across crops and geographies. This paper defines a new term ‘agronomic gain’ based on an improvement in KPIs, including productivity, resource use efficiencies, and soil health that a specific single or combination of agronomic practices delivers under certain environmental conditions. We apply the concept of agronomic gain to the different stages of science-based agronomic innovations and provide a description of different approaches used to assess agronomic gain including yield gap assessment, meta-data analysis, on-station and on-farm studies, impact assessment, panel studies, and use of subnational and national statistics for assessing KPIs at different stages. We mainly focus on studies on rice in sub-Saharan Africa, where large yield gaps exist. Rice is one of the most important staple food crops and plays an essential role in food security in this region. Our analysis identifies major challenges in the assessment of agronomic gain, including differentiating agronomic gain from genetic gain, unreliable in-person interviews, and assessment of some KPIs at a larger scale. To overcome these challenges, we suggest to (i) conduct multi-environment trials for assessing variety × agronomic practice × environment interaction on KPIs, and (ii) develop novel approaches for assessing KPIs, through development of indirect methods using remote-sensing technology, mobile devices for systematized site characterization, and establishment of empirical relationships among KPIs or between agronomic practices and KPIs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493867",,"0378-4290||1872-6852",,"10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108193","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493867","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Oryza spp||Agronomy||Productivity||Sustainability","Agronomic gain: Definition, approach, and application",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-10T05:24:52Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85109029890",,"000675892800003","Field crops res.",,"Field Crops Research","270","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Thereby, the root growth zone repeatedly experiences soil physical stress such as hypoxia or increased penetration resistance. To mimic the highly variable physical environment surrounding the root growth zone, we subjected pea and wheat seedlings to periodic soil physical stress. One day of soil hypoxia or increased penetration resistance reduced root elongation rate of both species by at least 20 %. Upon stress release, root elongation rate of pea could recover within one day, while no such recovery occurred in wheat. Similarly, the diameter of the root elongation zone in pea increased by 15 % and 20 % due to hypoxia and increased penetration resistance, respectively, but decreased again once the stresses were released. In contrast, the diameter of the elongation zone of wheat roots started to decrease with the onset of soil physical stress and this trend continued upon stress release. Hence, root responses to short-term soil physical stress were reversible in pea and irreversible in wheat, indicating reversible and irreversible root phenotypic plasticity, respectively. This suggests that strategies to cope with periodic soil physical stress may vary among species. The differentiation between reversible and irreversible phenotypic plasticity is crucial to advance our understanding on soil exploration, resource acquisition, whole plant growth, and ultimately crop yield formation on structured soil.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492825",,"0098-8472||1873-7307",,"10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.104494","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492825","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Phenotypic plasticity||Root growth||Root phenomics||Soil heterogeneity||Soil hypoxia||Soil penetration resistance","Reversible and irreversible root phenotypic plasticity under fluctuating soil physical conditions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-03T00:43:39Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85121422503",,"000662571100001","Environ.

Land-use intensification has caused dramatic declines in grassland biodiversity, and in Europe this decline has not yet been halted. Therefore, a major challenge in ecological restoration is to effectively restore plant diversity in permanent grasslands, that is, long-term managed grassland not being used as cropland. As species richness is often limited by seed dispersal, introducing locally absent species is crucial. Seeding diverse seed mixtures is an appropriate tool, but restoration outcomes are highly variable. Considering constraints by land-use intensity and plant functional traits during restoration could improve the efficacy of restoration efforts.  2.	We established a full-factorial experiment with high-diversity seeding and topsoil disturbance in 73 grasslands along land-use intensity and productivity gradients and evaluated the restoration success over 5 years. In addition, after 5 years we assessed the number of established species and tested whether specific traits promoted the establishment of sown species in interaction with productivity.  3.	Plant diversity increased considerably when seeding and disturbance were combined while seeding alone only slightly increased species richness. Along land-use gradients, we found no direct effects of grazing or mowing on the establishment of sown species, but fertilization indirectly limited establishment in the combined treatment via a negative effect of productivity.  4.	Functional traits structured the establishment of sown species, especially in the combined treatments, but effects varied with productivity. Species with low seed mass and low specific leaf area had greater establishment success in low-productivity grasslands, whereas species with high seed mass had greater establishment in high-productivity grasslands.  5.	Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the potential of using diverse seed mixtures for biodiversity restoration in a wide range of permanent grasslands, especially when combined with topsoil disturbance. However, productivity both limited restoration success and affected establishment via an interaction with plant functional traits. As productivity is a major constraint in grassland restoration, we strongly recommend to first stop fertilization and reduce soil nutrient loads in highly productive grasslands. Restoration by seeding, with or without disturbance, should only be applied when productivity is reduced and the local environment should be considered to compile site-specific seed mixtures to maximize restoration success.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000479369",,"0021-8901||1365-2664",,"10.1111/1365-2664.13883","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/479369","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Dispersal limitation||Fertilization||Functional traits||Land-use intensity||Productivity||Seed addition||Seedling establishment||Trait-environment interactions","Restoration of plant diversity in permanent grassland by seeding: assessing the limiting factors along land‐use gradients",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-19T14:08:30Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85108105875",,"000662163000001","J.

Despite its rich biodiversity and proximity to the geographical origins of Sus scrofa domesticus, the place of Indian pigs in the global phylogeny is unclear. Using microarray-derived (porcine 60K SNP chip) genotypes of 11 Ghurrah pigs from North-Western India and a public dataset comprising 2113 pigs of 146 breeds, we determined the genomic ancestry of Ghurrah pigs and compared their genetic constitution to European and Asian breeds to ascertain signatures of divergent selection. Results showed that Ghurrah pigs contain genes of Asian and European ancestry with signs of inter-species introgression. Using Admixture LD – decay statistics, the European admixture event was dated to the recent past, coinciding with the start of cross-breeding efforts in India. The complex Asian ancestry pattern of the breed resembled that of wild boars of South – Central China and Thailand, possibly suggesting introgression from an Indian wild boar relative. Signatures of selection analysis showed the divergence of Ghurrah pigs from Asian and European breeds in genomic regions associated with odontogenesis, and nervous system processess, respectively. Our results present the first genomic characterization of an Indian pig breed using dense microarray-derived genotypes and highlight the importance of further genomic characterization of Indian domestic and wild pigs.

However, the importance of facilitation by shrubs in maintaining plant community diversity is not well evaluated in the Himalayas, especially for the richness and conservation of medicinal and human-valued species. Therefore, we aimed to explore the facilitative role of a dwarf shrub species, Berberis angulosa, in maintaining plant composition and richness of human-valued species in the Langtang valley of Nepal's Himalayas. We censused plant species in open patches and beneath Berberis during monsoon and post-monsoon (dry) seasons at three elevations. Total species richness and richness of human-valued species were significantly higher inside the Berberis canopy than in gaps; the former being 39% and the latter 46% greater under shrubs than in open sites. Facilitation by Berberis shrubs promoted plant community diversity irrespective of season and elevation; however, higher differences in mean species richness for both total plant species and human-valued species during the dry season and at high elevation indicated increased facilitation intensity under more stressful conditions. The facilitative effect of Berberis shrubs increased, combining both seasons, overall plant diversity by 19% (total=105), and human-valued species by 16% (total=56). Our results show the importance of facilitation by nurse shrubs in structuring plant communities and protecting medicinal and socio-ecologically important plants, thus enriching ecosystem services in the Himalayas.

In this study, the genomes of T1190 and its non-transgenic wild-type PinS (F1-offspring of ‘Pinova’ and ‘Idared’) were sequenced by Illumina short-read sequencing in two separate experiments resulting in a mean sequencing depth of 182× for T1190 and 167× for PinS. The sequencing revealed 8,450 reads, which contain sequences of ≥20 bp identical to the plant transformation vector. These reads were assembled into 125 contigs, which were examined to see whether they contained transgenic insertions or if they are not using a five-step procedure. The sequence of one contig represents the known T-DNA insertion on chromosome 4 of T1190. The sequences of the remaining contigs were either equally present in T1190 and PinS, their part with sequence identity to the vector was equally present in apple reference genomes, or they seem to result from endophytic contaminations rather than from additional transgenic insertions. Therefore, we conclude that the transgenic apple plant T1190 contains only one transgenic insertion, located on chromosome 4, and shows no further partial insertions of the transformation vector.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000501139",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2021.715737","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/501139","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Malus×domestica (Borkh)||fast breeding||BpMADS4||juvenility||null segregant||new plant breeding techniques||whole genome sequencing","No Evidence of Unexpected Transgenic Insertions in T1190 – A Transgenic Apple Used in Rapid Cycle Breeding – Following Whole Genome Sequencing",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-17T08:21:39Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113554740",,"000685052000001","Front.

More accurate basecalls or longer reads could address this issue, but no current sequencing platform can provide both simultaneously. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is an example of an important species for which the lack of a reference genome assembly hindered a swift adoption of genomics-based methods into breeding programs. To fill this gap, we optimized the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing protocol, obtaining sequencing reads with a N50 of 62 kb—an unprecedented value for a plant sample. The assembly of such reads produced a highly complete (2.3 of 2.7 Gb), correct (QV 45), and contiguous (contig N50 and N90 11.74 and 3.34 Mb, respectively) genome assembly. We show how read length was key in determining the assembly contiguity. Sequence annotation revealed the dominance of transposable elements and repeated sequences (81.6% of the assembly) and identified 38,868 protein coding genes. Almost 90% of the bases could be anchored to seven pseudomolecules, providing the first high quality haploid reference assembly for perennial ryegrass. This protocol will enable producing longer Oxford Nanopore Technology reads for more plant samples and ushering forage grasses into modern genomics-assisted breeding programs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000499144",,"1759-6653",,"10.1093/gbe/evab159","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499144","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Lolium perenne||Forage grasses||Perennial ryegrass||Genomics||Genome assembly||Oxford Nanopore","Ultralong Oxford Nanopore reads enable the development of a reference-grade perennial ryegrass genome assembly",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-03T08:41:43Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85114386398",,"000690274300023","Genome Biol Evol","8","Genome Biology and Evolution","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Newly established hybrids often experience massive genomic perturbations, including karyotype reshuffling and gene expression modifications. These phenomena may be asymmetric with respect to the two progenitors, with one of the parental genomes being ‘dominant’. Such ‘genome dominance’ can manifest in several ways, including biased homoeolog gene expression and expression level dominance. Here we employed a k-mer based approach to study gene expression in reciprocal Festuca pratensis Huds. × Lolium multiflorum Lam. allopolyploid grasses. Our study revealed significantly more genes where expression mimicked that of the Lolium parent compared to the Festuca parent. This genome dominance was heritable to successive generation and its direction was only slightly modified by environmental conditions and plant age. Our results suggest that Lolium genome dominance was at least partially caused by its more efficient trans-acting gene expression regulatory factors. Unraveling the mechanisms responsible for propagation of parent-specific traits in hybrid crops contributes to our understanding of allopolyploid genome evolution and opens a way to targeted breeding strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000498377",,"0960-7412||1365-313X",,"10.1111/tpj.15375","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/498377","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Gene expression||allopolyploidy||interspecific hybrids||cis/trans regulation||genome dominance||homoeology","Reciprocal allopolyploid grasses (Festuca × Lolium) display stable patterns of genome dominance",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-29T11:05:24Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85111738975",,"000681215000001","Plant j.","4","The Plant Journal","107","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To study the impact of nets on pollen flow in an experimental field site in Switzerland, non-GM apple varieties ‘Ladina’ and ’Nicogreen’ were planted inside and outside a netted plot, respectively. Seeds harvested from mature fruits were germinated and the paternal variety of the seedlings was determined using simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers. We demonstrate that pollination frequency from trees inside the netted plot to trees outside over a two-year (2018 and 2019) study of 4500 seedlings is 0.6% (26 seedlings). Moreover, these outcrossing events decreased with increasing distance from the pollen donor. Over the study period, we found on average 0.9%, 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.09% of the seedlings derived from apples of ‘Nicogreen’ trees at 8 m, 15 m, 72 m and 117 m being generated by fertilisations of ‘Ladina’ pollen, respectively. In comparison, 48.3% (2018 season) and 75.1% (2019 season) of examined ‘Ladina’ seedlings in the netted plot originated from ‘Nicogreen’ tree pollen outside the netted plot. The results suggest that insect netting is effective in minimizing egress of apple pollen from an experimental site and that the likelihood of outcrossing is reduced further (<0.1%) when there are no compatible apple trees within a radius of 100 m of the pollen donor. These data are important for biosafety research/regulation to aid understanding of pollen flow in experimental field sites.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000503321",,"2073-4395",,"10.3390/agronomy11091754","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/503321","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","outcrossing||Malus × domestica||genetically modified||field trial||pollen flow||biosafety regulation","Low Outcrossing from an Apple Field Trial Protected with Nets",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-31T14:38:03Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85114692327",,"000699293200001",,"9","Agronomy","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, all LUE models assume a constant value of maximum LUE at canopy scale (LUEmaxcanopy) over a given vegetation type. This assumption is not supported by observed plant traits regulating LUEmaxcanopy, which varies greatly even within the same ecosystem type. In this study, we developed an improved satellite data driven GPP model by identifying the potential maximal GPP (GPPPOT) and their dominant climate control factor in various plant functional types (PFT), which takes into account both plant trait and climatic control inter-dependence. We selected 161 sites from the FLUXNET2015 dataset with eddy covariance CO2 flux data and continuous meteorology to derive GPPPOT and their dominant climate control factor of vegetation growth for 42 natural PFTs. Results showed that (1) under the same phenology and incident photosynthetic active radiation, the maximal variance of GPPPOT is found in different PFTs of forests (10.9 g C m−2 day−1) and in different climatic zones of grasslands (>10 g C m−2 day−1); (2) intra-annual change of GPP in tropical and arid climate zones is mostly driven by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) changes, while temperature is the dominant climate control factor in temperate, boreal and polar climate zones; even under the same climate condition, physiological stress in photosynthesis is different across PFTs; (3) the model that takes into account the plant trait difference across PFTs had a higher agreement with flux tower-based GPP data (GPPflux) than the GPP products that omit PFT differences. Such agreement was highest for natural vegetation cover sites (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 1.79 g C m−2 day−1). These results suggest that global scale GPP models should incorporate both plant traits and their dominant climate control factor variance in various PFT to reduce the uncertainties in terrestrial carbon assessments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000483517",,"0303-2434||1872-826X||1569-8432",,"10.1016/j.jag.2021.102328","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/483517","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Terrestrial carbon cycle||Carbon flux||Plant trait||Climatic zones","Improved global estimations of gross primary productivity of natural vegetation types by incorporating plant functional type",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-10T15:11:43Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"ICOS-CH Phase 2","173691","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,"85120692569",,"000647797000002",,,"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","100","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although the role of neighbourhood competition on stand dynamics has received increasing attention, the response of competition to environmental fluctuations and stand development remains poorly explored. We evaluated changes in competition during stand development in a dry-edge Scots pine relict population located in Central Spain. Typically, tree-to-tree interactions have been investigated through static competition measurements, which usually lack the temporal variation associated to natural forest development and environmental conditions. Here, we assessed how individual and neighbourhood components of competition evolved along a 35-year period, and we related competition dynamics to population structure and drought levels. On six plots, 508 trees were mapped and diameters at breast height (DBH) were measured. Two increment cores were taken from target trees to derive basal area increment (BAI), and neighbourhood was reconstructed back to 1980. Results provide insights into inter-annual variability in competition effects and their role on tree radial growth depending on climatic conditions. From the year 2005 onwards, both individual and neighbourhood components of competition showed a decoupled pattern over time. This effect was particularly pronounced during the extreme drought in 2012, in which the individual component decreased, whereas the neighbourhood component increased. In addition, climatic variability modulated the competition effects during stand development. This approach of evaluating competition dynamics proves to be promising for studying forest stand development and the influence of climate impacts on tree populations subjected to xeric conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000483040",,"0931-1890||1432-2285",,"10.1007/s00468-021-02109-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/483040","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Competition effects||Dendroecology||Drought stress||Pinus sylvestris||Stand Development||Tree radial growth","Evaluating tree-to-tree competition during stand development in a relict Scots pine forest: how much does climate matter?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-07T09:41:38Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102455663",,"000627195300001","Trees","4","Trees","35","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As maize is one of the main hosts of F. graminearum, the risk of infection by this plant pathogen is highest when wheat is grown after maize and infected crop residues are not buried through ploughing.  OBJECTIVES This study aimed to investigate the agronomic and economic viability of two innovative cropping systems with the goal to reduce the risk of FHB and mycotoxins in subsequent wheat. These systems were maize-intercropping and cover cropping with different plant species before the wheat growing season under reduced tillage practices.  METHODS For the maize-intercropping study, red clover, sudangrass, phacelia, white mustard and Indian mustard were used as intercrops with grain maize and compared with a sole maize crop in a grain maize-winter wheat rotation under no-tillage or reduced tillage. For the cover cropping study, white mustard, Indian mustard and winter pea were used as interval cover crops in a silage maize-spring wheat rotation under no-tillage and compared with treatments without a cover crop, i.e. herbicide or plough applied after silage maize. The incidence of Fusarium head blight causing species and the accumulation of mycotoxins in grains of wheat as well as the crop yield were monitored. In addition, an economic assessment was conducted by calculating the receipts, operating costs and gross margin for each cropping system.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Growing intercrops with maize or interval cover crops in a maize-wheat rotation under reduced tillage decreased mycotoxins in wheat while maintaining wheat yield. The use of white mustard or Indian mustard as intercrops reduced deoxynivalenol in winter wheat by up to 52% compared with maize grown as a sole crop. The use of white mustard, Indian mustard or winter pea as interval cover crops also reduced deoxynivalenol and improved yield in spring wheat by up to 85% and 25%, respectively. Remarkably, the toxin reduction through these cover crops was comparable with that obtained by ploughing. However, due to increased operating costs, we observed economic trade-offs in these innovative cropping systems, i.e. 7–25% reduced gross margin over the entire rotation.  SIGNIFICANCE Both cereal growers and consumers can benefit from the recommended practices, which considerably lower the risk of mycotoxin contamination in harvest products while maintaining crop yield. To address the economic trade-offs, policy makers should support innovation in cropping systems, enhancing food safety while also ensuring the economic viability of cereal production systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493868",,"0308-521X",,"10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103198","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493868","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Fusarium head blight||Wheat||Mycotoxin||Food safety||Intercrop||Cover crop","The agronomic and economic viability of innovative cropping systems to reduce Fusarium head blight and related mycotoxins in wheat",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-10T05:24:52Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85109011097",,"000689664800005",,,"Agricultural Systems","192","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this regard, agroecology is perceived as a sustainable pathway to improve farming practices. This article proposes first a theoretical framework to analyze the proximity of farmers' management to agroecological principles. Second, it describes the current use of agroecological pest and soil management practices by French Polynesian farmers. And third, it explains which agronomic and socio-economic factors drive the implementation of agroecological practices. For this, qualitative interviews were conducted with 32 farmers on three islands, and statistical analyses were carried for correlation between the use of practices and socio-economic variables. Results show that French Polynesian farmers implement different soil and pest management practices that are in line with agroecological principles. Farmers scored better in terms of pest management with high plant diversity, implementation of crop rotations, and mechanical weed management. There is a significant influence of the “cropping system” and the “production system” (organic, integrated, and conventional) on the use of practices as well as proximity to agroecological principles. Identified pathways for an agroecological transition are implementing farmer to farmer knowledge exchange, farmer networks, and farm demonstrations as well as training of extension services staff.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516745",,"2571-581X",,"10.3389/fsufs.2021.708647","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516745","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Transition pathways||Agroecological practices||Agroecology||Innovation tracking||Organic agriculture||Tahiti","Soil and Pest Management in French Polynesian Farming Systems and Drivers and Barriers for Implementation of Practices Based on Agroecological Principles",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-24T16:49:40Z",,,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Front.

The response of trees to intra-annual environmental constraints varies temporally throughout a growing season and spatially across landscapes. A better understanding of these dynamics will help us anticipate the impacts of short-term climate variability and medium-term climate change on forests. Using the process-based 3-PG forest ecosystem model, we assessed the spatial manifestation and seasonal variation in environmental constraints [vapour pressure deficit (VPD), air temperature and soil water availability] on tree growth for the potential distribution range of seven widespread Central European tree species.  2. We focused our analyses on Switzerland, where large climatic gradients occur within a comparatively small geographic area. On average, over the last 60 years, simulated forest growth during the May–August growing season was limited by high VPD (67% of the forested area), low air temperature (29%) or low soil water availability (4%). But this response varied among species and across elevations.  3. When comparing the period 1961–1990 with 1991–2018, we observed major shifts from former temperature limitation to recent VPD limitation across 12% of the area (3%–25%, depending on species), mainly at mid-elevations (700–1,200 m a.s.l.). At the same time, forest growth at lower elevations (i.e. below 700 m a.s.l.) became more limited by available soil water at the end of the growing season.  4. Synthesis. Our results highlight how the relative impact of environmental growth constraints has shifted in the last three decades, and show that the importance of VPD as a dominant environmental growth constraint has increased for tree species in Swiss and Central European forests. Understanding the spatial and temporal variability in environmental growth constraints will help to generate accurate species-specific risk maps for forest managers to identify areas with elevated drought and heat stress in the near future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494777",,"0022-0477",,"10.1111/1365-2745.13712","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494777","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","3-PG||climate change||drought||growth limitation||tree-rings||VPD","Tree growth in Switzerland is increasingly constrained by rising evaporative demand",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T10:20:12Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85107796693",,"000660902700001","J.

Our analyses reveal large gradients in RMFs both across and within vegetation types that can be attributed to resource availability. High RMFs occur in cold and dry ecosystems, while low RMFs dominate in warm and wet regions. Across all vegetation types, the directional effect of temperature on RMFs depends on water availability, suggesting feedbacks between heat, water and nutrient supply.

In the agricultural grasslands that we studied, management effects either overruled or modified the driving role of plant diversity observed in the biodiversity experiment. Nevertheless, we show that greater above- (plants) and belowground (mycorrhizal fungi) biodiversity contributed to tightening the P cycle in agricultural grasslands, as reduced management intensity and the associated increased biodiversity fostered the exploitation of P resources. Our results demonstrate that promoting a high above- and belowground biodiversity has ecological (biodiversity protection) and economical (fertiliser savings) benefits.

In particular, the effects of climate and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition on litter decomposition and its temporal dynamics are of significant importance, since their effects might change over the course of the decomposition process. Within the TeaComposition initiative, we incubated Green and Rooibos teas at 524 sites across nine biomes. We assessed how macroclimate and atmospheric inorganic N deposition under current and predicted scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 8.5) might affect litter mass loss measured after 3 and 12 months. Our study shows that the early to mid-term mass loss at the global scale was affected predominantly by litter quality (explaining 73% and 62% of the total variance after 3 and 12 months, respectively) followed by climate and N deposition. The effects of climate were not litter-specific and became increasingly significant as decomposition progressed, with MAP explaining 2% and MAT 4% of the variation after 12 months of incubation. The effect of N deposition was litter-specific, and significant only for 12-month decomposition of Rooibos tea at the global scale. However, in the temperate biome where atmospheric N deposition rates are relatively high, the 12-month mass loss of Green and Rooibos teas decreased significantly with increasing N deposition, explaining 9.5% and 1.1% of the variance, respectively. The expected changes in macroclimate and N deposition at the global scale by the end of this century are estimated to increase the 12-month mass loss of easily decomposable litter by 1.1–3.5% and of the more stable substrates by 3.8–10.6%, relative to current mass loss. In contrast, expected changes in atmospheric N deposition will decrease the mid-term mass loss of high-quality litter by 1.4–2.2% and that of low-quality litter by 0.9–1.5% in the temperate biome. Our results suggest that projected increases in N deposition may have the capacity to dampen the climate-driven increases in litter decomposition depending on the biome and decomposition stage of substrate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000498973",,"2624-893X",,"10.3389/ffgc.2021.678480","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/498973","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Tea bag||Green tea||Rooibos tea||Litter decomposition||Carbon turnover||Nitrogen deposition||TeaComposition initiative","Effects of Climate and Atmospheric Nitrogen Deposition on Early to Mid-Term Stage Litter Decomposition Across Biomes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-02T12:56:01Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85111449981",,,,,"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These water inputs are often not considered in ecohydrological studies, because water amounts of NRW events are rather small and therefore difficult to measure. Here we present a novel micro-lysimeter (ML) system and its application which allows to quantify very small water inputs from NRW with an unprecedented high accuracy of ±0.25 g, which corresponds to ±0.005 mm water input. This is possible with an improved ML design paired with individual ML calibrations in combination with high-frequency measurements at 3.3 Hz and an efficient low-pass filtering to reduce noise level. With a set of ancillary sensors, the ML system furthermore allows differentiating between different types of NRW inputs: dew, hoar frost, fog, rime and the combinations among these, but also additional events when condensation on leaves is less probable, such as water vapor adsorption events. In addition, our ML system design allows to minimize deviations from natural conditions in terms of canopy and soil temperatures, plant growth and soil moisture. This is found to be a crucial aspect for obtaining realistic NRW measurements in short-statured grasslands. Our ML system has proven to be useful for high-accuracy, long-term measurements of NRW on short-statured vegetation like grasslands. Measurements with the ML system at a field site in Switzerland showed that NRW input occurred frequently with 127 events over 12 months, with a total NRW input of 15.9 mm. High average monthly NRW inputs were measured during summer months, suggesting a high ecohydrological relevance of NRW inputs for temperate grasslands.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516103",,"1812-2116||1812-2108",,"10.5194/hess-2021-317","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516103","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Technical note: High accuracy weighing micro-lysimeter system for long-term measurements of non-rainfall water inputs to grasslands",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2021-11-19T11:16:07Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The importance of fog and dew for Swiss grasslands today and in the future (Acronym: IFDewS)","175733||175733","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT||Projekte MINT",,,,,,"Hydrol. earth syst. sci.",,"Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This trait, called harvest index in the agricultural context3,4,5, determines how plant biomass is converted to seed yield and consequently financial revenue from numerous major staple crops. While plant diversity has been demonstrated to increase plant biomass6,7,8, plant diversity effects on seed yield of crops are ambiguous9 and dependent on the production syndrome10. This discrepancy might be explained through changes in the proportion of resources invested in reproduction in response to changes in plant diversity, namely through changes in species interactions and microenvironmental conditions11,12,13,14. Here, we show that increasing crop plant diversity from monocultures over two- to four-species mixtures increased annual primary productivity, resulting in overall higher plant biomass and, to a lesser extent, higher seed yield in mixtures compared with monocultures. The difference between the two responses to diversity was due to a reduced harvest index of the eight tested crop species in mixtures, possibly because their common cultivars have been bred for maximum performance in monoculture. While crop diversification provides a sustainable measure of agricultural intensification15, the use of currently available cultivars may compromise larger gains in seed yield. We therefore advocate regional breeding programmes for crop varieties to be used in mixtures that should exploit complementarity16 among crop species.",,,,"2055-026X||2055-0278",,"10.1038/s41477-021-00948-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493457","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,"Agroecology||Agriculture||Community ecology||Plant ecology","Diversity increases yield but reduces harvest index in crop mixtures",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-07-08T02:54:45Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Ecology and evolution in practice: A plant–plant interaction-based approach to the evolution of biodiversity effects on productivity","170645","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,"85108414934",,"000665728100002","Nat Plants","7","Nature Plants","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In contrast, the nonlinearity and large spatial variability of identified controls stress the importance of the interplay among soil, vegetation and climate parameters in controlling warming responses.

Development of basic models utilized information that is available only from feeding experiments. Basic models were developed using a database with 63 treatment means from 19 studies and were evaluated against an external database (n = 36, from 10 studies) along with other extant models. In total, the basic model database included 99 treatment means from 29 studies with records for enteric CH4 production (MJ/day), dry matter intake (DMI) and dietary nutrient composition. When evaluated by low root mean square prediction errors and high concordance correlation coefficients, the developed basic models that included DMI, dietary concentrations of fatty acids and neutral detergent fiber performed slightly better in predicting CH4 emissions than extant models. In order to propose country-specific values for the CH4 conversion factor Ym (% of gross energy intake partitioned into CH4) and thus to be able to carry out the national inventory for Norway, the existing operational model was updated for the prediction of Ym over a wide range of feeding situations. A simulated operational database containing CH4 production (predicted by the basic model), feed intake and composition, Ym and gross energy intake (GEI), in addition to the predictor variables energy corrected milk yield and dietary concentrate share were used to develop an operational model. Input values of Ym were updated based on the results from the basic models. The predicted Ym ranged from 6.22 to 6.72%. In conclusion, the prediction accuracy of CH4 production from dairy cows was improved with the help of newly published data, which enabled an update of the operational model for calculating the national inventory of CH4 in Norway.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000491616",,"2076-2615",,"10.3390/ani11071891","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491616","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","dairy cattle||prediction model||methane conversion factor||dry matter intake||fatty acid||neutral detergent fiber","A Basic Model to Predict Enteric Methane Emission from Dairy Cows and Its Application to Update Operational Models for the National Inventory in Norway",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-28T06:49:49Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85108452580",,"000675922600001",,"7","Animals","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In experiments under controlled conditions, temperature is often set to artificial, binary regimes with constant values at day and at night. This study investigated how such a diel (24 hr) temperature regime affects leaf growth, carbohydrate metabolism and gene expression, compared to a temperature regime with a field‐like gradual increase and decline throughout 24 hr. Soybean (Glycine max) was grown under two contrasting diel temperature treatments. Leaf growth was measured in high temporal resolution. Periodical measurements were performed of carbohydrate concentrations, carbon isotopes as well as the transcriptome by RNA sequencing. Leaf growth activity peaked at different times under the two treatments, which cannot be explained intuitively. Under field‐like temperature conditions, leaf growth followed temperature and peaked in the afternoon, whereas in the binary temperature regime, growth increased at night and decreased during daytime. Differential gene expression data suggest that a synchronization of cell division activity seems to be evoked in the binary temperature regime. Overall, the results show that the coordination of a wide range of metabolic processes is markedly affected by the diel variation of temperature, which emphasizes the importance of realistic environmental settings in controlled condition experiments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456952",,"0140-7791||1365-3040",,"10.1111/pce.13958","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456952","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","circadian||controlled conditions||fluctuating temperature||natural environment||storage carbohydrates","Rethinking temperature effects on leaf growth, gene expression and metabolism: Diel variation matters",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-17T16:48:29Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Carbon isotope fractionation during leaf and root respiration as a function of nitrogen nutrition||PhenoCOOL: Wheat and soybean phenotyping under cold conditions using growth as a dynamic trait","153545||169542","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85097524030",,"000598742600001","Plant cell environ.","7","Plant, Cell & Environment","44","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Assessing compaction costs and guiding recovery strategies are hindered by paucity of data on soil structure recovery rates. A long-term Soil Structure Observatory was established on a loamy soil in Switzerland to monitor soil structure recovery after prescribed compaction, and to better assess the roles of natural processes (vegetation, macrofauna, and shrink–swell cycles) on recovery patterns. The aim of this study was to quantify short-term soil structure recovery under natural conditions in the presence and absence of plant cover (ley and bare soil). We measured soil porosity and gas and water transport capabilities at 0.1 and 0.3 m depth. Two years after the compaction event, soil physical properties have not recovered to precompaction levels, even within the topsoil. Surprisingly, no differences were observed in the recovery patterns of ley and bare soil treatments. Measurements show that recovery rates differ among soil properties with the most severely affected properties by compaction (permeability) exhibiting highest recovery rates. Total soil porosity shows no recovery trend, suggesting lack of soil decompaction. Improved soil functions and decompaction are distinct aspects of soil structure recovery, with the latter requiring net upward transport of soil mass. We suggest that soil structure recovery proceeds at two fronts: from the soil surface downward, and expanding around local biologically-active pockets (marked by biopores) into the compacted soil volumes. This concept could be tested with additional data of longer time series at our site as well as in other soils and climates.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494921",,"0361-5995||1435-0661",,"10.1002/saj2.20240","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494921","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Soil structure recovery following compaction: Short-term evolution of soil physical properties in a loamy soil",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T10:31:14Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Biophysical processes controlling restoration of compacted soil structure - long-term soil structure observatory and mechanistic studies","143061","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 68: Gesuch",,,"85106293681",,"000653247600001","Soil Sci.

Eddy covariance (EC) measurements of CH4 flux are ideal for constraining ecosystem-scale CH4 emissions due to quasi-continuous and high-temporal-resolution CH4 flux measurements, coincident carbon dioxide, water, and energy flux measurements, lack of ecosystem disturbance, and increased availability of datasets over the last decade. Here, we (1) describe the newly published dataset, FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0, the first open-source global dataset of CH4 EC measurements (available at https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/, last access: 7 April 2021). FLUXNET-CH4 includes half-hourly and daily gap-filled and non-gap-filled aggregated CH4 fluxes and meteorological data from 79 sites globally: 42 freshwater wetlands, 6 brackish and saline wetlands, 7 formerly drained ecosystems, 7 rice paddy sites, 2 lakes, and 15 uplands. Then, we (2) evaluate FLUXNET-CH4 representativeness for freshwater wetland coverage globally because the majority of sites in FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0 are freshwater wetlands which are a substantial source of total atmospheric CH4 emissions; and (3) we provide the first global estimates of the seasonal variability and seasonality predictors of freshwater wetland CH4 fluxes. Our representativeness analysis suggests that the freshwater wetland sites in the dataset cover global wetland bioclimatic attributes (encompassing energy, moisture, and vegetation-related parameters) in arctic, boreal, and temperate regions but only sparsely cover humid tropical regions. Seasonality metrics of wetland CH4 emissions vary considerably across latitudinal bands. In freshwater wetlands (except those between 20∘ S to 20∘ N) the spring onset of elevated CH4 emissions starts 3 d earlier, and the CH4 emission season lasts 4 d longer, for each degree Celsius increase in mean annual air temperature. On average, the spring onset of increasing CH4 emissions lags behind soil warming by 1 month, with very few sites experiencing increased CH4 emissions prior to the onset of soil warming. In contrast, roughly half of these sites experience the spring onset of rising CH4 emissions prior to the spring increase in gross primary productivity (GPP). The timing of peak summer CH4 emissions does not correlate with the timing for either peak summer temperature or peak GPP. Our results provide seasonality parameters for CH4 modeling and highlight seasonality metrics that cannot be predicted by temperature or GPP (i.e., seasonality of CH4 peak). FLUXNET-CH4 is a powerful new resource for diagnosing and understanding the role of terrestrial ecosystems and climate drivers in the global CH4 cycle, and future additions of sites in tropical ecosystems and site years of data collection will provide added value to this database. All seasonality parameters are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4672601 (Delwiche et al., 2021).

Plant genetic diversity (PGD; i.e., within-species diversity) is related to many beneficial effects to the ecosystem functioning of grasslands. The monitoring of PGD in temperate grasslands is complicated by the multiplicity of species present and by a shortage of methods for large-scale assessment. However, the continuous advancement of high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches have improved the prospects of broad, multispecies PGD monitoring. Among them, amplicon sequencing stands out as a robust and cost-effective method.  Here we report a set of twelve multispecies primer pairs that can be used for high-throughput PGD assessment in multiple grassland plant species. The loci targeted by the amplicons were selected and tested in two phases: a “discovery phase” based on a sequence capture assay (611 target nuclear loci assessed in 16 grassland plant species), which resulted in the selection of eleven loci; and a “validation phase”, in which the selected loci were targeted and sequenced using twelve multispecies primers in test populations of Dactylis glomerata L., Lolium perenne L., Festuca pratensis Huds., Trifolium pratense L. and T. repens L. The resulting multispecies amplicons had overall nucleotide diversities per species ranging from 5.19 × 10−3 to 1.29 × 10−2, which is in the range of flowering-related genes but slightly lower than pathogen resistance genes. We conclude that the methodology, the DNA sequence resources, and the amplicon-specific primer pairs reported in this study provide the basis for large-scale, multispecies PGD monitoring in grassland plants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519799",,,,"10.1101/2021.07.26.453819","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519799","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"A multispecies amplicon sequencing approach for genetic diversity assessment in grassland plant species",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2021-12-09T10:39:24Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To address this challenge, we followed the functional land management approach and assessed five soil functions: primary productivity, water regulation and purification, climate regulation, soil biodiversity and nutrient cycling. Soil, management and climate data were collected from 94 sites covering 13 countries, five climatic zones and two land‐use types (arable and grassland). This dataset was analysed using the Soil Navigator, a multicriteria decision support system developed to assess the supply of the five soil functions simultaneously. Most sites scored high for two to three soil functions, demonstrating that managing for multifunctionality in soil is possible but that local constraints and trade‐offs do exist. Nutrient cycling, biodiversity and climate regulation were less frequently delivered at high capacity than the other two soil functions. Using correlation and co‐occurrence analyses, we also found that synergies and trade‐offs between soil functions vary among climatic zones and land‐use types. This study provides a new framework for monitoring soil quality at the European scale where both the supply of soil functions and their interactions are considered.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000446720",,"1351-0754||1365-2389",,"10.1111/ejss.13051","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446720","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","arable land||climate||grassland||monitoring||soil multifunctionality||synergies||trade‐offs","Soil multifunctionality: Synergies and trade‐offs across European climatic zones and land uses",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-20T04:51:03Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"LAND Management: Assessment, Research, Knowledge base","635201","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,"85092170665",,"000575851000001","Eur.

This fat may represent an as yet underutilized energy source for livestock. However, transfer of lauric and myristic acid, prevalent in BSFL fat and undesired in human nutrition, into animal-source foods like eggs may limit its implementation. To quantify this, a laying hen experiment was performed comprising five different diets (10 hens/diet). These were a control diet with soybean oil and meal and a second diet with soybean oil but with partially defatted BSFL meal as protein source. The other three diets were based on different combinations of partially defatted BSFL meal and fat obtained by two different production methods. Lauric acid made up half of the BSFL fat from both origins. Both BSFL fats also contained substantial amounts of myristic and palmitic acid. However, in the insect-based diets, the net transfer from diet to egg yolk was less than 1% for lauric acid, whereas the net transfer for myristic and palmitic acid was about 30% and 100%, respectively. The net transfer did not vary between BSFL originating from production on different larval feeding substrates. The results illustrate that hens are able to metabolize or elongate very large proportions of ingested lauric acid and myristic acid, which are predominant in the BSFL lipids (together accounting for as much as 37 mol%), such that they collectively account for less than 3.5 mol% of egg yolk fatty acids.",,,,"0024-4201||1558-9307",,"10.1002/lipd.12304","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478040","en","Wiley",,,"Dietary fat||Fatty acids||Lipid analysis||Nutrition||Saturated fatty acids","Transfer of lauric and myristic acid from black soldier fly larval lipids to egg yolk lipids of hens is low",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-04-09T08:13:30Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85104595479",,"000642220400001","Lipids","4","Lipids","56","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study aims to fill this gap by calibrating a new Ag3PO4 stable isotope comparison material produced by the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU).  Methods Aliquots of Ag3PO4 were distributed to four laboratories who frequently measure the δ18O value in Ag3PO4; the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU), the University of Western Australia (UWA), the University of Helsinki (UH), and the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ). The instruments used to perform the measurements were high-temperature conversion elemental analysers coupled with continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometers. The working gas δ18O value was set to 0‰ and the normalization was done by a three-point linear regression using the reference materials IAEA-601, IAEA-602, and NBS127.  Results The mean δ18O value of the new BOKU Ag3PO4 comparison material on the VSMOW-SLAP scale is 13.71‰ and the combined uncertainty is estimated as ±0.34‰. This estimated uncertainty is within the range typical for comparison materials of phosphates and sulphates. Consistent results from the different laboratories probably derived from similar instrumentation, and use of the same reference materials and normalization procedure. The matrix effect of the different reference materials used in this study was deemed negligible.  Conclusions The BOKU Ag3PO4 can be used as an alternative comparison material for stable oxygen isotope analysis and is available for stable isotope research laboratories to facilitate calibration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484735",,"1097-0231||0951-4198",,"10.1002/rcm.9101","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484735","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"New Ag3PO4 comparison material for stable oxygen isotope analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-19T02:23:10Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85105418903",,,"RCM, Rapid commun. mass spectrom.","12","Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry","35","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, the factors which control SOC content across scales remain unclear. Earlier studies demonstrated that soil texture and geochemistry strongly affect SOC content. However, those findings primarily rely on data from temperate regions where soil mineralogy, weathering status and climatic conditions generally differ from tropical and subtropical regions. We investigated soil properties and climate variables influencing SOC concentrations across sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 1601 samples were analyzed, collected from two depths (0-20 and 20-50gcm) from 17 countries as part of the Africa Soil Information Service project (AfSIS). The data set spans arid to humid climates and includes soils with a wide range of pH values, weathering status, soil texture, exchangeable cations, extractable metals and land cover types. The most important SOC predictors were identified by linear mixed-effects models, regression trees and random forest models. Our results indicate that geochemical properties, mainly oxalate-extractable metals (Al and Fe) and exchangeable Ca, are equally important compared to climatic variables (mean annual temperature and aridity index). Together, they explain approximately two-thirds of SOC variation across sub-Saharan Africa. Oxalate-extractable metals were most important in wet regions with acidic and highly weathered soils, whereas exchangeable Ca was more important in alkaline and less weathered soils in drier regions. In contrast, land cover and soil texture were not significant SOC predictors on this large scale. Our findings indicate that key factors controlling SOC across sub-Saharan Africa are broadly similar to those in temperate regions, despite differences in soil development history.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493465",,"2199-3971||2199-398X",,"10.5194/soil-7-305-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493465","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Continental-scale controls on soil organic carbon across sub-Saharan Africa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-08T03:05:16Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85108942857",,"000669513300001",,"1","Soil","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Organic ligands play a key role to control the toxicity and mobility of Cd in living organisms and also in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Therefore, knowledge of the equilibrium isotope fractionation of Cd with organic ligands is crucial to further advance Cd isotope source and process tracing in the field of biogeochemistry. In this study, we calculated reduced partition function ratios (103lnβ) of Cd isotopes in various organic Cd complexes by density functional theory. The calculations revealed that the 103lnβ of 114Cd/110Cd for these complexes decreased in the order of Cd(Hcit)(H2cit)− > Cd(cit)(H2O)3− > CdH(cit)(H2O)4 > CdEDTA > Cd(his)2H2O > Cd(cit)24− ≈ Cd(H2O)62+ > Cd(H2O)42+ > Cd(cys)(H2O)32+ > Cd(GS)2(H2O)22− > Cd(DMPS)(H2O)2− > Cd(DMPS)24− at 0–100 °C. In general, heavier Cd isotopes preferably bind to oxygen and nitrogen donor atoms while lighter Cd isotopes bind to sulfur donor atoms of organic ligands. Thus, the previously observed immobilization of light Cd isotopes in living organisms could be related to Cd detoxification processes with sulfur. The predicted equilibrium isotope fractionation will strengthen Cd isotopes as a process tracing tool in living organisms and will improve the understanding of Cd isotope cycling in aquatic and terrestrial systems.",,,,"0009-2541||1872-6836",,"10.1016/j.chemgeo.2021.120178","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/476695","en","Elsevier",,,"Cd isotope||Organic complexes||Equilibrium isotope fractionation||O/N/S donor||Destiny functional theory||Isotope biogeochemistry","Theoretical isotope fractionation of cadmium during complexation with organic ligands",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-03-28T21:56:05Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102881534",,"000641459500003","Chem. geol.",,"Chemical Geology","571","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recent work has employed novel mobility data sets as a proxy for trace gas emissions from traffic by scaling CO2 emissions linearly with those near-real-time mobility data. Yet, there has been little work evaluating these emission numbers. Here, we systematically compare these mobility data sets to traffic data from local governments in seven diverse urban and national/state regions to characterize the magnitude of errors that result from using the mobility data. We observe differences in excess of 60% between these mobility data sets and local traffic data. We could not find a general functional relationship between the mobility data and traffic flow over all the regions and observe higher deviations from using such general relationships than the original data. Finally, we give an overview of the potential errors that come from estimating CO2 emissions using (mobility or traffic) activity data. Future work should be cautious while using these mobility metrics for emission estimates.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000490042",,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2021JD034664","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/490042","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"What Are the Different Measures of Mobility Telling Us About Surface Transportation CO2 Emissions During the COVID-19 Pandemic?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-17T02:50:33Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85107505497",,"000663557500013","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","11","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","126","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

There is a limited knowledge on how the deposited pristine ash becomes immobilized and stabilized in the soil after the volcanic event. Here, we studied processes of soil aggregates formation in the buried ash layer in an early stage of the succession as well as the influence of the biological legacy (previous land management history) on these processes after the 2011 volcanic event of the Puyehue–Cordón Caulle Volcanic Complex. 5.5 years after the eruption we collected soil cores to a 10 cm depth in wet and mesic meadows with good and poor grassland conditions induced by light and heavy grazing intensity, respectively, in the East semiarid region of North Patagonia, Argentina. The ash layer was observed down to 5 cm from the soil surface, clearly differentiating a newly developed soil layer formed after the volcanic event. Accordingly, the top 5 cm were examined for the distribution of different size fractions of water-stable soil aggregates and their associated organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) contents. We detected signs of physical and physicochemical changes in respect to the pristine ash collected at these sites in 2011. Soil neoformation processes were detected through the presence of large (4%) and small (21%) macroaggregates, although microaggregates (~45%) and silt + clay fractions (~29%) dominated the soil mass (ash-soil matrix: 0–5 cm depth). C and N contents decreased in a sequence: large macroaggregates ≥ small macroaggregates > microaggregates ≥ silt + clay, highlighting the importance of soil organic matter in the formation of larger-size aggregates and their quality (C and N contents). Biological legacy influenced soil aggregate formation and their quality, as reflected by a higher mass of small macroaggregates and a lower mass of microaggregates (only in mesic meadows) and by higher C and N contents under good grassland conditions. The seasonal hydrological conditions of meadow soils (i.e., soil water content, wetting and drying cycles) via effects on biological and physical processes likely resulted in a reduced aggregation in wet meadows. We noticed an incipient but present soil aggregation processes in these semiarid wetlands translated in the immobilization and stabilization of the buried ashes in the soil. The total C content in the new 0–5 cm soil layer increased at a rate of 1.0 Mg C ha−1 yr−1, on average. This indicates a functional recovery of the ecosystem along with a substantial CO2 mitigation potential in the ashes stabilized with soil organic matter, which might partially counterbalance CO2 emitted during the eruption. © 2021 Elsevier",,,,"0016-7061||1872-6259",,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.114987","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472844","en","Elsevier",,,"Volcanic ash||Soil forming processes||Aggregate forming processes||Patagonian wetlands","Immobilization and stabilization of volcanic ash in soil aggregates in semiarid meadows of Northern Patagonia",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-03-04T04:24:41Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101331122",,"000627883100004","Geoderma",,"Geoderma","392","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This poses serious threats to farming activities and has major implications for sustaining rural livelihoods and food security. Farmers’ ability to respond to and withstand the increasing incidence of drought events needs to be strengthened and their resilience enhanced. Implementation of measures to enhance resilience is determined by decisions of farmers and it is important to understand the reasons behind their behavior. We assessed the viability of measures to enhance resilience of farmers to drought, by developing a general framework that covers economic-technical and psychological-cognitive aspects, here summarized under the terms (1) motivation and (2) feasibility. The conceptual framework was applied to cocoa farmers in Ghana and tef farmers in Ethiopia by using questionnaire-based surveys. A portfolio of five specific measures to build resilience (i.e., irrigation, shade trees, fire belts, bookkeeping, mulching, early mature varieties, weather forecast, reduced tillage, improved harvesting) in each country was evaluated with a closed-ended questionnaire that covered the various aspects of motivation and feasibility whereby farmers were asked to (dis)agree on a 5-point Likert scale. The results show that if the motivation mean score is increased by 0.1 units, the probability of implementation increases by 16.9% in Ghana and by 7.7% in Ethiopia. If the feasibility mean score is increased by 0.1 units, the probability of implementation increases by 24.9% in Ghana and by 11.9% in Ethiopia. We can conclude that motivation and feasibility matter, and we improve our understanding of measure implementation if we include both feasibility and motivation into viability assessments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000490829",,"1381-2386||1573-1596",,"10.1007/s11027-021-09952-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/490829","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Vulnerability||Climate change||Sub-Saharan Africa||Cocoa||Tef","Beyond feasibility—the role of motivation to implement measures to enhance resilience: Evidence from drought-affected smallholder farmers in Ghana and Ethiopia",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-23T03:12:12Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85107925118",,"000661474100001","Mitig. adapt. strategies glob. chang.","5","Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change","26","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Infrared spectroscopic modeling can link and massively scale up these methods for many soil characteristics in a cost-effective and timely manner. In Switzerland, only 10 % to 15 % of agricultural soils have been mapped sufficiently to serve spatial decision support systems, presenting an urgent need for rapid quantitative soil characterization. The current Swiss soil spectral library (SSL; n = 4374) in the mid-infrared range includes soil samples from the Biodiversity Monitoring Program (BDM), arranged in a regularly spaced grid across Switzerland, and temporally resolved data from the Swiss Soil Monitoring Network (NABO). Given that less than 2 % of the samples in the SSL originate from organic soils, we aimed to develop both an efficient calibration sampling scheme and accurate modeling strategy to estimate the soil carbon (SC) contents of heterogeneous samples between 0 and 2 m depth from 26 locations within two drained peatland regions (School of Agricultural, Forest and Food Sciences (HAFL) data set; n = 116). The focus was on minimizing the need for new reference analyses by efficiently mining the spectral information of the SSL.  We used partial least square regressions (PLSRs), together with five repetitions of a location-grouped, 10-fold cross-validation, to predict SC ranging from 1 % to 52 % in the local HAFL data set. We compared the validation performance of different calibration schemes involving local models (1), models using the entire SSL combined with local samples (2), commonly referred to as spiking, and subsets of local and SSL samples optimized for the peatland target sites using the resampling local (RS-LOCAL) algorithm (3). Using local and RS-LOCAL calibrations with at least five local samples, we achieved similar validation results for predictions of SC up to 52 % (R2 = 0.93 to 0.97; bias = -0.07 to 1.65; root mean square error (RMSE) = 2.71 % to 3.89 % total carbon; ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) = 3.38 to 4.86; and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) = 4.93 to 7.09). However, calibrations using RS-LOCAL only required five or 10 local samples for very accurate models (RMSE = 3.16 % and 2.71 % total carbon, respectively), while purely local calibrations required 50 samples for similarly accurate results (RMSE < 3 % total carbon). Of the three approaches, the entire SSL spiked with local samples for model calibration led to validations with the lowest performance in terms of R2, bias, RMSE, RPD and RPIQ. Hence, we show that a simple and comprehensible modeling approach, using RS-LOCAL together with a SSL, is an efficient and accurate strategy when using infrared spectroscopy. It decreases field and laboratory work, the bias of SSL spiking approaches and the uncertainty of local models. If adequately mined, the information in the SSL is sufficient to predict SC in new and independent study regions, even if the local soil characteristics are very different from the ones in the SSL.

However, resistance to these different classes of plant antagonists is mediated by different molecular mechanisms, and the extent to which induced systemic resistance by Pseudomonas can simultaneously protect plants against both pathogens and herbivores remains unclear. We screened 12 root-colonizing Pseudomonas strains to assess their ability to induce resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana against a foliar pathogen (Pseudomonas syringae DC3000) and a chewing herbivore (Spodoptera littoralis). None of our 12 strains increased plant resistance against herbivory; however, four strains enhanced pathogen resistance, and one of these (Pseudomonas strain P97-38) also made plants more susceptible to herbivory. Phytohormone analyses revealed stronger salicylic acid induction in plants colonized by P97-38 (versus controls) following subsequent pathogen infection but weaker induction of jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated defenses following herbivory. We found no effects of P97-38 inoculation on herbivore-relevant nutrients such as sugars and protein, suggesting that the observed enhancement of susceptibility to S. littoralis is due to effects on plant defense chemistry rather than nutrition. These findings suggest that Pseudomonas strains that enhance plant resistance to pathogens may have neutral or negative effects on resistance to herbivores and provide insight into potential mechanisms associated with effects on different classes of plant antagonists. Improved understanding of these effects has potentially important implications for the use of rhizobacteria inoculation in agriculture.",,,,"0099-2240||1098-5336",,"10.1128/AEM.02831-20","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491549","en","American Society for Microbiology",,,"Arabidopsis thaliana||Pseudomonas||Pseudomonas syringae||Spodoptera littoralis||biological control||glucosinolates||Induced systemic resistance||Phytohormones","Effects of Root-Colonizing Fluorescent Pseudomonas Strains on Arabidopsis Resistance to a Pathogen and an Herbivore",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-06-27T03:33:23Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85108303766",,"000693246600018","Appl.

Die Auswahl von Sorten für eine Kernsammlung soll einerseits die genetische und phänotypische Vielfalt wiedergeben, anderseits auch Sorten von öffentlichem Interesse berücksichtigen. Neben der Erhaltung dient eine Kernsammlung besonders der Beschreibung der genetischen Vielfalt und somit der Identifikation von sortenspezifischen Eigenschaften, die von der Züchtung effizient und gezielt genutzt werden können. Insbesondere in der Apfelzüchtung, wo die genetische Vielfalt in den wenigen, kommerziell erfolgreichen Sorten gering ist, ist die Verbreiterung der genetischen Basis ein wichtiges Element, um den Kulturapfel an neue Herausforderungen wie klimatische Veränderungen oder das Auftreten von neuen Krankheiten anzupassen. Um die Apfelzüchtung in der Schweiz weiter voranzubringen, entschied das BLW nach Absprache mit Agroscope und der ETH Zürich eine Schweizerische Apfel-Kernsammlung zu etablieren. Diese besteht aus 330 alten Schweizer Apfelsorten, die zusammen mit heute genutzten Sorten als Referenz an drei klimatisch unterschiedlichen Standorten gepflanzt wurde.

Over-fertilization can have negative influences on the field and the regional level (e.g., agro-ecosystems). Remote sensing of the plant N of field crops presents a valuable tool for the monitoring of N flows in agro-ecosystems. Available data for validation of satellite-based remote sensing of N is scarce. Therefore, in this study, field spectrometer measurements were used to simulate data of the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites developed for vegetation monitoring by the ESA. The prediction performance of normalized ratio indices (NRIs), random forest regression (RFR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for plant-N-related traits was assessed on a diverse real-world dataset including multiple crops, field sites and years. The plant N traits included the mass-based N measure, N concentration in the biomass (Nconc), and an area-based N measure approximating the plant N uptake (NUP). Spectral indices such as normalized ratio indices (NRIs) performed well, but the RFR and GPR methods outperformed the NRIs. Key spectral bands for each trait were identified using the RFR variable importance measure and the Gaussian processes regression band analysis tool (GPR-BAT), highlighting the importance of the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region for estimation of plant Nconc—and to a lesser extent the NUP. The red edge (RE) region was also important. The GPR-BAT showed that five bands were sufficient for plant N trait and leaf area index (LAI) estimation and that a surplus of bands effectively reduced prediction performance. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was performed on all traits simultaneously, showing the dominance of the LAI in the mixed remote sensing signal. To delineate the plant-N-related traits from this signal, regional and/or national data collection campaigns producing large crop spectral libraries (CSL) are needed. An improved database will likely enable the mapping of N at the agro-ecosystem level or for use in precision farming by farmers in the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492907",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs13122404","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492907","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","nitrogen||chlorophyll||leaf area index||agro-ecosystem monitoring||spectral indices||random forest||gaussian processes regression||ARTMO toolbox","Crop Nitrogen Retrieval Methods for Simulated Sentinel-2 Data Using In-Field Spectrometer Data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-05T02:54:50Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85109041645",,"000666559400001","Remote Sens.","12","Remote Sensing","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The raw ecosystem flux (i.e., net exchange) is calculated by the covariance between the turbulent vertical wind component measured by a sonic anemometer and the entity of interest, e.g., CO2, measured by a gas analyzer. Due to the application of two different instruments, wind and gas are not recorded at exactly the same time, resulting in a time lag between the two time series. For the calculation of ecosystem fluxes this time delay has to be quantified and corrected for, otherwise fluxes are systematically biased. Time lags for each averaging interval can be estimated by finding the maximum absolute covariance between the two turbulent time series at different time steps in a pre-defined time window of physically possible time-lags (e.g., McMillen, 1988; Moncrieff et al., 1997). Lag detection works well when processing fluxes for compounds with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is typically the case for e.g. CO2. In contrast, for compounds with low SNR (e.g., N2O, CH4) the cross-covariance function with the turbulent wind component yields noisier results and calculated fluxes are biased towards larger absolute flux values (Langford et al., 2015), which in turn renders the accurate calculation of yearly ecosystem GHG budgets more difficult and results may be inaccurate. One method to adequately calculate fluxes for compounds with low SNR is to first calculate the time lag for a reference compound with high SNR (e.g., CO2) and then to apply the same time lag to the target compound of interest (e.g., N2O), with both compounds being recorded by the same analyzer (Nemitz et al., 2018). DYCO uses this method by facilitating the dynamic lag-detection between the turbulent wind data and a reference compound and the subsequent application of found reference time lags to one or more target compounds.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000490125",,"2475-9066",,"10.21105/joss.02575","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/490125","en","IGI Global","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"DYCO: A Python package to dynamically detect and compensate for time lags in ecosystem time series",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-17T08:32:14Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"62","The Journal of Open Source Software","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Intercropping offers a potential solution to control weed pressure by reducing the resources available for weeds; however, available research on the relationship between crop diversity and weed pressure and its consequences for crop yield is not yet fully conclusive. In this study, we performed an extensive intercropping experiment using eight crop species and 40 different species mixtures to examine how crop diversity affects weed communities and how the subsequent changes in weeds influence crop yield. Mesocosm experiments were carried out under field conditions in Switzerland and in Spain, which differ drastically in terms of climate, soil and weed community, and included monocultures, two- and four-species mixtures, and a control treatment without crops. Weed communities were assessed in terms of biomass, species number and evenness, and community composition. Results indicate that intercropping reduces weed biomass and diversity in Spain but not in Switzerland. In Switzerland, despite the lack of a crop diversity effect on weeds, crop yield increased with crop species number. Moreover, in Switzerland, where soil resources were abundant, increasing crop yield correlated with reduced weed biomass. In Spain, where water and nutrients were limited, crop yield was not related to weed biomass or diversity. The presented research applies plant community ecology in the context of agricultural crop production systems. We demonstrate that, in our study, increased crop yield in mixtures was not due to increased weed suppression in diverse crop communities, and so must be the result of other ecological processes. We further show that crop–weed relationships vary across environmental conditions; more specifically, our study shows that weeds are less detrimental to crop yield in harsher environments compared to benign abiotic conditions, where alternative strategies are needed to control weed pressure and ensure the yield benefits provided by intercropping.",,,,"1051-0761||1939-5582",,"10.1002/eap.2311","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/489257","en","Ecological Society of America",,,"annual crop yield||biodiversity||competition||intercropping||productivity relationship||sustainable agriculture||weed suppression","Crop–weed relationships are context-dependent and cannot fully explain the positive effects of intercropping on yield",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-06-12T04:38:34Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Ecology and evolution in practice: A plant–plant interaction-based approach to the evolution of biodiversity effects on productivity","170645","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,"85103172871",,"000634120800001","Ecol.

However, even when there has been success in suppressing absolute methane emissions, intake, digestibility, and performance often decline in parallel. Ideal dietary levels of effective feeds would reduce methane production without affecting performance-related variables. Such favorable associative effects have been demonstrated in vitro by combining a high-quality forage with plants rich in phenols. In the present study, the tannin-rich leaves of hazel (Corylus avellana) gradually replaced (from 0 to 820 g/kg) a high-quality forage (dried alfalfa) in 20 types of experimental pellets fed to 20 mid-to-late lactating cows. Additionally, the cows were fed a mixed basal ration and some concentrate. The proportion of hazel in the 20 complete diets ranged from 0 to 400 g/kg dry matter. After 14 days of adaptation, 8 days were used for intensive sampling of feces (including markers for determining digesta retention time), urine, and milk. In addition, cows stayed for 2 days in open-circuit respiration chambers. Hazel leaves reduced the feed intake only slightly. Digestibility declined and mean digesta retention time was prolonged with increasing hazel proportion, likely due to the lower feeding value of the hazel leaves compared to the alfalfa. As aimed for, there were no significant effects on energy-corrected milk yield, body energy, and body N retention with increasing hazel intake, even though methane emission clearly declined in absolute term and per unit of digestible organic matter and tended to decrease per unit of energy corrected milk. In addition, increasing hazel proportions strongly shifted N excretion from urinary N (which declined from about 300 to 100 g/kg N intake) to fecal N. This could also be anticipated from the sharp decline in milk urea concentration (from about 35 to 10 mg/dL). In conclusion, hazel leaves as a feed supplement for dairy cows showed a high palatability within 3 weeks of feeding in dairy cows and great potential to mitigate emissions of methane and nitrogen in volatile form at maintained production levels. No favorable associative dosage effects seem to exist when combining tannin-rich hazel leaves with the high-quality forage alfalfa in a different proportions to a mixed basal ration. However, the present study is one of the few, where it was possible to mitigate noxious emissions of dairy cows by feeding a tannin rich feed supplement without concomitant negative impact on the animal's performance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000480376",,"0377-8401||1873-2216",,"10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2020.114790","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/480376","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Woody forage||Methanogenesis||Nitrogen balance||Cattle||Associative effect||Tannin","Increasing the proportion of hazel leaves in the diet of dairy cows reduced methane yield and excretion of nitrogen in volatile form, but not milk yield",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-25T08:41:26Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Identification of the presence of positive associative effects in dairy cattle: Environmental and animal health effects of suitable plant species combinations exceed adverse side-effects on digestion and metabolism.","ETH-49 15-1","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,"85104327016",,"000651738800013","Anim.

The study was conducted under practical conditions, deliberately accepting a certain lack of controllable variables. In order to assess a system applicable in practice, relatively small amounts of sainfoin were offered, and graded supply levels were compared by varying the duration of offer instead of dietary concentration. Within one dairy herd of 60 Swiss Fleckvieh cows, 30 individuals were chosen and randomly allocated to three groups balanced for milk yield, milk urea concentration, days in milk and parity. Over a period of 5 weeks, 2 kg per cow and day of sainfoin pellets were provided either intermittently, for 2 × 5 days (SST) in weeks 3 and 5 of the experiment or continuously over 35 days (SLT). A control group (CON) received 2 kg per cow and day of ryegrass pellets during the 5 weeks. The entire herd grazed on a protein-rich natural sward and was kept overnight in an open-space barn receiving fresh grass and hay ad libitum. Experimental pellets were offered individually twice per day in buckets. Feed, milk, faeces and urine samples were collected in weeks 0 (baseline), 3 and 5. Milk was analysed for fat, protein and urea, urine for purine derivatives, creatinine and nitrogen, and faeces for protein, fibre and particle fractions. During three sampling weeks, chewing activity was recorded by sensor halters. Treatment SST increased rumination time in the first half of the day, which was the only treatment effect on intake and rumination behaviour. Milk fat and protein yields were greater in SST compared to CON, but no treatment effect on concentration and yield of milk urea was found. The proportion of particle fractions in faeces was smaller in both sainfoin treatments compared to CON. In urine, the ratio of purine derivatives to creatinine tended to be higher in SST than in CON, and total urinary nitrogen excretion was lower, indicating a slightly better protein efficiency in SST. In summary, the study revealed small positive effects on protein metabolism and yield when sainfoin was applied short-term over two short periods, whereas long-term application had no effect.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000480377",,"1871-1413||1878-0490",,"10.1016/j.livsci.2021.104509","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/480377","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cattle||Legume||Condensed tannins||Purine derivatives||Low-input||On-farm research","On-farm examination of sainfoin supplementation effects in dairy cows in a roughage-based feeding system: Indicators of protein utilisation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-25T08:41:26Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85104278323",,"000656717300007",,,"Livestock Science","248","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study aimed to improve the robustness and accuracy of prediction models that estimate daily CH4 emissions from milk Fourier transform mid‐infrared (FT‐MIR) spectra by (i) increasing the reference dataset and (ii) adjusting for routinely recorded phenotypic information. Prediction equations for CH4 were developed using a combined dataset including daily CH4 measurements (n = 1089; g d−1) collected using the SF6 tracer technique (n = 513) and measurements using respiration chambers (RC, n = 576). Furthermore, in addition to the milk FT‐MIR spectra, the variables of milk yield (MY) on the test day, parity (P) and breed (B) of cows were included in the regression analysis as explanatory variables.  RESULTS Models developed based on a combined RC and SF6 dataset predicted the expected pattern in CH4 values (in g d−1) during a lactation cycle, namely an increase during the first weeks after calving followed by a gradual decrease until the end of lactation. The model including MY, P and B information provided the best prediction results (cross‐validation statistics: R2 = 0.68 and standard error = 57 g CH4 d−1).  CONCLUSIONS The models developed accounted for more of the observed variability in CH4 emissions than previously developed models and thus were considered more robust. This approach is suitable for large‐scale studies (e.g. animal genetic evaluation) where robustness is paramount for accurate predictions across a range of animal conditions. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.",,,,"0022-5142||1097-0010",,"10.1002/jsfa.10969","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/459187","en","Wiley",,,"Methane||Milk||MIR spectra||Dairy||Phenotype||Reference method","Improving robustness and accuracy of predicted daily methane emissions of dairy cows using milk mid‐infrared spectra",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-05T03:49:51Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097753685",,"000600248000001","J.

Thirty growing crossbred Limousin bulls, with an initial bodyweight of 164 ± 13 kg and 4.3 ± 0.3 months of age, were fed a grass/maize-silage based diet with little additional concentrate (0.5:0.3:0.2). Concentrates contained either soybean meal (positive control), faba beans, pumpkin seed cake, or spirulina (Arthrospira platensis), resulting in about 226 g crude protein (CP)/kg concentrate dry matter (DM) and 158 g CP/kg total diet DM. A grain-based concentrate providing just 135 g CP/kg concentrate DM and 139 g CP/total diet DM served as a negative control. Bulls of all groups had comparable average daily gains (1.43 ± 0.1 kg) and feed intakes (6.92 ± 0.37 kg). Carcass and meat quality did not differ among groups. The fatty acid profile of meat lipids was hardly affected. These results indicate that soybean meal can be replaced by any of the tested protein sources without impairing performance or meat quality. Importantly, bulls fed the negative control achieved a fattening and slaughter performance comparable to that of the protein-supplemented groups without affecting meat and adipose tissue quality. Thus, the present findings suggest that feeding crossbred bulls a grass/maize-silage based diet does not require additional protein supplementation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000487521",,"2076-2615",,"10.3390/ani11061588","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/487521","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","beef cattle||Alternative protein sources||fatty acids||grass silage||sustainable production systems||microalgae","Soybean Meal Can Be Replaced by Faba Beans, Pumpkin Seed Cake, Spirulina or Be Completely Omitted in a Forage-Based Diet for Fattening Bulls to Achieve Comparable Performance, Carcass and Meat Quality",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-31T08:16:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85106051417",,"000665476000001",,"6","Animals","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In mature forests, this interlinkage and how it is impacted by drought is still poorly understood. Here, we pulse‐labelled 100‐year‐old trees with 13CO2 within a 15‐year‐long irrigation experiment in a naturally dry pine forest to quantify how drought regime affects the transfer and use of assimilates from trees to the rhizosphere and associated microbial communities. It took 4 days until new 13C‐labelled assimilates were allocated to the rhizosphere. One year later, the 13C signal of the 3‐h long pulse labelling was still detectable in stem and soil respiration, which provides evidence that parts of the assimilates are stored in trees before they are used for metabolic processes in the rhizosphere. Irrigation removing the natural water stress reduced the mean C residence time from canopy uptake until soil respiration from 89 to 40 days. Moreover, irrigation increased the amount of assimilates transferred to and respired in the soil within the first 10 days by 370%. A small precipitation event rewetting surface soils altered this pattern rapidly and reduced the effect size to +35%. Microbial biomass incorporated 46 ± 5% and 31 ± 7% of the C used in the rhizosphere in the dry control and irrigation treatment respectively. Mapping the spatial distribution of soil‐respired 13CO2 around the 10 pulse‐labelled trees showed that tree rhizospheres extended laterally 2.8 times beyond tree canopies, implying that there is a strong overlap of the rhizosphere among adjacent trees. Irrigation increased the rhizosphere area by 60%, which gives evidence of a long‐term acclimation of trees and their rhizosphere to the drought regime. The moisture‐sensitive transfer and use of C in the rhizosphere has consequences for C allocation within trees, soil microbial communities and soil carbon storage.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000475516",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15557","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/475516","en","Blackwell Science","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Carbon allocation||Climate change||Drought||Forest||Isotope tracing||Mean||Residence time||Rhizosphere||Roots||Soil respiration","Drought alters the carbon footprint of trees in soils—tracking the spatio-temporal fate of 13C-labelled assimilates in the soil of an old-growth pine forest",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-19T18:34:30Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102699359",,"000630533500001","Glob.

AB is a serious apple disease, mostly in low input orchards and in cider production areas in Northern Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. However, the epidemiology and population genetic structure of this pathogen is unknown.  Methods We developed twelve Dc-specific microsatellite markers and screened DNA of both pure fungal isolates and infected apple leaves. The marker data of 313 European samples of Dc were compared to Dc isolates from Asia (n = 7) and the USA (n = 3).  Results We found 31 distinct multilocus genotypes (MLGs) in European samples, and seven additional MLGs in the Asian and USA samples. The European samples had the typical genetic signature of a recently introduced species including high clonality, a low number of private alleles and one dominant MLG across all the sampling sites. All European MLGs were genetically distant from those MLGs of Asian and USA origin. Based on the lack of linkage disequilibrium observed, there is evidence that Dc undergoes regular cycles of sexual recombination in the European population, although the sexual stage (apothecia) has not been observed in Europe.  Conclusions The twelve newly developed SSR markers reported here provide a useful tool to characterize the population genetic diversity and structure of Dc in Europe. Our study supports the hypothesis that Dc is a recently introduced pathogen in Europe, but of currently unknown origin. Dc has a large effective population size during field epidemics, so we believe that the pathogen has substantial evolutionary potential. Application of the SSR markers to large-scale and diverse Dc samples will help to better understand the epidemiology of AB, which has become a global apple disease, and will help guide effective mitigation strategies based on disease management and resistance breeding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000498811",,"2662-4044",,"10.1186/s43170-021-00039-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/498811","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Apple blotch||Diplocarpon coronariae syn.

These yield advantages have often been attributed to complementary resource use, but few studies quantified the temporal complementarity of nutrient acquisition and biomass production. Our understanding of how nutrient uptake rates of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) and biomass accumulation change throughout the growing season and between different neighbors is limited. We conducted weekly destructive harvests to measure temporal trajectories of N and P uptake and biomass production in three crop species (oat, lupin, and camelina) growing either as isolated single plants, in monocultures or as intercrops. Additionally, we quantified organic acid exudation in the rhizosphere and biological N2-fixation of lupin throughout the growing season. Logistic models were fitted to characterize nutrient acquisition and biomass accumulation trajectories. Nutrient uptake and biomass accumulation trajectories were curtailed by competitive interactions, resulting in earlier peak rates and lower total accumulated nutrients and biomass compared to cultivation as isolated single plants. Different pathways led to overyielding in the two mixtures. The oat–camelina mixture was characterized by a shift from belowground temporal niche partitioning of resource uptake to aboveground competition for light during the growing season. The oat–lupin mixture showed strong competitive interactions, where lupin eventually overyielded due to reliance on atmospheric N and stronger competitiveness for soil P compared to oat. Synthesis: This study demonstrates temporal shifts to earlier peak rates of plants growing with neighbors compared to those growing alone, with changes in uptake patterns suggesting that observed temporal shifts in our experiment were driven by competitive interactions rather than active plant behavior to reduce competition. The two differing pathways to overyielding in the two mixtures highlight the importance of examining temporal dynamics in intercropping systems to understand the underlying mechanisms of overyielding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000490215",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2021.668803","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/490215","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Cumulative biomass accumulation||Instantaneous nutrient uptake rates||Intercropping||Nitrogen||Phosphorous||Plant–plant interactions||Temporal dynamics||Root exudates","Temporal Differentiation of Resource Capture and Biomass Accumulation as a Driver of Yield Increase in Intercropping",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-18T03:43:37Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Ecology and evolution in practice: A plant–plant interaction-based approach to the evolution of biodiversity effects on productivity","170645","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,"85107544290",,"000659908100001","Front.

This system is under threat from, amongst others, a range of climate related shocks, including extreme weather events as well as more gradual stressors, such as changing rainfall patterns. The impacts of climate related shocks and stressors to the global food system, such as loss of income and hunger, are unequally distributed between food system actors with smallholder farmers (an incredibly diverse yet globally significant grouping) being particularly vulnerable. Increasingly, many smallholder farmers are embedded in global food value chains (GFVCs), producing crops for export, including fruits, vegetables and non-food commodities. GFVCs are international networks of actors that interact at the various stages (production, processing, distribution, retailing and consumption) of the food system. However, little is understood about how farmers engaged in GFVCs are affected by climate shocks and how the impacts are influenced by their participation in a GFVC. Resilience, the ability of a system to cope with shocks and maintain overall function, has emerged as a potentially useful concept for guiding the governance and management of food systems in the face of these evolving threats. Within the broader field of resilience, climate resilience is emerging as a priority topic in smallholder food production in the Global South. This thesis seeks to understand how climate shocks impact smallholders engaged in GFVCs and elicit ways to enhance the climate resilience of the vulnerable actors in these systems.  I created three linked objectives for this thesis : (i) Co-define, with stakeholders, “climate resilience” of smallholder farmers in GFVCs. (ii) Assess the climate resilience of smallholder farmers and its determinants in GFVCs. (iii) Assess and explore different opportunities to enhance climate resilience of smallholders in GFVCs. To operationalise these objectives, I investigated two smallholder driven GFVCs, that share many characteristics, such as polarisation of actor power and climate hazard exposure, but also have some key ecological and institutional contrasts. These are the Ghanaian - Swiss cocoa value chain and the Dominican Republic - UK banana value chain. Both of these GFVCs face regular and intensifying climate threats, with a severe shock being experienced in both GFVCs between 2015 and 2017. As a result of the El Niño oscillation in 2015 there was a strong drought experienced by cocoa farmers in Ghana during the 2015-16 production season. Contrastingly, banana farmers in the Dominican Republic were exposed to severe flood damage caused by two consecutive  hurricanes, Irma and Maria, in September 2017. These climate shocks are the focus of my thesis.  To deliver on the objectives, I adopted (with many crucial collaborations) a four-phase approach: (i) Value chain stakeholder platform establishment, (ii) Characterising climate risks and co-defining climate resilience, (iii) Resilience assessment of smallholder producers in the context of GFVCs, (iv) Exploration of resilience enhancement opportunities. In each value chain, I utilise an overall transdisciplinary research approach, involving multiple methods including; multi-stakeholder workshops, focus groups, value-chain-actor interviews, household surveys, biophysical on farm assessments and satellite remote sensing. Chapter 2 takes the case of the 2015-16 drought shock, to cocoa production in Ghana, to examine whether sustainability certification, namely Organic, UTZ and Rainforest Alliance, can deliver climate resilience for smallholder farmers. In Chapter 3, I again take the case of cocoa producers but move beyond comparison of certification impacts to address the question: What determines the adoption of climate resilience strategies by smallholder farmers? In Chapter 4, taking the Dominican Republic banana case, I ask: What determines the resilience of smallholder farmers embedded in GFVCs to extreme weather events? I address four specific research questions; (i) How are smallholder farmers impacted by hurricane induced flooding? (ii) What actions or strategies do the actors of this GFVC adopt to enhance their climate resilience? (iii) How quickly did farmers recover? and (iv) What determined recovery rates?  Across the banana and cocoa value chains, I find that for climate resilience strategies to be effective they must be both generalisable across diverse (even unknown) threats, whilst also incorporating specificity versus key hazards. This is challenged by the fact that farmer agency relating to resilience strategy utilisation is scale-limited, exemplified by them having little power to act at a landscape scale. Moreover, resilience enhancing strategies are more than just the sum of their parts and therefore, both synergistic and antagonistic, interactions must be considered in their design and promotion. In particular, in relation to GFVCs, climate resilience strategies are not, by default, benevolent and important inter-actor tradeoffs occur, such as traders switching sourcing locations in the face of a shock. I find multiple determinants of climate resilience strategy adoption, including land tenure, income generating capacity and farm scale. Relatedly, I find access to markets for alternative agricultural products is key to developing climate resilient multifunctional agricultural systems. Additionally, the sub-national regional context strongly moderates climate resilience strategy adoption and extreme-weather-shock outcomes and, therefore, should be accommodated in policy and programme design. In terms of mechanisms to enhance the climate resilience of smallholders in GFVCs, certification has the potential to modify smallholder climate resilience but underperforms on the uptake of complex versus simple measures because of a strong commodity focus. I find that climate specific training enhances climate resilience strategy uptake but targeting is key to avoid smaller scale farmers being left behind. Spatial planning at a landscape scale, such as zoning using flood risk maps, can enhance climate resilience and should be pursued as a powerful resilience enhancing tool. Overall, participating in GFVCs is a “double-edged sword” for smallholders’ climate resilience and, therefore, cooperation must be enhanced, for example via mechanisms to increase basin-scale collaboration and trader loyalty, so as to reduce the tradeoffs involved.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504801",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504801","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","sustainable agriculture||food systems||climate change||resilience","Enhancing smallholder farmer climate resilience in cocoa and banana global food value chains",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-09-08T13:21:28Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27595",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A Hereford-based assembly is the widely accepted bovine reference genome. Haplotype-resolved genomes that exceed the current bovine reference genome in quality and continuity have been assembled for different breeds of cattle. Using whole genome sequencing data of 161 Brown Swiss cattle, we compared the accuracy of read mapping and sequence variant genotyping as well as downstream genomic analyses between the bovine reference genome (ARS-UCD1.2) and a highly continuous Angus-based assembly (UOA_Angus_1).  Results Read mapping accuracy did not differ notably between the ARS-UCD1.2 and UOA_Angus_1 assemblies. We discovered 22,744,517 and 22,559,675 high-quality variants from ARS-UCD1.2 and UOA_Angus_1, respectively. The concordance between sequence- and array-called genotypes was high and the number of variants deviating from Hardy-Weinberg proportions was low at segregating sites for both assemblies. More artefactual INDELs were genotyped from UOA_Angus_1 than ARS-UCD1.2 alignments. Using the composite likelihood ratio test, we detected 40 and 33 signatures of selection from ARS-UCD1.2 and UOA_Angus_1, respectively, but the overlap between both assemblies was low. Using the 161 sequenced Brown Swiss cattle as a reference panel, we imputed sequence variant genotypes into a mapping cohort of 30,499 cattle that had microarray-derived genotypes using a two-step imputation approach. The accuracy of imputation (Beagle R2) was very high (0.87) for both assemblies. Genome-wide association studies between imputed sequence variant genotypes and six dairy traits as well as stature produced almost identical results from both assemblies.  Conclusions The ARS-UCD1.2 and UOA_Angus_1 assemblies are suitable for reference-guided genome analyses in Brown Swiss cattle. Although differences in read mapping and genotyping accuracy between both assemblies are negligible, the choice of the reference genome has a large impact on detecting signatures of selection that already reached fixation using the composite likelihood ratio test. We developed a workflow that can be adapted and reused to compare the impact of reference genomes on genome analyses in various breeds, populations and species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000486920",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-021-07554-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/486920","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Reference genome comparison||Bovine||Alignment quality||Sequence variants||Functional annotation||Signatures of selection||Genome-wide association study","Investigating the impact of reference assembly choice on genomic analyses in a cattle breed",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-27T10:49:25Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Compiling a population-specific haplotype reference panel to facilitate the fine-mapping of pleiotropic QTL in cattle||Identification of functionally active genomic features relevant to phenotypic diversity and plasticity in cattle","185229||815668","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","H2020||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85106231257",,"000658378100002","BMC Genomics","1","BMC Genomics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, linear reference genomes are imperfect, lacking millions of bases of unknown relevance and are unable to reflect the genetic diversity of populations. This makes reference-guided methods susceptible to reference-allele bias. To overcome such limitations, we build a pangenome from six reference-quality assemblies from taurine and indicine cattle as well as yak. The pangenome contains an additional 70,329,827 bases compared to the Bos taurus reference genome. Our multiassembly approach reveals 30 and 10.1 million bases private to yak and indicine cattle, respectively, and between 3.3 and 4.4 million bases unique to each taurine assembly. Utilizing transcriptomes from 56 cattle, we show that these nonreference sequences encode transcripts that hitherto remained undetected from the B. taurus reference genome. We uncover genes, primarily encoding proteins contributing to immune response and pathogen-mediated immunomodulation, differentially expressed between Mycobacterium bovis-infected and noninfected cattle that are also undetectable in the B. taurus reference genome. Using whole-genome sequencing data of cattle from five breeds, we show that reads which were previously misaligned against the Bos taurus reference genome now align accurately to the pangenome sequences. This enables us to discover 83,250 polymorphic sites that segregate within and between breeds of cattle and capture genetic differentiation across breeds. Our work makes a so-far unused source of variation amenable to genetic investigations and provides methods and a framework for establishing and exploiting a more diverse reference genome.",,,,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2101056118","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/485851","en","National Academy of Sciences",,,"pangenome||genome graphs||reference genome||genetic diversity","Novel functional sequences uncovered through a bovine multiassembly graph",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-05-22T03:52:41Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Compiling a population-specific haplotype reference panel to facilitate the fine-mapping of pleiotropic QTL in cattle","185229","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85105768228",,,"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","20","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","118","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Maintaining multiple sexually selected traits is likely to be metabolically costly, potentially resulting in trade-offs in the evolution of male signals. However, a phylogenetic framework to test hypotheses regarding the evolution and maintenance of male sexual traits in Eumaeini has been lacking. Here, we infer a comprehensive, time-calibrated phylogeny from 379 loci for 187 species representing 91% of the 87 described genera. Eumaeini is a monophyletic group that originated in the late Oligocene and underwent rapid radiation in the Neotropics. We examined specimens of 818 of the 1096 described species (75%) and found that secondary sexual traits are present in males of 91% of the surveyed species. Scent pads and scent patches on the wings and brush organs associated with the genitalia were probably present in the common ancestor of Eumaeini and are widespread throughout the tribe. Brush organs and scent pads are negatively correlated across the phylogeny, exhibiting a trade-off in which lineages with brush organs are unlikely to regain scent pads and vice versa. In contrast, scent patches seem to facilitate the evolution of scent pads, although they are readily lost once scent pads have evolved. Our results illustrate the complex interplay between natural and sexual selection in the origin and maintenance of multiple male secondary sexual characteristics and highlight the potential role of sexual selection spurring diversification in this lineage.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000485854",,"0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2020.2512","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/485854","en","Royal Society of London","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","brush organ||insect phylogenetics||scent pad||scent patch||sexual selection","Evolutionary trade-offs between male secondary sexual traits revealed by a phylogeny of the hyperdiverse tribe Eumaeini (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-22T03:53:06Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85105767750",,"000710446000011","Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1950","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","288","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We analyzed plant-herbivore networks based on literature-derived interactions and long-term sampling from 289 grasslands and forests in three regions of Germany. Network size and nestedness were the most important determinants of network robustness in both ecosystems. Along land-use intensity gradients, networks in moderately grazed grasslands were more robust than in those managed by frequent mowing or fertilization.

Using a global compilation of high-frequency CO2 measurements, we demonstrate that nocturnal CO2 emissions are on average 27% (0.9 gC m−2 d−1) greater than those estimated from diurnal concentrations alone. Constraints on light availability due to canopy shading or water colour are the principal controls on observed diel (24 hour) variation, suggesting this nocturnal increase arises from daytime fixation of CO2 by photosynthesis. Because current global estimates of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from running waters (0.65–1.8 PgC yr−1) rely primarily on discrete measurements of dissolved CO2 obtained during the day, they substantially underestimate the magnitude of this flux.

The microalga spirulina has shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in monogastric species. To investigate potential beneficial effects in ruminants, we replaced soybean meal (SOY) in the diets of dairy cows and fattening bulls by spirulina (SPI) and analyzed plasma concentrations of antioxidants (β-carotene, α-tocopherol, polyphenols) and serum total antioxidant capacity. Following in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated for expression analysis of inflammation-and antioxidant-defense-related genes. Plasma β-carotene concentration was higher in SPI, compared to SOY cows, but did not differ in bulls. Plasma total phenol concentration was significantly higher in SPI, compared to SOY bulls, but not in cows. Stimulation of bovine PBMCs with LPS increased the expression of most cytokines and some antioxidant enzymes. Gene expression of PBMCs derived from SPI animals, compared to SOY animals, hardly differed. Our results indicate that in ruminants, spirulina might not have potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Future studies should evaluate the microbial degradation of spirulina and its bioactive compounds in the rumen to provide further data on potential beneficial health effects in ruminants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000487430",,"2076-3921",,"10.3390/antiox10050814","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/487430","en","MDPI AG","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","microalgae||Spirulina||inflammation||lipopolysaccharide||dairy cows||Fattening bulls||leukocytes","Antioxidant and inflammatory gene expression profiles of bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to arthrospira platensis before and after lps challenge",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-29T02:34:48Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85106036926",,"000653339200001",,"5","Antioxidants","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Forage grass research can also benefit from this revolution, enabling progress in population genetic studies, functional biology, and genomics-assisted breeding. Due to its large genome size and high repeat content, so far only incomplete and fragmented assemblies are available for the grasses of the Lolium and Festuca species complex.  Findings Here, we report a highly contiguous draft assembly of Italian ryegrass (L. multiflorum Lam.), spanning 4.5 Gb and with a N50 of 3 Mb, containing ~70,000 gene models. Thanks to its relatedness to barley, 78% of the assembly was anchored on seven pseudomolecules. The high heterozygosity of the plant allowed obtaining a diploid assembly – i.e. across 95% of the assembly, both alleles were assembled on separate sequences. This feature allowed unraveling a very high amount of intergenic sequence variation between allelic sequences.  Conclusions We present a nearly complete genome assembly of a genotype used in contemporary Swiss forage grass breeding programs. This work shows how genomic research has improved, allowing to decode the genetic code of large, complex, and heterozygous plants. It also allows the functional characterization of the ryegrass gene repertoire and the large-scale development of molecular markers. Furthermore, it paves the road for a reference-based characterization and exploitation of the genetic variation within the Lolium and Festuca species complex.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519806",,,,"10.1101/2021.05.05.442707","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519806","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Lolium||genome assembly||diploid||forage grass||Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.)","Evidence for high intergenic sequence variation in heterozygous Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) genome revealed by a high-quality draft diploid genome assembly",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2021-12-09T10:42:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, questions remain about the extent to which SOM quality and quantity along the soil profile may change under future warming. In this study we assessed how +4 °C whole-soil warming affected the quantity and quality of SOM down to 90 cm depth in a mixed-coniferous temperate forest using biomarker analyses. Our findings indicate that 4.5 years of soil warming led to divergent responses in subsoils (>20 cm) as compared to surface soils. Warming enhanced the accumulation of plant-derived n-alkanes over the whole soil profile. In the subsoil, this was at the expense of plant- and microorganism-derived fatty acids, and the relative abundance of SOM molecular components shifted from less microbially transformed to more transformed organic matter. Fine root mass declined by 24.0 ± 7.5% with warming over the whole soil profile, accompanied by reduced plant-derived inputs and accelerated decomposition of aromatic compounds and plant-derived fatty acids in the subsoils. Our study suggests that warming accelerated microbial decomposition of plant-derived inputs, leaving behind more degraded organic matter. The non-uniform, and depth dependent SOM composition and warming response implies that subsoil carbon cycling is as sensitive and complex as in surface soils.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474255",,"0038-0717||1879-3428",,"10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108185","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474255","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Whole soil warming||Deep soil organic matter||Biomarker||Alkanes||Fatty acids||Decomposition","Warming promotes loss of subsoil carbon through accelerated degradation of plant-derived organic matter",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-13T04:35:51Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102077030",,"000640189100039","Soil biol. biochem.",,"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","156","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation worldwide require the formation of new concepts of ecological restoration and rehabilitation aimed at improving ecosystem functions, services, and biodiversity conservation in cities. Although relict sites of natural and semi-natural ecosystems can be found in urban areas, environmental conditions and species composition of most urban ecosystems are highly modified, inducing the development of novel and hybrid ecosystems. A consequence of this ecological novelty is the lack of (semi-) natural reference systems available for defining restoration targets and assessing restoration success in urban areas. This hampers the implementation of ecological restoration in cities. In consideration of these challenges, we present a new conceptual framework that provides guidance and support for urban ecological restoration and rehabilitation by formulating restoration targets for different levels of ecological novelty (i.e., historic, hybrid, and novel ecosystems). To facilitate the restoration and rehabilitation of novel urban ecosystems, we recommend using established species-rich and well-functioning urban ecosystems as reference. Such urban reference systems are likely to be present in many cities. Highlighting their value in comparison to degraded ecosystems can stimulate and guide restoration initiatives. As urban restoration approaches must consider local history and site conditions, as well as citizens’ needs, it may also be advisable to focus the restoration of strongly altered urban ecosystems on select ecosystem functions, services and/or biodiversity values. Ecosystem restoration and rehabilitation in cities can be either relatively inexpensive or costly, but even expensive measures can pay off when they effectively improve ecosystem services such as climate change mitigation or recreation. Successful re‐shaping and re-thinking of urban greenspace by involving citizens and other stakeholders will help to make our cities more sustainable in the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000470470",,"1439-1791||1618-0089",,"10.1016/j.baae.2021.02.010","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/470470","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"A conceptual framework for urban ecological restoration and rehabilitation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-19T09:16:15Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102422311",,"000632620000008","Basic Appl.

All herbage from the first cut of a grassland dominated by perennial ryegrass was harvested on the same day and preserved either as hay or silage. The first regrowth of the same plot was used for strip grazing or green feeding indoors. Balanced by breed, 24 Montbéliarde and 24 Holstein cows were allocated to the 4 treatments. Apart from the forages, the late-lactation cows received 3 kg/d of dry matter from concentrate. After 2 wk of dietary adaptation, the bulk milk of 3 subgroups, each with 4 cows, was collected. Part of the milk was pasteurized, and part was left raw and partly transformed to small-sized Cantal-type cheese ripened for 9 wk. Milk and cheese underwent descriptive sensory analysis by a trained sensory panel, as well as analyses of physicochemical traits. Volatile organic compounds of the cheeses were also analyzed. Raw and pasteurized milk from hay-fed cows had less intense odors of cooked milk, cream, and barnyard than milk from grazing cows, whereby the effect of pasteurization did not differ between herbage utilization methods. Cheeses obtained from cows fed fresh herbage (grazing and indoors) were clearly yellower than cheeses from silage- and hay-fed cows, which coincided with the color intensity perceived by the panelists. Moreover, cheeses from cows fed fresh herbage had more intense barnyard and dry fruit flavors, were perceived as creamier and having less lactic odor, and exhibited more fat exudation than those from cows fed conserved herbage. Only a few differences were observed in milk and cheeses from hay-fed compared with silage-fed cows, and those differences were far less pronounced than those of milk and cheeses from cows fed fresh herbage. In conclusion, the present study did not substantiate assumptions of clear sensory differences of milk and uncooked pressed cheese from hay-fed compared with silage-fed cows. For the first time, this study reports that the global flavor intensity of cheeses from indoor green-fed cows is similar to that of cheeses derived from cows fed conserved forages, whereas cheeses from grazing cows have the greatest global flavor intensity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000480374",,"0022-0302||1525-3198",,"10.3168/jds.2020-19738","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/480374","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","herbage utilization method||dairy cow||milk sensory profile||cheese sensory profile","Feeding cows with hay, silage, or fresh herbage on pasture or indoors affects sensory properties and chemical composition of milk and cheese",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-25T08:41:02Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102112653",,"000642287000014","J.

Dew and radiation fog occur in combination during clear and calm nights, and both use ambient water vapor as a source. Research on the combined mechanisms involved in NRW inputs to ecosystems is rare, and distillation of water vapor from the soil as a NRW input pathway for dew formation has hardly been studied. Furthermore, eddy covariance (EC) measurements are associated with large uncertainties on clear, calm nights when dew and radiation fog occur. The aim of this paper is thus to use stable isotopes as tracers to investigate the different NRW input pathways into a temperate Swiss grassland at Chamau during dry spells in summer 2018. Stable isotopes provide additional information on the pathways from water vapor to liquid water (dew and fog) that cannot be measured otherwise. We measured the isotopic composition (δ18O, δ2H, and d=δ2H−8⋅δ18O) of ambient water vapor, NRW droplets on leaf surfaces, and soil moisture and combined them with EC and meteorological observations during one dew-only and two combined dew and radiation fog events. The ambient water vapor d was found to be strongly linked with local surface relative humidity (r=−0.94), highlighting the dominant role of local moisture as a source for ambient water vapor in the synoptic context of the studied dry spells. Detailed observations of the temporal evolution of the ambient water vapor and foliage NRW isotopic signals suggest two different NRW input pathways: (1) the downward pathway through the condensation of ambient water vapor and (2) the upward pathway through the distillation of water vapor from soil onto foliage. We employed a simple two-end-member mixing model using δ18O and δ2H to quantify the NRW inputs from these two different sources. With this approach, we found that distillation contributed 9 %–42 % to the total foliage NRW, which compares well with estimates derived from a near-surface vertical temperature gradient method proposed by Monteith in 1957. The dew and radiation fog potentially produced 0.17–0.54 mm d−1 NRW gain on foliage, thereby constituting a non-negligible water flux to the canopy, as compared to the evapotranspiration of 2.7 mm d−1. Our results thus underline the importance of NRW inputs to temperate grasslands during dry spells and reveal the complexity of the local water cycle in such conditions, including different pathways of dew and radiation fog water inputs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484997",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-25-2617-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484997","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The role of dew and radiation fog inputs in the local water cycling of a temperate grassland during dry spells in central Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-19T14:38:30Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The importance of fog and dew for Swiss grasslands today and in the future (Acronym: IFDewS)","175733","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85106673448",,"000654339500003","Hydrol.

Facilitation by nurse plants increases understorey diversity and supports ecological communities. In turn, biodiversity shapes ecological networks and enhances ecosystem functioning. However, whether and how facilitation and increased biodiversity jointly influence community structure and ecosystem functioning remains unclear. 2. We performed a field experiment disentangling the relative contribution of nurse plants and increasing understorey plant diversity in driving pollination interactions. Both the presence of nurse shrubs and increased understorey plant diversity increased pollinator diversity and visitation rates. While nurse and understorey diversity effects on pollinator visitation rates did not interact, the effects of increasing understorey plant diversity on pollinator diversity were stronger in the absence than in the presence of shrubs, meaning that nurse shrubs attenuated the effects of high understorey diversity and buffered the effects of low understorey diversity. 3. We also found positive complementarity effects among understorey species as well as complementarity between nurse plants and understorey species at high diversity. Results also indicate negative selection effects, suggesting that species with generally few pollinators benefit the most in the polyculture while a species (possibly the nurse plant) with generally lots of pollinators does not. The corresponding changes in pollination networks with the experimental treatments were due to both changes in the frequency of visits and turnover in pollinator community composition. 4. Synthesis. Plant–plant facilitative systems, where a nurse plant increases understorey plant diversity, are common in stressful environments. Here, we show that these facilitative systems positively influence mutualistic interactions with pollinators via both direct nurse effects and indirect positive effects of increasing plant diversity. Conserving and supporting nurse plant systems is crucial not only for maintaining plant diversity but also for supporting ecosystem functions and services.",,,,"0022-0477",,"10.1111/1365-2745.13593","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/469825","en","Wiley",,,"cooperation||ecosystem functioning and services||leguminous shrubs||mutualism||nurse plants||plant–plant–insect interactions||pollination||Retama sphaerocarpa","Facilitation and biodiversity jointly drive mutualistic networks",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-02-17T03:46:29Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Ecology and evolution in practice: A plant–plant interaction-based approach to the evolution of biodiversity effects on productivity","170645","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,"85100174699",,"000613858700001","J.

Canopy structure is an important driver of the energy budget of grassland ecosystem and is, at the same time, altered by plant diversity. Diverse plant communities typically have taller and more densely packed canopies than less diverse communities. With this, they absorb more radiation, have a higher transpiring leaf surface and are better coupled to the atmosphere which leads to cooler canopy surfaces. However, whether plant diversity generally translates into a cooling potential remains unclear and lacks empirical evidence. Here, we assessed how functional identity, functional diversity, and species richness of grassland communities in the Jena Experiment predict the mean and variation of plant surface temperature mediated via effects of canopy structure.  2.    Using terrestrial laser scanning, we estimated canopy structure describing metrics of vertical structure (mean height, LAI), the distribution (evenness), and the highest allocation (center of gravity) of biomass along height strata. As metrics of horizontal structure, we considered community stand gaps, canopy surface variation and emergent flowers. We measured surface temperature with a thermal camera. We used SEM models to predict biodiversity effects on the surface temperature during two seasonal peaks of biomass.  3.    Before the first cut in May, herb‐dominated communities directly promoted lower leaf surface temperatures. However, communities with lower center of gravity (mostly herb‐dominated) also increased canopy surface temperatures compared with grass‐dominated communities with higher biomass stored in the top canopy. Grass‐dominated communities showed a smaller variation of surface temperatures, which was also positively affected by species richness via an increase in mean height. In August, mean surface temperature decreased with increasing community clumpiness and LAI. The variation of surface temperature was greater in herb‐dominated than in grass‐dominated communities and increased with plant species richness (direct effects).  4.    Synthesis: The mean and variation of canopy surface temperature were driven by differences in functional group composition (herbs‐ vs. grass dominance) and to a lesser extent by plant diversity. These effects were partly mediated the metrics of canopy structure but also by direct effects unrelated to the structural metrics considered.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000471936",,"0022-0477",,"10.1111/1365-2745.13631","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/471936","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","community canopy structure||facilitation||grassland||sampling effects||surface temperature||terrestrial laser scanning||thermal regulation","Biodiversity facets affect community surface temperature via 3D canopy structure in grassland communities",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-26T10:07:50Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102202183",,"000626554500001","J.

We review the need for increasing agricultural sustainability, how this can in part be delivered by positive biodiversity–ecosystem function (BEF) effects, the role within these of plant–plant facilitation, and how a better understanding of this role may help to deliver sustainable crop (particularly arable) production systems.  2.    Major challenges facing intensive arable production include overall declines in biodiversity, poor soil structure and health, nutrient and soil particle run-off, high greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing costs of synthetic inputs including herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers.  3.    Biodiversity–ecosystem function effects have the potential to deliver win–wins for arable food production, whereby enhanced biodiversity is associated with ‘good outcomes’ for farming sustainability, albeit sometimes through negative BEF effects for some components of the system. Although it can be difficult to separate explicitly from niche differentiation, evidence indicates facilitation can be a key component of these BEF effects.  4.    Explicit recognition of facilitation's role brings benefits to developing sustainable crop systems. First, it allows us to link fundamental ecological studies on the evolution of facilitation to the selection of traits that can enhance functioning in crop mixtures. Second, it provides us with analytical frameworks which can be used to bring structure and testable hypotheses to data derived from multiple (often independent) crop trials.  5.    Before concrete guidance can be provided to the agricultural sector as to how facilitation might be enhanced in crop systems, challenges exist with respect to quantifying facilitation, understanding the traits that maximise facilitation and integrating these traits into breeding programmes, components of an approach we suggest could be termed ‘Functional Ecological Selection’.  6.    Synthesis. Ultimately, better integration between ecologists and crop scientists will be essential in harnessing the benefits of ecological knowledge for developing more sustainable agriculture. We need to focus on understanding the mechanistic basis of strong facilitative interactions in crop systems and using this information to select and breed for improved combinations of genotypes and species as part of the Functional Ecological Selection approach.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000485518",,"0022-0477",,"10.1111/1365-2745.13592","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/485518","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships||Crop breeding||functional ecological selection||pest and disease resistance||plant–plant facilitation||review||soil nutrients||sustainable crop production","Facilitation and biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships in crop production systems and their role in sustainable farming",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-21T02:24:59Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Designing innovative plant teams for ecosystem resilience and agricultural sustainability||Ecology and evolution in practice: A plant–plant interaction-based approach to the evolution of biodiversity effects on productivity","727284||170645","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF","H2020||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,"85100859550",,"000617935200001","J.

However, effects of aberrant epigenetic reprogramming on gene expression compromise cell and organ phenotype, resulting in low success rate of SCNT. Standard SCNT procedures include enucleation of recipient oocytes before the nuclear donor cell is introduced. Enucleation removes not only the spindle apparatus and chromosomes of the oocyte but also the perinuclear, mitochondria rich, ooplasm. Here, we use a Bos taurus SCNT model with in vitro fertilized (IVF) and in vivo conceived controls to demonstrate a ∼50% reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the liver and skeletal muscle, but not the brain, of SCNT fetuses at day 80 of gestation. In the muscle, we also observed significantly reduced transcript abundances of mtDNA-encoded subunits of the respiratory chain. Importantly, mtDNA content and mtDNA transcript abundances correlate with hepatomegaly and muscle hypertrophy of SCNT fetuses. Expression of selected nuclear-encoded genes pivotal for mtDNA replication was similar to controls, arguing against an indirect epigenetic nuclear reprogramming effect on mtDNA amount. We conclude that mtDNA depletion is a major signature of perturbations after SCNT. We further propose that mitochondrial perturbation in interaction with incomplete nuclear reprogramming drives abnormal epigenetic features and correlated phenotypes, a concept supported by previously reported effects of mtDNA depletion on the epigenome and the pleiotropic phenotypic effects of mtDNA depletion in humans. This provides a novel perspective on the reprogramming process and opens new avenues to improve SCNT protocols for healthy embryo and tissue development.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488674",,"2296-634X",,"10.3389/fcell.2021.664099","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488674","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nuclear transfer||Mitochondrial DNA depletion||Mitochondrial gene expression||Fetal tissues||Bovine","Mitochondrial DNA Depletion in Granulosa Cell Derived Nuclear Transfer Tissues",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-08T02:37:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85107037932",,"000655358100001","Front.

Their activity is generally measured in soil extracts, and thus, it remains uncertain how mobile these enzymes are and to which extent they can be translocated within the soil profile. The presence of phosphomonoesterases in soil solutions potentially affects the share of labile dissolved organic P (DOP), which in turn would affect P leaching. Our study aimed at assessing the production and leaching of phosphomonoesterases from organic layers and topsoil horizons in forest soils and its potential effect on dissolved P forms in leachates obtained from zero-tension lysimeters. We measured phosphomonoesterase activities in leached soil solutions and compared it with those in water extracts from litter, Oe/Oa, and A horizons of two beech forests with a contrasting nitrogen (N) and P availability, subjected to experimental N x P fertilization. In addition, we determined phosphate and DOP. In soil solutions leached from litter, Oe/Oa, and A horizons, phosphomonoesterase activities ranged from 2 to 8 mu mol L-1 h(-1) during summer, but remained below detection limits in winter. The summer values represent 0.1-1% of the phosphomonoesterase activity in soil extracts, indicating that enzymes can be translocated from organic layers and topsoils to greater soil depths. Activities of phosphomonoesterases obtained by water extracts were greater in the organic layer of the P-poor site, while activities of those in soil solutions were similar at the two sites. Nitrogen addition increased phosphomonoesterase activities in leached soil solutions of the organic layer of the N- and P-poor soil. Using a modeling approach, we estimated that approx. 76% of the initial labile DOP was hydrolyzed to dissolved inorganic P within the first 24 h. Back calculations from measured labile DOP revealed an underestimation of approx. 15% of total dissolved P, or 0.03 mg L-1. The observed leaching of phosphomonoesterases implies that labile organic P could be hydrolyzed in deeper soil horizons and that extended sample storage leads to an underestimation of the contribution of DOP to total dissolved P leaching. This has been neglected in the few field studies measuring DOP leaching.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494790",,"2624-893X",,"10.3389/ffgc.2021.684069","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494790","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","dissolved organic phosphorus||N x P fertilization experiment||hydrolysis||leaching||phosphate||sample storage||organic layers","Leaching of Phosphomonoesterase Activities in Beech Forest Soils: Consequences for Phosphorus Forms and Mobility",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T10:21:55Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000661162400001",,,"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using this approach, we selected 70 key ancestors from two lines of the Swiss Large White breed that have been selected divergently for fertility and fattening traits and sequenced their genomes with short paired-end reads.  Results Using pedigree records, we estimated the effective population size of the dam and sire line to 72 and 44, respectively. In order to assess sequence variation in both lines, we sequenced the genomes of 70 boars at an average coverage of 16.69-fold. The boars explained 87.95 and 95.35% of the genetic diversity of the breeding populations of the dam and sire line, respectively. Reference-guided variant discovery using the GATK revealed 26,862,369 polymorphic sites. Principal component, admixture and fixation index (FST) analyses indicated considerable genetic differentiation between the lines. Genomic inbreeding quantified using runs of homozygosity was higher in the sire than dam line (0.28 vs 0.26). Using two complementary approaches, we detected 51 signatures of selection. However, only six signatures of selection overlapped between both lines. We used the sequenced haplotypes of the 70 key ancestors as a reference panel to call 22,618,811 genotypes in 175 pigs that had been sequenced at very low coverage (1.11-fold) using the GLIMPSE software. The genotype concordance, non-reference sensitivity and non-reference discrepancy between thus inferred and Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip-called genotypes was 97.60, 98.73 and 3.24%, respectively. The low-pass sequencing-derived genomic relationship coefficients were highly correlated (r > 0.99) with those obtained from microarray genotyping.  Conclusions We assessed genetic diversity within and between two lines of the Swiss Large White pig breed. Our analyses revealed considerable differentiation, even though the split into two populations occurred only few generations ago. The sequenced haplotypes of the key ancestor animals enabled us to implement genotyping by low-pass sequencing which offers an intriguing cost-effective approach to increase the variant density over current array-based genotyping by more than 350-fold.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000479976",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-021-07610-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/479976","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Swiss large white||Genetic diversity||Low-pass sequencing||Genotyping by sequencing||Key ancestor animals","Characterization of a haplotype-reference panel for genotyping by low-pass sequencing in Swiss Large White pigs",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-22T07:13:52Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85104718438",,"000642621600003","BMC Genomics","1","BMC Genomics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We examined the innate and learned preferences of Bombus impatiens for Mimulus guttatus floral scent phenotypes corresponding to different levels of pollen rewards in the presence and absence of the innately attractive floral volatile compound β-trans-bergamotene. Bees learned to prefer honest signals after foraging on live M. guttatus flowers, but only exhibited this preference when presented floral scent phenotypes that did not include β-trans-bergamotene.

A better representation of photosynthetic capacity is required for Earth System models to simulate carbon assimilation reliably. Here we use a global leaf-trait dataset to test whether photosynthetic capacity is quantitatively predictable from climate, based on optimality principles; and to explore how this prediction is modified by soil properties, including indices of nitrogen and phosphorus availability, measured in situ. The maximum rate of carboxylation standardized to 25 °C (Vcmax25) was found to be proportional to growing-season irradiance, and to increase—as predicted—towards both colder and drier climates. Individual species’ departures from predicted Vcmax25 covaried with area-based leaf nitrogen (Narea) but community-mean Vcmax25 was unrelated to Narea, which in turn was unrelated to the soil C:N ratio. In contrast, leaves with low area-based phosphorus (Parea) had low Vcmax25 (both between and within communities), and Parea increased with total soil P. These findings do not support the assumption, adopted in some ecosystem and Earth System models, that leaf-level photosynthetic capacity depends on soil N supply. They do, however, support a previously-noted relationship between photosynthesis and soil P supply.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478745",,"2399-3642",,"10.1038/s42003-021-01985-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478745","en","Springer Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Global climate and nutrient controls of photosynthetic capacity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-14T17:03:42Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85104231162",,"000639943800003","Commun Biol","1","Communications Biology","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Multi-spectral images acquired with a commercially available UAV platform and soil available mineral N content (Nmin) sampled in the field were used to evaluate the in-field variability of the N-status of the crop. A plot-based field experiment was designed to compare uniform standard rate (ST) to variable rate (VR) N application. Non-fertilized (NF) and N-rich (NR) plots were placed as positive and negative N-status references and were used to calculate various indicators related to NUE. The crop was monitored throughout the season to support three split fertilizations. The data of two growing seasons (2017/2018 and 2018/2019) were used to validate the sensitivity of spectral vegetation indices (SVI) suitable for the sensor used in relation to biomass and N-status traits. Grain yield was mostly in the expected range and inconsistently higher in VR compared to ST. In contrast, N fertilizer application was reduced in the VR treatments between 5 and 40% depending on the field heterogeneity. The study showed that the methods used provided a good base to implement variable rate fertilizer application in small to medium scale agricultural systems. In the majority of the case studies, NUE was improved around 10% by redistributing and reducing the amount of N fertilizer applied. However, the prediction of the N-mineralisation in the soil and related N-uptake by the plants remains to be better understood to further optimize in-season N-fertilization.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000426591",,"1385-2256||1573-1618",,"10.1007/s11119-020-09733-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/426591","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nitrogen management||Winter wheat||UAV||Variable rate application","Site-specific nitrogen management in winter wheat supported by low-altitude remote sensing and soil data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-16T11:34:50Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Reconciling innovative farming practices and networks to enable sustainable development of smart Swiss farming systems","172433||172433","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","NFP 73: Gesuch||NFP 73: Gesuch",,,"85087405595",,"000544541300001",,"2","Precision Agriculture","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In order to predict and mitigate impacts of these anthropogenic activities, it is important to investigate how marsh plants respond to such environmental changes. Methods  In this study, Bolboschoenus planiculmis, a tuberous sedge with a wide distribution range in Eurasia, was selected to examine the effect of air temperature changes (15, 20 and 25 °C over 24 h; 20/10 and 30/15 °C, day/night) and K supply (0, 1, 3, 9 and 18 mmol/L) on its reproductive and growth traits in climate chambers. Important Findings  We found that high constant temperatures (20 and 25 °C) were more beneficial for tuberization of B. planiculmis than high alternating temperatures (30/15 °C), whereas aboveground biomass and shoot height were generally largest at high temperatures (30/15 and 25 °C). Both reproductive and growth traits of B. planiculmis showed hump-shaped relationships with K supply, with an optimum K concentration of around 1–3 mmol/L. The combination of high constant temperatures and optimal K concentrations promoted reproductive traits the most, whereas the combination of higher temperatures (30/15 and 25 °C) and K concentrations up to 9 mmol/L increased growth traits only. We therefore conclude that population abundance of B. planiculmis might benefit from global warming and the additional K supply.||温度变化和钾添加对扁秆藨草生长及繁殖的影响  人类活动导致的气候变暖和农业面源污染已被认为是影响湿地植物生长和繁殖的重要因素。为了预 测和缓解这些人类活动的影响，研究沼泽植物如何响应这些环境变化具有重要意义。本研究选取在欧亚 大陆广泛分布的莎草科球茎植物扁秆藨草(Bolboschoenus planiculmis)为研究对象，考察气温变化(恒温： 15、20、25 °C及交替温度：20/10和30/15 °C)和钾添加(0、1、3、9 和18 mmol/L)对其生长和繁殖性状 的影响。研究结果表明，高的恒温(20、25 °C)比高的交替温度(30/15 °C)更有利于扁秆藨草球茎的形成， 而地上生物量和株高一般在较高温度下(30/15、25 °C)达到最大值。扁秆藨草的繁殖和生长性状均与施钾量 呈驼峰型关系，最适施钾量在1–3 mmol/L K。高恒温效应和最适钾浓度的交互作用对繁殖性状的促进作 用最大，但是，较高的温度(30/15和25 °C)和0–9 mmol/L的钾浓度只促进了生长性状的生长。综上所述， 扁秆藨草的种群优势度可能受益于全球变暖和额外的钾添加。","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000455582",,"1752-9921||1752-993X",,"10.1093/jpe/rtaa091","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/455582","en||zh","Oxford University Press","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Climate warming||Non-point source pollution||functional traits||Clonal reproduction||Wetland plants||marsh||气候变暖||面源污染||功能性状||克隆繁殖||湿地植物||沼泽","The effect of temperature changes and K supply on the reproduction and growth of Bolboschoenus planiculmis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-09T16:34:34Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000637313200014","J.

To investigate the spatiotemporal variations of GHG emissions from WSPs with a focus on the effects of sludge accumulation and distribution, we conducted a bathymetry survey and two sampling campaigns in Ucubamba WSP (Cuenca, Ecuador). The results indicated that spatial variation of GHG emissions was strongly dependent on sludge distribution. Thick sludge layers in aerated ponds and facultative ponds caused substantial CO2 and CH4 emissions which accounted for 21.3% and 78.7% of the total emissions from the plant. Conversely, the prevalence of anoxic conditions stimulated the N2O consumption via complete denitrification leading to a net uptake from the atmosphere, i.e. up to 1.4±0.2 mg-N m−2 d−1. Double emission rates of CO2 were found in the facultative and maturation ponds during the day compared to night-time emissions, indicating the important role of algal respiration, while no diel variation of the CH4 and N2O emissions was found. Despite the uptake of N2O, the total GHG emissions of the WSP was higher than constructed wetlands and conventional centralized wastewater treatment facilities. Hence, it is recommended that sludge management with proper desludging regulation should be included as an important mitigation measure to reduce the carbon footprint of pond treatment facilities.",,,,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2021.116858","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468425","en","Elsevier",,,"Greenhouse gas||Stabilization pond||Carbon dioxide||Methane||Nitrous oxide||Sludge||Spatiotemporal variation","Spatial and temporal variations of greenhouse gas emissions from a waste stabilization pond: Effects of sludge distribution and accumulation",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-02-09T05:20:25Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85100290304",,"000625365700006","Water Res.",,"Water Research","193","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Both resulted in Royal Commissions (the strongest form of judicial inquiry in Australia) as to their cause(s) owing to large losses of life and property. Here we tested the hypothesis that site 'wetness' – determined using a Topographic Wetness Index – is a major determinant of the extent of fire (% of sample points that burnt) within high intensity wildfire events and across tenures. We show that wetness dominated the extent of fire in these forests in both the 1939 and 2009 wildfire events. Mountain Ash forests are now strongly skewed in their distribution, with wetter and older forests favoured by protected tenures (e.g. National Parks) designed to meet needs for water and conservation. In 2009, the extent of fire at the stand scale in water catchments and conservation tenures was twice that in 1939. In land tenures with multiple uses (e.g. State Forests), the extent of fire was one-third less in 2009 than it was in 1939. Topographic controls on water availability, and major droughts, will likely continue to dominate the extent and likelihood of fire in these forests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000469184",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/abe57e","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/469184","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Topography not tenure controls extent of wildfire within Mountain Ash forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-12T08:44:30Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103441413",,"000630751300001","Environ.

Some parasitic plants exploit this change by growing towards regions of low R:FR to locate host plants. In principle, variation in R:FR can also convey ecologically relevant information about host proximity or architecture. Here, we demonstrate that the parasitic vine Cuscuta epilinum Weihe (Convolvulaceae) can distinguish fine-scale differences in R:FR associated with differences in the proximity and shape of potential host plants. We conducted dual-choice experiments by placing parasite seedlings between targets, including low R:FR fields manipulated via LED lighting and pairs of model plants exhibiting realistic R and FR reflectance but differing in proximity or shape. Seedlings consistently distinguished between low-R:FR fields of differing intensity. Furthermore, they exhibited preferences for nearer plant models versus identical models placed 4 cm further away and between same-sized models exhibiting shape differences. Our results indicate that parasites can discriminate minute differences in R:FR signatures corresponding to host factors (proximity and shape) that impact seedling survival. This keen sensory ability underpins the parasite's sophisticated foraging behaviour and highlights the broader importance of light cues in plant ecology.",,,,"0140-7791||1365-3040",,"10.1111/pce.13967","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458707","en","Wiley",,,"Cuscuta||parasite host location||plant architecture||plant senses||R:FR","A plant parasite uses light cues to detect differences in host-plant proximity and architecture",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-12-30T03:42:01Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097557761",,"000599096000001","Plant cell environ.","4","Plant, Cell & Environment","44","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, to date, it has rarely been evaluated whether and how restoration efforts manage to rebuild biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions (ecosystem multifunctionality) simultaneously. Here, we quantified how three restoration methods of increasing intervention intensity (harvest only < topsoil removal < topsoil removal + propagule addition) affected grassland ecosystem multifunctionality 22 yr after the restoration event. We compared restored with intensively managed and targeted seminatural grasslands based on 13 biotic and abiotic, above‐ and belowground properties. We found that all three restoration methods improved ecosystem multifunctionality compared to intensively managed grasslands and developed toward the targeted seminatural grasslands. However, whereas higher levels of intervention intensity reached ecosystem multifunctionality of targeted seminatural grasslands after 22 yr, lower intervention missed this target. Moreover, we found that topsoil removal with and without seed addition accelerated the recovery of biotic and aboveground properties, and we found no negative long‐term effects on abiotic or belowground properties despite removing the top layer of the soil. We also evaluated which ecosystem properties were the best indicators for restoration success in terms of accuracy and cost efficiency. Overall, we demonstrated that low‐cost measures explained relatively more variation of ecosystem multifunctionality compared to high‐cost measures. Plant species richness was the most accurate individual property in describing ecosystem multifunctionality, as it accounted for 54% of ecosystem multifunctionality at only 4% of the costs of our comprehensive multifunctionality approach. Plant species richness is the property that typically is used in restoration monitoring by conservation agencies. Vegetation structure, soil carbon storage and water‐holding capacity together explained 70% of ecosystem multifunctionality at only twice the costs (8%) of plant species richness, which is, in our opinion, worth considering in future restoration monitoring projects. Hence, our findings provide a guideline for land managers how they could obtain an accurate estimate of aboveground‐belowground ecosystem multifunctionality and restoration success in a highly cost‐efficient way. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000468281",,"1051-0761||1939-5582",,"10.1002/eap.2271","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468281","en","Wiley","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Above-belowground properties||Biotic-abiotic properties||Long-term monitoring||Cost efficiency||Semi-natural grasslands","Evaluating long‐term success in grassland restoration: an ecosystem multifunctionality approach",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-08T11:02:28Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101286636",,"000620903500001","Ecol.

The main objective of the present study was to completely replace soybean in layer diets with defatted meal and fat from black soldier fly larvae without adverse effects. For this purpose, 5 × 10 Lohmann Brown Classic hens were fed either a soybean-based diet or diets based on defatted black soldier fly larvae meal and fat from 2 producers (1 commercial, 1 small-scale) operating with different rearing substrates, temperatures, and larvae processing methods (10 hens/diet). The data obtained included nutrient composition of larvae meals and diets, amino acid digestibility (6 hens/diet), and metabolizability, performance and egg quality (all 10 hens/diet). In addition, the acceptance of the 4 larvae-based diets was tested against the soybean-based diet in a 6-d choice feeding situation (10 hens/treatment). The nutritional value of the larvae-based diets was equivalent to the soybean-based diet in hens with a laying performance of 98%. Although average feed intake was not significantly different over the 7 experimental wk, the diets based on larvae feeds from the small-scale production appeared to be slightly less accepted in a choice situation than the soy-based diet and those with larvae from commercial origin. This was more likely the effect of the larvae fat rather than that of the larvae protein meal. In addition, the commercial larvae material was superior to that from the small-scale production concerning supply with digestible sulfur-containing amino acids (548 vs. 511 mg/d) and lysine (792 vs. 693 mg/d), egg weight (67 vs. 63.2 g), daily egg mass (66 vs. 61 g/d) and, in tendency, feed efficiency. The results indicate that soybean-based feeds can be replaced completely by black soldier fly meal and fat in diets of high-performing layers. However, because of nutritional differences between the larvae materials of different origin the quality of the larvae has to be closely monitored before being used.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000470692",,"0032-5791",,"10.1016/j.psj.2021.101034","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/470692","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Hermetia illucens||defatted larvae meal||Layer||feed acceptance||performance","Black Soldier Fly larvae meal and fat can completely replace soybean cake and oil in diets for laying hens",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-21T21:21:37Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101746018",,"000663725500001","Poult. sci.","4","Poultry Science","100","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We compared E. solidaginis males and females, focusing on sexually dimorphic structures that are known to be involved in pheromone production in other tephritid species. Morphological and chemical analyses indicated that the rectum and pleural epidermis are involved in male E. solidaginis pheromone production, storage, or emission. We detected large quantities of pheromone in the enlarged rectum, suggesting that it stores pheromone for subsequent release through the anus. However, pheromone might also discharge through the pleural cuticle with the involvement of unusual pleural attachments of the tergosternal muscles, which, when contracted in males, realign specialized cuticular surface elements and expose less-sclerotized areas of cuticle. In males, pheromone components were also detected in epidermal cells of the pleuron. These cells were 60–100 times larger in mature males than in females and, to our knowledge, are the largest animal epithelial cells ever recorded. Furthermore, because these large cells in males are multinucleated, we presume that they develop through somatic polyploidization by endomitosis. Consequently, the pheromone-associated multinuclear pleural epidermal cells of Eurosta solidaginis may provide an interesting new system for understanding polyploidization. © 2021 Elsevier",,,,"0022-1910||1879-1611",,"10.1016/j.jinsphys.2021.104210","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473496","en","Elsevier",,,"1-Nonanol||Bulbulate cuticle||Conophthorin||Gland||Pheromone emission||Rectum","Giant polyploid epidermal cells and male pheromone production in the tephritid fruit fly Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae)",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-03-09T06:04:02Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101714338",,"000641044400010","J Insect Physiol",,"Journal of Insect Physiology","130","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we present dissolved organic carbon (DOC), organic and inorganic nitrogen (DON, DIN), orthophosphate (PO43−), and major and trace ion concentrations and fluxes from the Amazon River using 26 samples collected over three annual hydrographs. Concentrations and fluxes were predominantly controlled by the annual wet season flood pulse. Average DOC, DON, DIN, and PO43− fluxes (±1 s.d.) were 25.5 (±1.0), 1.14 (±0.05), 0.82 (±0.03), and 0.063 (±0.003) Tg yr−1, respectively. Chromophoric dissolved organic matter absorption (at 350 nm) was strongly correlated with DOC concentrations, resulting in a flux of 74.8 × 106 m−2 yr−1. DOC and DON concentrations positively correlated with discharge while nitrate + nitrite concentrations negatively correlated, suggesting mobilization and dilution responses, respectively. Ammonium, PO43−, and silica concentrations displayed chemostatic responses to discharge. Major and trace ion concentrations displayed clockwise hysteresis (except for chloride, sodium, and rubidium) and exhibited either dilution or chemostatic responses. The sources of weathered cations also displayed seasonality, with the highest proportion of carbonate‐ and silicate‐derived cations occurring during peak and baseflow, respectively. Finally, our seasonally resolved weathering model resulted in an average CO2 consumption yield of (3.55 ± 0.11) × 105 mol CO2 km−2 yr−1.

However, while links of P turnover in soils to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) availability have been described, it remains to be clarified how combinations of fertilizer C and N additions affect stocks and cycling of distinct P fractions at different soil depths. The objectives of our study were (1) to assess how soil total P stocks are affected by organic amendments and N fertilization, (2) to evaluate how different soil P fractions respond to N fertilization, and (3) to verify whether N fertilization increases soil biological P cycling.  Methods: We collected soil samples from a long‐term field experiment established in 1984 in Rauischholzhausen, Germany. The soil is a Haplic Luvisol and received either no organic fertilizer (NOF), farmyard manure (FYM) or a combination of organic and mineral N fertilizer (OMF). Each treatment additionally received three levels of mineral N: 0 kg ha−1 y−1 (N0), 100 kg ha−1 y−1 (N100), and 200 kg ha−1 y−1 (N200). The organic fertilizers were applied by a manure spreader and the N fertilizer (calcium ammonium nitrate) was applied in spring as top dressing by a plot fertilizer machine. We estimated stocks of P in fractions isolated by sequential P fractionation, and assessed the oxygen isotopic composition of 1 M HCl‐extractable phosphate (δ18OP).  Results: We found that increased organic matter (OM) addition and mineral N inputs caused significant decreases in the stocks of resin‐ and NaHCO3‐extractable P in the topsoil (0–30 cm). Mineral N fertilization alone resulted in significant increases in stocks of resin‐, NaHCO3‐, and NaOH‐extractable P in the upper subsoil (30–50 cm). These changes occurred for both inorganic and organic P. The subsoil δ18OP values were closer to expected equilibrium values in soil fertilized with mineral N, indicative of more intensive biological P cycling than in the treatments without mineral N inputs.  Conclusions: These findings suggest that long‐term OM and mineral N fertilization promotes topsoil P losses from labile fractions by crop uptake with an enrichment of these P forms in the subsoil, and an overall increase in biological P cycling in both top‐ and subsoil horizons upon N fertilization.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478971",,"1436-8730||0044-3263||1522-2624",,"10.1002/jpln.202000261","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478971","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Nitrogen||Organic matter||Oxygen isotopes in phosphate (d18OP)||Sequential P fractionation||Soil P stocks","Soil phosphorus cycling is modified by carbon and nitrogen fertilization in a long-term field experiment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-16T04:35:18Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85100098820",,"000613570800001","J.

Here, we review recent advances in alpine plant ecology with a focus on dry mountain ranges, mainly in Mediterranean-type climate, with a global change perspective. Raising temperatures and changes in precipitation influence both plant growth and reproduction, and therefore the spatial distribution of species. Research in high-elevation systems evidenced that plant–plant interactions involving cushion plants play a crucial role in the assembly of plant communities, influencing species richness, genetic and phylogenetic diversity, and species persistence. By buffering environmental extremes and ameliorating biophysical conditions, cushion plant species acting as ecosystem engineers are fundamental in the response of alpine ecosystems to global warming, mitigating negative impacts on different plant species with narrow niche and small distribution range.||Los efectos del calentamiento global son más notables en entornos de gran altitud que en otros ecosistemas.

The associated reduction of soil biodiversity and essential soil functions, such as nutrient cycling, can restrict plant growth and crop yield. By increasing plant diversity in agricultural systems, intercropping could be a promising way to foster soil microbial diversity and functioning. However, plant–microbe interactions and the extent to which they influence crop yield under field conditions are still poorly understood. In this study, we performed an extensive intercropping experiment using eight crop species and 40 different crop mixtures to investigate how crop diversity affects soil microbial diversity and activity, and whether these changes subsequently affect crop yield. Experiments were carried out in mesocosms under natural conditions in Switzerland and in Spain, two countries with drastically different soils and climate, and our crop communities included either one, two or four species. We sampled and sequenced soil microbial DNA to assess soil microbial diversity, and measured soil basal respiration as a proxy for soil activity. Results indicate that in Switzerland, increasing crop diversity led to shifts in soil microbial community composition, and in particular to an increase of several plant-growth promoting microbes, such as members of the bacterial phylum Actinobacteria. These shifts in community composition subsequently led to a 15 and 35% increase in crop yield in 2 and 4-species mixtures, respectively. This suggests that the positive effects of crop diversity on crop productivity can partially be explained by changes in soil microbial composition. However, the effects of crop diversity on soil microbes were relatively small compared to the effects of abiotic factors such as fertilization (three times larger) or soil moisture (three times larger). Furthermore, these processes were context-dependent: in Spain, where resources were limited, soil microbial communities did not respond to crop diversity, and their effect on crop yield was less strong. This research highlights the potential beneficial role of soil microbial communities in intercropping systems, while also reflecting on the relative importance of crop diversity compared to abiotic drivers of microbiomes and emphasizing the context-dependence of crop–microbe relationships.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000483168",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2021.660749","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/483168","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","intercropping||soil microbial communities||biodiversity–productivity relationship||sustainable agriculture||annual crop yield||crop diversification","Positive Effects of Crop Diversity on Productivity Driven by Changes in Soil Microbial Composition",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-10T02:53:10Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85104978810",,"000645024800001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we elucidated the role of Cd storage forms (i.e., the chemical Cd speciation) on the dynamics of Cd within rice. In a pot trial, we grew rice on a Cd-contaminated soil in upland conditions and sampled roots and shoots parts at flowering and maturity. Cd concentrations, isotope ratios, Cd speciation (X-ray absorption spectroscopy), and micronutrient concentrations were analyzed. During grain filling, Cd and preferentially light Cd isotopes were strongly retained in roots where the Cd storage form did not change (Cd bound to thiols, Cd–S = 100%). In the same period, no net change of Cd mass occurred in roots and shoots, and the shoots became enriched in heavy isotopes (Δ114/110Cdmaturity–flowering = 0.14 ± 0.04‰). These results are consistent with a sequestration of Cd in root vacuoles that includes strong binding of Cd to thiol containing ligands that favor light isotopes, with a small fraction of Cd strongly enriched in heavy isotopes being transferred to shoots during grain filling. The Cd speciation in the shoots changed from predominantly Cd–S (72%) to Cd bound to O ligands (Cd–O, 80%) during grain filling. Cd–O may represent Cd binding to organic acids in vacuoles and/or binding to cell walls in the apoplast. Despite this change of ligands, which was attributed to plant senescence, Cd was largely immobile in the shoots since only 0.77% of Cd in the shoots were transferred into the grains. Thus, both storage forms (Cd–S and Cd–O) contributed to the retention of Cd in the straw. Cd was mainly bound to S in nodes I and grains (Cd–S > 84%), and these organs were strongly enriched in heavy isotopes compared to straw (Δ114/110Cdgrains/nodes–straw = 0.66–0.72‰) and flag leaves (Δ114/110Cdgrains/nodes–flag leaves = 0.49–0.52‰). Hence, xylem to phloem transfer in the node favors heavy isotopes, and the Cd–S form may persist during the transfer of Cd from node to grain. This study highlights the importance of Cd storage forms during its journey to grain and potentially into the food chain.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000486769",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2021.645150","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/486769","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","cadmium||rice||soil||stable isotope fractionation||X-ray absorption spectroscopy||speciation||remobilization and storage","Changes of Cadmium Storage Forms and Isotope Ratios in Rice During Grain Filling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-27T02:55:31Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103691589",,,"Front.

While environmental gradients influence N cycling on a regional scale, topography is known to affect N availability on a local scale. We compared natural abundance of 15N isotopes of soil profiles in tropical lowland forest, tropical montane forest, and subtropical Miombo woodland within the Congo Basin as a proxy to assess ecosystem-level differences in N cycling. Soil δ15N profiles indicated that N cycling in the montane forest is relatively more closed and dominated by organic N turnover, whereas the lowland forest and Miombo woodland experienced a more open N cycle dominated by inorganic N. Furthermore, we examined the effect of slope gradient on soil δ15N within forest types to quantify local differences induced by topography. Our results show that slope gradient only affects the soil δ15N in the Miombo forest, which is prone to erosion due to a lower vegetation cover and intense rainfall at the onset of the wet season. Lowland forest, on the other hand, with a flat topography and protective vegetation cover, showed no influence of topography on soil δ15N in our study site. Despite the steep topography, slope angles do not affect soil δ15N in the montane forest, although stable isotope signatures exhibited higher variability within this ecosystem. A pan-tropical analysis of soil δ15N values (i.e., from our study and literature) reveals that soil δ15N in tropical forests is best explained by factors controlling erosion, namely mean annual precipitation, leaf area index, and slope gradient. Erosive forces vary immensely between different tropical forest ecosystems, and our results highlight the need for more spatial coverage of N cycling studies in tropical forests, to further elucidate the local impact of topography on N cycling in this biome.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478090",,"2199-3971||2199-398X",,"10.5194/soil-7-83-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478090","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Stable isotope signatures of soil nitrogen on an environmental-geomorphic gradient within the Congo Basin",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-10T14:16:26Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103476838",,"000636067300001",,"1","Soil","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, their effects on higher trophic levels (e.g. insects) remain largely unclear. In this study, by field sampling in the Hengduan Mountains (HDM) in southwestern China, we evaluated the effects of an alpine gynodioecious cushion species, Arenaria polytrichoides (Carophyllaceae), on insect richness, abundance and population dynamics at two different elevations (4427 m vs. 4732 m) separately at two time periods (day vs. night) and in two growing seasons (early vs. late). The results showed that the total insect diversity decreases from low to high elevation sites. Some insect species were exclusively detected within A. polytrichoides cushions, leading to an increase in local insect richness from 7% to 35%. The positive effects of cushions on insect diversity could be attributed to unique biotic properties provided by cushions. Firstly, the effects were determined by the sexual dimorphism of the cushion with hermaphroditic cushions supporting higher insect diversity than female cushions. This could be because hermaphroditic cushions provide more resources, such as nectar and pollen grains, for insects than female cushions. Secondly, the cushions' associated beneficiary plants can also provide extra resources for attracting more insects, but this effect was mediated by the micro-environmental conditions. Finally, the magnitude of cushions' positive effects on insect dynamics were stronger under higher than under lower environmental stress. This study confirmed that facilitation by A. polytrichoides cushions in HDM plays an important role in constructing the alpine insect community and further regulating its dynamics. Moreover, the positive effects of cushions on insect dynamics increase with increasing environmental stress. Therefore, the distribution range of insects would quite possibly be expanded into higher elevation under future climate changes, which will induce new challenges for the local alpine ecosystems.",,,,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143091","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/464578","en","Elsevier",,,"Alpine ecosystems||Climate change||Cushion species||Environmental gradient||Insect diversity||Microclimatic refugia","The positive effects of the alpine cushion plant Arenaria polytrichoides on insect dynamics are determined by both physical and biotic factors",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-22T03:50:45Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85096518928",,"000607910300026","Sci.

Although plant biomass often increases in elevated CO2 (eCO2) experiments4,5,6, SOC has been observed to increase, remain unchanged or even decline7. The mechanisms that drive this variation across experiments remain poorly understood, creating uncertainty in climate projections8,9. Here we synthesized data from 108 eCO2 experiments and found that the effect of eCO2 on SOC stocks is best explained by a negative relationship with plant biomass: when plant biomass is strongly stimulated by eCO2, SOC storage declines; conversely, when biomass is weakly stimulated, SOC storage increases. This trade-off appears to be related to plant nutrient acquisition, in which plants increase their biomass by mining the soil for nutrients, which decreases SOC storage. We found that, overall, SOC stocks increase with eCO2 in grasslands (8 ± 2 per cent) but not in forests (0 ± 2 per cent), even though plant biomass in grasslands increase less (9 ± 3 per cent) than in forests (23 ± 2 per cent). Ecosystem models do not reproduce this trade-off, which implies that projections of SOC may need to be revised.",,,,"0028-0836||1476-4687",,"10.1038/s41586-021-03306-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477419","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"A trade-off between plant and soil carbon storage under elevated CO2",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-04-05T02:52:10Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103354739",,"000632555800019",,"7851","Nature","591","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We previously generated pigs with a modified TP53 allele that carries a Cre-removable transcriptional stop signal in intron 1, and an oncogenic mutation TP53R167H (orthologous to human TP53R175H) in exon 5. Pigs with the unrecombined mutant allele (flTP53R167H) develop mainly osteosarcoma but also nephroblastomas and lymphomas. This observation suggested that TP53 gene dysfunction is itself the key initiator of bone tumorigenesis, but raises the question which aspects of the TP53 regulation lead to the development of such a narrow tumour spectrum. Molecular analysis of p53 revealed the presence of two internal TP53 promoters (Pint and P2) equivalent to those found in human. Consequently, both pig and human express TP53 isoforms. Data presented here strongly suggest that P2-driven expression of the mutant R167H-Δ152p53 isoform (equivalent to the human R175H-Δ160p53 isoform) and its circular counterpart circTP53 determine the tumour spectrum and play a critical role in the malignant transformation in flTP53R167H pigs. The detection of Δ152p53 isoform mRNA in serum is indicative of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we showed a tissue-specific p53-dependent deregulation of the p63 and p73 isoforms in these tumours. This study highlights important species-specific differences in the transcriptional regulation of TP53. Considering the similarities of TP53 regulation between pig and human, these observations provide useful pointers for further investigation into isoform function including the novel circTP53 in both the pig model and human patients.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000472794",,"0950-9232||1476-5594",,"10.1038/s41388-021-01686-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472794","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Porcine model elucidates function of p53 isoform in carcinogenesis and reveals novel circTP53 RNA",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-03T16:28:42Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85100963278",,"000619405600001",,"10","Oncogene","40","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The complex set of food-related problems requires multidimensional perspectives, using inter- and transdisciplinary methodologies, to address social-ecological aspects over a mere focus on productivity. This article introduces a hands-on Food Sustainability Assessment Framework (FoodSAF) that allows non-academic actors to identify pathways for making food systems more sustainable through collective transformations in a “spiral of change”. The emphasis is on making the concept of “food sustainability” operational and applicable, by exploring transdisciplinary methodologies, encourage genuine participation of actors at the local level, and elevate their solutions in the direction of decision-making spaces, where policy makers have a key role in supporting change. The results provide evidence-based scientific knowledge for the promotion of innovation strategies and policy options that improve the sustainability of food systems with the specific aim of strengthening local food systems in a long-term process to co-create transformations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507390",,"2692-2053",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507390","en","Social Innovations Partners","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Food systems||Transformations||Sustainability||Food crisis||Food sustainability","Transformations Towards Food Sustainability Using the Participatory Food Sustainability Assessment Framework (FoodSAF)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-28T09:39:06Z",,,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://socialinnovationsjournal.com/index.php/sij/article/view/695",,,"64","Social Innovations Journal","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Measurements comprise 2 years (2010 and 2011) of manual static chamber measurements of CH4 and N2O, 5 years of continuous eddy covariance (EC) measurements (CO2–H2O – 2010–2014), and 3 years (2012–2014) of EC measurement of CH4 and N2O. Intensive grassland management included both regular and sporadic management activities. Regular management practices encompassed mowing (three to five cuts per year) with subsequent organic fertilizer amendments and occasional grazing, whereas sporadic management activities comprised grazing or similar activities. The primary objective of our measurements was to compare pre-plowing to post-plowing GHG exchange and to identify potential memory effects of such a substantial disturbance on GHG exchange and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) gains and losses. In order to include measurements carried out with different observation techniques, we tested two different measurement techniques jointly in 2013, namely the manual static chamber approach and the eddy covariance technique for N2O, to quantify the GHG exchange from the observed grassland site.  Our results showed that there were no memory effects on N2O and CH4 emissions after plowing, whereas the CO2 uptake of the site considerably increased when compared to pre-restoration years. In detail, we observed large losses of CO2 and N2O during the year of restoration. In contrast, the grassland acted as a carbon sink under usual management, i.e., the time periods 2010–2011 and 2013–2014. Enhanced emissions and emission peaks of N2O (defined as exceeding background emissions 0.21 ± 0.55 nmol m−2 s−1 (SE = 0.02) for at least 2 sequential days and the 7 d moving average exceeding background emissions) were observed for almost 7 continuous months after restoration as well as following organic fertilizer applications during all years. Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEECO2) showed a common pattern of increased uptake of CO2 in spring and reduced uptake in late fall. NEECO2 dropped to zero and became positive after each harvest event. Methane (CH4) exchange fluctuated around zero during all years. Overall, CH4 exchange was of negligible importance for both the GHG budget and the carbon budget of the site.  Our results stress the inclusion of grassland restoration events when providing cumulative sums of C sequestration potential and/or global warming potential (GWP). Consequently, this study further highlights the need for continuous long-term GHG exchange observations as well as for the implementation of our findings into biogeochemical process models to track potential GHG mitigation objectives as well as to predict future GHG emission scenarios reliably.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000472775",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-18-1481-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472775","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Are there memory effects on greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, N2O and CH4) following grassland restoration?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-03T14:49:51Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Robust models for assessing the effectiveness of technologies and managements to reduce N2O emissions from grazed pastures (Models4Pastures)","154245","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","FACCE-JPI",,,"85102087309",,"000625997700001",,"4","Biogeosciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Genetic factors, such as heritable mutations of Rb1 and TP53, are associated with an increased risk of OS. Identifying driver mutations for OS has been challenging due to the complexity of bone growth-related pathways and the extensive intra-tumoral heterogeneity of this cancer. We previously generated pigs carrying a mutated TP53 gene, which develop OS at high frequency. RNA sequencing and allele expression imbalance (AEI) analysis of OS and matched healthy control samples revealed a highly significant AEI (p = 2.14 × 10−39) for SNPs in the BIRC3-YAP1 locus on pig chromosome 9. Analysis of copy number variation showed that YAP1 amplification is associated with the AEI and the progression of OS. Accordingly, the inactivation of YAP1 inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion, and leads to the silencing of TP63 and reconstruction of p16 expression in p53-deficient porcine OS cells. Increased p16 mRNA expression correlated with lower methylation of its promoter. Altogether, our study provides molecular evidence for the role of YAP1 amplification in the progression of p53-dependent OS.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000475287",,"2072-6694",,"10.3390/cancers13061364","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/475287","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","YAP1||TP53||TP63||p16||Allelic expression imbalance||Copy number variation||Bone cancer||Pig","Allelic Expression Imbalance Analysis Identified YAP1 Amplification in p53- Dependent Osteosarcoma",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-18T09:01:39Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102649711",,"000634367900001",,"6","Cancers","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We set out to determine the potential of locally-accessible organic amendments and weed biomass management to secure crop nutritional quality and yield while maintaining soil fertility. Orange-fleshed sweet potato was fertilized with sole or co-application of poultry manure, cowpea residue, and inorganic fertilizer, combined with removal or incorporation of biomass residue from the fallow period. Non-amended control represented current farmers practice. Poultry manure fertilization, in sole or co-application with inorganic fertilizer, maintained storage root yield from the first to the second season, averaging 7.7 t ha−1. Conversely, non-amended control decreased storage root yield by 61% from the first to the second season. Poultry manure with weed biomass incorporation maintained total soil C and N at 14.4 g kg−1 and 1.1 g kg−1, respectively, after two growing seasons. Poultry manure co-applied with inorganic fertilizer decreased total C and N by 15% and 14% respectively. The changes in soil total C and N observed in this experiment provide basis to support management recommendations for farmers focusing on locally-sourced organic amendments. Poultry manure is the more reliable organic amendment to maintain sweet potato agricultural performance and soil fertility, with potential to support long-term sweet potato cultivation. The negative effect of inorganic fertilizer on total soil nutrient concentration after two seasons needs consideration to avoid soil fertility mismanagement.",,,,"1385-1314||1573-0867",,"10.1007/s10705-020-10111-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465816","en","Springer",,,"Organic fertilizer||Poultry manure||Weed biomass incorporation||Crop residue","Soil fertility maintenance with organic amendments to orange fleshed sweetpotato",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-27T06:18:09Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099288647",,"000606442700001","Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst","2","Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems","119","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Semen from individual bulls is used for thousands of artificial inseminations for which the fertilization success is monitored. Results from the breeding soundness examination and repeated observations of semen quality complement the fertility evaluation for each bull.  Results In a cohort of 3881 Brown Swiss bulls that had genotypes at 683,609 SNPs, we reveal four novel recessive QTL for male fertility on BTA1, 18, 25, and 26 using haplotype-based association testing. A QTL for bull fertility on BTA1 is also associated with sperm head shape anomalies. All other QTL are not associated with any of the semen quality traits investigated. We perform complementary fine-mapping approaches using publicly available transcriptomes as well as whole-genome sequencing data of 125 Brown Swiss bulls to reveal candidate causal variants. We show that missense or nonsense variants in SPATA16, VWA3A, ENSBTAG00000006717 and ENSBTAG00000019919 are in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL. Using whole-genome sequence data, we detect strong association (P = 4.83 × 10− 12) of a missense variant (p.Ile193Met) in SPATA16 with male fertility. However, non-coding variants exhibit stronger association at all QTL suggesting that variants in regulatory regions contribute to variation in bull fertility.  Conclusion Our findings in a dairy cattle population provide evidence that recessive variants may contribute substantially to quantitative variation in male fertility in mammals. Detecting causal variants that underpin variation in male fertility remains difficult because the most strongly associated variants reside in poorly annotated non-coding regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000477100",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-021-07523-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477100","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bull fertility||Quantitative trait loci||Semen quality||Association study||Haplotype","Autosomal recessive loci contribute significantly to quantitative variation of male fertility in a dairy cattle population",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-31T08:41:19Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Compiling a population-specific haplotype reference panel to facilitate the fine-mapping of pleiotropic QTL in cattle","185229","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,"85103682928",,"000635169900001","BMC Genomics","1","BMC Genomics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Current yields are low due to poor soil fertility and because farmers do not use improved germplasm, clean planting material, or improved crop management in Nigeria. To provide feasible agronomic recommendations targeting increased root yield, the effects of tillage intensity, fertilizer application, plant density and weed control were tested in 230 farmers’ fields in southwestern Nigeria over two years. In 2016, tillage treatments were zero, single and double passage with a disc plough, followed by ridging (soil shaping) versus leaving the soil flat. Fertilizer application at 75:20:90 kg ha−1 NPK was tested against a control and two plant densities (10,000 versus 12,500 ha−1) were compared. In 2017, plant density at 10,000 ha−1 and double plough were excluded, while pre- and post-emergence herbicide application versus farmer’s choice of weed control (i.e. manual weeding using hand hoe) was introduced. Cassava was harvested at 12 months after planting, and yields were recorded as fresh root mass. In 2016, double plough (15.9 Mg ha−1) had a minor advantage over single plough (14.3 Mg ha−1), while zero plough produced 12.9 Mg ha−1 (P < 0.001). Ridging increased yield significantly (P < 0.01) by 2.3 Mg ha−1 after single and zero plough, but not after double plough. Across tillage treatments, planting at 12,500 plants ha−1 and fertilizer application increased yields by 1.5 and 4.2 Mg ha−1, respectively. In 2017, ridging resulted in a yield increase of 1.7 Mg ha−1 after single plough and 5.6 Mg ha−1 after zero plough. Fertilizer application increased root yield by 2.9 Mg ha-1 across tillage treatments. The use of herbicides negatively affected cassava yields in zero plough fields, compared with manual weeding. After ploughing, yield in herbicide based and manual weed control were not different. Cassava root yield response to tillage intensity strongly varied across fields, with low-yielding fields commonly responding less frequently to tillage. We conclude that unresponsive fields require measures other than increased tillage intensity to increase cassava root yields and that cost-intensive tillage operations must be targeted to responsive fields together with fertilizer application and improved weed control.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460866",,"0378-4290||1872-6852",,"10.1016/j.fcr.2020.108038","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460866","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cassava||Root yield||Tillage||Agronomic practices||Fertilizer application||Planting density","On-farm assessment of cassava root yield response to tillage, plant density, weed control and fertilizer application in southwestern Nigeria",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-09T15:00:48Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85098628625",,"000608266700005","Field crops res.",,"Field Crops Research","262","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Sap-sucking pests such as aphids also excrete honeydew as food reward for ants, leading to potential conflict where ants could preferentially defend either the plant or the aphid. How pest insects might influence plant pearl body production, is yet to be investigated. Okra is a widely consumed vegetable worldwide and is attacked by the ant-tended cotton aphid. The plants produce pearl bodies, which are predominantly found on the underside of the leaves and formed from epidermal cells. We conducted a set of field and greenhouse experiments to explore plant-aphid-ant interactions, their influence on pearl body production and resulting performance of okra plants, across okra varieties. We found that ants of Pheidole genus, which are dominant in okra fields, preferred pearl bodies over aphid honeydew; although, their highest abundance was recorded in presence of both these food rewards, and on one okra variety. Removal of pearl bodies from the plants increased their production; however, plant growth and chlorophyll content were negatively associated with pearl body replenishment. Potentially to mitigate this resource cost, plants developed such a novel defense response because we found that aphid presence reduced pearl body production, but only when there were no ants. Finally, aphids negatively affected plant performance, but only at very high densities. As aphids also attract ants, plants may tolerate their presence at low densities to attract higher ant abundances. Our study highlights that plants can adapt their defense strategies in pest presence for efficient resource use. We suggest that understanding pearl body associated interactions in crop plants can assist in using such traits for pest management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000477423",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2021.627570","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477423","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","pearl bodies||ant preference||aphid honeydew||plant defense||pests||plant performance","The Efficiency of Plant Defense: Aphid Pest Pressure Does Not Alter Production of Food Rewards by Okra Plants in Ant Presence",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-05T02:52:25Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103337539",,"000634265600001","Front.

The widely used maintenance P fertilization strategy relies on critical concentrations of soil test P (STP), which should cause the lowest possible impact on the environment while still ensuring optimal yield. While both soil P availability and crop yields are fundamentally related to pedoclimatic conditions, little is known about the extent to which soil and climate variables control critical STP. The official P fertilization guidelines for arable crops in Switzerland are based on empirically derived critical concentrations for two soil test methods (H2O-CO2 and AAE10). To validate those values and evaluate their relation to pedoclimatic conditions, we established nonlinear multivariate multilevel yield response models fitted to long-term data from six sites. The Mitscherlich function proved most suitable out of three functions and model fit was significantly enhanced by taking the multilevel data structure into account. Yield response to STP was strongest for potato, intermediate for barley, and lowest for wheat and maize. Mean critical STP at 95% maximum yield ranged among crops from 0.15–0.58 mg kg−1 (H2O-CO2) and 0–36 mg kg−1 (AAE10). However, pedoclimatic conditions such as annual temperature or soil clay content had a large impact on critical STP, entailing changes of up to 0.9 mg kg−1 (H2O-CO2) and 80 mg kg−1 (AAE10). Critical STP for the AAE10 method was also affected by soil pH. Our findings suggest that the current Swiss fertilization guidelines overestimate actual crop P demand on average and that site conditions account for large parts of the variation in critical STP. We propose that site-specific fertilization recommendations could be improved on the basis of agro-climate classes in addition to soil information, which can help to counteract the accumulation of unutilized soil P by long-term P application.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000458511",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143453","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458511","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","STP||Critical concentrations||Nonlinear mixed models||Multivariate analysis||Mitscherlich function||Long-term field trials","Yield response to soil test phosphorus in Switzerland: Pedoclimatic drivers of critical concentrations for optimal crop yields using multilevel modelling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-24T03:44:14Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85096141549",,"000600786700105","Sci.

Genetic variation for this process is therefore important for adaptation. This study investigates the genetic response to temperature fluctuations during stem elongation and its relationship to phenology and height. Canopy height of 315 wheat genotypes (GABI wheat panel) was scanned twice weekly in the field phenotyping platform (FIP) of ETH Zurich using a LIDAR. Temperature response was modelled using linear regressions between stem elongation and mean temperature in each measurement interval. This led to a temperature-responsive (slope) and a temperature-irresponsive (intercept) component. The temperature response was highly heritable (H2=0.81) and positively related to a later start and end of stem elongation as well as final height. Genome-wide association mapping revealed three temperature-responsive and four temperature-irresponsive quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Furthermore, putative candidate genes for temperature-responsive QTLs were frequently related to the flowering pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana, whereas temperature-irresponsive QTLs corresponded to growth and reduced height genes. In combination with Rht and Ppd alleles, these loci, together with the loci for the timing of stem elongation, accounted for 71% of the variability in height. This demonstrates how high-throughput field phenotyping combined with environmental covariates can contribute to a smarter selection of climate-resilient crops.",,,,"1460-2431||0022-0957",,"10.1093/jxb/eraa471","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461744","en","Oxford University Press",,,"Development||field phenotyping||GWAS||LIDAR||physiology||plant height||temperature response||wheat","Temperature response of wheat affects final height and the timing of stem elongation under field conditions",,"Journal Article||Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-12T14:13:28Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"PhenoCOOL: Wheat and soybean phenotyping under cold conditions using growth as a dynamic trait","169542","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,"83934338","85102563961",,"000648886400037","J.

Readily extractable inorganic and microbial soil phosphorus (P) pools may be affected due to rapid changes in soil water availability. We aimed to determine how soil P dynamics are affected by repeated soil DRW using a sandy grassland soil that regularly experiences DRW. In a laboratory soil incubation study, the soil was exposed to three DRW cycles, with each cycle consisting of a two-day drying phase, a three-day dryness phase and a four-day moist phase after rapid rewetting. The indicators of abiotic processes (P sorption) and biotic processes (respiration, microbial abundance, potential phosphatase enzyme activities) were regularly determined together with water-extractable P, resin-extractable P and microbial P in a 33P-labelled soil.  During the first DRW cycle, microbial P was reduced by half and accompanied by a concomitant but not equivalent increase in water-extractable P and a slight as well as delayed increase in resin-extractable P. Thus, increases in water-extractable P were explained by microbial P released during drying but also by microbial P occupying soil P sorption sites, thereby decreasing soil P sorption. Changes in the 33P-isotopic composition of microbial P at the same time suggested that microorganisms did not respond homogenously to the DRW treatment and indicated an increased mineralisation of previously unavailable organic P compounds. However, during the second and third DRW cycles, only water-extractable P, soil P sorption and potential phosphatase activities were affected by the DRW treatment, whereas all other parameters remained similar in values to the constant moist treatment. The effects of DRW on soil P dynamics appeared to affect water-extractable P more long-lastingly, whereas microbial P and most of the biotic indicators quickly adjusted to the DRW treatment. We conclude that the current concepts suggesting an increased mobility of soil P towards other environmental compartments due to soil DRW should consider that abiotic and biotic soil P dynamics are not equally affected in the case of short repetition of DRW incidences.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456120",,"0038-0717||1879-3428",,"10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.108079","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456120","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Drying-rewetting||P dynamics||Microbial P turnover||33P isotopic dilution","Repeated drying and rewetting differently affect abiotic and biotic soil phosphorus (P) dynamics in a sandy soil: A33P soil incubation study",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-13T04:14:57Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097221675",,"000608177400007","Soil biol. biochem.",,"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","153","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This might be advantageous for the plant, as it can disturb the associative avoidance learning of pollinators, promoting more visits to the flowers. Some studies have shown that color and fragrance can be correlated in polymorphic deceptive orchids, but these studies employed color traits based on the human visual system and not the visual perception of pollinators. Thus, we investigated the composition of the floral fragrance of Ionopsis utricularioides (Sw.) Lindl., a polymorphic deceptive orchid, and analyzed possible correlations with the floral color as seen by bees, Apis mellifera L. and Melipona quadrifasciata Lepeletier, using the color hexagon model. We found high color and fragrance intraspecific variation, as expected for deceptive species. However, we found no color-fragrance association in individuals, either by comparing fragrance profiles with the color variable saturation or by comparing them with the placement of individuals in the color hexagon for both bee species. This lack of correlation contradicts the biochemical pathway hypothesis, which proposes that associations between floral color and scent in polymorphic flowers arise from shared biochemical pathways. However, a complete absence of correlation between floral signals is consistent with selection arising through pollinator cognitive ecology. Lack of correlation would increase the floral variability perceived by bees, given their multimodal learning, and this variability could disrupt avoidance learning of deceptive flowers, thus enhancing the efficacy of the plant's deceptive pollination mechanism. © 2020 Elsevier",,,,"0031-9422||1873-3700",,"10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.112591","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458334","en","Elsevier",,,"Ionopsis utricularioides||Orchidaceae||Floral color variation||Fragrance variation||Color-fragrance association||Deceptive pollination||Bees||Vision||Olfaction||Cognition","What pollinators see does not match what they smell: Absence of color-fragrance association in the deceptive orchid Ionopsis utricularioides",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-12-23T08:49:09Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097673043",,"000609228000002","Phytochemistry",,"Phytochemistry","182","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Two urban grassland types of contrasting management dominate urban greenspaces: frequently mown, species-poor short-cut lawns and less intensively managed, near-natural tall-grass meadows. The higher conservation value of tall-grass meadows makes management interventions such as converting short-cut lawns into tall-grass meadows a promising tool for urban biodiversity conservation. The societal success of such interventions, however, depends on identifying the values urban residents assign to different types of urban grasslands, and how these values translate to attitudes towards greenspace management. Using 2027 questionnaires across 19 European cities, we identify the assigned values that correlate with people's personal greenspace use and their preferences for different types of urban grasslands to determine how these values relate to the agreement with a scenario of converting 50% of their cities’ short-cut lawns into tall-grass meadows. We found that most people assigned nature-related values, such as wildness, to tall-grass meadows and utility-related values, such as recreation, to short-cut lawns. Positive value associations of wildness and species richness with tall-grass meadows, and social and nature-related greenspace activities, positively correlated with agreeing to convert short-cut lawns into tall-grass meadows. Conversely, disapproval of lawn conversion correlated with positive value associations of cleanliness and recreation potential with short-cut lawns. Here, people using greenspaces for nature-related activities were outstandingly positive about lawn conversion. The results show that the plurality of values assigned to different types of urban grasslands should be considered in urban greenspace planning. For example, tall-grass meadows could be managed to also accommodate the values associated with short-cut lawns, such as tidiness and recreation potential, to support their societal acceptance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000449437",,"1439-1791||1618-0089",,"10.1016/j.baae.2020.10.006","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/449437","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Urban biodiversity conservation||Lawn management||Nature-related values||Urban grasslands||Ecological restoration||Socio-ecological systems||Green infrastructure||Urban greenspace","Acceptance of near-natural greenspace management relates to ecological and socio-cultural assigned values among European urbanites",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-03T09:14:15Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097657343",,"000616375100011","Basic Appl.

Eighteen cows in total were subjected to one of three different feeding system treatments: full-time grazing or part-time grazing combined with indoor feeding of fresh grass with low or high concentrate supplementation. Milk was sampled in spring, summer and autumn. Milk coagulation time was 15.0, 19.0 and 17.7 min, coagulation dynamics 1.67, 3.41 and 1.79 min, and curd firmness 52.7, 32.4 and 47.0 mm in spring, summer and autumn, respectively. Thus, milk coagulation properties of the milk were lower during summer. There were strong seasonal effects on milk FA proportions, but there were not always changes with progressing season, or changes were different with respect to the impact of the feeding systems (system × season interaction). The milk fat was favourably rich in oleic acid, conjugated linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid and had a low n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio in all systems. Factors like seasonal variations in grass composition and the energy balance of the cows were considered relevant for the milk FA composition. Overall, seasonal variations in milk quality were less pronounced with part-time grazing with fresh grass indoors as compared to full-time grazing without concentrate.",,,,"0022-0299||1469-7629",,"10.1017/S0022029921000169","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478088","en","Cambridge University Press",,,"Concentrate supplementation||Dairy||Fatty acid composition||Grazing||Milk coagulation properties","Effects of full-time v. part-time grazing on seasonal changes in milk coagulation properties and fatty acid composition",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-04-10T14:15:45Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102820405",,"000635225700005","J.

By measuring the concentrations of the individual N compounds, complemented by the determination of abiotic parameters and other relevant nutrients within the system water at 13 sampling points, significant differences between compartments that build up an aquaponic system could be demonstrated.

Our aim was to evaluate the validity of this concept. Most studies that report 'positive effects' of PSM on plant growth have been conducted under controlled conditions, whereas field experiments more frequently fail to demonstrate a positive response. Many studies have indicated that the mechanisms seenin vitrodo not translate into improved crop P nutrition in complex soil-plant systems. Furthermore, associated mechanisms are often not rigorously assessed. We suggest that PSM do not mobilise sufficient P to change the crops' nutritional environment under field conditions. The current concept, in which PSM solubilise P 'for the plant' should thus be revised. Although PSM have the capacity to solubilise P to meet their own needs, it is the turnover of the microbial biomass that subsequently provides P to plants over a longer time. Therefore, the existing concept of PSM function is unlikely to deliver a reliable strategy for increasing crop P nutrition. A further mechanistic understanding is needed to determine how P mobilisation by PSM as a component of the whole soil community can be manipulated to become more effective for plant P nutrition.",,,,"0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.16924","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448265","en","Wiley",,,"agriculture||microbial biomass||microorganisms||phosphorus||plant nutrition||solubilisation","Phosphate-solubilising microorganisms for improved crop productivity: a critical assessment",,"Review Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-10-28T03:52:51Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85092408980",,"000577828200001","New Phytol.","3","New Phytologist","229","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Furthermore, biodiversity research has demonstrated that plant diversity enhances the productivity and functioning of ecosystems. However, these two fields of research developed in parallel and independent from one another, with the consequence that little is known about the role of ecosystem engineers in the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across trophic levels. Here, we present an experimental framework to study this relationship. We combine facilitation by plants acting as ecosystem engineers with plant–insect interaction analysis and variance partitioning of biodiversity effects. We present a case‐study experiment in which facilitation by a cushion‐plant species and a dwarf‐shrub species as ecosystem engineers increases positive effects of plant functional diversity (ecosystem engineers and associated plants) on ecosystem functioning (flower visitation rate). The experiment, conducted in the field during a single alpine flowering season, included the following treatments: (1) removal of plant species associated with ecosystem engineers, (2) exclusion (covering) of ecosystem engineer flowers, and (3) control, i.e., natural patches of ecosystem engineers and associated plant species. We found both positive and negative associational effects between plants depending on ecosystem engineer identity, indicating both pollination facilitation and interference. In both cases, patches supported by ecosystem engineers increased phylogenetic and functional diversity of flower visitors. Furthermore, complementarity effects between engineers and associated plants were positive for flower visitation rates. Our study reveals that plant facilitation can enhance the strength of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships, with complementarity between plants for attracting more and diverse flower visitors being the likely driver. A potential mechanism is that synergy and complementarity between engineers and associated plants increase attractiveness for shared visitors and widen pollination niches. In synthesis, facilitation among plants can scale up to a full network, supporting ecosystem functioning both directly via microhabitat amelioration and indirectly via diversity effects.",,,,"0012-9658||1939-9170",,"10.1002/ecy.3243","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461858","en","Wiley",,,"biodiversity change||complementarity effect||ecosystem functioning||facilitation||functional diversity||multitrophic interactions||phylogenetic diversity||plant–plant–insect networks","An experimental approach to assessing the impact of ecosystem engineers on biodiversity and ecosystem functions",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-13T06:05:52Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The impact of land-use change and species invasion on biodiversity and ecological networks||Ecology and evolution in practice: A plant–plant interaction-based approach to the evolution of biodiversity effects on productivity","180195||170645","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Scientific Exchanges||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,"85098065154",,"000602152000001","Ecol.","2","Ecology","102","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It remains unclear whether opening the crate leads to changes in sow lying down behaviour and piglet activity that may pose an increased risk of injury to piglets. This study aimed to assess whether the lying down behaviour of lactating sows housed in temporary crating changed shortly after removal of confinement, whether it was influenced by piglets' behaviour and age and whether sows preferentially used some support during lying down after crate opening. Sows (n = 13) were crated from 5 days pre partum to 3 days post partum. Their behaviours were recorded on video over a 24-h period both preceding and following crate opening, as well as over a 24-h period on day 25. The following behaviours were analysed: position and activity of the piglets when the sow lie down, duration of the lying down events, use of pen walls or crate bars as support when lying down; and position of the sow in the pen when lying down. Piglet mortality was assessed every day. Data were analysed in SAS using GLM. The duration of lying down events did not differ between the 24-h periods before and after opening the crate but increased on day 25 (P < 0.01). Similarly, the percentage of piglets in the danger zone did not differ between the 24-h periods before and after opening the crate, but increased on day 25 (P < 0.0001). The percentage of piglets in the creep area increased temporarily the day after the crate opening (P < 0.0001). Sows frequently utilised support when lying down, but less over the 24-h period after the crate opening compared to the two other periods (P < 0.001). A higher percentage of piglets in the creep area resulted in longer lying down events where the sow's snout was in contact with piglets located in the creep area (P < 0.05). The present study shows that opening the crate does have an immediate impact on lying down behaviour and piglet behaviour, but it does not pose an increased risk to piglets. Our results also indicate that piglet behaviour changed with age and influenced sow lying down behaviour. Finally, our findings further suggest that some available lying down support may be a very important feature of the pen during the whole lactation period.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456862",,"1751-7311||1751-732X",,"10.1016/j.animal.2020.100130","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456862","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Housing||Lactation||Lying down behaviour||Sow and piglet behaviour||Temporary crating","Assessment of lying down behaviour in temporarily crated lactating sows",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-17T13:19:57Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85100683758",,"000626639900060",,"2","Animal","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Ejaculates that fulfill predefined quality requirements are processed, diluted and used for inseminations. Within short time, eight Swiss Large White boars producing immotile sperm that had multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella were noticed at a semen collection center. The eight boars were inbred on a common ancestor suggesting that the novel sperm flagella defect is a recessive trait. Transmission electron microscopy cross-sections revealed that the immotile sperm had disorganized flagellar axonemes. Haplotype-based association testing involving microarray-derived genotypes at 41,094 SNPs of six affected and 100 fertile boars yielded strong association (P = 4.22 × 10−15) at chromosome 12. Autozygosity mapping enabled us to pinpoint the causal mutation on a 1.11 Mb haplotype located between 3,473,632 and 4,587,759 bp. The haplotype carries an intronic 13-bp deletion (Chr12:3,556,401–3,556,414 bp) that is compatible with recessive inheritance. The 13-bp deletion excises the polypyrimidine tract upstream exon 56 of DNAH17 (XM_021066525.1: c.8510–17_8510–5del) encoding dynein axonemal heavy chain 17. Transcriptome analysis of the testis of two affected boars revealed that the loss of the polypyrimidine tract causes exon skipping which results in the in-frame loss of 89 amino acids from DNAH17. Disruption of DNAH17 impairs the assembly of the flagellar axoneme and manifests in multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella. Direct gene testing may now be implemented to monitor the defective allele in the Swiss Large White population and prevent the frequent manifestation of a sterilizing sperm tail disorder in breeding boars.",,,,"1943-2631",,"10.1093/genetics/iyaa033","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/467161","en","Oxford University Press",,,"Sperm flagella defect||Impaired male fertility||Polypyrimidine tract||Exon skipping||Genetic disorder||Genetics of Sex","Infertility due to defective sperm flagella caused by an intronic deletion in DNAH17 that perturbs splicing",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-02-01T16:18:45Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103227464",,"000637218100009",,"2","Genetics","217","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For many of these studies, obtaining a sample of the source bedrock or applied mineral fertiliser for isotope analysis is impossible; meaning there is now a demand for a comprehensive characterisation of global bedrock δ18O‐PO4 to support this work. Here we compile δ18O‐PO4 data from a wide range of global bedrocks, including 56 new values produced as part of this study and a comprehensive overview of those within the previously existing literature. We present δ18O‐PO4 data from the range of major phosphatic lithologies alongside as much metadata for the samples as could be gathered. Much of the data comes from bedrocks of marine sedimentary origin (< 1 Ma = > +22‰, > 540 Ma = ≈ +12‰), but we also present data from bedrocks associated with guano (range: +19.5 to +15‰) and igneous deposits (range: +12 to –0.8‰), both of which have distinct δ18O‐PO4 signatures due to their formation mechanisms. We show that where repeat measurements of the same formation have been undertaken, regardless of method or exact sample location, there is an average within formation error of ± 1.25‰. This is important, as is constitutes a reasonable level of uncertainty for phosphorus cycling studies which need to estimate bedrock δ18O‐PO4 composition based on the literature. In combination, this data set presents 284 δ18O‐PO4 values from 56 countries; a comprehensive starting point for researchers interested in understanding bedrock end member δ18O‐PO4.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000466622",,"1436-8730||0044-3263||1522-2624",,"10.1002/jpln.202000513","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/466622","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bedrock||Oxygen isotope||phosphate cycle||Phosphorus||Soils","A review of phosphate oxygen isotope values in global bedrocks: characterising a critical endmember to the soil phosphorus system",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-29T09:41:26Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099553896",,"000608832900001","J.

In recent years there has been an upsurge of studies on ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF), or the ability of ecosystems to simultaneously provide multiple functions and/or services. The concept of EMF itself, the analytical approaches used to calculate it, and its implications depending on the spatial scale and field of study have been discussed in detail. However, to date there has been little dialogue concerning the basis of EMF studies: what should or should not be considered appropriate measures for ecosystem functions. 2. To begin this discussion, we performed an in‐depth review of EMF studies across four major terrestrial ecosystems (agroecosystems, drylands, forests and grasslands) by analysing 82 studies, which together have assessed 775 ecosystem functions from a variety of field and greenhouse experiments across the globe. 3. The number of ecosystem functions analysed varied from two to 82 per study and we found large differences in the distribution of functions across ecosystem types and ecosystem service categories. Furthermore, there was little explanation of why certain variables were included in the EMF calculation or how they relate to ecosystem functioning. 4. Synthesis. Based on the literature analysis, it is clear that there is no general agreement regarding which measurements should or should not be considered functions in the field of ecology. To address this issue, we propose a general guideline for determining and measuring appropriate functions. © 2020 British Ecological Society.",,,,"0022-0477","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/449558||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517482","10.1111/1365-2745.13511","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517526","en","Wiley",,,"Agroecosystems||Biodiversity||Drylands||Ecosystem multifunctionality||Forests||Functions||Grasslands||Microbes","A closer look at the functions behind ecosystem multifunctionality: A review",,"Review Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-11-04T03:55:31Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85092902967",,"000579741500001","J.

In many parts of the world, forest management has shifted from a focus on timber production to multi-purpose forestry, combining timber production with the supply of other forest ecosystem services. However, it is unclear which forest types provide which ecosystem services and to what extent forests primarily managed for timber already supply multiple ecosystem services. Based on a comprehensive dataset collected across 150 forest plots in three regions differing in management intensity and species composition, we develop models to predict the potential supply of 13 ecosystem services. We use those models to assess the level of multifunctionality of managed forests at the national level using national forest inventory data. Results: Looking at the potential supply of ecosystem services, we found trade-offs (e.g. between both bark beetle control or dung decomposition and both productivity or soil carbon stocks) as well as synergies (e.g. for temperature regulation, carbon storage and culturally interesting plants) across the 53 most dominant forest types in Germany. No single forest type provided all ecosystem services equally. Some ecosystem services showed comparable levels across forest types (e.g. decomposition or richness of saprotrophs), while others varied strongly, depending on forest structural attributes (e.g. phosphorous availability or cover of edible plants) or tree species composition (e.g. potential nitrification activity). Variability in potential supply of ecosystem services was only to a lesser extent driven by environmental conditions. However, the geographic variation in ecosystem function supply across Germany was closely linked with the distribution of main tree species. Conclusions: Our results show that forest multifunctionality is limited to subsets of ecosystem services. The importance of tree species composition highlights that a lack of multifunctionality at the stand level can be compensated by managing forests at the landscape level, when stands of complementary forest types are combined. These results imply that multi-purpose forestry should be based on a variety of forest types requiring coordinated planning across larger spatial scales. © 2021, The Author(s).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000467226",,,,"10.1186/s40663-021-00280-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/467226","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Ecosystem processes and services||Forest management||Structural diversity||Tree species composition||Trade-offs and synergies||Forest productivity","National Forest Inventories capture the multifunctionality of managed forests in Germany",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-02T08:14:12Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099864594",,"000611979200001",,"1","FOREST ECOSYSTEMS","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Along with their lower nutrient requirements, compared to specialized dairy breeds, they are expected to be better adapted to complex environments and valorize grasslands into dairy products of high quality. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the grazing selection of three contrasting dairy breeds on a biodiverse mountain pasture, and its consequences on milk fatty acid (FA) profile and prevalence of individual terpenes. A dual-purpose breed from the Italian Alps, the Valdostana Red Pied (Va), was compared to Montbéliardes (Mo), more specialized in milk production, and the highly specialized Holsteins (Ho). Diet selection was measured by scan-sampling, calculating selectivity indexes, and collecting simulated bites during two consecutive days in June (end of first grazing cycle) and July (second grazing cycle). Milk samples were collected at each milking during these experimental periods. Yield of milk and its fat and protein contents were measured. Milk FA and terpenes were analyzed by gas chromatographic methods. We tested the effects of breed, period and their interaction in a repeated mixed model, and calculated Pearson's correlations between behavioral data and milk FA as well as terpenes. The Va grazed less mature vegetation than Ho, but this difference was not sufficient to lead to a major breed effect on milk FA profile and prevalence of terpenes. However, the proportion of α-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3) was always higher in the milk fat of Va than Ho (Mo were intermediary), but this without any correlation to grazing selection. This could be a consequence from a different metabolism concerning ruminal biohydrogenation, but must be further investigated. Finally, we confirmed previous studies that highlighted a link between milk quality and cows' grazing behavior, but here without differences among breeds. All cows adapted their behavior to the herbage evolution during the season, leading to higher proportions of unsaturated FA in July than June milks. Our study suggests that under mountain grazing conditions (biodiverse pasture and cows in late lactation), milk quality depends more on herbage composition than on cow breed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000464737",,"2297-1769",,"10.3389/fvets.2020.612504","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/464737","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Grazing behavior||Simulated bites||Late-lactating||Holstein||Montbéliarde||Valdostana Red Pied||α-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3)","Little Difference in Milk Fatty Acid and Terpene Composition Among Three Contrasting Dairy Breeds When Grazing a Biodiverse Mountain Pasture",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-22T11:33:36Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85100460711",,"000614788000001","Front.

The understanding of this ecosystem function is of vital importance for future climate change research. In this study, we explored soil fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in four tropical forest sites located on the western flanks of the Andes in northern Ecuador. The measurements were carried out during the dry season from August to September 2018 and along an altitudinal gradient from 400 to 3010 m a.s.l. (above sea level). During this short-term campaign, our measurements showed (1) an unusual but marked increase in CO2 emissions at high altitude, possibly linked to changes in soil pH and/or root biomass, (2) a consistent atmospheric CH4 sink over all altitudes with high temporal and spatial variability, and (3) a transition from a net N2O source to sink along the altitudinal gradient. Our results provide arguments and insights for future and more detailed studies on tropical montane forests. Furthermore, they stress the relevance of using altitudinal transects as a biogeochemical open-air laboratory with a steep in situ environmental gradient over a limited spatial distance. Although short-term studies of temporal variations can improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind the production and consumption of soil GHGs, the inclusion of more rigorous sampling for forest management events, forest rotation cycles, soil type, hydrological conditions and drainage status, ground vegetation composition and cover, soil microclimate, and temporal (seasonality) and spatial (topographic positions) variability is needed in order to obtain more reliable estimates of the CO2, CH4, and N2O source/sink strength of tropical montane forests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000466544",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-18-413-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/466544","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ideas and perspectives: Patterns of soil CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes along an altitudinal gradient - A pilot study from an Ecuadorian neotropical montane forest",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-29T03:44:09Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099643724",,"000611534700001",,"2","Biogeosciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Eddy covariance (EC) measurements of CH4 flux are ideal for constraining ecosystem-scale CH4 emissions, including their seasonality, due to quasi-continuous and high temporal resolution of flux measurements, coincident measurements of carbon, water, and energy fluxes, lack of ecosystem disturbance, and increased availability of datasets over the last decade. Here, we 1) describe the newly published dataset, FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0, the first global dataset of CH4 EC measurements (available at https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4- community-product/). FLUXNET-CH4 includes half-hourly and daily gap-filled and non gap-filled aggregated CH4 fluxes and meteorological data from 79 sites globally: 42 freshwater wetlands, 6 brackish and saline wetlands, 7 formerly drained ecosystems, 7 rice paddy sites, 2 lakes, and 15 uplands. Then, we 2) evaluate FLUXNET-CH4 representativeness for freshwater wetland coverage globally, because the majority of sites in FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0 are freshwater wetlands and because freshwater wetlands are a substantial source of total atmospheric CH4 emissions; and 3) provide the first global estimates of the seasonal variability and seasonality predictors of freshwater wetland CH4 fluxes. Our representativeness analysis suggests that the freshwater wetland sites in the dataset cover global wetland bioclimatic attributes (encompassing energy, moisture, and vegetation-related parameters) in arctic, boreal, and temperate regions, but only sparsely cover humid tropical regions. Seasonality metrics of wetland CH4 emissions vary considerably across latitudinal bands. In freshwater wetlands (except those between 20° S to 20° N) the spring onset of elevated CH4 emissions starts three days earlier, and the CH4 emission season lasts 4 days longer, for each degree C increase in mean annual air temperature. On average, the onset of increasing CH4 emissions lags soil warming by one month, with very few sites experiencing increased CH4 emissions prior to the onset of soil warming. In contrast, roughly half of these sites experience the spring onset of rising CH4 emissions prior to the spring increase in gross primary productivity (GPP). The timing of peak summer CH4 emissions does not correlate with the timing for either peak summer temperature or peak GPP. Our results provide seasonality parameters for CH4 modeling, and highlight seasonality metrics that cannot be predicted by temperature or GPP (i.e., seasonality of CH4 peak). The FLUXNET-CH4 dataset provides an open-access resource for CH4 flux synthesis, has a range of applications, and is unique in that it includes coupled measurements of important CH4 drivers such as GPP and temperature. Although FLUXNET-CH4 could certainly be improved by adding more sites in tropical ecosystems and by increasing the number of site-years at existing sites, it is a powerful new resource for diagnosing and understanding the role of terrestrial ecosystems and climate drivers in the global CH4 cycle. All seasonality parameters are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4408468. Additionally, raw FLUXNET-CH4 data used to extract seasonality parameters can be downloaded from https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/, and a complete list of the 79 individual site data DOIs is provided in Table 2 in the Data Availability section of this document.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484338",,"1866-3591",,"10.5194/essd-2020-307","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484338","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"FLUXNET-CH4: A global, multi-ecosystem dataset and analysis of methane seasonality from freshwater wetlands",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2021-05-17T09:23:48Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Earth syst. sci. data, Pap. open discuss.",,"Earth System Science Data Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To better understand the relation of Cd binding to S and Cd isotope fractionation in soils and plants, we combined isotope and XAS speciation analyses in soil-rice systems that were rich in Cd and S. The systems included distinct water management (flooded vs. non-flooded) and rice accessions with (excluder) and without (non-excluder) functional membrane transporter OsHMA3 that transports Cd into root vacuoles. Initially, 13% of Cd in the soil was bound to S. Through soil flooding, the proportion of Cd bound to S increased to 100%. Soil flooding enriched the rice plants towards heavy isotopes (δ114/110Cd = −0.37 to −0.39%) compared to the plants that grew on non-flooded soils (δ114/110Cd = −0.45 to −0.56%) suggesting that preferentially light Cd isotopes precipitated into Cd sulfides. Isotope compositions in CaCl2 root extracts indicated that the root surface contributed to the isotope shift between soil and plant during soil flooding. In rice roots, Cd was fully bound to S in all treatments. The roots in the excluder rice strongly retained Cd and its lights isotopes while heavy isotopes were transported to the shoots (Δ114/110Cdshoot-root 0.16–0.19‰). The non-excluder rice accumulated Cd in shoots and the apparent difference in isotope composition between roots and shoots was smaller than that of the excluder rice (Δ114/110Cdshoot-root −0.02 to 0.08‰). We ascribe the retention of light Cd isotopes in the roots of the excluder rice to the membrane transport of Cd by OsHMA3 and/or chelating Cd–S complexes in the vacuole. Cd–S was the major binding form in flooded soils and rice roots and partly contributed to the immobilization of Cd and its light isotopes in soil-rice systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460370",,"0269-7491||1878-2450||1873-6424",,"10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115934","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460370","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cadmium||Rice||Isotopes||Speciation||Membrane transporter||Vacuole||Sulfur||Redox","Cadmium transfer in contaminated soil-rice systems: Insights from solid-state speciation analysis and stable isotope fractionation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-07T20:18:20Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097057851",,"000604429000008","Environ Pollut",,"Environmental Pollution","269","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a means for identifying chromosomal regions harboring deleterious DNA-variants causing such phenotypes. We performed a GWAS to unravel the causes of incidental cases of atypically small vulvae in German Landrace gilts.  Results A case-control GWAS involving Illumina porcine SNP60 BeadChip-called genotypes of 17 gilts with atypically small vulvae and 1818 control animals (fertile German Landrace sows) identified a significantly associated region on the X-chromosome (P = 8.81 × 10− 43). Inspection of whole-genome sequencing data in the critical area allowed us to pinpoint a likely causal variant in the form of a nonsense mutation of bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP15; Sscrofa11.1_X:g.44618787C>T, BMP15:p.R212X). The mutant allele occurs at a frequency of 6.2% in the German Landrace breeding population. Homozygous gilts exhibit underdeveloped, most likely not functional ovaries and are not fertile. Male carriers do not seem to manifest defects. Heterozygous sows produce 0.41±0.02 (P=4.5 × 10-83) piglets more than wildtype animals. However, the mutant allele’s positive effect on litter size accompanies a negative impact on lean meat growth.  Conclusion Our results provide an example for the power of GWAS in identifying the genetic causes of a fuzzy phenotype and add to the list of natural deleterious BMP15 mutations that affect fertility in a dosage-dependent manner, the first time in a poly-ovulatory species. We advise eradicating the mutant allele from the German Landrace breeding population since the adverse effects on the lean meat growth outweigh the larger litter size in heterozygous sows.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460451",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-020-07343-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460451","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A nonsense mutation of bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP15) causes both infertility and increased litter size in pigs",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-08T08:09:28Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85098852427",,"000608287900011","BMC Genomics","1","BMC Genomics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, studies on the soil environmental controls of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from African tropical forest ecosystems are still rare. The aim of this study was to disentangle the regulation effect of soil nutrients on soil GHG fluxes in a tropical forest in northwestern Uganda. Therefore, a large-scale nutrient manipulation experiment (NME) based on 40 m × 40 m plots with different nutrient addition treatments (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), N + P, and control) was established. Soil CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes were measured monthly using permanently installed static chambers for 14 months. Total soil CO2 fluxes were partitioned into autotrophic and heterotrophic components through a root trenching treatment. In addition, soil temperature, soil water content, and mineral N were measured in parallel to GHG fluxes. N addition (N, N + P) resulted in significantly higher N2O fluxes in the transitory phase (0–28 days after fertilization, p < 0.01), because N fertilization likely increased soil N beyond the microbial immobilization and plant nutritional demands leaving the excess to be nitrified or denitrified. Prolonged N fertilization however, did not elicit a significant response in background (measured more than 28 days after fertilization) N2O fluxes. P fertilization marginally and significantly increased transitory (p = 0.052) and background (p = 0.010) CH4 consumption, probably because it enhanced methanotrophic activity. Addition of N and P together (N + P) resulted in larger CO2 fluxes in the transitory phase (p = 0.010), suggesting a possible co-limitation of N and P on soil respiration. Heterotrophic (microbial) CO2 effluxes were significantly higher than the autotrophic (root) CO2 effluxes (p < 0.001) across all treatment plots with microbes contributing about three times more to the total soil CO2 effluxes compared to roots (p < 0.001). However, neither heterotrophic nor autotrophic respiration significantly differed between treatments. The results from this study suggest that the feedback of tropical forests to the global soil GHG budget could be disproportionately altered by changes in N and P availability in these biomes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000461942",,,,"10.5194/soil-2020-94","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461942","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Nutrient limitations regulate soil greenhouse gas fluxes from tropical forests: evidence from an ecosystem-scale nutrient manipulation experiment in Uganda",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2021-01-13T08:51:32Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Soil Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is well known that the variability of yields is linked to changes in meteorological conditions. However, little is known about the long-term effects of agronomic management strategies, such as the supply of important nutrients. We analysed the stability of four major European crops grown between 1955 and 2008 at a long-term fertilization experiment located in Germany. Six fertilizer treatments ranged from no fertilization over the omission of individual macronutrients to complete mineral fertilization with all major macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium). Yield stability was estimated for each crop × treatment combination using the relative yield deviation in each year from the corresponding (nonlinear) trend value (relative yield anomalies (RYA)). Stability was lowest for potato, followed by sugar beet and winter wheat and highest for winter rye. Stability was highest when soils had received all nutrients with the standard deviation of RYA being two to three times lower than for unfertilized plots. The omission of nitrogen and potassium was associated with a decrease in yield stability and a decrease in the number of simultaneous positive and negative yield anomalies among treatments. Especially in root crops nutrient supply strongly influenced both annual yield anomalies and changes in anomalies over time. During the second half of the observation period yield stability decreased for sugar beet and increased for winter wheat. Potato yields were more stable during the second period, but only under complete nutrient supply. The critical role of potassium supply for yield stability suggests potential links to changes in the water balance during the last decades. Results demonstrate the need to explicitly consider the response of crops to long-term nutrient supply for understanding and predicting changes in yield stability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460858",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/abc849","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460858","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Crop yield||Yield anomalies||Risk||Long-term data||Fertilization||Potassium","Nutrient supply affects the yield stability of major European crops - a 50 year study",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-09T14:50:13Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000600074500001","Environ.

However, nitrogen surplus permits (NSPs), which are tradeable, can be more cost-efficient in addressing the problem. To model this instrument, we calculated the individual marginal abatement cost curve for a sample of about 3,400 Swiss farms using farm-optimization models implemented in the agent-based agricultural sector model SWISSland. We also used SWISSland to analyze the effects of two NSP distribution systems (grandfathering and land-based allocation) on different farm types. The results showed that different farm types range in their abatement costs to reduce N surplus from an average of −0.04 CHF kg−1 N on arable farms to 51.06 CHF kg−1 N on special crop farms. We also found that N surpluses hardly explain the level of abatement costs. The biggest differences in effects of the distribution scheme were found in intensive livestock farm types such as pig or poultry farms.",,,,"0964-0568||1360-0559",,"10.1080/09640568.2020.1823344","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/452871","en","Routledge",,,"N surplus||Permit||Marginal abatement cost (MAC)||Gent-based modeling||Switzerland","Reduction of nitrogen pollution in agriculture through nitrogen surplus quotas: an analysis of individual marginal abatement cost and different quota allocation schemes using an agent-based model",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-11-25T03:50:59Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000588157200001","J. environ. plan. manag.","8","Journal of Environmental Planning and Management","64","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite tremendous advancements in DNA sequencing technologies and genome assembly methods, genome sequences of highest quality in terms of completeness, correctness and contiguity are yet to be established for the Lolium-Festuca species complex. The International Lolium-Festuca Pangenome Consortium (ILFPC) has set out to fill this gap and aims at establishing multiple high-quality genome sequences to advance forage and turf grass research and breeding. Here we report about first results of the joint efforts within ILFPC and, more importantly, how the established genomic resources can help answering biological questions. Using self-incompatibility (SI) as an example, we present how whole genome assemblies can be used to resolve the gene content and order at one SI locus, previously identified by fine-mapping. The multiple genomes obtained through ILFPC also enabled us to compare the gene constitution of different genotypes within and across species and link this information to SI functionality. The availability of multiple high-quality genome assemblies constitutes a milestone for genetic studies, functional biology and genomics-assisted breeding. Moreover, comparing genomes and moving towards pangenomics opens new opportunities to describe structural genome variation and unlock genetic diversity in the Lolium-Festuca species complex.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528455","978-80-244-5967-7||978-80-244-5968-4||978-80-244-5969-1",,,"10.5507/vup.21.24459677.11","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528455","en","Palacký University","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Lolium-Festuca species complex||International Lolium-Festuca Pangenome Consortium (ILFPC)||Self-incompatibility","Understanding forage grass genomes beyond single nucleotide variation - an example on self-incompatibility",,"Conference Paper","Open access","Exploiting genetic diversity of forages to fulfil their economic and environmental roles",,,"2022-01-25T13:58:23Z",,,,,,,"yes","34th Meeting of the EUCARPIA Fodder Crops and Amenity Grasses Section","September 6-8, 2021","Freising, Germany",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Their ecosystem services (i.e., the ecosystem functions that benefit people) include erosion prevention, the regulation of the flows of water, carbon and nitrogen, many cultural services, and the production of roughage for ruminant feeding. Grasslands can be categorized according to their management intensity into natural (i.e., grasslands that can persist without any management intervention), semi-natural (i.e., grasslands that require low intensity management like moderate grazing and mowing), and improved grasslands (i.e., grasslands that are managed intensively, usually involving the use of fertilizers and the use of high yielding plant varieties). In the temperate latitudes of Western Europe, most grassland areas are semi-natural or improved, and in countries like Switzerland, they play a central role in agriculture, with more than 70% of the agricultural land being dedicated to grasslands. Long term trends of consumer demand for animal-based products, however, have been posing a heavy burden on grassland ecosystems. The focus on biomass yield at the expense of other ecosystem services has led many farmers to shift to more intensive grassland management practices or to convert their grasslands into croplands. A large proportion of semi-natural grasslands has been lost since the beginning of the twentieth century in the temperate latitudes of the world. A growing body of scientific research and agricultural policies is currently oriented to understanding, evaluating, and incentivizing agricultural management practices that ensure grassland productivity while retaining greater grassland ecosystem functioning (i.e., grassland multifunctionality). This has important implications for the food security of the coming generations, particularly under changing climatic conditions.  Plant biodiversity is an important contributor to grassland ecosystem functioning. High levels of species richness (i.e., between-species diversity) and genetic diversity (i.e., within-species diversity) stabilize yield even under environmental stress. Furthermore, the genetic diversity of grass and legume species —the two most economically relevant plant families in grasslands— comprises valuable genetic resources for forage breeding. Biodiversity monitoring of grassland plants is therefore an essential task for the mobilization of useful plant genetic resources and for the promotion of grassland multifunctionality through scientific research and agricultural policies.  Certain features of grassland plants complicate biodiversity monitoring, particularly at the level of genetic diversity. Grasslands span large areas and can harbor a great diversity of plant species, all of which have the potential to contribute to grassland multifunctionality. Multispecies assessments are therefore needed for comprehensive evaluations of the ecological effects of plant genetic diversity. Furthermore, grassland plant species usually have intricate life-history traits. Their strong outbreeding behavior generates high levels of genetic diversity and blurs the genetic differentiation between populations in geographical proximity. Frequent polyploidization events and interspecific hybridization can also blur the lines between closely related or interfertile species, as is the case in many grasses like the Festuca/Lolium complex and the species of the genus Poa. Such biological features pose hurdles for both species richness and genetic diversity assessment.  Continuous advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies are quickly improving the prospects of large-scale monitoring grassland plant biodiversity. High-throughput sequencing approaches like complexity reduction libraries and targeted sequencing can be applied to assess species richness (e.g., DNA metabarcoding) and genetic diversity (e.g., sequence capture, and amplicon sequencing). Each high-throughput sequencing approach, however, comes with specific strengths and limitations. An evaluation of their performance, their cost-effectiveness, and their applicability for multispecies assessments (in the case of genetic diversity) is necessary for their including in large-scale monitoring efforts.  The main goal of this thesis is to develop and evaluate DNA sequencing-based methods for grassland plant biodiversity assessments, with a special focus on genetic diversity. This work introduces novel, high-throughput sequencing-based resources for multispecies genetic diversity assessment in forage crop species. In addition, it presents the optimization and evaluation of DNA barcoding for the taxonomic assignment of such species. A central aspect of this work was the development of methods that are applicable in a wide array of species (i.e., multispecies methods). We therefore produced and used genomic information on a set of sixteen grassland plant species defined as priority species by the Swiss National Action Plant for the Protection and Sustainable Use of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.  In Chapter 1, we present an overview of the ecological and agricultural relevance of grassland plant biodiversity, both in terms of species richness and genetic diversity. We highlight the central role of biodiversity monitoring for the successful implementation of international and national biodiversity protection efforts and agricultural policies, such as the direct payment schemes for the in-situ conservation of grassland plant genetic resources currently in place in Switzerland. We end that chapter by describing the main challenges for the large-scale biodiversity monitoring of grassland plants and by stating in more detail the aim of this project, together with more details on our focus species. Special attention is given to their genetic diversity patterns, which are the main topic of this work.  In Chapter 2, we present a review of the DNA sequencing methods available for the study of genetic diversity in grassland plant species. The strengths and limitations of each method is detailed, and we highlight their prospects for large-scale genetic diversity monitoring.  As a preliminary step for large-scale species richness assessment, we present in Chapter 3 an evaluation and some optimizations of the DNA barcoding methodology in our focus grassland plant species. DNA barcoding is a targeted sequencing approach that is widely used to assess species richness and abundances in microorganisms, and some animal and plant taxa. We conclude that DNA barcoding is a promising prospect for year-round, large-scale species richness assessments in grassland plant species, particularly for legumes.  In Chapter 4, we introduce the development of a set of multispecies primers that can be used to assess genetic diversity in grassland plant species. The results of this study are divided into a “discovery phase”, in which we produced genomic-level information of the genetic diversity of five genotypes of our focus species using a sequence capture assay (i.e., a targeted sequencing method based on probe hybridization); and a “validation phase”, in which a set of multispecies primers targeting a selection of genetically diverse loci (which were determined in the discovery phase) was used to evaluate the genetic diversity of test populations of five grassland plant species: orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and white clover (Trifolium repens L.). We conclude that multispecies amplicon sequencing is an accurate method for genetic diversity assessment in grassland plant species, which can be implemented in large-scale monitoring efforts. Furthermore, we present some ways how the resources developed in this work (i.e., the sequence capture probes and the multispecies primers) can be further improved and extended by the development of more multispecies primers, the implementation of multiplex PCR, and by the use of mixed-species samples.  In Chapter 5, we evaluated the possibility of performing genetic diversity assessments on mixed-species samples. For this, we used single-species- and mixed-species-samples of orchardgrass, meadow fescue, perennial ryegrass, red clover, and white clover. We also produced a reference database for the species-level taxonomic assignment of sequencing reads. This database was produced by amplifying and sequencing the multispecies amplicons in an extended set of 19 grassland plant species. Although sequencing coverage was low, the genetic diversity estimates from mixed-species samples was well correlated to those of their corresponding single-species samples.  We conclude that genetic diversity assessment using large single-species samples has an acceptable accuracy, and that genetic diversity assessment in mixed-species samples is a promising prospect. Further work is needed to improve taxonomic assignments in interfertile grass species and to improve the sequencing coverage.  Finally, in the general discussion and concluding remarks presented in Chapter 6, we reflect on the strengths and limitations of the methods developed in this work for biodiversity monitoring. We present the results of this work as contributions to the toolset for biodiversity monitoring, which can be leveraged by already existing monitoring programs and which will have the greatest impact in the hands of expert users that oversee their implementation by non-specialized personnel. We present some prospects for the improvement of amplicon sequencing-based genetic diversity assessments. We also provide some insights on the sampling methodology needed for large-scale applications, highlighting the usefulness of single- and mixed-species bulked-samples (i.e., samples that contain biomass from multiple species) for cost-efficient analysis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000524178",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524178","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","genetic diversity||grasslands||Molecular ecology||Plant sciences||Biodiversity monitoring","Genomics-based diversity assessment in grassland plants",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences",,"2022-01-10T09:31:24Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27868",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The process is supported by agronomical and environmental data that can be collected through a multitude of sensors, which allow monitoring crop growth in the field and nutrient availability from the soil in real-time and at high spatial and temporal resolution. Wheat is one of the three most cultivated crops globally, with about 750 Mt year−1 production and the most cultivated cereal crop in Europe and Switzerland. At the same time, the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in wheat cultivation (and other crops) is relatively low in Europe and globally, with values between 30% and 70%, whereas an optimal NUE should be about 80–90% to balance a low N surplus with a low risk of soil N depletion. Nitrogen (N) is often the most limiting nutrient for plant growth and accounts for most fertilizer applied in agriculture to promote high yield. The inaccurate use of N fertilizers globally and in Switzerland causes some of the major environmental and health problems related to agricultural crop production, namely the emission of greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere and nitrate leaching (NO3 – ) into groundwater. Furthermore, the sources of N available to the plant during the season are affected by the natural spatial variability at field scale and the timely synchronization between N inputs from fertilization and crop N demand. The concept of observing, measuring, and responding to inter- and intra-field variability in crops during the season is known as site-specific N management. This thesis's objective was to develop and test a combination of digital and standard methods to provide decision-support for N fertilization in winter wheat production in Switzerland. The basic idea is that monitoring the agro-ecosystem's dynamic processes leads to a more automated quantification of the N balance, including the N supplied by the soil system. By precisely estimating the required, additional N input in relation to the expected N outputs, a better-informed N management would result in increased N use efficiency and reduced risk of N emission to the environment. This thesis's central hypothesis was that the implementation of site-specific N fertilization using variable rate (VR) technology would reduce average N application compared to the standard (ST) uniform application without affecting yield, thus increasing N use efficiency and reducing the risk of N surplus. The methods established were based on sensor data such as multi-spectral images and soil properties combined with standard plant and soil analysis. The experimental setup consisted of a multi-plot design with two treatments (VR and ST) and two controls (no fertilizer and additional fertilizer) in seven fields over three years (2018–2020) for a total of seven site-years (F1–F7) located in northeast Switzerland.ii Wheat was monitored throughout the season to support three split fertilizer applications. The combined imaging and ground truth plant data were used to validate the sensitivity of spectral vegetation indices, suitable for the sensor used, with biomass and N status traits. Grain yield was mainly in the expected range (6–7 t ha−1), and no significant difference between VR and ST was observed. In contrast, N fertilizer application was reduced in the VR treatments between 5 and 40%, depending on the field. In most site-years, N use efficiency was improved (13% on average) by redistributing and reducing the amount of N fertilizer applied. However, a better prediction of N mineralization in the soil and related N uptake by the plants was necessary to further optimize in season N fertilization. To better understand the relation between the components of the N balance and crop growth, part of the study concentrated on the ST treatment of six site-years (F2–F7). Two indicators were tested to link the weekly remote sensing-based monitoring of N uptake and nitrate-N dynamics in soil pore water measured with suction cups and an ion-selective electrode. The N balance was calculated and compared with the fertilization recommended by the adjusted N fertilization norm (ANFN) a good practice to determine N fertilizer requirement in Switzerland. The remotely estimated Nuptake (REN) allowed high temporal resolution N monitoring. The changes in nitrate-N in the soil solution (NSS) could be monitored weekly. The REN and NSS showed a distinct relationship for high- and low yielding fields. The timely integration of both was related to improved NUE and reduced N surplus. For Swiss wheat production, NUE can be increased and surpluses reduced with the ANFN method. A concept was developed to assess the economic and environmental performance of the two treatments VR and ST. The N balance was linked to the economic optima. This relation was used to calculate N fertilizer's price that would need to be charged to maximize revenues and minimize the risk of N surplus. On average, net revenues in VR were 4% (94 CHF ha−1) higher than in the ST treatment. The residual N was on average 32% (21 kg N ha–1 ) lower in VR compared to ST, due to a reduction in N inputs of 13% without significant yield differences. The economic optima ranged from 200 to 240 kg N ha–1 over the three years (2018–2020). The point where increasing N surplus occurs varied from 180 to 205 kg N ha–1 (2018–2020). The results imply that if N fertilizer's price increases by 20–40%, the gap between the economic optimum and the optimal N fertilization could be reduced. In conclusion, by monitoring and managing the variability observed in crop and soil, the established methods showed possible solutions to reduce N surplus in medium- to small-scale wheat production in Switzerland. Ultimately, the progress necessary to further improve wheat cultivation will rely on identifying genotypes and precision management practices better adapted to the changing environment. Sensor-based monitoring of agro-ecosystems can lead the way to these practices, aiming to maintain profitability, high yields, and quality, and reduce ecological impact by reducing emissions to the environment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493036",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493036","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Smart farming||Nitrogen management||Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum)||Soil nutrient content||Remote sensing","Combined digital and standard methods to  optimize nitrogen (N) management and  reduce N surplus in winter wheat  (T. aestivum) production",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-07-05T12:00:46Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27550",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The system consists of interconnected compartments for fish rearing and plant production, as well as for water filtration, with all compartments hosting diverse microbial communities, which interact within the system. Due to the design, function and operation mode of the individual compartments, each of them exhibits unique biotic and abiotic conditions. Elucidating how these conditions shape microbial communities is useful in understanding how these compartments may affect the quality of the water, in which plants and fish are cultured.  Results We investigated the possible relationships between microbial communities from biofilms and water quality parameters in different compartments of the aquaponic system. Biofilm samples were analyzed by total community profiling for bacterial and archaeal communities. The results implied that the oxygen levels could largely explain the main differences in abiotic parameters and microbial communities in each compartment of the system. Aerobic system compartments are highly biodiverse and work mostly as a nitrifying biofilter, whereas biofilms in the anaerobic compartments contain a less diverse community. Finally, the part of the system connecting the aerobic and anaerobic processes showed common conditions where both aerobic and anaerobic processes were observed.  Conclusion Different predicted microbial activities for each compartment were found to be supported by the abiotic parameters, of which the oxygen saturation, total organic carbon and total nitrogen differentiated clearly between samples from the main aerobic loop and the anaerobic compartments. The latter was also confirmed using microbial community profile analysis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460923",,"1471-2180",,"10.1186/s12866-020-02075-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460923","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Aquaponics||Chemical analysis||Community analysis||Archaea||Bacteria||T-RFLP","Environmental parameters and microbial community profiles as indication towards microbial activities and diversity in aquaponic system compartments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-11T03:54:09Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85098782179",,"000608036000008","BMC microbiol.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficiency of increasing levels of perilla meal in broiler diets to modify the fatty acid composition and other properties of meat quality. Two-hundred broilers were divided into five groups and fed diets with 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8% perilla meal. The breast and thigh meat of the broilers, slaughtered at 42 days of age, were subjected to in-depth physicochemical and sensory analyses. The results showed that perilla meal efficiently modified the fatty acid compositions of the lipids of both muscles. Saturated fatty acids declined, especially C14:0 and C16:0, whereas monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) increased significantly in both muscle groups. The C14:1, C16:1, and C18:3 n-3 levels were found to be significantly different between treatment groups, in which the highest values were noticed in the perilla meal groups. Small increases in n-6 fatty acids resulted in commensurate decreases in n-6:n-3 ratios. Increased C18:3 n-3 proportions, as well as extended oxidative stability, were observed particularly in the 2% perilla meal inclusion. Perilla meal also increased protein content and water holding capacity (WHC), and decreased fat content and shear force; whereas the sensory evaluations were unchanged in both portions of meat.",,,,"1685-1994","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462365||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/463533","10.12982/cmujns.2021.015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/463746","en","Chiang Mai University",,,"Broiler meat||Meat quality||n-3 fatty acid||Perilla meal","Increased Levels of De-oiled Perilla Seed Meal in Broiler Diets to Enhance n-3 Fatty Acid Proportions and Improve Efficiency Levels",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-14T07:07:29Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85098877046",,,,"1","Chiang Mai University journal of natural sciences","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Worse, the strong reinforcement of the legislation regarding animal welfare and health concerns (e.g. ban on cage housing, ban on the use of antibiotics as growth promoters) over the last decades has passed totally unseen to most consumers. Furthermore, consumers’ perception of chicken is different from that of beef, leading to different expectations. Chicken is mostly perceived as cheap, healthy and blend in taste. This perception can be a hurdle when trying to create added value with chicken. Chicken production is also seen as highly intensive, giving rise to mistrust.

Resistance to fire blight is described especially in wild Malus accessions such as M. × robusta 5 (Mr5), but the molecular basis of host resistance response to the pathogen Erwinia amylovora is still largely unknown. The bacterial effector protein AvrRpt2EA was found to be the key determinant of resistance response in Mr5. A wild type E. amylovora strain and the corresponding avrRpt2EA deletion mutant were used for inoculation of Mr5 to induce resistance or susceptible response, respectively. By comparison of the transcriptome of both responses, 211 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. We found that heat-shock response including heat-shock proteins (HSPs) and heat-shock transcription factors (HSFs) are activated in apple specifically in the susceptible response, independent of AvrRpt2EA. Further analysis on the expression progress of 81 DEGs by high-throughput real-time qPCR resulted in the identification of genes that were activated after inoculation with E. amylovora. Hence, a potential role of these genes in the resistance to the pathogen is postulated, including genes coding for enzymes involved in formation of flavonoids and terpenoids, ribosome-inactivating enzymes (RIPs) and a squamosa promoter binding-like (SPL) transcription factor.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000482495",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-021-88032-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/482495","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Transcriptional profile of AvrRpt2EA-mediated resistance and susceptibility response to Erwinia amylovora in apple",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-05T04:07:02Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85104691417",,"000642742500058","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Among essential nutritious food, fresh fruits and vegetable, such as tomato, are produced to meet local demand, but also to be traded internationally. Tomatoes are high-value products that represent a significant source of income for its producers. However, the production of such water demanding crops, is subject to vulnerability in face of climate related shocks such as drought or heavy rainfalls, threatening subsequently their producers’ livelihood. Addressing impacts of climate related shocks on producers and ways to enhance their resilience becomes central to tackle food systems challenges. Yet, ways to address agricultural producer’s resilience are disputed and trade-offs between ecological and socio-economical functions are colliding.  The overarching goal of this thesis is to contribute to ways to operationalize producer’s climate resilience, by having a special focus on tomato production in two countries: Morocco and Ghana. These two countries have been chosen as they exemplify the diverse problematic around tomato production on the African continent.  In this thesis, we used a combination of systems dynamics modeling tools and a survey among 244 tomato producers of two major producing regions in Morocco: the Souss-Massa region, where production is under greenhouses and mainly for export and the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra, where the production is open-field and intended for the national market. We analyzed the interactions between agricultural, ecological and socio-economic dimensions of the tomato production systems, and simulated the long-term behavior of the two production systems. The results of the model simulations highlighted how overexploitation of groundwater tables affects crop production and farmers’ income. We extended the analysis with our model, to further observe the effects of various ranges of droughts on the two production systems. Our results showed that droughts are accelerating the process of groundwater depletion, increasingly impacting farmers’ income. Finally, we analysed two policies that are suggested as a set of adaptative measures for a systemic enhancement of resilience under these circumstances. We show that a more radical approach towards water resource conservation upholding the most vulnerable producers has to be adopted.  In Ghana, we conducted a survey among 344 tomato small-scale farmers in Ashanti and Upper East Region and complemented it with a system map based on evidence from tomato value chain stakeholders. The results show that farmers are severely exposed not only to climate, but also market related shocks, which negatively affect both production activities and farmers’ revenues. Furthermore, we identified that only few response mechanisms are in place yet to face these shocks, and we suggest that the current system is suboptimal and therefore requires transformation.  The results of the studies in both countries, showed that operationalizing resilience requires a systemic approach to address the interconnections, feedback mechanisms and long-term outcomes of shocks on tomato producers. Enhancing resilience demands an integrated approach based on engagement of value-chains stakeholders, to support appropriate structures encompassing both climate and trading aspects. We, therefore, conclude that leaning towards a sustainable and inclusive resilience requires a transformation of the existing systems in place.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000477538",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477538","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Food systems||Systems dynamics||Socio-ecological resilience||Water management||Climate change","Operationalizing resilience in the face of climate change.

In addition, Sentinel-1 C-Band time series data are used to increase the temporal resolution of the predicting features and to add phenological characteristics. For two 1.3×1.3km test tiles, random forest classifiers are trained using different combinations (ALS, SAR, ALS+SAR) of input features.

Since microorganisms are the key drivers of soil organic carbon decomposition, this knowledge gap causes uncertainty in the predictions of future carbon cycling in the subsoil carbon pool (> 50 % of the soil organic carbon stocks are below 30 cm soil depth).  In the Blodgett Forest field warming experiment (California, USA) we investigated how +4 ∘C warming in the whole-soil profile to 100 cm soil depth for 4.5 years has affected the abundance and community structure of microorganisms. We used proxies for bulk microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and functional microbial groups based on lipid biomarkers, such as phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs). With depth, the microbial biomass decreased and the community composition changed. Our results show that the concentration of PLFAs decreased with warming in the subsoil (below 30 cm) by 28 % but was not affected in the topsoil. Phospholipid fatty acid concentrations changed in concert with soil organic carbon. The microbial community response to warming was depth dependent. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria increased in warmed subsoil, and Gram+ bacteria in subsoils adapted their cell membrane structure to warming-induced stress, as indicated by the ratio of anteiso to iso branched PLFAs. Our results show for the first time that subsoil microorganisms can be more affected by warming compared to topsoil microorganisms. These microbial responses could be explained by the observed decrease in subsoil organic carbon concentrations in the warmed plots. A decrease in microbial abundance in warmed subsoils might reduce the magnitude of the respiration response over time. The shift in the subsoil microbial community towards more Actinobacteria might disproportionately enhance the degradation of previously stable subsoil carbon, as this group is able to metabolize complex carbon sources.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000500552",,"2199-3971||2199-398X",,"10.5194/soil-7-477-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500552","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Whole-soil warming decreases abundance and modifies the community structure of microorganisms in the subsoil but not in surface soil",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-12T03:11:52Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"When trees die: Understanding how plants and microbes interact and influence soil biogeochemical processes","180030","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,"85112238960",,"000680819500002",,"2","Soil","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As such, tropical SOC stabilization mechanisms likely differ from those in temperate soils due to contrasting soil development. To better understand these mechanisms, we investigated SOC dynamics at three soil depths under pristine tropical African mountain forest along a geochemical gradient from mafic to felsic and a topographic gradient covering plateau, slope and valley positions. To do so, we conducted a series of soil C fractionation experiments in combination with an analysis of the geochemical composition of soil and a sequential extraction of pedogenic oxides. Relationships between our target and predicting variables were investigated using a combination of regression analyses and dimension reduction. Here, we show that reactive secondary mineral phases drive SOC properties and stabilization mechanisms together with, and sometimes more strongly than, other mechanisms such as aggregation or C stabilization by clay content. Key mineral stabilization mechanisms for SOC were strongly related to soil geochemistry, differing across the study regions. These findings were independent of topography in the absence of detectable erosion processes. Instead, fluvial dynamics and changes in soil moisture conditions had a secondary control on SOC dynamics in valley positions, leading to higher SOC stocks there than at the non-valley positions. At several sites, we also detected fossil organic carbon (FOC), which is characterized by high C/N ratios and depletion of N. FOC constitutes up to 52.0 +/- 13.2 % of total SOC stock in the C-depleted subsoil. Interestingly, total SOC stocks for these soils did not exceed those of sites without FOC. Additionally, FOC decreased strongly towards more shallow soil depths, indicating decomposability of FOC by microbial communities under more fertile conditions. Regression models, considering depth intervals of 0-10, 30-10 and 60-70 cm, showed that variables affiliated with soil weathering, parent material geochemistry and soil fertility, together with soil depth, explained up to 75 % of the variability of SOC stocks and Delta C-14. Furthermore, the same variables explain 44 % of the variability in the relative abundance of C associated with microaggregates vs. free-silt- and-clay-associated C fractions. However, geochemical variables gained or retained importance for explaining SOC target variables when controlling for soil depth. We conclude that despite long-lasting weathering, geochemical properties of soil parent material leave a footprint in tropical soils that affects SOC stocks and mineral-related C stabilization mechanisms. While identified stabilization mechanisms and controls are similar to less weathered soils in other climate zones, their relative importance is markedly different in the tropical soils investigated.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000500537",,"2199-3971||2199-398X",,"10.5194/soil-7-453-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500537","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The role of geochemistry in organic carbon stabilization against microbial decomposition in tropical rainforest soils",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-12T03:11:52Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85112208524",,"000680819500001",,"2","Soil","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The reference genome of domestic cattle was built from a single animal from the Hereford breed. However, the linear reference sequence does not represent the genetic diversity of global cattle breeds. The lack of diversity causes problems, particularly when DNA sequences from genetically distant animals are aligned and compared to the reference sequence. This issue is widely known as reference bias. Pangenomes are an intriguing novel reference structure to consider the full-spectrum of genetic diversity within a species. A rich, graph-based pangenome reference can integrate multiple genome assemblies and their sites of variations in a coherent and non-redundant data structure. This thesis investigated for the first time the utility of graph-based references for genomic analysis in a livestock population. 					 Chapter 2 assessed the feasibility of graph-based genomic analysis in cattle. Specifically, a graph-based sequence variant genotyping approach was implemented using the Graphtyper software and compared to two widely-used methods (SAMtools and GATK) that rely on a strictly linear representation of the reference using whole-genome sequencing data of 49 Original Braunvieh cattle. A comparison between sequence variant and array-derived genotypes indicated that the graph-based approach outperformed both SAMtools and GATK with regard to genotype concordance, non-reference sensitivity, non-reference discrepancy, and Mendelian consistency of genotypes observed in parent-offspring pairs. These findings demonstrated that graph-based genotyping using Graphtyper is accurate, sensitive, and computationally feasible in the cattle genome. 					 Chapter 3 reports on the construction of breed-specific and multi-breed genome graphs for four European cattle breeds (Original Braunvieh, Brown Swiss, Fleckvieh, and Holstein). The vg toolkit was used to augment the linear Hereford-based reference sequence with variants that were prioritized based on allele frequency in different breeds. Based on both real and simulated short-read sequencing data, this study showed that variant prioritization is crucial to build informative genome graphs. Intriguingly, adding many low frequency and rare variants to the genome graphs compromised mapping accuracy. Moreover, this chapter demonstrated that multi-breed graphs and breed-specific graphs enable almost identical mapping improvements over a linear reference genome. Finally, the first whole-genome graph was constructed for the Brown Swiss cattle breed using 14 million variants. The application of this whole-genome graph facilitated accurate short-read mapping and unbiased sequence variant discovery. 					 Chapter 4 reports on integrating six reference-quality bovine genome assemblies into a unified multi-assembly graph using the minigraph software. The pangenome contains 70 megabases that are not present in the current ARS-UCD1.2 Bos taurus reference genome. Using complementary bioinformatics approaches, this chapter provides compelling evidence that these non-reference sequences contain functionally active and biologically-relevant elements. Specifically, the analysis of transcriptome data revealed putatively novel genes, including some that are differentially expressed between individual animals. Moreover, variant discovery in the non-reference sequences revealed thousands of yet undetected polymorphic sites capturing genetic differentiation across cattle breeds. This chapter demonstrated that multi-assembly graphs make so far neglected genetic variations amenable to genetic investigations.  Overall, this thesis presents a novel analysis paradigm in livestock genomics by leveraging variation-aware reference structures. The analyses presented in this thesis provide a first step towards the transition from linear to graph-based reference structures in order to mitigate inherent biases of the linear reference genome. Importantly, this thesis establishes a computational framework to integrate multiple genome assemblies and their sites of variations into a more diverse reference structure broadly applicable across species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000510180",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510180","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Pangenome||Bioinformatics||Genomics||Genetics","Establishing Bovine Pangenome Graphs",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,"2021-10-16T04:36:55Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27672",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using metabarcoding, we assessed temporal dynamics of soil bacterial and fungal communities in three land-use types, i.e., arable land, permanent grassland, and forest, over five years. Soil microbial communities remained relatively stable and differences over time were smaller than those among sites. Temporal variability was highest in arable soils. Indications for consistent shifts in community structure over five years were only detected at one site for bacteria and at two sites for fungi, which provided further support for long-term stability of soil microbial communities. A sliding window analysis was applied to assess the effect of OTU abundance on community structures. Partial communities with decreasing OTU abundances revealed a gradually decreasing structural similarity with entire communities. This contrasted with the steep decline of OTU abundances, as subsets of rare OTUs (<0.01%) revealed correlations of up to 0.97 and 0.81 with the entire bacterial and fungal communities. Finally, 23.4% of bacterial and 19.8% of fungal OTUs were identified as scarce, i.e., neither belonging to site-cores nor correlating to environmental factors, while 67.3% of bacterial and 64.9% of fungal OTUs were identified as rare but not scarce. Our results demonstrate high stability of soil microbial communities in their abundant and rare fractions over five years.

The long-term effects of this transformation of pristine forests to fallow-based agroecosystems and secondary forests on biogeochemical cycles that drive forest functioning are poorly understood. Here, we show that biomass burning on the African continent results in high phosphorus (P) deposition on an equatorial forest via fire-derived atmospheric emissions. Furthermore, we show that deposition loads increase with forest regrowth age, likely due to increasing canopy complexity, ranging from 0.4 kg P ha−1 yr−1 on agricultural fields to 3.1 kg P ha−1 yr−1 on old secondary forests. In forest systems, canopy wash-off of dry P deposition increases with rainfall amount, highlighting how tropical forest canopies act as dynamic reservoirs for enhanced addition of this essential plant nutrient. Overall, the observed P deposition load at the study site is substantial and demonstrates the importance of canopy trapping as a pathway for nutrient input into forest ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504150",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-021-25428-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504150","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Fire-derived phosphorus fertilization of African tropical forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-05T02:44:19Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113640555",,"000691126200007","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These microbial dynamics are controlled by water availability in three fundamental ways: as resource, as solvent, and as transport medium. For one of the dominant tree species in Swiss forests - Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) - high mortality rates have been observed in recent decades. In the Rhone valley of Switzerland, forest dieback appears to be primarily caused by direct effects of drought and an increasing susceptibility of trees to further constraints, such as pathogen attacks. Nonetheless, water limitation does not affect soil microbes and trees separately but rather induces a series of interconnected effects between trees and the associated soil microbiome, which could strongly alter carbon and nutrient cycling in forests. We conduct a study to investigate the effects of drought on the biological interplay between Scots pine trees and soil microbial communities. We aim to estimate how shifts in microbial community composition and functional capacity under drought may affect nutrient cycling and tree vitality potentially contributing to tree mortality. In order to understand these mechanisms, we perform greenhouse experiments with tree-soil mesocosms under controlled conditions. State-of-the art molecular methods such as metabarcoding of ribosomal markers, shotgun metagenome sequencing, and qPCR of key functional genes are used to unravel alterations in the soil microbiome and in the underlying functional metabolic potential related to drought and associated tree-mortality. Furthermore, to elucidate the impact of drought on microbial carbon dynamics, stable isotope labelling techniques have been applied to trace 13C labeled plant photosynthates into the soil microbial communities by analyzing 13C signatures of phospholipid fatty acids. Investigation of soil physicochemical properties and tree-vitality is done in parallel with the microbial assessments to understand the feedbacks on nutrient-cycling and the soil-tree continuum. The overarching aim of this study is to gain new insights into the complex relationships between soil, trees and microbes under drought.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516734",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-16542","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516734","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Investigating the drought-prone biological interplay of soil microbial communities and Scots pine trees ",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2021-11-24T15:17:18Z",,,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19-30, 2021","Online",,,,"When trees die: Understanding how plants and microbes interact and influence soil biogeochemical processes","180030","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Increasing global temperatures have the potential to stimulate the decomposition of carbon stored in peatlands, contributing to the release of disproportionate amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere but increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations may stimulate photosynthesis and return C into ecosystems.  Key questions remain about the magnitude and rate of these interacting and opposite processes to environmental change drivers.  We assessed the impact of a 0–9°C temperature gradient of deep peat warming (4 years of warming; 0-200 cm depth) in ambient or elevated CO2 (2 years of +500 ppm CO2 addition) on the quantity and quality of SOM at the climate change manipulation experiment SPRUCE (Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments) in Minnesota USA. We assessed how warming and elevated CO2 affect the degradation of plant and microbial residues as well as the incorporation of these compounds into SOM. Specifically, we combined the analyses of free extractable n-alkanes and fatty acids together with measurements of compound-specific stable carbon isotopes (δ13C).  We observed a 6‰ offset in δ13C between bulk SOM and n-alkanes, which were uniformly depleted in δ13C when compared to bulk organic matter. Such an offset between SOM and n-alkanes is common due to biosynthetic isotope fractionation processes and confirms previous findings. After 4 years of deep peat warming, and 2 years of elevated CO2 addition a strong depth-specific response became visible with changes in SOM quantity and quality. In the upper 0-30 cm depth, individual n-alkanes and fatty acid concentrations declined with increasing temperatures with warming treatments, but not below 50 cm depth. In turn, the δ13C values of bulk organic matter and of individual n-alkanes and fatty acids increased in the upper 0-30 cm with increasing temperatures, but not below 50 cm depth. Thus n-alkanes, which typically turnover slower than bulk SOM, underwent a rapid transformation after a relatively short period of simulated warming in the acrotelm. Our results suggest that warming accelerated microbial decomposition of plant-derived lipids, leaving behind more degraded organic matter. The non-uniform, and depth dependent warming response implies that warming will have cascading effects on SOM decomposition in the acrotelm in peatlands.

These conditions likely do not only affect the growth and vitality of trees but may also feed back on the cycling of carbon and nitrogen at the interface between roots and soils.  In September 2019, we established a mesocosm experiment to mechanistically study on a seasonal basis how the interactions between plants and soil biotic and abiotic resources are altered during events of drought. The mesocosms feature young Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees and soil collected from a drought-affected natural forest in the Rhone valley, Switzerland; and are treated with three different levels of water availability (control, sufficient water; intermediate drought, 40% reduction; severe drought, 75% reduction). One year after the start of the experiment an isotopic labelling campaign with 13CO2 was conducted to trace the natural pathway of photosynthetic assimilates into above- and belowground carbon pools and fluxes.  During the first growing season of the experiment, severe drought more than doubled the growth of fine roots when compared to the control treatment. In turn, the mean diameter of the fine roots significantly decreased by 22%, and fewer ectomycorrhizal root tips were observed. These findings suggest that trees exposed to drought invest more in within-plant carbon maintenance and in the growth of root systems, rather than in the allocation of carbon to sustain the biology in the rhizosphere for nutrient acquisition. Moreover, post-label soil pore 13CO2 concentrations and total soil CO2 concentrations were lower under severe drought compared to intermediate and control treatments, indicating a generally reduced carbon metabolism. By tracking the fate of 13C assimilates into fine roots, soils and microbial communities over time we now investigate whether there is a threshold at which Scots pine trees stop investing in providing carbon to the rhizosphere and rather succumb to drought.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516740",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-1125","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516740","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Enhanced root growth but reduced belowground carbon allocation are the initial responses to water limitation in model Scots pine-soil systems",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2021-11-24T15:24:04Z",,,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19-30, 2021","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is largely unknown how subsoil (below 30 cm) microbial communities will respond to this warming and how plant-derived soil organic carbon (SOC) will be affected. Predictions how climate change will affect the large subsoil carbon pool (>50 % of SOC is below 30 cm soil depth) remain uncertain.  At Blodgett forest (California, USA) a field warming experiment was set up in 2013 warming whole soil profiles to 100 cm soil depth by +4°C compared to control plots. We took samples in 2018, after 4.5 years of continuous warming and investigated how warming has affected the abundance and community structure of microoganisms (using phospholipid fatty acids, PLFAs), and plant litter (using cutin and suberin).  The warmed subsoil (below 30 cm) contained significantly less microbial biomass (28%) compared to control plots, whereas the topsoil remained unchanged. Additionally below 50 cm, the microbial community was different in warmed as compared to control plots. Actinobacteria were relatively more abundant and Gram+ bacteria adapted their cell-membrane structure to warming. The decrease in microbial abundance might be related to lower SOC concentrations in warmed compared to control subsoils. In contrast to smaller SOC concentrations and less fine root mass in the warmed plots, the concentrations of the plant polymers suberin and cutin did not change. Overall our results demonstrate that already four seasons of simulated whole-soil warming caused distinct depth-specific responses of soil biogeochemistry: warming altered the subsoil microbial community, but not concentrations of plant-derived soil organic carbon.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516735",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-4921","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516735","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Whole-soil warming alters microbial community, but not concentrations of plant-derived soil organic carbon in subsoil",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2021-11-24T15:20:17Z",,,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19-30, 2021","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Concurrently, governments and consumers are becoming more aware of “farm-to-fork” production systems and are financially encouraging more sustainable and environmentally friendly dairy production. In temperate climate countries, with an abundance of natural grasslands, grassland-based feeding (GBF) is often encouraged. The main aims of the present doctoral thesis were to systemically evaluate and quantify selected milk biomarkers as predictors of the proportion of grassland-based feeds (%GBF) in dairy cow diets, and to investigate the effects GBF and dietary tannins have on the milk fatty acid (FA) profile and noxious emissions produced by dairy production.  The first experiment served to evaluate and quantify certain FA suggested in the literature as potential biomarkers for %GBF. Milk β-carotene content and milk colour were additionally tested in this regard. This was accomplished by incrementally replacing dietary maize-silage with grass silage from 47–100% of consumption. Results indicate that a diet containing 75% GBF should contain ≥ 0.633 and 0.847 g α-linolenic acid (ALA) and total n-3 FA per 100 g total FA, respectively, and an n-6:n-3 FA ratio of < 2.06 measured with gas chromatography (GC); when estimated with mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) should be ≥ 3.15 g/100 g total FA. β-carotene turned out not to be a good predictor for estimating %GBF. Unexpectedly, the milk hue became greener with increasing %GBF (negative a* values, ‒6.391 for 75% GBF), suggesting the red-green colour index as another suitable biomarker. This experiment also enabled the investigation of the effects of incremental grass silage proportion increase on methane (CH4) emission, urinary nitrogen (N) losses, and protein and energy utilisation in dairy cows. The dietary increase in GBF did not impair milk yield, N and energy utilization. Simplified regression equations revealed that, contrary to current assumptions, there was a decline in CH4 production from 373 to 303 g/day when increasing GBF from 500 to 1000 g/kg dry matter (DM), and there was a trend for a decline in CH4 emission intensity, from 20.6 to 17.6 g/kg, for energy-corrected milk (ECM) in mid-to-late lactating cows. However, urine N emissions clearly increased even when related to N intake; the latter from 260 to 364 g/kg N intake when increasing GBF from 500 to 1000 g/kg DM.  The second experiment served to test the effects of tannic vine leaves and early grass cutting regimes on CH4 emission, milk FA profile and energy and protein utilization in dairy cows with two different fresh grass regrowth periods, 21 (ES) or 42 (LS) days, with (+V) or without (−V) vine leaves. No significant differences were observed in feed DM intake and milk yield. Energy-corrected milk yield was numerically higher for ES vs LS diets. Methane emission intensity was lowest with ES+V compared to LS−V diets (-28%; 21.0 vs 29.2 g/kg milk; 19.1 vs 26.5 g/kg ECM). Methane yield decreased by 17% and 20% when related to intake of DM and of digested organic matter (dOM) for ES+V vs LS−V (17.9 vs 21.6 g/kg DM; 25.7 vs 32.7 g/kg dOM). Cows consuming ES diets vs. LS diets excreted 33% more urinary N at an unchanged proportion of N intake. Unexpectedly, vine leaves did not mitigate urine N excretion. In the third and fourth experiments, the rapid effects of a tannic bark extract of an acacia species (Acacia mearnsii) and six different temperate, tanniferous plants (hazel, silverbirch, blackcurrant, grape vine, wood avens and rosebay willow) were tested for their effects on the milk FA profiles of dairy cows. Substantial changes in total phenols and FA were found in milk samples after just 3 days; with Acacia mearnsii, we measured differences after just one day. The fourth experiment showed average proportionate declines of rumenic acid (RA) and vaccenic acid (VA) by 29% and 68%, respectively, when test plants were compared to lucerne; indicating a definitive ruminal biohydrogenation (RBH) response. However, there were no significant effects between test plants and lucerne when comparing ALA and linoleic acid (LA) proportions in milk fat. These findings demonstrate that phenols and certain individual FA in bovine milk can be rapidly modified by adding specific tanniferous plants to the diet. Overall, increasing GBF (particularly ES) reduced CH4 emissions from dairy cows; however, urine N excretion increased. Fortunately, this can be counteracted by a variety of new feeding concepts including the addition of dietary tannins; however, this was not the case with the addition of dietary vine leaves. Vine leaves proved to decrease CH4 independently of the grass regrowth period and additionally enhanced milk FA profiles for human nutrition. Acacia mearnsii and the other six tanniferous plants tested altered the milk FA profile in just 3 days; however, this time period was too short to report any human-nutrition benefits. Overall, the inclusion of more GBF in dairy cow diets may have a significant impact on more sustainable, environmentally friendly dairy production, with increased human-nutrition benefits, for decades to come.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000514295",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/514295","en","ETH Zurich",,,"MILK PROPERTIES + MILK QUALITY (DAIRYING)||methane||plant secondary compounds||ANIMAL NUTRITION (ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY)","New feeding concepts for dairy cows",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-11-08T13:40:32Z","2024-11-08",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27949",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Apple production relies on a few, mainly disease-susceptible, cultivars, which require the recurrent use of plant protection products during the growing season. One of the most devastating diseases in apple is fire blight, a bacterial disease caused by Erwinia amylovora. The management of fire blight produced estimated annual costs of more than US$5 million in Switzerland between 1993 and 2013. The most effective and sustainable strategy to reduce yield losses caused by E. amylovora is the use of fire blight resistant cultivars. To achieve widespread success, resistant varieties must at least reach the quality level of cultivars currently available on the market. For this goal, breeders must face the challenges of apple's reproductive biology. The long juvenility phase and self-incompatibility of apple make the breeding and selection of new cultivars a long process. This is especially true for the introduction of resistance from wild apple material, where the most effective resistance genes have been identified so far. Cisgenesis exploits genetic modification to transfer genes, including their own regulatory sequences, between sexually compatible plants. Thereby, it allows introducing a disease resistance gene from a wild apple in an established apple cultivar. While conventionally bred varieties always represent a novel genotype that needs to outcompete established cultivars with a superior combination of traits, cisgenic apple lines should resemble its untransformed cultivar except for the added trait. Therefore, cisgenesis could be the ideal tool to rapidly deploy disease resistances in apple production. However, the high regulatory requirements pose a challenge in the use of genetically modified crops in Europe. Although 30 years of research on genetically modified plants have not revealed any particular risks associated with the technology compared to conventionally bred plants, these regulatory requirements have not changed substantially. Nevertheless, each genetically modified apple line has the transferred gene integrated in a different location in the genome, which has the potential for a unique expression pattern and has to be evaluated case-by-case. Therefore, the main goal of this work was to investigate the potential unintended effects of a cisgenic modification on apple in a multi-year field trial. The investigated cisgenic line C44.4.146 was derived from the fire blight susceptible cultivar ‘Gala Galaxy’ and was amended with the fire blight resistance gene FB_MR5 which originated from the wild apple Malus × robusta 5. C44.4.146 carries a single copy of FB_MR5 on chromosome 16 and was found to be resistant to fire blight when young shoots were inoculated with E. amylovora. This thesis describes the most extensive study aiming at the discovery of potential unintended effects of a cisgenic modification in apple. In addition, growing potted trees in the field allowed producing flowers that were inoculated with the pathogen in a quarantine greenhouse to assess if flowers of C44.4.146 were also resistant to fire blight. In Chapter 1 the importance of apple, the process and challenges of apple breeding, the current status of disease resistance breeding and applications of genetic modifications in apple are summarized. Chapter 2 describes the establishment of the field trial and phenotypic assessments of the trees over five years. The design of the field trial gave a unique opportunity to compare trees and fruits of C44.4.146 to its untransformed wild type ‘Gala Galaxy’ as well as to ‘Gala’ and selected ‘Gala’ sports. Sports are spontaneous mutants of a cultivar. They derive from shoots in which one or more mutations in the meristem generated a new or modified phenotype. This phenotype is then maintained by grafting. In order to evaluate the extent of cisgenic modifications in C44.4.146, sports are ideal comparators, because they share the same genetic origin and maintain most of the characteristics of the original cultivar. In total 44 traits were investigated on tree- and fruitlevel and two metabolome studies were carried out in two years. None of the assessed traits and no metabolite feature showed a significantly different expression pattern in C44.4.146 compared to its untransformed wild type and the ‘Gala’-related genotypes in all years of investigation. In addition, the results showed that the in vitro cultivation of ‘Gala Galaxy’ introduced more evident changes than the genetic modification that led to C44.4.146. It was shown that the in vitro cultivation of ‘Gala Galaxy’ resulted in a disruption of a ‘Gala Galaxy’ fruit property, i.e., a significantly reduced area of red over color of the fruits. This reduction in red over color was inherited by C44.4.146. Transient deviations of tree-related traits within the same genotype were also observed, which derived from different propagations before plantation. Finally, greenhouse experiments with field-grown trees confirmed that FB_MR5 conferred fire blight resistance when the trees were inoculated through the flowers. Chapter 3 investigates the molecular changes in C44.4.146 using a multi-omics approach, for generating RNA transcript, protein, and metabolite profiles of leaf material collected in the field. RNA transcript profiling was repeated after three years. The differences found in these profiles between C44.4.146 and its untransformed in vitro grown 'Gala Galaxy' were always within the range of differences found among 'Gala' and its sports. While no protein or metabolite feature were found to be differentially abundant, five and four genes showed a differential expression in C44.4.146 compared to the ‘Gala’-related genotypes. Two out of these genes were identified in both years. As their gene function was mostly unknown, future experiments should investigate the function of these genes to see if the expression of these genes was modulated in a basal defense reaction caused by FB_MR5 prior pathogen recognition or if it is a consequence of the transformation process. Although the results of Chapters 2 and 3 found no clear risk associated to C44.4.146, two sensitive bioassays are described in Chapter 4 and were performed to assess whether cisgenic leaf material from the field affects the fitness of two non-target soil arthropods. Arthropods are suitable for this risk assessment as they are an essential part of the soil ecosystem and sensitive to environmental contaminants. The study showed that leaf material of C44.4.146 did not affect the fitness of Folsomia candida or Drosophila melanogaster larvae. Additionally, the studies revealed that differences of the conventionally bred cultivar were greater than differences between the cisgenic line and its untransformed wild type or ‘Gala’ sports. Finally, Chapter 5 connects the extensive results from five years of phenotypical evaluations including metabolite profiles from fruits (Chapter 2), transcript, protein, and metabolite profiles from leaves (Chapter 3), as well as biosafety studies on leaf material (Chapter 4) to conclude that the cisgenic apple line C44.4.146 is not associated with higher alterations or risks than its in vitro cultured wild type or ‘Gala’ sports. It was shown that in vitro culture and the mutations leading to ‘Gala’ sports can induce more evident differences than the cisgenic modification. Unlike genetically modified plants, tissue cultured plants and sports have not raised biosafety concerns, even though they have the potential to induce molecular and phenotypic alterations. This illustrates the unequal treatment of crops developed through genetic modification and supports that risk assessments should be adapted case-by-case to the plant and not be based on the technology used to generate it. The knowledge gained from the different approaches will be valuable in deciding how to setup future evaluations of cisgenic crops. Next to apple, other perennial, vegetatively propagated, and outcrossing fruit crops will benefit from this knowledge too. All in all, this extensive study on the unintended effects of a cisgenic modification in apple support the use of cisgenesis as complementary breeding tool for the development of improved cultivars.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000518977",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518977","en","ETH Zurich",,,,"Field study to investigate consequences of the genetic modification resulting in the fire blight resistant cisgenic apple line C44.4.146",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-12-06T18:25:17Z","2024-12-07",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27805",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Consequently, the negative influence of intraspecific competition between beneficiary individuals could potentially outweigh the positive influence of interspecific facilitation when, for example, higher densities of a beneficiary are negated by the negative effect of crowding on beneficiary reproduction. The aim of this study was, therefore, to examine the impact of an interspecific interaction on the outcome of intraspecific interactions within the context of plant–plant facilitation. We used the cushion‐forming Azorella selago and a commonly co‐occurring dominant perennial grass species, Agrostis magellanica, on sub‐Antarctic Marion Island as a model system. We assessed the impact of an interspecific interaction (between A. selago and A. magellanica) on the outcome of intraspecific interactions (between A. magellanica individuals), by testing if the impact of A. magellanica density on A. magellanica performance is mediated by its interaction with A. selago. We observed evidence for competition among A. magellanica conspecifics, with a decreasing proportion of A. magellanica individuals being reproductive under higher conspecific density. This negative intraspecific effect was greater on A. selago than on the adjacent substrate, suggesting that the facilitative effect of A. selago changes the intensity of intraspecific interactions between A. magellanica individuals. However, experimentally reducing A. magellanica density did not affect the species’ performance. We also observed that the effect of A. selago on A. magellanica was positive, and despite the negative effect of intraspecific density on the proportion of reproductive A. magellanica individuals, the net reproductive effort of A. magellanica (i.e., the density of reproductive individuals) was significantly greater on A. selago than on the adjacent substrate. These results highlight that, in abiotically severe environments, the positive effects of interspecific facilitation by a benefactor species may outweigh the negative effects of intraspecific competition among beneficiaries. More broadly, these results suggest that both positive inter‐ and intraspecific biotic interactions may be key to consider when examining spatial and temporal variation in species’ performance.

Root growth creates new macropores and provides essential carbon to soil, while root water uptake may induce crack formation around roots. Cracks can facilitate root growth as they provide pathways of least resistance and improve water infiltration and soil aeration. Due to the lack of suitable quantification methods, knowledge on the effects of root water uptake on soil crack formation remains limited. In the current study, we developed a time-lapse imaging platform that allows i) simulating root water uptake through localized soil drying and ii) quantifying the development of two-dimensional crack networks. Customized soil boxes that were 50 mm wide, 55 mm high and 5 mm deep were designed. Artificial roots made of dialysis tubes were inserted into the soil boxes and polyethylene glycol solution was circulated through the tubes. This induced a gradient in osmotic potential at the contact area (150 mm2) between the soil and the dialysis tubes, resulting in controlled soil drying. Drying intensity was varied by using different polyethylene glycol concentrations. Experiments were conducted with three soils that were subjected to three drying intensities for 6.5 days. We developed a time-lapse imaging system to record soil crack formation at two-minute intervals in twelve samples simultaneously. Resulting crack networks were quantified with an automated image analysis pipeline. Across soils and drying intensities, crack network development slowed down after 24–48 h of soil drying. The extent and complexity of crack networks increased with drying intensity and crack networks were larger and more complex in the clay and clay loam soil than in the silt loam soil. Smaller and less complex crack networks were better connected than larger and more complex networks. These results demonstrate that the platform developed in this study is suitable to quantify crack network development in soil due to simulated root water uptake at high temporal resolution and high throughput. Thereby, it can provide information needed to improve our understanding on how plants modify soil structure.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438664",,"0167-1987||1879-3444",,"10.1016/j.still.2020.104769","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438664","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Root water uptake||Soil structure dynamics||Soil drying||Time-lapse imaging||Image analysis||Osmotic potential","A time-lapse imaging platform for quantification of soil crack development due to simulated root water uptake",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-04T20:23:18Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85089428632",,"000582696400023","Soil tillage res.",,"Soil and Tillage Research","205","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We find that ideology has a small effect: governments and political parties across the spectrum have similar, and relatively ambitious, decarbonization and renewables targets. This mirrors citizens' strong support for ambitious action regardless of their ideological self-description. However, whereas political positions on phasing out fossil fuel power are clear across the policy space, positions on phasing in new flexibility options to balance intermittent renewables are vague or non-existent.

Recent work has begun to explore the effects of inbreeding on ecological interactions among plants and other organisms, including insect herbivores and pathogens. However, the effects of inbreeding on floral traits, floral scents, and pollinator visitation are less well studied.  METHODS Using inbred and outbred maternal families of horsenettle (Solanum carolinense, Solanaceae), we examined the effects of inbreeding on traits associated with pollinator attraction and floral rewards. Specifically, we measured corolla size, counted pollen grains per flower, and analyzed floral volatile emissions via gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. We also examined pollinator visitation to experimental arrays of flowering inbred and outbred plants under field conditions.  RESULTS Compared to those of outbred plants, flowers of inbred plants exhibited reduced corolla size and pollen production, as well as significantly reduced emission of the two most abundant volatile compounds in the floral blend. Furthermore, bumblebees—the main pollinators of horsenettle—discriminated against inbred flowers in the field: bees were more likely to make initial visits to flowers on outbred plants, visited outbred flowers more often overall, and spent more time on outbred flowers.  CONCLUSIONS These results show that inbreeding can (1) alter floral traits that are known to mediate pollinator attraction; (2) reduce the production of floral rewards (pollen is the sole reward in horsenettle); and (3) adversely affect pollinator visitation under field conditions.",,,,"1914-2016:||0002-9122",,"10.1002/ajb2.1594","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465817","en","Wiley",,,"Mating system||Solanaceae||Bombus||floral scent||floral traits||corolla size","Inbreeding in Solanum carolinense alters floral attractants and rewards and adversely affects pollinator visitation",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-27T06:18:22Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099349205",,"000607735700001","Am.

Previous attempts to infer phylogenetic relationships among the family’s major lineages (subfamilies, tribes, genera) based on Sanger sequence data were insufficient to statistically resolve the monophyly and the phylogenetic position of the subfamily Amiseginae and the phylogenetic relationships among the tribes Allocoeliini, Chrysidini, Elampini, and Parnopini (Chrysidinae). Here, we present a phylogeny inferred from nucleotide sequence data of 492 nuclear single-copy genes (230,915 aligned amino acid sites) from 94 species of Chrysidoidea (representing Bethylidae, Chrysididae, Dryinidae, Plumariidae) and 45 outgroup species by combining RNA-seq and DNA target enrichment data. We find support for Amiseginae being more closely related to Cleptinae than to Chrysidinae. Furthermore, we find strong support for Allocoeliini being the sister lineage of all remaining Chrysidinae, whereas Elampini represent the sister lineage of Chrysidini and Parnopini.

The release of N2O is of particular concern due to its high global warming potential and destruction of stratospheric ozone. Tropical forest soils are predicted to be among the largest natural sources of N2O; however, despite being the world’s second-largest rainforest, measurements of gaseous N-losses from forest soils of the Congo Basin are scarce. In addition, long-term studies investigating N2O fluxes from different forest ecosystem types (lowland and montane forests) are scarce. In this study we show that fluxes measured in the Congo Basin were lower than fluxes measured in the Neotropics, and in the tropical forests of Australia and South East Asia. In addition, we show that despite different climatic conditions, average annual N2O fluxes in the Congo Basin’s lowland forests (0.97 ± 0.53 kg N ha−1 year−1) were comparable to those in its montane forest (0.88 ± 0.97 kg N ha−1 year−1). Measurements of soil pore air N2O isotope data at multiple depths suggests that a microbial reduction of N2O to N2 within the soil may account for the observed low surface N2O fluxes and low soil pore N2O concentrations. The potential for microbial reduction is corroborated by a significant abundance and expression of the gene nosZ in soil samples from both study sites. Although isotopic and functional gene analyses indicate an enzymatic potential for complete denitrification, combined gaseous N-losses (N2O, N2) are unlikely to account for the missing N-sink in these forests. Other N-losses such as NO, N2 via Feammox or hydrological particulate organic nitrogen export could play an important role in soils of the Congo Basin and should be the focus of future research.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000487438",,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-021-01004-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/487438","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","N2O emissions||Congo Basin","In-depth analysis of N2O fluxes in tropical forest soils of the Congo Basin combining isotope and functional gene analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-29T12:37:52Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85106537044",,"000654103400005","ISME J",,"The ISME Journal","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Quantitative soil measures are needed to assess soil fertility decline and to improve crop nutrient supply in the region. We developed and tested a mid-infrared (mid-IR) soil spectral library to enable timely and cost-efficient assessments of soil properties. Our collection included 80 soil samples from four landscapes (10 km × 10 km) and 20 fields per landscape across a gradient from humid forest to savannah and 14 additional samples from one landscape that had been sampled within the Land Health Degradation Framework. We derived partial least squares regression models to spectrally estimate soil properties. The models produced accurate cross-validated estimates of total carbon, total nitrogen, total sulfur, total iron, total aluminum, total potassium, total calcium, exchangeable calcium, effective cation exchange capacity, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-extractable iron and clay content (R2>0.75). The estimates of total zinc, pH, exchangeable magnesium, bioavailable copper, and manganese were less predictable (R2>0.50). Our results confirm that mid-IR spectroscopy is a reliable and quick method to assess the regional-level variation of most soil properties, especially the ones closely associated with soil organic matter. Although the relatively small mid-IR library shows satisfactory performance, we expect that frequent but small model updates will be needed to adapt the library to the variation of soil quality within individual fields in the regions and their temporal fluctuations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000514087",,"2199-3971||2199-398X",,"10.5194/soil-7-717-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/514087","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Estimation of soil properties with mid-infrared soil spectroscopy across yam production landscapes in West Africa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-06T14:11:52Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85118259560",,"000711959500001",,"2","Soil","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In particular, for the African continent, spatially explicit information on soils and their ability to sustain these services is still scarce. To address data gaps, infrared spectroscopy has achieved great success as a cost-effective solution to quantify soil properties in recent decades. Here, we present a mid-infrared soil spectral library (SSL) for central Africa (CSSL) that can predict key soil properties, allowing for future soil estimates with a minimal need for expensive and time-consuming wet chemistry. Currently, our CSSL contains over 1800 soil samples from 10 distinct geoclimatic regions throughout the Congo Basin and along the Albertine Rift. For the analysis, we selected six regions from the CSSL, for which we built predictive models for total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) using an existing continental SSL (African Soil Information Service, AfSIS SSL; n=1902) that does not include central African soils. Using memory-based learning (MBL), we explored three different strategies at decreasing degrees of geographic extrapolation, using models built with (1) the AfSIS SSL only, (2) AfSIS SSL combined with the five remaining central African regions, and (3) a combination of AfSIS SSL, the remaining five regions, and selected samples from the target region (spiking). For this last strategy we introduce a method for spiking MBL models. We found that when using the AfSIS SSL only to predict the six central African regions, the root mean square error of the predictions (RMSEpred) was between 3.85–8.74 and 0.40–1.66 g kg−1 for TC and TN, respectively. The ratio of performance to the interquartile distance (RPIQpred) ranged between 0.96–3.95 for TC and 0.59–2.86 for TN. While the effect of the second strategy compared to the first strategy was mixed, the third strategy, spiking with samples from the target regions, could clearly reduce the RMSEpred to 3.19–7.32 g kg−1 for TC and 0.24–0.89 g kg−1 for TN. RPIQpred values were increased to ranges of 1.43–5.48 and 1.62–4.45 for TC and TN, respectively. In general, predicted TC and TN for soils of each of the six regions were accurate; the effect of spiking and avoiding geographical extrapolation was noticeably large. We conclude that our CSSL adds valuable soil diversity that can improve predictions for the Congo Basin region compared to using the continental AfSIS SSL alone; thus, analyses of other soils in central Africa will be able to profit from a more diverse spectral feature space. Given these promising results, the library comprises an important tool to facilitate economical soil analyses and predict soil properties in an understudied yet critical region of Africa. Our SSL is openly available for application and for enlargement with more spectral and reference data to further improve soil diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000514089",,"2199-3971||2199-398X",,"10.5194/soil-7-693-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/514089","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The central African soil spectral library: a new soil infrared repository and a geographical prediction analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-06T14:11:52Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85118232281",,"000711540900001",,"2","Soil","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This may become a problem in zero-concentrate feeding systems when pasture grass is rich in crude protein. Polyphenols such as tannins may protect part of dietary protein from ruminal degradation and thus inhibit ammonia formation.  Aims: The present study screened mature herbs for their potential to mitigate ruminal ammonia formation in cattle, when provided as a supplement to a forage diet.  Methods: Thirty-five temperate-climate, herbaceous meadow plant species (including three legumes) that appear in biodiverse natural and sown pastures were investigated for their effects on ruminal ammonia production. Aboveground material was harvested during ripening of the seeds and analysed for nutrient and phenol concentrations. Net energy and protein absorbable at the duodenum were calculated. Incubations (24 h) with cattle rumen fluid following the in vitro Hohenheim Gas Test protocol were performed to compare the effects of the test plants on ruminal gas and ammonia formation. Test plants replaced one-third of a basal mixture consisting of 57% Lolium perenne L. and 43% Medicago sativa L. (air-dry-matter basis). Results were compared with those obtained with the basal mixture alone.  Key results: According to regression analysis, ammonia concentration after incubation was negatively related to concentrations of total extractable phenols and total tannins in feed mixtures, whereas the relationship was weakly positive with dietary crude protein. In 23 and 19 of the test diets, respectively, in vitro gas production (indicating ruminal organic matter digestibility) and ammonia concentrations in the incubation medium after 24 h were significantly lower than with the basal mixture alone. Incubations containing Galium verum L., Leontodon hispidus L., Lotus corniculatus L., Onobrychis viciifolia Scop., Plantago lanceolata L., Sanguisorba minor Scop. and Scabiosa columbaria L. maintained gas production and estimated in vitro organic matter digestibility while at the same time lowering ammonia concentrations.  Conclusions: Seven mature herbs of a screening of 35 proved to have potential for positive effects on ruminal protein utilisation without impairing fermentation.  Implications: These herbs are of particular interest as dietary supplements for dairy cows grazing protein-rich pastures.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000458659",,"1836-0939||1836-5787",,"10.1071/AN20323","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458659","en","CSIRO","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Condensed tannins||Forbs||Hydrolysable tannins||Plant secondary compounds||Protein efficiency","Mature herbs as supplements to ruminant diets: effects on in vitro ruminal fermentation and ammonia production",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-29T03:31:34Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097807256",,"000598227000001","Anim.

Self-compatibility (SC), defined as the ability for a plant to self-fertilize, is a reproductive trait evolved through the loss of ancestral self-incompatibility (SI) during the evolution of many plant species. Studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from SI to SC and its consequences for plant adaptation and speciation has engaged the scientific community for decades. For some crops, SC is a tool to efficiently produce homozygous plant material by self-pollination, which breeders have used to generate parental lines for hybrid breeding schemes. This makes SC not only a trait of fundamental importance for plant biology but also of great agricultural interest to produce high yielding grass hybrids. This thesis has investigated genetic causes of SC in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), one of the world’s most important forage crops. Perennial ryegrass is characterized by a SI system that prevents inbreeding and makes it a strictly allogamous species. Naturally occurring sources of SC in perennial ryegrass have been documented, however their regulation is just starting to be understood at the genetic level. Moreover, a general utilization of SC for breeding is lacking. The goal of this thesis was to advance the current understanding of the genetic architecture of SC in perennial ryegrass by identifying genomic regions and molecular determinants responsible for SC. The research described in chapters 2-5 and here summarized, provide both biological as well as practical insights for the application of SC in forage grass breeding. After a general introduction, chapter 2 reviews the state of the art about the SI system in grasses and describes in detail known causes of SC. Strategies for the discovery of novel SC sources are discussed, together with a review of the possibilities that SC presents for forage grass breeding. Specifically, the importance of using SC to purge deleterious alleles and to fix genetic variation in heterotic groups in order to implement hybrid breeding strategies is addressed. Moreover, the perspectives of using SC as a tool to develop immortalized mapping populations for the genetic dissection of agronomic traits are discussed. Chapter 3 describes a fine mapping experiment aimed at narrowing down a genomic region harboring a SC causal gene in a perennial ryegrass population. Previous classical genetic studies on this population mapped a SC locus on linkage group (LG) 5. However, the region identified was still considerably large, making it difficult to suggest candidate genes. With a combination of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and analysis of segregation distortion based on a genome-wide linkage map, we confirmed the presence of the QTL on LG 5. In addition, we further fine mapped the locus to a 0.26 cM region, considerably improving the mapping resolution achieved in previous studies. Lastly, projecting the interval onto a genome assembly, we identified potential candidate genes. Chapter 4 reports the development and genetic characterization of a perennial ryegrass population segregating for SC. A segregating population was developed starting from germplasm provided by the seed company Deutsche Saatvederelung AG (DSV) and consisted of S1 and S2 lines originating from two founder self-compatible genotypes. To investigate structure and genetic diversity within the population, SNP markers were developed from a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) library. Combining 69,002 SNPs with SC phenotypic variation in a genome-wide association study, we identified SNPs with a significant association. Significant SNPs mapped on chromosome 2 and 7 and indicated the presence of three candidate QTL, revealing novel sources of SC and providing a fundamental resource for SC diagnostic markers in marker-assisted selection programs. Lastly, a pilot study described in chapter 5 investigates the occurrence of a temperature-induced SC in perennial ryegrass, a phenomenon called pseudo-self-compatibility (PSC). A set of 16 self-incompatible genotypes selected from the DSV perennial ryegrass germplasm was incubated at 30 °C during flowering and pollen tube growth was assessed using in vitro self-pollinations. The PSC response was found to be highly genotype-dependent, revealing the presence of variation for this trait. This study paves the way to further genetic mapping studies aimed at determining the genetic control of PSC. In conclusion, chapter 6 discusses the findings showed in the previous chapters in a broader context. Also, future perspectives are addressed, describing possible further experimental designs to complement the results presented in this thesis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000479187",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/479187","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)||Self-compatibility||forage crop breeding||QTL mapping||GWAS||Fine mapping","Genetic dissection of self-compatibility in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and its exploitation for breeding",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,"2021-04-18T13:41:26Z","2022-03-24",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27304",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As a consequence, over orography, flat tops of stratus clouds are intersected by the vertical coordinate surfaces. We conduct idealised two-dimensional simulations of a stratus cloud with the COSMO model to study the effect of such sloping vertical coordinate surfaces. The evolution of the stratus cloud above a flat surface within a horizontally homogeneous atmosphere serves as a reference. During night-time, the cloud thickens, driven by radiative cooling at the cloud top. Adding a sinusoidal perturbation to the vertical coordinate surfaces reduces the growth of the stratus cloud. With strong perturbations, the cloud starts to dissipate. The physical processes in the two simulations are identical, hence this behaviour is purely driven by numerical diffusion. The cloud is similarly thinned when sinusoidal orographic features are introduced. The reduction depends on the amplitude and wavelength of the perturbations and hills. Increasing the horizontal resolution partly mitigates the numerical diffusion. However, this is a very costly measure for an operational weather model. We suggest conducting further research on a new vertical coordinate with additional local smoothing of the orographic signal.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000465074",,"0035-9009||1477-870X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/445841||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/451052","10.1002/qj.3907","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465074","en","Royal Meteorological Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","complex orography||COSMO model||numerical diffusion||stratus cloud||terrain‐following coordinates","Effects of terrain-following vertical coordinates on simulation of stratus clouds in numerical weather prediction models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-14T04:09:20Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Towards an operational fog forecasting system (Fog4Cast)","ETH-17 16-2","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,"85091755675",,"000574216300001","Q.

Plants respond to drier soils by reducing stomatal conductance in order to conserve water and avoid hydraulic damage. Despite the importance of plant drought responses for the global carbon cycle and local and regional climate feedbacks, land surface models are unable to capture observed plant responses to soil moisture stress. We assessed the impact of soil moisture stress on simulated gross primary productivity (GPP) and latent energy flux (LE) in the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) vn4.9 on seasonal and annual timescales and evaluated 10 different representations of soil moisture stress in the model. For the default configuration, GPP was more realistic in temperate biome sites than in the tropics or high-latitude (cold-region) sites, while LE was best simulated in temperate and high-latitude (cold) sites. Errors that were not due to soil moisture stress, possibly linked to phenology, contributed to model biases for GPP in tropical savanna and deciduous forest sites. We found that three alternative approaches to calculating soil moisture stress produced more realistic results than the default parameterization for most biomes and climates. All of these involved increasing the number of soil layers from 4 to 14 and the soil depth from 3.0 to 10.8 m. In addition, we found improvements when soil matric potential replaced volumetric water content in the stress equation (the “soil14_psi” experiments), when the critical threshold value for inducing soil moisture stress was reduced (“soil14_p0”), and when plants were able to access soil moisture in deeper soil layers (“soil14_dr*2”). For LE, the biases were highest in the default configuration in temperate mixed forests, with overestimation occurring during most of the year. At these sites, reducing soil moisture stress (with the new parameterizations mentioned above) increased LE and increased model biases but improved the simulated seasonal cycle and brought the monthly variance closer to the measured variance of LE. Further evaluation of the reason for the high bias in LE at many of the sites would enable improvements in both carbon and energy fluxes with new parameterizations for soil moisture stress. Increasing the soil depth and plant access to deep soil moisture improved many aspects of the simulations, and we recommend these settings in future work using JULES or as a general way to improve land surface carbon and water fluxes in other models. In addition, using soil matric potential presents the opportunity to include plant functional type-specific parameters to further improve modeled fluxes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488845",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-14-3269-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488845","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Improvement of modeling plant responses to low soil moisture in JULESvn4.9 and evaluation against flux tower measurements",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-08T13:01:17Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies||Robust models for assessing the effectiveness of technologies and managements to reduce N2O emissions from grazed pastures (Models4Pastures)","774124||154245","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF","H2020||FACCE-JPI",,,"85107553488",,"000660616300005","Geosci. model dev.","6","Geoscientific Model Development","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Assembly of its genome has been difficult because of its large size and allohexaploid nature (AABBDD genome). Following the first reported assembly of the genome of the experimental strain Chinese Spring (CS), the 10+ Wheat Genomes Project was launched to produce multiple assemblies of worldwide modern cultivars. The only Asian cultivar in the project is Norin 61, a representative Japanese cultivar adapted to grow across a broad latitudinal range, mostly characterized by a wet climate and a short growing season. Here, we characterize key aspects of its chromosome-scale genome assembly spanning 15 Gb with a raw scaffold N50 of 23 Mb. Analysis of the repetitive elements identified chromosomal regions unique to Norin 61 that encompass a tandem array of the pathogenesis-related-13 family. We report novel copy-number variations in the B homeolog of the florigen gene FT1/VRN3, pseudogenization of its D homeolog, and the association of its A homeologous alleles with the spring/winter growth habit. Further, the Norin 61 genome carries typical East Asian functional variants from CS ranging from a single nucleotide to multi-Mb scale. Examples of such variation are the Fhb1 locus, which confers Fusarium head-blight resistance, Ppd-D1a, which confers early flowering, Glu-D1f for Asian noodle quality, and Rht-D1b, which introduced semi-dwarfism during the green revolution. The adoption of Norin 61 as a reference assembly for functional and evolutionary studies will enable comprehensive characterization of the underexploited Asian bread wheat diversity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000454044",,"0032-0781||1471-9053",,"10.1093/pcp/pcaa152","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454044","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Adaptation||Asian germplasm||Bread wheat||Genome assembly||Polyploidy||Norin 61","De Novo Genome Assembly of the Japanese Wheat Cultivar Norin 61 Highlights Functional Variation in Flowering Time and Fusarium Resistance Genes in East Asian Genotypes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-01T16:34:37Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"RESPONSE - to society and policy needs through plant, food and energy sciences","847585","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85103606101",,"000642329100003","Plant Cell Physiol.","1","Plant & Cell Physiology","62","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, there is little evidence of dust-derived P-containing minerals in soils. Here we studied P forms along a well-described climatic gradient on Hawaii, which is also a dust deposition gradient. Soil mineralogy and soil P forms from six sites along the climatic gradient were analyzed with bulk (X-ray diffraction and P K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure) and microscale (X-ray fluorescence, P K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure, and Raman) analysis methods. In the wettest soils, apatite grains ranging from 5 to 30 µm in size were co-located at the micro-scale with quartz, a known continental dust indicator suggesting recent atmospheric deposition. In addition to co-location with quartz, further evidence of dust-derived P included backward trajectory modeling indicating that dust particles could be brought to Hawaii from the major global dust-loading areas in central Asia and northern Africa. Although it is not certain whether the individual observed apatite grains were derived from long-distance transport of dust, or from local dust sources such as volcanic ash or windblown fertilizer, these observations offer direct evidence that P-containing minerals have reached surface layers of highly-weathered grassland soils through atmospheric deposition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438668",,"0016-7061||1872-6259",,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114681","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438668","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Phosphorus transformations||Soil development||Aeolian dust inputs||P K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy||micro-Raman spectroscopy","Microspectroscopy reveals dust-derived apatite grains in acidic, highly-weathered Hawaiian soils",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-04T20:23:18Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85089832577",,"000582381600020","Geoderma",,"Geoderma","381","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

By integrating the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios with climate models, a vegetation model, socio-economic scenarios, and a forest economic model, the study explores long run adjustments of both ecosystems and markets to climate change that have not been studied before. The ecological model suggests that global forest productivity increases under RCP 8.5. The overall supply of timber expands faster than demand through the 23rd century lowering timber prices and creating net benefits in the timber sector. Consumers benefit the most from the lower prices but these same low prices tend to damage forest owners, especially in the tropics. Even without a formal sequestration policy, average global forest carbon is projected to increase by 6%–8% by 2100. Under the RCP 2.6, forest carbon remains stable through 2200 but under RCP 8.5 it is simulated to increase by another 8% with a very heterogeneous distribution across world regions. Under both RCPs, global forest area is projected to increase relative to a no-climate change case until 2150, but possibly decline thereafter.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000466065",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/abd589","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/466065","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Forests||Climate impacts||Adaptation||RCPs||SSPs","Assessing the long-term interactions of climate change and timber markets on forest land and carbon storage",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-27T16:04:12Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"next-generation Modelling of the biosphere - Including New Data streams and optimality approaches","181115","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Eccellenza",,,"85099946766",,"000607749200001","Environ.

Fourteen VC and VR each grazed high alpine pastures, and ten PI received fresh grass in a lowland barn. In each group, the heavier half of the animals were slaughtered after the grass-feeding period. All others received hay and concentrate for another 48 days. Properties of the carcase and the longissimus thoracis (LT) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles (aged 7 or 28 days) were determined. Sensory analysis of the LT and BF muscles was performed by 10 trained panellists and 53 consumers, respectively. The VC and VR grew faster than the PI, but dressing percentages and conformation scores were inferior. The LT was perceived as less tender from the VC and VR compared to the PI, and shear force and insoluble collagen were also higher. Finishing accentuated the problem for VC and did not improve carcase and meat quality otherwise. Prolonged ageing did not render the beef more tender. Compared to the LT, the BF was more resistant to factors of influence in quality. Consumers perceived long-aged beef to be preferable and comparably inexpensive for its quality. No other factor influenced sensory impression.

We developed a trait-based framework predicting that as global change increases limitation of a given nutrient, fungal taxa with traits that target that nutrient will represent a larger proportion of the community (and vice versa). In addition, we expected that warming and drying and N enrichment would generate environmental stress for fungi and may select for stress tolerance traits. We tested the framework by analyzing fungal community data from previously published field manipulations and linking taxa to functional gene traits from the MycoCosm Fungal Portal. Altogether, fungal genera tended to respond similarly to 3 elements of global change: increased precipitation, N enrichment, and warming and drying. The genera that proliferated under these changes also tended to possess functional genes for stress tolerance, which suggests that these global changes-even increases in precipitation-could have caused environmental stress that selected for certain taxa. In addition, these genera did not exhibit a strong capacity for C breakdown or P acquisition, so soil C turnover may slow down or remain unchanged following shifts in fungal community composition under global change. Since we did not find strong evidence that changes in nutrient limitation select for taxa with traits that target the more limiting nutrient, we revised our trait-based framework. The new framework sorts fungal taxa into Stress Tolerating versus C and P Targeting groups, with the global change elements of increased precipitation, warming and drying, and N enrichment selecting for the stress tolerators.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000500999",,"2325-1026",,"10.1525/elementa.2020.00144","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500999","en","University of California Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Elevated CO2||Precipitation||Warming||Drying||Nitrogen enrichment||Nitrogen fertilization||Limiting nutrients||Synthesis||Fungal traits||Growth form||Extracellular enzymes||Functional genes||Tissue phosphorus concentration","Nutrient and stress tolerance traits linked to fungal responses to global change: Four case studies",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-16T03:18:34Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85117909866",,"000683376700001",,"1","Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Because of their mobility and versatility, there is a growing interest in developing drones for the remote exploration of these dangerous and often difficult to access places. However, the mechanical design and locomotion strategies of current drones limit the size of the confined space that can be explored. In this work, we present a quadcopter capable of traversing long passageways 34% smaller than its nominal size. The combination of a soft morphing frame and multi-modal mobility allows the drone to exploit a new dynamic strategy for passageway traversal. The drone flies at a given speed towards the entrance of the passageway until it collides with it. The momentum and ability of the frame to soften allow the drone to passively fold and enter. Once the drone is squeezed between the walls of the passageway, it uses two tracks to crawl through. Through experiments, we characterize the main mechanical systems of the drone and study the entry into crevices of different sizes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000513113","978-1-6654-1764-8||978-1-6654-1765-5",,,"10.1109/SSRR53300.2021.9597683","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/513113","en","IEEE","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"A Soft Drone with Multi-modal Mobility for the Exploration of Confined Spaces",,"Conference Paper","Open access","2021 IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR)",,,"2021-11-01T15:37:31Z",,,,,,,"yes","2021 IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics (SSRR)","October 25-27, 2021","New York, NY, USA",,,,"SquAshy – Soft Aerial robots that squeeze and crawl to traverse confined spaces","ETH-15 20-2||ETH-15 20-2||ETH-15 20-2","10.13039/501100003006||10.13039/501100003006||10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ||ETHZ||ETHZ","ETH Grants||ETH Grants||ETH Grants",,,,,"000853883500008",,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the effect of (Formula presented.) vs. (Formula presented.) supply on δ13C of leaf metabolites and respired CO2 is largely unknown. We supplied tobacco plants with a gradient of (Formula presented.) to (Formula presented.) concentration ratios and determined gas exchange variables, concentrations and δ13C of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, δ13C of dark-respired CO2, and activities of key enzymes nitrate reductase, malic enzyme and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Net assimilation rate, dry biomass and concentrations of organic acids and starch decreased along the gradient. In contrast, respiration rates, concentrations of intercellular CO2, soluble sugars and amino acids increased. As (Formula presented.) decreased, activities of all measured enzymes decreased. δ13C of CO2 and organic acids closely co-varied and were more positive under (Formula presented.) supply, suggesting organic acids as potential substrates for respiration. Together with estimates of intra-molecular 13C enrichment in malate, we conclude that a change in the anaplerotic reaction of the TCA cycle possibly contributes to 13C enrichment in organic acids and respired CO2 under (Formula presented.) supply. Thus, the effect of (Formula presented.) vs. (Formula presented.) on δ13C is highly relevant, particularly if δ13C of leaf metabolites or respiration is used as proxy for plant performance.

The overall aim of this thesis was to gain insights into the mechanisms of phosphorus (P) cycling in unmanaged forest ecosystems and to study how these mechanisms are linked to soil formation and global environmental changes. The soil P cycle was studied by quantifying P pools and fluxes. The influence of several factors of soil formation on P cycling was assessed at different experimental scales, ranging from a laboratory incubation, via semi-controlled field experiments, to studies at the ecosystem scale. First, litter decomposition rates were studied to assess the magnitude and controlling factors on nutrient release and microbial functioning. Litter of differing carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) ratios was used and incubated in a laboratory study at 5°C and 15°C. Litter samples were taken along a natural gradient of plant growth forms in two forest-tundra ecotones in northern Russia. This study revealed that microorganisms, major mediators of litter decomposition, were able to adapt to a wide range of nutrient conditions by adjusting the C:N:P ratios of their biomass. The carbon use efficiency (CUE) of microorganisms decreased with increasing litter C:N:P ratios from forest to tundra, indicating the occurrence of “overflow respiration” where microorganisms respire C to acquire nutrients. Net N and P release was negatively correlated with litter C:N:P ratios, with almost no release of N and P from tundra litter. Experimental warming by 10°C had little influence on the nutrient release, indicating that litter quality is more important for nutrient release than temperature. The observed increase in nutrient release from tundra to forest strongly suggests that nutrient release contributes to the stability of the present vegetation types. The lower nutrient release in the tundra than in the forest potentially reduces plant growth and thereby decreases the forests’ ability to expand into tundra. Second, a field study on P cycling in two German beech forests demonstrated for the first time significant phosphatase activity in percolating soil solution from forest soils. As a consequence, there is a subsequent quick hydrolysis of phosphate-monoesters to phosphate in sampled water, which prevents a clear determination of the ratio of monoesters to phosphate present within the soil. Based on these results, it was shown that phosphatase activity leads to an underestimation of labile P in soil solution, with concentrations more than halving within 24 hours of sample storage. The overestimation of phosphate mobility in the soil, and the conclusion that soil P depletion is most likely driven by non-labile dissolved organic P leaching is highly relevant for accurately predicting long-term P processes. Third, the influence of soil nutrient status, fertilization, and seasons on the leaching of inorganic and organic P and N was studied over 15 months in the field. For this, two beech forest soils differing in total P stocks and soil type were examined. The study revealed that the effects of N and P fertilization on N and P leaching strongly depended on the N and P status of the soil. Fertilization increased the leaching stronger at the low-P site. Also, drying and rewetting increased P leaching more strongly at the low-P site. This suggests that the nutrient-poor soil is more susceptible to environmental changes like in the temperature and precipitation regime or in the atmospheric composition. Further, P forms were differently affected by the N and P fertilization and seasonal changes, with dissolved inorganic P leaching being particularly sensitive to changes in weather conditions, e.g. rewetting after longer dry spells. Comparisons of input and output fluxes of P revealed that at these two Abstract 6 sites under the prevailing conditions, leaching losses from the mineral topsoil were comparable in magnitude to atmospheric P inputs. Finally, the impact of plant-soil interactions on the P cycling was examined in an unmanaged tundra-forest ecosystem on the Kola Peninsula, Russia. This study showed that indirect temperature effects resulting in differing vegetation types, had a stronger impact on N and P cycling than direct temperature itself. Despite similar total N and P stocks and the same age of soils, the distribution of P pools differed across the forest-tundra ecotone. Available nutrient stocks increased from tundra to forest, despite a strong concomitant increase in plant biomass, while the P pool in stones in the soil profile decreased, hinting to an increased weathering in the forest. Moreover, the available nutrient stocks (ammonium and resin extractable P) were also higher in soils under tree canopies than in open patches of the forest, implying that higher available nutrient stocks were related to the presence of trees and not only due to climate. Potential mechanisms include enhanced weathering in tree rhizospheres. Further, higher nutrient availability resulted in higher concentrations of leaf nutrients and hence, increased nutrient release during decomposition, potentially reinforcing the observed vegetation patterns. Soil microorganisms adapted to the gradient in available nutrients along the transect by adjusting their C-to-nutrient ratios and producing more extracellular enzymes in the nutrient-poor tundra compared to the boreal forest. The interplay of biotic and abiotic processes resulted in faster soil development in the boreal forest compared to the tundra, indicating the possibility for a positive feedback of treeline advance with warmer climate. In conclusion, this thesis showed that P cycling in unmanaged forest ecosystems is strongly shaped by its nutrient status, driving long-term soil development. Phosphorus cycling is significantly altered and, most likely, accelerated by the combined impact of global change on the frequency of extreme weather events and on inputs of C, N, and P. Nitrogen and P inputs were shown to be important drivers for the P cycling, but the magnitude of the effect depended on the current nutrient status of the soil and the chemical nature of P. This applies, in particular, to organic P, as leaching of non-labile dissolved organic P was identified as a potential main driver of long-term soil P depletion. Phosphorus cycling is also strongly affected by vegetation, as biogeochemical processes in the rhizosphere depend on functional plant types, leading to positive and negative feedbacks. This is supported by the finding that litter quality, being a result of plant-soil interactions, is more important for nutrient release than temperature itself. Also, this thesis gives evidence that processes in nutrient poor soil-plant systems are more susceptible to environmental changes such as extreme weather events or the increase of C, N, and P inputs. In summary, it is crucial to explicitly consider the nutrient status of soils in studies and models investigating soil processes, and to focus on organic and inorganic P, as our understanding of the P cycle still lags behind our understanding of the one of C and N cycles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542115",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542115","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Drivers of phosphorus cycling in temperate and boreal forest soils",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2022-04-12T12:26:33Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27988",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although efforts to protect these threatened habitats have steadily increased, their ongoing loss could not be halted. Mild intervention methods often failed to re-establish the targeted grassland due to unsuitable soil conditions and the dominance of non-target species. High impact restoration methods, such as topsoil removal with and without seed addition, seemed to be much more successful in re-establishing nutrient-poor and species-rich grasslands. Yet, the success of grassland restoration was mainly evaluated via vegetation surveys as the sole property in the past. Other ecosystem properties, especially belowground biotic communities and soil properties, were generally neglected even after the soil had been heavily affected by restoration. Additionally, monitoring rarely covered periods of more than the first few years after restoration, mainly due to resource limitations. Therefore, long-term evaluations of restoration success spanning several decades are lacking. This lack of long-term evaluations resulted in conflicts between nature conservation (pro) and soil protection (contra) agencies as there is a disagreement with regard to the harm topsoil removal may cause to the system. Hence, there is urgent need to examine the ecological responses of biotic and abiotic, above- and belowground properties after topsoil removal, which I did in this PhD thesis. This knowledge not only advances basic research, but should also aid decision-making processes at the political and management level concerning ecological restoration. The study area in the Canton of Zurich is one of the few regions in Central Europe where various restoration intervention methods including topsoil removal were tested during the last 30 to 40 years. I re-visited i) a large-scale experiment using three different restoration methods of increasing intervention intensities established in 1995 and ii) an assembly of sites where topsoil was removed and target plant species applied at different times between 1986 and 2015. This provided me with the great opportunity to develop novel approaches for assessing the long-term success of various restoration methods. The objectives of this PhD thesis were to 1) assess the potential of different restoration methods of increasing intervention intensities to restore biodiversity, community composition and ecosystem functioning above- and belowground (Chapter 1 – 3), 2) test the suitability of multiple abiotic and biotic properties to accurately evaluate long-term restoration success (Chapter 3), 3) estimate cost-efficiency of these abiotic and biotic properties (Chapter 3), 4) study the temporal recovery of grasslands after topsoil removal (Chapter 4) and 5) suggest how monitoring of restoration success should be modified in the future for a holistic evaluation.  I found that i) high impact topsoil removal methods outmatched lower impact methods such as mowing and biomass disposal, and ii) cost-efficient above- and belowground properties were better suited to assess restoration success compared to expensive properties. Combining vegetation structure, soil carbon storage and soil water holding capacity represented the best compromise between accuracy and cost-efficiency for assessing ecosystem multifunctionality and long-term restoration success. The first five to fifteen years after restoration seemed to be most important to determine restoration success, with above- and belowground properties recovering in parallel. The integration of soil biotic and functional criteria in monitoring and evaluating restoration outcome, as outlined in this thesis, represents an important step forward to improve our understanding on the long-term ecological responses at the community and the ecosystem level. Thus, the findings gained from this PhD thesis will help to develop more efficient restoration and monitoring tools and thereby support and facilitate enhanced global efforts to restore degraded or destroyed ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000479565",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/479565","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","grassland restoration||high-intensity measures||Long-term effects||above- and belowground properties||topsoil removal","Restoration of semi-natural grasslands using topsoil removal",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-04-20T10:38:56Z","2022-04-20",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27294",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

After 4 days at 28 °C, the strains yielded yellow, round, convex and mucoid colonies. Pathogenicity of the strains was confirmed on its isolation host, as well as on Hydrangea quercifolia. Analysis using MALDI-TOF MS identified the Hydrangea strains as belonging to the genus Xanthomonas but excluded them from the species Xanthomonas hortorum. A phylogenetic tree based on gyrB confirmed the close relation to X. hortorum. Three fatty acids were dominant in the Hydrangea isolates: anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 0 and summed feature 3 (C16 : 1 ω7c/C16 : 1 ω6c). Unlike X. hortorum pathovars, the Hydrangea strains were unable to grow in the presence of lithium chloride and could only weakly utilize d-fructose-6-PO4 and glucuronamide. Phylogenetic characterization based on multilocus sequence analysis and phylogenomic characterization revealed that the strains are close to, yet distinct from, X. hortorum. The genome sequences of the strains had average nucleotide identity values ranging from 94.35–95.19 % and in silico DNA–DNA hybridization values ranging from 55.70 to 59.40 % to genomes of the X. hortorum pathovars. A genomics-based loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay was developed which was specific to the Hydrangea strains for its early detection.

Soil is a critical component of farming systems and is a limited resource, but also tends to be more and more degraded and lost due to human activities. Thus, sustainable soil management practices are needed more than ever to sustain and improve chemical, physical and biological aspects of soil quality. These are related to key ecosystem functions such as supplying water and nutrient to crops, carbon sequestration, nutrient recycling, and the promotion of biodiversity. Therefore, soil systems require a lot of data so that we can understand, localize or generalize processes in soils, and accordingly manage them from environmental and agronomic viewpoints. For example, we need a better integration of knowledge of how soil management practices (i.e, tillage, fertilization) affects the dynamics of soil's properties, to better manage this precious resource, to protect life across the ecological landscapes, and feed the world's population.  Soil properties emerge in function of their mineral and organic compositional diversity, but also processes governed by living components, across space and time. With the classical methods, we have not managed to collect enough static and dynamic parameters of soils' direct physical, chemical and biological composition and properties, for basic soil research and soil decision making (i.e., land planning, construction, environmental and agricultural policy). In Switzerland, only about 10\% to 15\% of agricultural soil landscapes have been sufficiently characterized to make informed land use decisions. This is mainly because most of the classical methods with established measurement protocols and procedures need a lot of time and financial capacities, for example for soil sample collection and processing. To complement and scale up estimates of the soils properties, diffuse reflectance infrared (IR) spectroscopy in the mid-IR and visible near infrared (vis--NIR) range are powerful methods to rapidly integrate the chemical and physical complexity of soils. Soil spectral libraries (SSLs) are harmonized collections of spectroscopic measurements and analytical reference values. The SSL can be used to estimate soil properties on new soil samples collected, primarily within but not necessarily limited to the geographical regions covered. For robust predictions, a gradient from global  machine learning methods using all data, to local chemometric modeling methods are used.   The research of my thesis evolved around creating SSLs from collected samples and soil archives. I developed spectroscopic data processing and modeling workflows to evaluate the trade-off between accuracy and requirement of updating with analytical measurements for agronomic soil quality assessments and local estimation for temporal soil monitoring. My thesis consists of the general introduction, three chapters, each of which represent this progressive evolution of local or regional modeling, general modeling and transfer learning. Finally, there is an overall conclusion of the work done and I give a research outlook.  In the first chapter, I built cost-effective diagnostic databases of soil quality in four project regions under yam production. I focused on specific soil proxies related to different yam production landscapes that then allow to scale up for other similar landscapes in West Africa. There I sampled typical soil variation in 20 fields of smallerholder farmers in each region, and complemented the soil library with 14 samples from the Land Health Degradation Framework. The purely local calibrations across all samples that we built for total carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), exchangeable calcium, effective CEC, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-extractable iron and clay content gave excellent estimates ($R^2 > 0.75$), which can be recommended for screening major soil constraints at new sites within the region. Despite the small size of the library and a gradient in inherent soil fertility (texture; organic carbon (OC)) across the soil ecoregions (humid forest to Northern Guinean savannah), the calibration with a standard multivariate linear method gave good results that are comparable to SSLs developed with higher sample number and local soil sampling densities.   In the second chapter, I led the development of  a mid-IR SSL for Switzerland ($n =4374 $). It was oriented towards local soil estimation and monitoring and based on time series data and soils from the Swiss Soil Monitoring Network (NABO) from 71 agricultural monitoring sites since 1985 ($n = 596$), and single-time measurements made at 1094 sites from the Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring program (BDM; $n = 3778$). Of the 16 properties we tested, ten showed good discrimination capacity ($R^2 > 0.72$) using mid-IR measurements and rule-based predictions with the {\sc cubist} algorithm. Of these, total C, OC, total N, pH and clay showed very good agreement with the analytical measurements ($R^2 > 0.8$), and were almost unbiased across all data. We also designed a strategy for site-local adaptation based on performance-driven selection ({\sc rs-local}), which we tuned with 2 reference observations for each of the 71 modeling sites and relevant observations from the SSL. Using such a transfer approach reduced the root mean squared error (RMSE) for total C projections of repeated time measurements more than four times (RMSE(C)~=~\SI{0.7}{g\,kg^{-1}}) for a monitoring site compared to the general rules. Interestingly, we also found substantial soil heterogeneity in the respective subsets from the SSL that were selected for localized modeling. The results suggest that the relatively large and diverse SSL has good potential to facilitate temporal soil monitoring at the plot level (10$\times$10\,m).  Finally, in the third chapter, I determined the uncertainty and effectiveness of spectroscopic measurement and modeling in combination with the established Swiss mid-IR SSL for detecting soil OC changes at individual plots at a long-term experiment (LTE; $n = 311$; five sampling times between 2002 and 2018) for the evaluation of sustainable farming practices. The estimation of measured OC changes between all possible consecutive time points and individual combinations of plot and depth had high cross-validation accuracy with partial least squares regression (PLSR) across all data points ($n = 311$; RMSE($\Delta$C)~=~\SI{1.9}{g\,kg^{-1}}). The approach was only 1.3 times more inaccurate for cluster-based and data-driven sample transfer from the SSL using the {\sc rs-local} algorithm. The transfer was highly effective because it only needed 2\% of the LTE samples to achieve marginally lower prediction accuracy than the purely local calibration. Despite the promising results, high small-scale soil variation in mineralogy might reduce the information transfer that is related to the functional change of SOM. To mitigate this effect, there is the need for either better representation of the soil conditions at specific LTEs in SSLs, or more innovation in the learning scheme to normalize soil changes directly via the spectra.  The establishment of the first version of the mid-IR SSL of Switzerland with the NABO and BDM collections was a key deliverable to test the suitability of SSLs for systematic soil monitoring over time. With chapters two and three, my PhD research has been one of its first country-to-plot level transfers of a large spectroscopic collection. With the findings of this thesis I conclude that the operationalization of SSLs needs adequately designed workflows for soil information transfer and modeling that are tailored to the soil conditions at the respective monitoring locations. For effective learning, it matters how we present data to predictive algorithms. Global modeling with all data in SSLs is useful if data is really scarce and can sometimes work out of the box. Therefore, it is important to continuously update SSLs with new soil records. Simultaneously, to make best use of them, I stand for that we should infuse local adaptation and also independent validation samples to extract and verify knowledge for specific uses, such as soil monitoring, digital soil mapping, agronomic soil testing or soil OC accounting.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000549011",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/549011","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","soil infrared spectroscopy||Soil monitoring||Statistical learning","Scaling-up Soil Quality Assessments: Efficient Infrared-spectroscopic Workflows across Space and Time",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2022-05-25T12:17:11Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"An integrated soil-spectroscopy-modeling platform to assess Swiss agricultural soil functions","ETH-40 15-2","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants","28105",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In grasslands, higher biodiversity in terms of plant diversity was shown to increase the diversity of higher trophic levels and provide benefits for farmers such as higher and more stable yields. However, we lack a systematic overview of costs for more diverse seed mixtures, which are an essential tool in maintaining and increasing plant diversity in grasslands. We here investigated the prices and characteristics of 262 commercially available seed mixtures from six German or Swiss online shops and quantified the relationships between seed mixture prices and plant diversity. The most frequent seed mixtures contained 1 to 10 species and were designed for rather intensive grassland management. On the contrary, a smaller set of seed mixtures with particularly high plant diversity (>30 species), usually of native ecotypes, were offered for restoration purposes. More diverse seed mixtures were also more expensive. For example, a seed mixture with 10 or 30 species was on average +63% or +387% more expensive, respectively, than a product containing only 1 species. The relationship between plant diversity and seed mixture prices per ha was related to other seed mixture characteristics, of which plant provenance (i.e., native ecotypes vs. cultivars) was particularly important for the price. Seed mixtures containing only native ecotypes had considerably higher prices per ha (≥ +75%) than those including cultivars. In conclusion, increasing biodiversity in grasslands can be costly. These costs need to be considered when making recommendations to farmers and other stakeholders. Measures to reduce such costs for maintaining and/or increasing plant diversity could promote establishment of grasslands with higher plant diversity, facilitate the restoration of semi-natural grasslands, and contribute to solving the biodiversity crisis in agroecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000499719",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ac1a9c","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499719","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Seed price||Biodiversity||Grassland restoration||Ecosystem service||Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research||Provenance","The costs of diversity: higher prices for more diverse grassland seed mixtures",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-05T12:16:48Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies","774124","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85116030437",,"000685928500001","Environ.

In vitro produced porcine blastocysts are known to be less competent than in vivo developed blastocysts. To understand the conditions that compromise developmental competence of in vitro embryos, it is crucial to evaluate the transcriptional profile of porcine embryos during pre-implantation stages. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome dynamics in in vivo developed and in vitro produced 4-cell embryos, morulae and hatched blastocysts.  Results In vivo developed and in vitro produced embryos displayed largely similar transcriptome profiles during development. Enriched canonical pathways from the 4-cell to the morula transition that were shared between in vivo developed and in vitro produced embryos included oxidative phosphorylation and EIF2 signaling. The shared canonical pathways from the morula to the hatched blastocyst transition were 14–3-3-mediated signaling, xenobiotic metabolism general signaling pathway, and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response. The in vivo developed and in vitro produced hatched blastocysts further were compared to identify molecular signaling pathways indicative of lower developmental competence of in vitro produced hatched blastocysts. A higher metabolic rate and expression of the arginine transporter SLC7A1 were found in in vitro produced hatched blastocysts.  Conclusions Our findings suggest that embryos with compromised developmental potential are arrested at an early stage of development, while embryos developing to the hatched blastocyst stage display largely similar transcriptome profiles, irrespective of the embryo source. The hatched blastocysts derived from the in vitro fertilization-pipeline showed an enrichment in molecular signaling pathways associated with lower developmental competence, compared to the in vivo developed embryos.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474340",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-021-07430-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474340","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Transcriptomics||Porcine||Embryo development||In vivo embryo development||in vitro fertilization","Transcriptome dynamics in early in vivo developing and in vitro produced porcine embryos",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-14T05:26:21Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101814439",,"000624591700001","BMC Genomics","1","BMC Genomics","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

From this first experience, a few avenues for improvements have been identified regarding data size, head diversity, and label reliability. To address these issues, the 2020 dataset has been reexamined, relabeled, and complemented by adding 1722 images from 5 additional countries, allowing for 81,553 additional wheat heads.

Tall goldenrod plants Solidago altissima appear to eavesdrop on the communication of a specialist gall‐inducing fly Eurosta solidaginis by detecting the volatile emissions of male flies and priming anti‐herbivore defences. However, the effects of defence priming on fly fitness have not previously been demonstrated, despite some evidence that female flies avoid ovipositing on primed plants in the field. 2.    To explore how priming affects female preferences and galling success, we manipulated exposure to the priming cue in multiple genotypes of S. altissima and assessed rates of oviposition and gall development. 3.    Priming reduced gall formation overall; however, its effect varied across plant genotypes, as well as by the age of the male flies used for priming, possibly reflecting dosage effects (older flies produce lower emissions). Priming by younger males significantly reduced galling success, while priming by older males slightly improved it. Remarkably, female flies accurately assessed host‐plant quality by avoiding plants primed by young males while preferring those primed by older males.  4.   Synthesis. Our results suggest that defence priming in S. altissima in response to the volatile emissions of E. solidaginis males does affect fly fitness; however, the effect of priming varied by plant genotype, suggesting that there may be variation in defensive strategies against the fly. Female flies have, in response to this defence, evolved a sophisticated ability to evaluate the quality of primed plants.

Interactions among neighbours can alter demography and traits of commingled species via adaptation or plasticity in phenotypic expression, and understanding these two mechanisms in diverse communities is important for determining the ecological and evolutionary consequences of plant–plant interactions.  2.    We reciprocally transplanted perennial species (Arenaria armerina and Festuca indigesta) among patches of two foundation shrub species and open ground to assess whether origin microsite (defined as the spatially distinct abiotic and biotic conditions associated with the two shrubs and open ground) determines germination, recruitment and growth that, in turn, promotes fine‐scale distribution of species among microsites. In addition, we tested the effect of origin microsite on traits, competitive ability, drought tolerance and outlier loci to assess whether origin microsite conditions drove differences in traits, strategies and adaptive loci.  3.    Germination was consistently greater for seeds planted back into their origin microsite relative to seeds sourced from foreign microsites, although this effect was weakened for recruitment. Plant growth was best in open sites regardless of origin microsite. In the greenhouse, A. armerina had conserved traits within origin microsite but distinct trait values among origins, specifically plants from the most productive microsite (e.g. sufficient light, high nutrients and improved water availability) had distinct trait values. Festuca indigesta had conserved trait responses among microsites while within microsite, individuals had significant trait plasticity to different environmental conditions. The combined field and greenhouse results suggest that fine‐scale distributions are supported by local adaptation among microsites of A. armerina and phenotypic plasticity of F. indigesta.  4.    Synthesis. Adaptation or plasticity in phenotypic expression has different implications for demographic rate and persistence of species in changing environments. Local adaptation to neighbours suggests that reductions in foundation species diversity could concomitantly lead to reduced genetic diversity of commingled species while a plastic response indicates a more robust and broad response to changing climatic and biotic conditions.",,,,"0022-0477",,"10.1111/1365-2745.13461","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/439173","en","Wiley",,,"competition||drought tolerance||evolutionary ecology||facilitation||foundation species||plant-plant interactions||trade-offs||trait plasticity","Foundation species promote local adaptation and fine-scale distribution of herbaceous plants",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-09-09T03:04:53Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Ecology and evolution in practice: A plant–plant interaction-based approach to the evolution of biodiversity effects on productivity","170645","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,"85088269584",,"000563838900001","J.

However, drying-rewetting is an inherent feature of soil behavior, and as such also impacts P cycling. While several studies have looked at net changes in P pool sizes with drying-rewetting, few studies have dynamically tracked P exchange using isotopes, which would give insights on P mean residence times in a given pool, and thus P availability. Here, we subjected three soils from a climatic gradient on the Kohala peninsula from Hawaii to 5-month drying-rewetting treatments. The hypotheses were that physico-chemical and biotic processes would be differently affected by repeated drying-rewetting cycles, and that response would depend on climatic history of the soils. Soils were labeled with 33P and 18O enriched water. At select time intervals, we carried out a sequential extraction and measured P concentration, 33P recovery (only first 3 months), and incorporation of 18O from water into phosphate. This allowed tracing P dynamics in sequentially extracted pools as well as O dynamics in phosphate, which are driven by biological processes. Results showed that P concentration and 33P recovery were predominantly driven by soil type. However, across all soils we observed faster dilution of 33P from resin-P into less mobile inorganic pools under drying-rewetting. On the other hand, O dynamics in phosphate were mostly governed by drying-rewetting treatment. Under drying-rewetting, considerably less O was incorporated from water into phosphate of resin-P, microbial-P and HCl-P, suggesting that drying-rewetting reduced biological P cycling. Hence, our results suggest that repeated drying-rewetting increases inorganic P exchange while reducing biological P cycling due to reduced microbial activity, independent of climatic history of the soils. This needs to be considered in P management in ecosystems as well as model representations of the terrestrial P cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523162",,"2673-8619",,"10.3389/fsoil.2021.738464","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523162","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","andosols||andisols||climatic gradient||oxygen isotopes in phosphate||phosphorus cycling||phosphorus radioisotopes||turnover||mean residence time","Soil Phosphorus Exchange as Affected by Drying-Rewetting of Three Soils From a Hawaiian Climatic Gradient",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-05T07:42:35Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Front.

Yet, popular experimental paradigms often employ artificial tasks, require training, or do not permit partner choice, possibly limiting their biological relevance. We developed the joint log-lift task, a social foraging paradigm in which animals have to jointly lift a log to each obtain a food reward. The task relies on an obligate strategy, meaning that the only way to benefit is to work jointly. We hypothesised that (1) animals learn to spontaneously solve the task, and that (2) kin and (3) more sociable individuals would engage more often together in the task and achieve greater success than non-kin and less sociable individuals, respectively. We presented the task to 8 groups of juvenile domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) in their home pen for 30 min daily. Over the course of 9 days, the pigs showed evidence of learning by progressively switching from individual to joint behaviours, leading to 68% (62 out of 91 pigs) spontaneously solving the task. Success was influenced by sociability, but not kinship. There were large differences in success among dyads, hinting at the possible role of social dynamics and inter-individual differences in the ability and/or motivation to solve the task. The joint log-lift task allows researchers to investigate spontaneous cooperative tendencies of individuals, dyads and groups in the home environment through ad libitum engagement with the apparatus. This ecologically relevant paradigm opens the way to investigate social foraging experimentally at large scale, by giving animals free choice about when and with whom to work jointly.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000513767",,"2297-1769",,"10.3389/fvets.2021.745627","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/513767","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","affiliation||coordination||cooperation||joint action||prosocial||spontaneous||sociability||social learning","The Joint Log-Lift Task: A Social Foraging Paradigm",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-05T08:14:24Z",,,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85117893966",,"000712769400001","Front.
