These diffusive fluxes are controlled by plants’ adaptations to balance carbon gains and hydraulic risks. We introduce a trait-based optimality theory that unifies the treatment of stomatal responses and biochemical acclimation of plants to changing environments. Tested with experimental data from eighteen species, our model successfully predicts the simultaneous decline in carbon assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, and photosynthetic capacity during progressive soil drought. It also correctly predicts the dependencies of gas exchange on atmospheric vapour pressure deficit, temperature, and CO2. Consistent with widely observed patterns, inferred trait values for the analysed species display a spectrum of stomatal strategies, a safety-efficiency trade-off, and a convergence towards low hydraulic safety margins. Our unifying theory opens new avenues for reliably modelling the interactive effects of drying soil and air and rising atmospheric CO2 on global photosynthesis and transpiration.",,,,,,"10.1101/2020.12.17.423132","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/466066","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory",,,,,"Towards a unified theory of plant photosynthesis and hydraulics",,"Working Paper","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-27T16:08:51Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Persistance of two CENH3 paralogs in diploids species raises the possibility of subfunctionalization. Here we analysed both CENH3 genes of the  diploid dryland crop cowpea. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that gene duplication of CENH3 occurred independently during the speciation of Vigna unguiculata. Both functional CENH3 variants are transcribed, and the corresponding proteins are intermingled in subdomains of different types of centromere sequences in a tissue-specific manner together with the kinetochore protein CENPC. CENH3.2 is removed from the generative cell of mature pollen, while CENH3.1 persists. CRISPR/Cas9-based inactivation of CENH3.1 resulted in delayed vegetative growth and sterility, indicating that this variant is needed for plant development and reproduction. By contrast, CENH3.2 knockout individuals did not show obvious defects during vegetative and reproductive development. Hence, CENH3.2 of cowpea is likely at an early stage of pseudogenization and less likely undergoing subfunctionalization.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456668",,"2399-3642",,"10.1038/s42003-020-01507-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456668","en","Nature Publishing Group",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Centromeres||Plant cell biology||Plant genetics||Plant molecular biology||Plant sciences","Unequel contribution of two paralogous CENH3 variants in cowpea centromere function",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-12-16T12:29:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85097568050",,"000600140500005","Commun Biol",,"Communications Biology","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Commonly, extreme climatic events are identified based on “changes in the mean conditions” over a discrete period with respect to the longer-term climatology. In this study we aim to: 1) define a different type of extreme event, i.e. weather extreme events: an event with extreme deviation from an expected value (calculated based on past weather conditions) and 2) quantify ecosystem resistance, recovery, and resilience in response to these shock events based on changes in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) measured over 16 years (2004 – 2019), in a montane mixed forest in Switzerland (CH-LAE, Lägeren). In addition to the identification of the physiological extreme events, we test the hypothesis that extremes associated with continuously varying environmental conditions can modify the physiological functionality of a forest ecosystem. We calculated weather extremes based on half-hourly measurements of atmospheric water demand (i.e. vapor pressure deficit, VPD) measured alongside eddy covariance flux measurements. Between 2004 and 2019, we found 185 such physiological extreme events (VPD-extreme), ranging from one to seven days, that occurred about 27 % in spring and 68 % in summer. On average NEP decreased by 25% during these VPD-extreme days compared to the normal-VPD day before, resulting in mean resistance (NEPextreme/NEPpre-extreme) of 0.75. Mean recovery (NEPpost-extreme/NEEextreme) was about 0.85, indicating about a 15% decrease in NEP on days after the extreme events compared to before. There was no significant trend in resistance, recovery, and resilience over the 16 years.  Finally, decreased functionality during these VPD-extreme days events confirms our hypothesis. Our approach of looking at the forest response to extreme events is independent of “changes of mean conditions from long-term climatology” and focuses on the ability of the ecosystem to maintain functionality within the realm of “continuous environmental variability”. Identification of physiologically-relevant climatic extremes and testing the legacy effect from those events is a crucial requirement for understanding the future response of forests to climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000463097",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/463097","en","American Geophysical Union",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/",,"Forest ecosystem response to weather extremes: case study of a montane mixed forest in Switzerland",,"Conference Poster","Open access",,,"2021-01-17T17:55:05Z",,,,"yes","AGU Fall Meeting 2020","December 1-17, 2020","online",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Comparative analysis revealed extensive structural rearrangements, introgressions from wild relatives and differences in gene content resulting from complex breeding histories aimed at improving adaptation to diverse environments, grain yield and quality, and resistance to stresses4,5. We provide examples outlining the utility of these genomes, including a detailed multi-genome-derived nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein repertoire involved in disease resistance and the characterization of Sm16, a gene associated with insect resistance.

While some taxa like vascular plants are relatively well recorded, important groups of pollinators like bees are still understudied. This article presents an updated checklist of the bee species of Morocco and includes a summary of global and regional distribution of each species. A total of 961 species belonging to six bee families and 68 genera are recorded: Andrenidae (8 genera, 217 species); Apidae (15 genera, 241 species); Colletidae (2 genera, 74 species), Halictidae (12 genera, 144 species), Megachilidae (28 genera, 271 species) and Melittidae (3 genera, 14 species). Among them, 67 species are recorded for the first time in Morocco. Around 70% of the bee fauna of Morocco consists of widespread Palaearctic species. Only 18% of Moroccan species recorded are restricted to North Africa and 8% are Moroccan single-country endemics (81 species). Afrotropical elements in the Moroccan fauna are few, with only 3% of Morocco species co-occuring in that region. This checklist is intended to stimulate new regional research on bees including their taxonomy and biogeography. As many groups of bees have been understudied, discovery of new species for science and new records for the country can be expected. Additional research including inventorying, monitoring, and integrative taxonomic studies are needed to develop a comprehensive strategy for bee conservation in Morocco.  © 2020 Magnolia Press",,,,,,"10.11646/zootaxa.4892.1.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456988","en","Magnolia Press",,,,"Hymenoptera||Anthophila||checklist||endemism||pollinators||Mediterranean||Sahara","The wild bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) of Morocco",,"Journal Issue","Metadata only",,,"2020-12-18T03:43:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85095767556",,"000599135200001",,"1","Zootaxa","4892","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These insects belong to distinct lineages with varying degrees of specialisation and diverse feeding ecologies, presenting numerous opportunities for comparative studies of chemically mediated eco‐evolutionary dynamics. This review presents the first evolutionary evaluation of cycad‐feeding among Lepidoptera along with a comprehensive review of their ecology. Our analysis suggests that multiple lineages have independently colonised cycads from angiosperm hosts, yet only a few clades appear to have radiated following their transitions to cycads. Defensive traits are likely important for diversification, as many cycad specialists are warningly coloured and sequester cycad toxins. The butterfly family Lycaenidae appears to be particularly predisposed to cycad‐feeding and several cycadivorous lycaenids are warningly coloured and chemically defended. Cycad–herbivore interactions provide a promising but underutilised study system for investigating plant–insect coevolution, convergent and divergent adaptations, and the multi‐trophic significance of defensive traits; therefore the review ends by suggesting specific research gaps that would be fruitfully addressed in Lepidoptera and other cycad‐feeding insects.",,,,"1461-023X||1461-0248",,"10.1111/ele.13581","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444934","en","Wiley",,,,"acquired chemical defense||aposematism||BMAA||chemical ecology||coevolution||defensive ecology||host transitions||MAM-glycosides||phytotoxin","Ecology and evolution of cycad‐feeding Lepidoptera",,"Review Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-10-07T14:16:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091680969",,"000572144000001","Ecol. lett.","12","Ecology Letters","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The adoption rate of DAS was markedly higher compared to EMS in all agricultural enterprises. The adoption rate was highest for high-value enterprise vegetables and surprisingly low for the high-value enterprise grapes. The results of a binary logistic regression showed that farmers located in the mountain zone were less likely to adopt PAT compared to farmers in the valley. Small farm size correlated with low adoption rates and vice versa showing adoption happens country-specific in the upper farm size distribution. The results show the potential for novel technologies to be adopted by farmers of high-value products. Furthermore, technologies have been partially used to reduce physical workload but not yet to evaluate crop or management performance to support decisions. However, automatic collection and forwarding of data is a fundamental step towards Smart Farming realizing its full potential in the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000416417",,"1385-2256||1573-1618",,"10.1007/s11119-020-09723-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/416417","en","Springer",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Digitalisation||Precision agriculture||Technology uptake||Drivers of adoption","Status quo of adoption of precision agriculture enabling technologies in Swiss plant production",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-24T00:42:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85084475641",,"000531117000001",,"6","Precision Agriculture","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The input of Nsymb reduces the energy costs of producing fertilizer and provides a supply of nitrogen (N) for plants that is more synchronous to plant demand than occasional fertilizer applications. Legumes have been promoted as a potential N2O mitigation strategy for grasslands, but evidence to support their efficacy is limited, partly due to the difficulty in conducting experiments across the large range of potential combinations of legume proportions and fertilizer N inputs. These experimental constraints can be overcome by biogeochemical models that can vary legume‐fertilizer combinations and subsequently aid the design of targeted experiments. Using two variants each of two biogeochemical models (APSIM and DayCent), we tested the N2O mitigation potential and productivity of full factorial combinations of legume proportions and fertilizer rates for five temperate grassland sites across the globe. Both models showed that replacing fertilizer with legumes reduced N2O emissions without reducing productivity across a broad range of legume‐fertilizer combinations. Although the models were consistent with the relative changes of N2O emissions compared to the baseline scenario (200 kg N ha−1 yr−1; no legumes), they predicted different levels of absolute N2O emissions and thus also of absolute N2O emission reductions; both were greater in DayCent than in APSIM. We recommend confirming these results with experimental studies assessing the effect of clover proportions in the range 30–50% and ≤150 kg N ha−1 yr−1 input as these were identified as best‐bet climate smart agricultural practices.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000453425",,"0886-6236||1944-9224",,"10.1029/2020gb006561","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453425","en","American Geophysical Union",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Evaluating the Potential of Legumes to Mitigate N2O Emissions From Permanent Grassland Using Process‐Based Models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-27T10:53:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Robust models for assessing the effectiveness of technologies and managements to reduce N2O emissions from grazed pastures (Models4Pastures)","154245","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","FACCE-JPI",,,,"85097991993",,"000603665500009","Glob. biogeochem. cycles","12","Global Biogeochemical Cycles","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In order to investigate unintended effects resulting from the process that led to the generation of this cisgenic line, 20 trees of C44.4.146 were grown in a protected field site together with 20 trees each of the untransformed wildtype ('Gala Galaxy' from in vitro culture), the original ‘Gala’ cultivar and sport mutants of 'Gala', in a randomized block design for multiple years. Comparisons were carried out on agronomical and molecular level, including a multi-omics investigation of leaf and fruit material. Here, we show that the large majority of deviations between the cisgenic line and its wildtype were in the range of natural variability observed within sport mutants of 'Gala'. Transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analyses performed on pooled leaf samples revealed a limited number of features for which the cisgenic line differed simultaneously from both, wildtype and investigated sport mutants. The same applied to tree-related parameters.

In this study, we investigated how different long‐term mineral fertilization treatments affect dry‐matter (DM) yield, plant species composition, and nutrient and mineral concentrations of forage from mountain grasslands. During 2 years, forage was sampled from three different long‐term fertilization experiments located at 930 (L), 1,190 (M) and 1,340 (H) m a.s.l. at different sites in Switzerland. At each site, three mineral fertilization treatments (0, PK and NPK) had been maintained for three to six decades, with two (L and M) or three harvests (H) per year. Yield, the botanical composition and concentrations of net energy, utilizable crude protein and different phenolic fractions were determined. Nutrient and mineral concentrations were also determined. For all three sites (L, M and H), unfertilized swards had lower annual DM yields (3.39, 5.17 and 2.73 t/ha) compared to PK (6.33, 7.17 and 4.44 t/ha) and NPK fertilized swards (7.69, 7.22 and 7.44 t/ha), respectively. Long‐term fertilization had little effect on the gross nutrient and phenolic composition, but forage P and K concentration increased. The decades‐long fertilization of either PK or NPK of up to 85 kg N, 80 kg P2O5 and 240 kg K2O/ha reduced plant species richness only at site H. Fertilization of PK may allow to simultaneously increase forage productivity and maintain forage quality in mountain grasslands. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons",,,,"0142-5242||1365-2494",,"10.1111/gfs.12488","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432524","en","Wiley",,,,"chemical composition||condensed tannin||dry-matter yield||harvest||long-term mineral fertilization","Forage quality of species‐rich mountain grasslands subjected to zero, PK and NPK mineral fertilization for decades",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-08-25T09:34:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85089311412",,"000558657800001","Grass forage sci.

The suitability of spirulina (Arthrospira platensis), a fast growing and resource-efficient blue-green microalga, as a source of metabolizable protein for dairy cows is known, but its effects on milk antioxidants and sensory properties were never investigated. Twelve cows were allocated to 2 groups and fed hay-based diets complemented with sugar beet pulp and wheat flakes in individual feeding troughs. The N content per kilogram of DM was equivalent between the 2 diets. Diet of 1 group was supplemented with 5% spirulina; the second group was supplemented with 6% soybean meal (control). After an adaptation period of 15 d, data were collected, and feed, milk, blood, and rumen fluid were sampled. Feeds were analyzed for proximate contents, and blood plasma was analyzed for total antioxidant capacity and antioxidant contents (tocopherol, phenols). Milk samples were analyzed for fatty acid profile, coagulation properties, color, and contents of fat, protein, lactose, total phenols, lipophilic vitamins, and provitamins (e.g., β-carotene). Triangle tests were performed by a trained sensory panel on 6 homogenized and pasteurized bulk milk samples per treatment. The substitution of soybean meal by spirulina in the diet did not affect feed intake, milk yield, milk fat, protein, or lactose contents compared with the control group. However, the milk from the spirulina-fed cows had a higher content of β-carotene (0.207 vs. 0.135 μg/mL) and was more yellow (b* index: 14.9 vs. 13.8). Similar to the spirulina lipids but far less pronounced, the milk fat from the spirulina-fed cows had a higher proportion of γ-linolenic acid (0.057 vs. 0.038% of fatty acid methyl esters) compared with milk fat from soybean meal-fed cows. Also trans-11 C18:1 (vaccenic acid) and other C18:1 trans isomers were elevated, but otherwise the fatty acid profile resembled that of cows fed the control diet. No sensory difference was found between milk from the 2 experimental groups. Furthermore, we observed no effects of substituting soybean meal by spirulina on total antioxidant capacity, α-tocopherol and total phenols in blood and milk. Effects on rumen fluid characteristics were minor. In conclusion, spirulina seems to be a promising protein source for dairy cows with certain improvements in nutritionally favorable constituents in milk and without side-effects on animal performance in the short term.",,,,"0022-0302||1525-3198",,"10.3168/jds.2020-18602","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/452678","en","Elsevier",,,,"Dairy cattle||Arthrospira platensis||Fatty acid||Sensory quality||β-carotene","Effects of the substitution of soybean meal by spirulina in a hay-based diet for dairy cows on milk composition and sensory perception",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-11-24T08:05:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85092252715",,"000591884900030","J.

As basic knowledge of reproductive physiology is currently lacking in many species, increasing the understanding of reproductive physiology is imperative and includes the development of novel artificial reproduction technologies. Despite the relatively comprehensive knowledge on molecular mechanisms underlying reproduction in livestock species such as cattle, pregnancy failures are likewise far from understood. Contrary to other wildlife species, the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) displays a remarkably high pregnancy rate. In parts, cattle and roe deer exhibit comparable features of preimplantation embryo development. Therefore, understanding the high fertility rate in the roe deer holds a great potential for cross-species knowledge gain. As the only known species among the artiodactylae, the roe deer displays a long period of embryonic diapause. The preimplantation blastocyst reaches a diameter of 1 mm only at around 4 months compared to around 13 days post estrus in cattle. The expanded blastocyst survives in a uterine microenvironment that contains a unique set of yet unidentified factors that allow embryonic stem cells to proliferate at low pace without impairing their developmental potential. Upon reactivation, intimate embryo-maternal communication comparable to those reported in cattle is thought to occur. In this review, current knowledge, parallels and differences of reproductive physiology in cattle and roe deer are reviewed. The roe deer is proposed as a unique model species to (1) enhance our knowledge of fertility processes, (2) define factors that support embryo survival for an extended period, (3) advance knowledge on embryonic stem cells, and (4) unravel potential implications for the development of novel strategies for artificial reproductive technologies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000441499",,"1879-3231||0093-691x",,"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.06.042","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/441499","en","Elsevier",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)||Embryo-maternal communication||Pluripotent stem cells||Species conservation||Embryonic diapause","Embryonic diapause in roe deer: A model to unravel embryo-maternal communication during pre-implantation development in wildlife and livestock species",,"Review Article","Open access",,,"2020-09-21T08:27:51Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Embryonic Diapause: pluripotency on hold?","185026","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85090879649",,"000591658500013","Theriogenology",,"Theriogenology","158","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Affected boars produce ejaculates that contain spermatozoa with defective acrosomes, resulting in low fertility. The acrosome defect was mapped to porcine chromosome 15 but the causal mutation has not been identified. We re‐analyzed microarray‐derived genotypes of affected boars and confirmed that the acrosome defect maps to a 12.24 Mb segment of porcine chromosome 15. To detect the mutation causing defective acrosomes, we sequenced the genomes of two affected and three unaffected boars to an average coverage of 11‐fold. Read depth analysis revealed a 55 kb deletion that is associated with the acrosome defect. The deletion encompasses the BOLL gene encoding the boule homolog, an RNA binding protein which is an evolutionarily conserved member of the DAZ (Deleted in AZoospermia) gene family. Lack of BOLL expression causes spermatogenic arrest and sperm maturation failure in many species. Boars that carry the deletion in the homozygous state produce sperm but their acrosomes are defective, suggesting that lack of porcine BOLL compromises acrosome formation. Our findings warrant further research to investigate the role of BOLL during spermatogenesis and sperm maturation in pigs.",,,,"1365-2052||0268-9146",,"10.1111/age.12998","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/442763","en","Wiley",,,,"genetic disorder||impaired male fertility||sperm maturation defect||sterility","Deletion of porcine BOLL is associated with defective acrosomes and subfertility in Yorkshire boars",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-09-25T14:37:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091444164",,"000572512800001","Anim. genet.","6","Animal Genetics","51","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In particular, the soil‐to‐atmosphere CO2 flux, commonly though imprecisely termed soil respiration (RS), is one of the largest carbon fluxes in the Earth system. An increasing number of high‐frequency RS measurements (typically, from an automated system with hourly sampling) have been made over the last two decades; an increasing number of methane measurements are being made with such systems as well. Such high frequency data are an invaluable resource for understanding GHG fluxes, but lack a central database or repository. Here we describe the lightweight, open‐source COSORE (COntinuous SOil REspiration) database and software, that focuses on automated, continuous and long‐term GHG flux datasets, and is intended to serve as a community resource for earth sciences, climate change syntheses and model evaluation. Contributed datasets are mapped to a single, consistent standard, with metadata on contributors, geographic location, measurement conditions and ancillary data. The design emphasizes the importance of reproducibility, scientific transparency and open access to data. While being oriented towards continuously measured RS, the database design accommodates other soil‐atmosphere measurements (e.g. ecosystem respiration, chamber‐measured net ecosystem exchange, methane fluxes) as well as experimental treatments (heterotrophic only, etc.). We give brief examples of the types of analyses possible using this new community resource and describe its accompanying R software package.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000446726",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15353","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446726","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","carbon dioxide||greenhouse gases||methane||open data||open science||soil respiration","COSORE: A community database for continuous soil respiration and other soil‐atmosphere greenhouse gas flux data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-20T04:52:13Z",,,,"yes",,,,"ICOS-CH Phase 2","173691","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,,"85092003521",,"000575527200001","Glob.

All three methods are based on the coupled water and carbon relationship, but they differ in assumptions and parameterizations. Intercomparison of the three daily T estimates shows high correlation among methods (R between .89 and .94), but a spread in magnitudes of T/ET (evapotranspiration) from 45% to 77%. When compared at six sites with concurrent EC and sap flow measurements, all three EC‐based T estimates show higher correlation to sap flow‐based T than EC‐based ET. The partitioning methods show expected tendencies of T/ET increasing with dryness (vapor pressure deficit and days since rain) and with leaf area index (LAI). Analysis of 140 sites with high‐quality estimates for at least two continuous years shows that T/ET variability was 1.6 times higher across sites than across years. Spatial variability of T/ET was primarily driven by vegetation and soil characteristics (e.g., crop or grass designation, minimum annual LAI, soil coarse fragment volume) rather than climatic variables such as mean/standard deviation of temperature or precipitation. Overall, T and T/ET patterns are plausible and qualitatively consistent among the different water flux partitioning methods implying a significant advance made for estimating and understanding T globally, while the magnitudes remain uncertain. Our results represent the first extensive EC data‐based estimates of ecosystem T permitting a data‐driven perspective on the role of plants’ water use for global water and carbon cycling in a changing climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000444958",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15314","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444958","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ecohydrology||eddy covariance||evaporation||evapotranspiration||FLUXNET||transpiration","Ecosystem transpiration and evaporation: Insights from three water flux partitioning methods across FLUXNET sites",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-07T15:36:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,"ICOS-CH Phase 2","173691","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,,"85092098496",,"000575306700001","Glob.

Due to precipitation changes, mild summer droughts are expected to become more frequent, even in temperate regions. For perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), an important forage grass of the Poaceae family, leaf growth is a crucial factor determining biomass accumulation and hence forage yield. Although leaf elongation has been shown to be temperature-dependent under normal conditions, the genetic regulation of leaf growth under water deficit in perennial ryegrass is poorly understood. Herein, we evaluated the response to water deprivation in a diverse panel of perennial ryegrass genotypes, employing a high-precision phenotyping platform. The study revealed phenotypic variation for growth-related traits and significant (P < 0.05) differences in leaf growth under normal conditions within the subgroups of turf and forage type cultivars. The phenotypic data was combined with genotypic variants identified using genotyping-by-sequencing to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Using GWAS, we identified DNA polymorphisms significantly associated with leaf growth reduction under water deprivation. These polymorphisms were adjacent to genes predicted to encode for phytochrome B and a MYB41 transcription factor. The result obtained in the present study will increase our understanding on the complex molecular mechanisms involved in plant growth under water deficit. Moreover, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers identified will serve as a valuable resource in future breeding programs to select for enhanced biomass formation under mild summer drought conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000458767",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2020.570204","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458767","en","Frontiers Media",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Leaf growth||Drought tolerance||Genome-wide association study||Dynamic phenotyping||Lolium perenne L.||Phytochrome B||MYB41","Genome-Wide Association Study to Identify Candidate Loci for Biomass Formation Under Water Deficit in Perennial Ryegrass",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-12-31T03:38:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85098069777",,"000600619500001","Front.

Here, we analyse the extent to which 42 different ecosystem properties can be predicted by 41 plant traits in 78 experimentally manipulated grassland plots over 10 years. Despite the unprecedented number of traits analysed, the average percentage of variation in ecosystem properties jointly explained was only moderate (32.6%) within individual years, and even much lower (12.7%) across years. Most other studies linking ecosystem properties to plant traits analysed no more than six traits and, when including only six traits in our analysis, the average percentage of variation explained in across-year levels of ecosystem properties dropped to 4.8%. Furthermore, we found on average only 12.2% overlap in significant predictors among ecosystem properties, indicating that a small set of key traits able to explain multiple ecosystem properties does not exist. Our results therefore suggest that there are specific limits to the extent to which traits per se can predict the long-term functional consequences of biodiversity change, so that data on additional drivers, such as interacting abiotic factors, may be required to improve predictions of ecosystem property levels.",,,,"2397-334X",,"10.1038/s41559-020-01316-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444850","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Biodiversity||Community ecology||Ecosystem ecology||Grassland ecology","Plant traits alone are poor predictors of ecosystem properties and long-term ecosystem functioning",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-10-07T07:40:54Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85092089670",,"000575339600001","Nat Ecol Evol","12","Nature Ecology & Evolution","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We evaluated how the properties of these networks varied across land-use intensity gradients for 150 forests and 150 grasslands. Land-use intensity significantly affected network structure in both habitats. Changes in connectance were larger in forests, while changes in modularity and evenness were more evident in grasslands. Our results show that increasing land-use intensity leads to more homogeneous networks with less integration within modules in both habitats, driven by the belowground compartment in grasslands, while forest responses to land management were more complex. Land-use intensity strongly altered hub identity and module composition in both habitats, showing that the positive correlations of provisioning services with biodiversity and ecosystem functions found at low land-use intensity levels, decline at higher intensity levels. Our approach provides a comprehensive view of the relationships between multiple components of biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and ecosystem services and how they respond to land use. This can be used to identify overall changes in the ecosystem, to derive mechanistic hypotheses, and it can be readily applied to further global change drivers.",,,,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2016210117","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448339","en","National Academy of Sciences",,,,"BEF||ecosystem function–service relationships||land management intensification||co-occurrence network||Biodiversity Exploratories","Land-use intensity alters networks between biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and services",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-10-28T11:28:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85096079852",,"000590738600024","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","45","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","117","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using high-density genotypes of 3938 Nellore cattle from Brazil, we investigated the accuracy of imputation from 50 K to 777 K SNP density using Minimac3, when map positions were determined according to the bovine genome assemblies UMD3.1 and ARS-UCD1.2. We assessed the effect of reference and target panel sizes on the pre-phasing based imputation quality using ten-fold cross-validation. Further, we compared the reliability of the model-based imputation quality score (Rsq) from Minimac3 to the empirical imputation accuracy.  Results The overall accuracy of imputation measured as the squared correlation between true and imputed allele dosages (R2dose) was almost identical using either the UMD3.1 or ARS-UCD1.2 genome assembly. When the size of the reference panel increased from 250 to 2000, R2dose increased from 0.845 to 0.917, and the number of polymorphic markers in the imputed data set increased from 586,701 to 618,660. Advantages in both accuracy and marker density were also observed when larger target panels were imputed, likely resulting from more accurate haplotype inference. Imputation accuracy increased from 0.903 to 0.913, and the marker density in the imputed data increased from 593,239 to 595,570 when haplotypes were inferred in 500 and 2900 target animals. The model-based imputation quality scores from Minimac3 (Rsq) were systematically higher than empirically estimated accuracies. However, both metrics were positively correlated and the correlation increased with the size of the reference panel and MAF of imputed variants.  Conclusions Accurate imputation of BovineHD BeadChip markers is possible in Nellore cattle using the new bovine reference genome assembly ARS-UCD1.2. The use of large reference and target panels improves the accuracy of the imputed genotypes and provides genotypes for more markers segregating at low frequency for downstream genomic analyses. The model-based imputation quality score from Minimac3 (Rsq) can be used to detect poorly imputed variants but its reliability depends on the size of the reference panel and MAF of the imputed variants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450471",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-020-07184-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450471","en","BioMed Central",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Investigating the accuracy of imputing autosomal variants in Nellore cattle using the ARS-UCD1.2 assembly of the bovine genome",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-10T08:40:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85095688967",,"000590724600001","BMC Genomics","1","BMC Genomics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Nitrogen (N) limitation to plant growth contributes to pasture degradation. The introduction of legumes in association with grasses has been proposed as a strategy to improve N supply via symbiotic N2 fixation, but the fixed N input and N benefits for associated grasses have hardly been determined in farmers’ pastures. We have carried out on-farm research in ten paired plots of grass-alone (GA) vs. grass-legume (GL) pastures. Measurements included soil properties, pasture productivity, and sources of plant N uptake using 15N isotope natural abundance methods. The integration of legumes increased pasture biomass production by about 74%, while N uptake was improved by two-fold. The legumes derived about 80% of their N via symbiotic N2 fixation. The isotopic signature of N of grasses in GA vs. GL pastures suggested that sources of grass N are affected by sward composition. Low values of δ15N found in some grasses in GA pastures indicate that they depend, to some extent, on N from non-symbiotic N2 fixation, while δ15N signatures of grasses in GL pastures pointed to N transfer to grass from the associated legume. The role of different soil–plant processes such as biological nitrification inhibition (BNI), non-symbiotic N2 fixation by GA pastures and legume–N transfer to grasses in GL pastures need to be further studied to provide a more comprehensive understanding of N sources supporting the growth of grasses in tropical pastures.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000452130",,"1424-2818",,"10.3390/d12110419","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/452130","en","MDPI",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biological nitrogen fixation||Nitrogen concentration||Nitrogen transfer||15N natural abundance","Urochloa grasses swap nitrogen source when grown in association with legumes in tropical pastures",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-20T06:49:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85096105306",,"000592882300001",,"11","Diversity","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We present a framework of food sustainability that was co-created by academic and non-academic actors and comprises five dimensions: food security, right to food, environmental performance, poverty and inequality, and social-ecological resilience. For each dimension, an interdisciplinary research team—together with actors from different food systems—defined key indicators and empirically applied them to six case studies in Kenya and Bolivia. Food sustainability scores were analysed for the food systems as a whole, for the five dimensions, and for food system activities. We then identified the indicators with the greatest influence on sustainability scores. While all food systems displayed strengths and weaknesses, local and agroecological food systems scored comparatively highly across all dimensions. Agro-industrial food systems scored lowest in environmental performance and food security, while their resilience scores were medium to high. The lowest-scoring dimensions were right to food, poverty and inequality, with particularly low scores obtained for the indicators women’s access to land and credit, agrobiodiversity, local food traditions, social protection, and remedies for violations of the right to food.

Genomics-assisted breeding utilizes genomic and phenotypic information to increase the selection efficiency in breeding programs, and measurements of phenotypes in different environments can facilitate the application of the approach under various climatic conditions. Here we present an apple reference population: the apple REFPOP, a large collection formed of 534 genotypes planted in six European countries, as a unique tool to accelerate apple breeding. The population consisted of 269 accessions and 265 progeny from 27 parental combinations, representing the diversity in cultivated apple and current European breeding material, respectively. A high-density genome-wide dataset of 303,239 SNPs was produced as a combined output of two SNP arrays of different densities using marker imputation with an imputation accuracy of 0.95. Based on the genotypic data, linkage disequilibrium was low and population structure was weak. Two well-studied phenological traits of horticultural importance were measured. We found marker–trait associations in several previously identified genomic regions and maximum predictive abilities of 0.57 and 0.75 for floral emergence and harvest date, respectively. With decreasing SNP density, the detection of significant marker–trait associations varied depending on trait architecture. Regardless of the trait, 10,000 SNPs sufficed to maximize genomic prediction ability. We confirm the suitability of the apple REFPOP design for genomics-assisted breeding, especially for breeding programs using related germplasm, and emphasize the advantages of a coordinated and multinational effort for customizing apple breeding methods in the genomics era.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000452882",,,,"10.1038/s41438-020-00408-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/452882","en","Nature Publishing Group",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The apple REFPOP—a reference population for genomics-assisted breeding in apple",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-25T03:53:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85096857348",,"000588074200017",,"1","Horticulture Research","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study addresses the mechanisms underlying such SOC losses by assessing LUC effects on, and relationships between, soil engineering invertebrate fauna, soil structural stability, and C allocation and sequestration within soil aggregates. We sampled three sites with sets of land use types varying in the level of anthropogenic stress in sandy loam, sand clay loam, and clay soils along a 1000-km-long transect in central Brazil, where bioenergy cropping expands across pasturelands. We quantified the effects of LUC on soil engineer fauna (i.e., termites, earthworms, coleopterans, and ants), soil structural stability, and C allocation and fitted structural equation models (SEM) to elucidate mechanistic links between the measured variables. We found that reductions in SOC stocks following LUC were concomitant with reductions in the abundance of soil engineers (log abundance of soil engineers, −1.17 ± 0.54; P = 0.0322), destabilization of soil structure (normalized stability index, −0.16 ± 0.04; P < 0.0001), and soil depth-dependent decreases in the amounts and increases in the humification degree of aggregate-occluded SOC. Our SEMsupported the predicted relationships among these responses, and indicated that soil engineering by invertebrates indirectly mediated changes in SOC stocks across land uses by controlling the physical protection of low-humified, aggregate-occluded SOC, a C fraction that accounted for over 90% of the change in total SOC stocks following LUC. When analysing the influence of the different invertebrate groups separately, we found stronger support for the role of termites in this process compared to that of earthworms, coleopterans, and ants. Hence, negative LUC effects on populations of soil engineers weaken soil functioning and its C storage. These results highlight the need for land-use strategies that maintain soil fauna in order to sustain key ecosystem processes like soil structural formation and soil C stabilization. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.",,,,"0038-0717||1879-3428",,"10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.107998","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/441119","en","Elsevier",,,,"Land-use change||Carbon stocks||Soil aggregation||Soil fauna||Soil organic matter||Termites","Linking soil engineers, structural stability, and organic matter allocation to unravel soil carbon responses to land-use change",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-09-18T02:47:26Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85090599288",,"000581509300016","Soil biol. biochem.",,"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","150","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Olympus, a legendary mountain in Central Greece, also known for its exceptional flora.  Location Mt. Olympus, Central Greece.  Taxon Bombus (Latreille, 1802).  Methods We explored 10 study sites located on the north‐eastern slope of the mountain, from 327 to 2,596 m a. s. l. Bumblebee surveys were carried out on a monthly basis using pan traps (years 2013 and 2014) and random transect observations assisted by hand netting (years 2013, 2014, and 2016); visited flowering plants and their diversity were recorded during the transect observations.  Results With a total of 22 recorded bumblebee species and one species complex, Mt. Olympus is one of the richest mountains in Mediterranean Europe regarding bumblebee diversity. Bombus quadricolor was recorded as a new species for Greece, whereas four species were recorded at their southernmost distribution limit, therefore possibly vulnerable to climate change. Species richness of both bumblebees and plants in flower followed a unimodal pattern along the altitudinal gradient, the former peaking at high altitudes (1,900–2,200 m a.s.l.), the latter at lower to intermediate altitudes (500–1,500 m a.s.l.). Bumblebee–plant visitation networks were larger, more diverse and more generalized in the between intermediate altitudes (1,500–1,800 m a.s.l.), while nestedness peaked at low and high altitudes.  Main conclusions Our results disclose the differential significance of the altitudinal zones of Mt. Olympus for the conservation of the diversity of bumblebees and their host plants, as well as of the interactions among them. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of this mountain, because of its South‐European location, regarding climate change impacts on the bumblebee fauna of Europe. All in all, they point towards more reinforced conservation measures to be taken including the expansion of the protection status to the entire mountain.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000440130",,"1366-9516||1472-4642",,"10.1111/ddi.13138","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/440130","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Altitudinal gradient||Bumblebee diversity||Global warming||Mount Olympus||Mountain system||Pollination network","Bumblebee diversity and pollination networks along the elevation gradient of Mount Olympus, Greece",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-09-12T02:53:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85088788539",,"000563863800001","Divers.

Here, to understand maize antibiotic biosynthesis, we integrated association mapping, pan-genome multi-omic correlations, enzyme structure–function studies and targeted mutagenesis. We define ten genes in three zealexin (Zx) gene clusters that encode four sesquiterpene synthases and six cytochrome P450 proteins that collectively drive the production of diverse antibiotic cocktails. Quadruple mutants in which the ability to produce zealexins (ZXs) is blocked exhibit a broad-spectrum loss of disease resistance. Genetic redundancies ensuring pathway resiliency to single null mutations are combined with enzyme substrate promiscuity, creating a biosynthetic hourglass pathway that uses diverse substrates and in vivo combinatorial chemistry to yield complex antibiotic blends.

Individual variation in global recombination rates has been shown to be heritable in several species, and variants significantly associated with this trait have been identified. Recombination on the sex chromosome has often been ignored in these studies although this trait may be particularly interesting as it may correspond to a biological process distinct from that on autosomes. For instance, recombination in males is restricted to the pseudo-autosomal region (PAR). We herein used a large cattle pedigree with more than 100,000 genotyped animals to improve the genetic map of the X chromosome and to study the genetic architecture of individual variation in recombination rate on the sex chromosome (XRR). The length of the genetic map was 46.4 and 121.2 cM in males and females, respectively, but the recombination rate in the PAR was six times higher in males. The heritability of CO counts on the X chromosome was comparable to that of autosomes in males (0.011) but larger than that of autosomes in females (0.024). XRR was highly correlated (0.76) with global recombination rate (GRR) in females, suggesting that both traits might be governed by shared variants. In agreement, a set of eleven previously identified variants associated with GRR had correlated effects on female XRR (0.86). In males, XRR and GRR appeared to be distinct traits, although more accurate CO counts on the PAR would be valuable to confirm these results.",,,,"0018-067x||1365-2540",,"10.1038/s41437-020-0341-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/428080","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Genetic linkage study||Heritable quantitative trait","Genetic architecture of individual variation in recombination rate on the X chromosome in cattle",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-07-23T05:25:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85087665524",,"000547233800001","Heredity","5","Heredity","125","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This interpolated climate data represents long‐term average thermal conditions at coarse spatial resolutions only. Hence, many climate‐forcing factors that operate at fine spatiotemporal resolutions are overlooked. This is particularly important in relation to effects of observation height (e.g. vegetation, snow and soil characteristics) and in habitats varying in their exposure to radiation, moisture and wind (e.g. topography, radiative forcing or cold‐air pooling). Since organisms living close to the ground relate more strongly to these microclimatic conditions than to free‐air temperatures, microclimatic ground and near‐surface data are needed to provide realistic forecasts of the fate of such organisms under anthropogenic climate change, as well as of the functioning of the ecosystems they live in. To fill this critical gap, we highlight a call for temperature time series submissions to SoilTemp, a geospatial database initiative compiling soil and near‐surface temperature data from all over the world. Currently, this database contains time series from 7,538 temperature sensors from 51 countries across all key biomes. The database will pave the way toward an improved global understanding of microclimate and bridge the gap between the available climate data and the climate at fine spatiotemporal resolutions relevant to most organisms and ecosystem processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000411646",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15123","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/411646","en","Wiley",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Microclimate||Soil climate||Climate change||Topoclimate||Database||Temperature||Species Distributions||Ecosystem processes","SoilTemp: a global database of near‐surface temperature",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-04-24T09:36:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Lif3web: The present and future spatial structure of tri-trophic networks","162604","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85086643464",,"000542205100001","Glob.

Resistance against individual pathogen species is often ineffective in the field where multiple pathogens form a pea root rot complex (PRRC) and conjointly infect pea plants. On the other hand, various beneficial plant-microbe interactions are known that offer opportunities to strengthen plant health. To account for the whole rhizosphere microbiome in the assessment of root rot resistance in pea, an infested soil-based resistance screening assay was established. The infested soil originated from a field that showed severe pea root rot in the past. Initially, amplicon sequencing was employed to characterize the fungal microbiome of diseased pea roots grown in the infested soil. The amplicon sequencing evidenced a diverse fungal community in the roots including pea pathogens Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani, Didymella sp., and Rhizoctonia solani and antagonists such as Clonostachys rosea and several mycorrhizal species. The screening system allowed for a reproducible assessment of disease parameters among 261 pea cultivars, breeding lines, and landraces grown for 21 days under controlled conditions. A sterile soil control treatment was used to calculate relative shoot and root biomass in order to compare growth performance of pea lines with highly different growth morphologies. Broad sense heritability was calculated from linear mixed model estimated variance components for all traits. Emergence on the infested soil showed high (H2 = 0.89), root rot index (H2 = 0.43), and relative shoot dry weight (H2 = 0.51) medium heritability. The resistance screening allowed for a reproducible distinction between PRRC susceptible and resistant pea lines. The combined assessment of root rot index and relative shoot dry weight allowed to identify resistant (low root rot index) and tolerant pea lines (low relative shoot dry weight at moderate to high root rot index). We conclude that relative shoot dry weight is a valuable trait to select disease tolerant pea lines. Subsequently, the resistance ranking was verified in an on-farm experiment with a subset of pea lines. We found a significant correlation (rs = 0.73, p = 0.03) between the controlled conditions and the resistance ranking in a field with high PRRC infestation. The screening system allows to predict PRRC resistance for a given field site and offers a tool for selection at the seedling stage in breeding nurseries. Using the complexity of the infested field soil, the screening system provides opportunities to study plant resistance in the light of diverse plant-microbe interactions occurring in the rhizosphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000452341",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2020.542153","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/452341","en","Frontiers Media",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","damping-off||disease tolerance||foot rot||legumes||plant-microbe interactions||resistance breeding||root rot","Heritable Variation in Pea for Resistance Against a Root Rot Complex and Its Characterization by Amplicon Sequencing",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-23T03:51:12Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85094867695",,"000589705900001","Front.

However, much of the evidence for this relationship is drawn from biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments in which biodiversity loss is simulated by randomly assembling communities of varying species diversity, and ecosystem functions are measured. This random assembly has led some ecologists to question the relevance of biodiversity experiments to real-world ecosystems, where community assembly or disassembly may be non-random and influenced by external drivers, such as climate, soil conditions or land use. Here, we compare data from real-world grassland plant communities with data from two of the largest and longest-running grassland biodiversity experiments (the Jena Experiment in Germany and BioDIV in the United States) in terms of their taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity and functional-trait composition. We found that plant communities of biodiversity experiments cover almost all of the multivariate variation of the real-world communities, while also containing community types that are not currently observed in the real world. Moreover, they have greater variance in their compositional features than their real-world counterparts. We then re-analysed a subset of experimental data that included only ecologically realistic communities (that is, those comparable to real-world communities). For 10 out of 12 biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, biodiversity effects did not differ significantly between the full dataset of biodiversity experiments and the ecologically realistic subset of experimental communities. Although we do not provide direct evidence for strong or consistent biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships in real-world communities, our results demonstrate that the results of biodiversity experiments are largely insensitive to the exclusion of unrealistic communities and that the conclusions drawn from biodiversity experiments are generally robust. By comparing data from real-world grassland communities with data from two of the longest-running grassland biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments, the authors show that conclusions derived from experimental systems are robust to the removal of unrealistic experimental communities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000439001",,"2397-334X",,"10.1038/s41559-020-1280-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/439001","en","Nature",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"The results of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments are realistic",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-09-08T03:24:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85089742894",,"000562363700001","Nat Ecol Evol","11","Nature Ecology & Evolution","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Due to the co‐occurrence of multiple N2O transformation pathways, it is, however, challenging to use isotopic information to quantify the contribution of distinct processes across variable spatiotemporal scales. Here, we present an overview of recent progress in N2O isotopic studies and provide suggestions for future research, mainly focusing on: analytical techniques; production and consumption processes; and interpretation and modelling approaches.  Comparing isotope‐ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) with laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS), we conclude that IRMS is a precise technique for laboratory analysis of N2O isotopes, while LAS is more suitable for in situ/inline studies and offers advantages for site‐specific analyses. When reviewing the link between the N2O isotopic composition and underlying mechanisms/processes, we find that, at the molecular scale, the specific enzymes and mechanisms involved determine isotopic fractionation effects. In contrast, at plot‐to‐global scales, mixing of N2O derived from different processes and their isotopic variability must be considered. We also find that dual isotope plots are effective for semi‐quantitative attribution of co‐occurring N2O production and reduction processes. More recently, process‐based N2O isotopic models have been developed for natural abundance and 15N‐tracing studies, and have been shown to be effective, particularly for data with adequate temporal resolution.  Despite the significant progress made over the last decade, there is still great need and potential for future work, including development of analytical techniques, reference materials and inter‐laboratory comparisons, further exploration of N2O formation and destruction mechanisms, more observations across scales, and design and validation of interpretation and modelling approaches. Synthesizing all these efforts, we are confident that the N2O isotope community will continue to advance our understanding of N2O transformation processes in all spheres of the Earth, and in turn to gain improved constraints on regional and global budgets. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,"1097-0231||0951-4198",,"10.1002/rcm.8858","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/440187","en","Wiley",,,,,"What can we learn from N2O isotope data? – Analytics, processes and modelling",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-09-14T02:47:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85089159038",,"000571207200014","RCM, Rapid commun. mass spectrom.","20","Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The objective of this study was to determine simultaneously the uptake of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contained in organic and mineral fertilizers by sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench ] and soil microbial biomass. Double 15N and 33P direct and indirect labeling techniques were applied in a pot experiment to determine the contributions of different fertilizers to sorghum N and P uptake during 52 d of growth. In parallel, soil respiration, available, and microbial N and P were tracked in an incubation experiment. Sorghum derived 83–90% of P from fertilizers. Nitrogen from cattle manure was poorly available, contributing only 20% of the N taken up by sorghum. Water‐soluble mineral fertilizers increased soil N and P availability, resulting in the highest total N and P uptake by sorghum from fertilizers and soil among all treatments. The application of cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] residues induced microbial N and P immobilization, reducing sorghum N and P uptake to the level of the non‐fertilized treatment. The use of double 15N and 33P labeling elucidated the impact of fertilizers on soil nutrient pools. The low plant N/P ratio suggested N limitation for sorghum in the manure treatment. Cowpea residues were inefficient for sorghum nutrition, but they increased soil microbial nutrient pools. This study gives insights on the potential effects of legume residues used as green manure to build soil fertility.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000452133",,,,"10.1002/agg2.20111","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/452133","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Nitrogen and phosphorus uptake from isotope‐labeled fertilizers by sorghum and soil microorganisms",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-20T06:56:12Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","Agrosystems, Geosciences & Environment","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Flux measurements showed that at lower elevation sites (below 1000 m.a.s.l.; grassland and mixed forest) annual ecosystem productivity (GPP) declined by approximately 20% compared to the previous 2 years (2016 and 2017), which led to a reduced annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP). At the high elevation sites, however, GPP increased by approximately 14% and as a result NEP increased in the alpine and montane grasslands, but not in the subalpine coniferous forest. There, increased ecosystem respiration led to a reduced annual NEP, despite increased GPP and lengthening of the growing period. Among all ecosystems, the coniferous forest showed the most pronounced negative stomatal response to atmospheric dryness (i.e. vapour pressure deficit, VPD) that resulted in a decline in surface conductance and an increased water-use efficiency during drought. While increased temperature enhanced the water-use efficiency of both forests, de-coupling of GPP from evapotranspiration at the low-elevation grassland site negatively affected water-use efficiency due to non-stomatal reductions in photosynthesis. Our results show that hot droughts (such as in 2018) lead to different responses across plants types, and thus ecosystems. Particularly grasslands at lower elevations are the most vulnerable ecosystems to negative impacts of future drought in Switzerland.

However, those findings primarily rely on data from temperate regions with soil mineralogy, weathering status and climatic conditions that generally differ from tropical and sub-tropical regions.  We investigated soil properties and climate variables influencing SOC concentrations across sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 1,601 samples were analyzed, collected from two depths (0–20 cm and 20–50 cm) at 45 sentinel sites from 17 countries as part of the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project. The dataset spans climatic conditions from arid to humid and includes soils with a wide range of pHH20 values, weathering status, soil texture, exchangeable cations, extractable metals and a variety of important land cover types.  The most important SOC predictors were identified by linear mixed effects models, regression trees and random forest models. Our results indicate that SOC is primarily controlled by aridity index (PET/MAP), exchangeable calcium (Caex) and oxalate-extractable aluminum (Alox); this was found across both depth intervals. Oxalate-extractable iron (Feox) emerged as the most important predictor for both depth intervals in the regression tree and random forest analyses. However, its influence on SOC concentrations was strong only below Feox concentrations of 0.25 wt %. This suggests that Feox can act as a pedogenic threshold – even on a continental scale. Across model-ling approaches, clay and fine silt content (< 8 µm) and land cover were not significant SOC pre-dictors, in contrast to common assumptions.  Our findings indicate that the key controlling factors of SOC across sub-Saharan Africa are similar to what has been reported for temperate regions – except for soil texture and vegetation cover. However, the strength and importance of the controlling factors vary across the environmental gradient we studied.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460471",,,,"10.5194/soil-2020-69","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460471","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biogeochemistry||Land-use||Soil organic matter||Clay mineralogy||Pedogenic threshold","Continental-scale controls on soil organic carbon across sub-Saharan Africa",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2021-01-08T08:33:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Soil Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using observations from 34 eddy covariance sites in different biomes across Europe, we studied the sensitivity of gross primary productivity (GPP) to environmental drivers during the summer drought of 2018 versus the reference summer of 2016. We found a greater drought-induced decline of summer GPP in grasslands (−38%) than in forests (−10%), which coincided with reduced evapotranspiration and soil water content (SWC). As compared to the ‘normal year’ of 2016, GPP in different ecosystems exhibited more negative sensitivity to summer air temperature (Ta) but stronger positive sensitivity to SWC during summer drought in 2018, that is, a stronger reduction of GPP with soil moisture deficit. We found larger negative effects of Ta and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) but a lower positive effect of photosynthetic photon flux density on GPP in 2018 compared to 2016, which contributed to reduced summer GPP in 2018. Our results demonstrate that high temperature-induced increases in VPD and decreases in SWC aggravated drought impacts on GPP.

Here, we show that this morphing strategy and the synergy of the two morphing surfaces can notably improve the agility, maneuverability, stability, flight speed range, and required power of a drone in different flight regimes by means of an avian-inspired drone.

However, grassland-based roughage often lacks the energy content required to meet the productivity potential of modern livestock breeds. Forage legumes, such as red clover, with increased starch content could partly replace maize and cereal supplements. However, breeding for increased starch content requires efficient phenotyping methods. This study is unique in evaluating a non-destructive hyperspectral imaging approach to estimate leaf starch content in red clover for enabling efficient development of high starch red clover genotypes. We assessed prediction performance of partial least square regression models (PLSR) using cross-validation, and validated model performance with an independent test set under controlled conditions. Starch content of the training set ranged from 0.1 to 120.3 mg g–1 DW. The best cross-validated PLSR model explained 56% of the measured variation and yielded a root mean square error (RMSE) of 17 mg g–1 DW. Model performance decreased when applying the trained model on the independent test set (RMSE = 29 mg g–1 DW, R2 = 0.36). Different variable selection methods did not increase model performance. Once validated in the field, the non-destructive spectral method presented here has the potential to detect large differences in leaf starch content of red clover genotypes. Breeding material could be sampled and selected according to their starch content without destroying the plant.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000446056",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2020.569948","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446056","en","Frontiers Media",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","red clover||starch content||hyperspectral imaging||partial least square regression||forage quality||grassland","A Non-destructive Method to Quantify Leaf Starch Content in Red Clover",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-15T06:38:33Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85094600658",,"000584750800001","Front.

However, δ 18O analysis of sugars is prone to error, and thoroughly tested methods are lacking.   Methods We performed three experiments to test if sample preparation modifies the δ 18O values of sugars. In experiment 1, we tested the effects of oven‐drying versus freeze‐drying, whereas in experiment 2 we focused on the extraction and purification of leaf sugars. In experiment 3, we investigated the exudation and purification of twig phloem sugars as a function of exudation time and different ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) exudation media.   Results Freeze‐drying produced more consistent δ 18O values than oven‐drying for sucrose but not for phloem sugars. The extraction and purification of leaf sugars can be performed without a significant modification of their δ 18O values; yet the purified leaf and phloem sugars possessed higher δ 18O values than the fraction of water‐soluble compounds. Moreover, the exudation time significantly modulated the δ 18O values of phloem sugars, which is probably related to changes in the sugar composition. The addition of EDTA did not improve the determination of the δ 18O values of phloem sugars.   Conclusions We show that the sample preparation of plant sugars for the reliable determination of δ 18O values requires a strict protocol, which is described in this paper. For phloem sugar, we recommend a maximum exudation time of 1 h to reduce the degradation of sucrose and minimise oxygen isotope exchange reactions between the resulting hexoses and water.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000422097",,"1097-0231||0951-4198",,"10.1002/rcm.8854","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/422097","en","Wiley",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Assimilates||Foliar||Fructose||Glucose||Sucrose","Improving the extraction and purification of leaf and phloem sugars for oxygen isotope analyses",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-24T08:20:04Z","2021-06-07",,,"yes",,,,"iTREE-Long-term variability of tree growth in a changing environment - identifying physiological mechanisms using stable C and O isotopes in tree rings.","136295","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Sinergia",,,,"85090360352",,"000571215700013","RCM, Rapid commun. mass spectrom.","19","Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Dew and radiation fog occur in combination during clear and calm nights, and both use ambient water vapor as a source. Research on the combined mechanisms involved in NRW inputs to ecosystems are rare, and the condensation of soil-diffusing vapor, as one of the NRW input pathways for dew formation, has hardly been studied at all. The aim of this paper is thus to investigate the different NRW input pathways into a temperate Swiss grassland at Chamau during prolonged dry periods in summer 2018. We measured the isotopic compositions (δ18O, δ2H, and d = δ2H − 8 · δ18O) of both ambient water vapor and the NRW droplets on leaf surfaces combined with eddy covariance and meteorological measurements during one dew-only and two combined dew and radiation fog events. We employed a simple two end-member mixing model using δ18O and δ2H to split the dew input pathways from different sources. Our results showed a decrease of 0.8–5.5 mmol mol−1 in volumetric water vapor mixing ratio and a decrease of 4.8–16.7 ‰ in ambient water vapor δ2H due to dew formation and radiation fog droplet deposition. A nighttime maximum in ambient water vapor δ18O (−15.5 ‰ to −14.3 ‰) and a 3.4–3.7 ‰ decrease in ambient water vapor d were observed for dew formation in unsaturated conditions. In conditions of slight super-saturation, a stronger decrease of ambient water vapor δ18O (0.3–1.5 ‰) and a minimum of ambient water vapor d (−6.0 ‰ to −4.7 ‰) were observed. The combined foliage NRW and ambient water vapor δ18O and δ2H suggested two different input pathways: (1) condensation of ambient water vapor and (2) of soil-diffusing vapor. The latter contributed 9–42 % to the total foliage NRW. The dew and radiation fog potentially produced 0.06–0.39 mm night−1 NRW gain on foliage, which was comparable with 2.8 mm day−1 daytime evapotranspiration. The ambient water vapor d was correlated and anti-correlated with ambient temperature and ambient relative humidity respectively, suggesting an only minor influence of large-scale air advection and highlighted the dominant role of local moisture as a source for ambient water vapor. Our results thus highlight the importance of NRW inputs to temperate grasslands during prolonged dry periods and reveal the complexity of the local water cycle in such conditions including different pathways of water deposition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000445289",,"1812-2116||1812-2108",,"10.5194/hess-2020-493","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/445289","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The role of dew and radiation fog inputs in the local water cycling of a temperate grassland in Central Europe",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2020-10-09T12:17:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,"The importance of fog and dew for Swiss grasslands today and in the future (Acronym: IFDewS)","175733||175733||175733||175733||175733","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT||Projekte MINT||Projekte MINT",,,,,,,"Hydrol. earth syst. sci.",,"Hydrology and Earth System Sciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recovery of root and leaf functioning and prioritized C supply to sink tissues after drought may compensate for drought-induced reduction of assimilation and growth. It remains unclear if C allocation to sink tissues during and following drought is controlled by altered sink metabolic activities or by the availability of new assimilates. Understanding such mechanisms is required to predict forests’ resilience to a changing climate. We investigated the impact of drought and drought release on C allocation in a 100-y-old Scots pine forest. We applied 13CO2 pulse labeling to naturally dry control and long-term irrigated trees and tracked the fate of the label in above- and belowground C pools and fluxes. Allocation of new assimilates belowground was ca. 53% lower under nonirrigated conditions. A short rainfall event, which led to a temporary increase in the soil water content (SWC) in the topsoil, strongly increased the amounts of C transported belowground in the nonirrigated plots to values comparable to those in the irrigated plots. This switch in allocation patterns was congruent with a tipping point at around 15% SWC in the response of the respiratory activity of soil microbes. These results indicate that the metabolic sink activity in the rhizosphere and its modulation by soil moisture can drive C allocation within adult trees and ecosystems. Even a subtle increase in soil moisture can lead to a rapid recovery of belowground functions that in turn affects the direction of C transport in trees.",,,,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2014084117","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/442080","en","National Academy of Sciences",,,,"drought||drought release||13C pulse labeling||sink control","Rhizosphere activity in an old-growth forest reacts rapidly to changes in soil moisture and shapes whole-tree carbon allocation",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-09-23T10:08:04Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85092681339",,"000579014500015","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","40","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","117","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that increased P deficiency in the topsoil results in an increased microbial recycling of P from the forest subsoil. We sampled soils from four German temperate forest sites representing a gradient in total P stocks. We analyzed the oxygen isotopic composition of HCl-extractable phosphate (δ18OP) and identified differences in P speciation with increasing soil depth using X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. We further determined microbial oxygen demand with and without nutrient supply at different soil depths to analyse nutrient limitation of microbial growth and used nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) to visualize spatial P gradients in the rhizosphere. We found that δ18OP values in the topsoil of all sites were close to the isotopic signal imparted by biological cycling when oxygen isotopes in phosphate are exchanged by enzymatic activity. However, with increasing soil depth and increasing HCl-P concentrations, δ18Ο values continuously decreased towards values expected for primary minerals in parent material at depths below 60 cm at sites with high subsoil P stocks and below more than 2 m at sites with low subsoil P stocks, respectively. For these depths, XANES spectra also indicated the presence of apatite. NanoSIMS images showed an enrichment of P in the rhizosphere in the topsoil of a site with high P stocks, while this P enrichment was absent at a site with low P stocks and in both subsoils. Addition of C, N and P alone or in combination revealed that microbial activity in subsoils of sites with low P stocks was mostly P limited, whereas sites with high P stocks indicated N limitation or N and P co-limitation. We conclude that subsoil P resources are recycled by trees and soil microorganisms. With continued weathering of the bedrock and mobilisation of P from the weathered rocks, P cycling will proceed to greater depths, especially at sites characterised by P limitation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000445401",,"0168-2563||1573-515X",,"10.1007/s10533-020-00700-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/445401","en","Springer",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Oxygen isotopes||Phosphate||NanoSIMS||XANES||Microbial P cycling||Soil","Biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus in subsoils of temperate forest ecosystems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-10T02:54:08Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091464921",,"000574343500001","Biogeochemistry (Dordrecht)","3","Biogeochemistry","150","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Utilizing an origami approach, we have designed, prototyped and controlled the Ori-Pixel, a 3-DoFs parallel robot that can control its height, pitch and roll angles.

A diagnostic marker test enabled the identification of carrier animals, but the underlying causal mutation remains unknown. To identify the mutation underlying AMC, we collected SNP chip genotyping data for 11 affected piglets and 23 healthy pigs. Association testing using 47 829 SNPs confirmed that AMC maps to SSC5 (P = 9.4 × 10−13). Subsequent autozygosity mapping revealed a common 6.06 Mb region (from 66 757 970 to 72 815 151 bp) of extended homozygosity in 11 piglets affected by AMC. Using WGS data, we detected a 63‐bp insertion compatible with the recessive inheritance of AMC in the second exon of KIF21A gene encoding Kinesin Family Member 21A. The 63‐bp insertion is predicted to introduce a premature stop codon in KIF21A gene (p.Val41_Phe42insTer) that truncates 1614 amino acids (~97%) from the protein. We found that this deleterious allele still segregates at a frequency of 0.1% in the SLW pig population. Carrier animals can now be detected unambiguously and excluded from breeding.

Here, we determined the structure of root nodule bacterial communities of rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), a leguminous shrub endemic to South Africa. We related the community dissimilarities of the root nodule bacteria of 18 paired cultivated and wild rooibos populations to pairwise geographical distances, plant ecophysiological characteristics and soil physicochemical parameters. Using next-generation sequencing data, we identified region-, cultivation- and farm-specific operational taxonomic units for four distinct classes of root nodule bacterial communities, dominated by members of the genus Mesorhizobium. We found that while bacterial richness was locally increased by organic cultivation, strong biogeographical differentiation in the bacterial communities of wild rooibos disappeared with cultivation of one single cultivar across its entire cultivation range. This implies that expanding rooibos farming has the potential to endanger wild rooibos populations through the homogenisation of root nodule bacterial diversity. © FEMS 2020.",,,,"0168-6496||1574-6941",,"10.1093/femsec/fiaa145","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/442886","en","Oxford University Press",,,,,"Geographical patterns of root nodule bacterial diversity in cultivated and wild populations of a woody legume crop",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-09-26T19:50:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091191454",,"000581018800001","FEMS microbiol. ecol.","10","FEMS Microbiology Ecology","96","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using a resilience approach, the study sought to assess knowledge about risks perceived by actors, forms of learning that actors in food systems have access to and use, and how this knowledge and learning has contributed to adaptation and resilience build ing. Data were collected through questionnaires, interviews, farmer meetings, workshops, and participant observation. The target population was different groups of actors in agroindustrial food systems in both countries, a regional food system in Kenya and an agroecological food system in Bolivia. The results show that knowledge on threats came from the actors’ experience and interaction with external actors. The main risks identified in Kenya and Bolivia included climate change impacts – particularly extreme climatic events (floods and droughts) –, price fluctuation of food products, declining soil fertility, deforestation, and –in Kenya– human-wildlife conflicts, and conflicts between actors over resource use. The most important forms of learning were experiential learning through demonstration farms, social learning exemplified in group approaches, and learning at individual levels through information exchange between farmers and external actors such as extension personnel, research organisations and non-governmental organisations. There is potential to enhance adaptation strategies whose knowledge has been acquired over the years, to build resilient food systems necessary for dealing with current and future shocks and stress.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507397",,"1869-6945",,"10.18461/IJFSD.V11I4.57","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507397","en","International Journal on Food System Dynamics",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Food systems||Learning||Adaptation||Resilience||Global South","Learning and Adaptation in Food Systems: Insights from Four Case Studies in the Global South",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-09-28T09:50:34Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4","International Journal on Food System Dynamics","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Moderate shrub encroachment is perceived beneficial for plant diversity by adding new species without outcompeting existing ones, yet systematic evidence is missing. We surveyed vegetation along 24 transects from open pasture into shrubland across the Swiss Alps using a new protocol distinguishing different spatial scales, shrub cover of each plot (2 x 2 m) and larger-scale zonal cover along the transect. Data were analysed using generalized linear models of shrub cover, shrub species and environmental conditions, such as geology, aspect or soil. Most shrub communities were dominated byAlnus viridis(62% of transects) andPinus mugo(25%), and the rest by other shrub species (13%). These dominant shrub species explained vegetation response to shrub cover well, without need of environmental variables in the model. Compared to open pasture,A. viridisresulted in an immediate linear decline in plant species richness and a marginal increase in beta-diversity (maximally + 10% at 35% cover). DenseA. viridishosted 62% less species than open pasture. InP. mugo,species richness remained stable until 40% shrub cover and dropped thereafter; beta-diversity peaked at 35% cover. Hence, scatteredP. mugoincreases beta-diversity without impairing species richness. In transects dominated by other shrubs, species richness and beta-diversity peaked at 40-60% shrub cover (+ 23% both).A. viridisreduced species richness in a larger area around the shrubs thanP. mugo. Therefore, effects of shrub encroachment on plant diversity cannot be generalized and depend on dominant shrub species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000443282",,"1664-2201||1664-221X",,"10.1007/s00035-020-00241-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/443282","en","Springer",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biodiversity||Vegetation||Mountain||Succession||Shrub encroachment||Conservation","Dominant shrub species are a strong predictor of plant species diversity along subalpine pasture-shrub transects",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-09-29T03:27:08Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85090949113",,"000569293000001","Alp. bot.","2","Alpine Botany","130","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Cocoa agroforestry systems are supposed to improve the sustainability of cocoa production. However, their combined agronomic, ecological, and socio-economic performance compared to monocultures is still largely unknown. Here we present a meta-analysis of 52 articles that directly compared cocoa agroforestry systems and monocultures. Using an inductive, multi-dimensional approach, we analyzed the differences in cocoa and total system yield, economic performance, soil chemical and physical properties, incidence of pests and diseases, potential for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and biodiversity conservation. Cocoa agroforestry systems outcompeted monocultures in most indicators. Cocoa yields in agroforestry systems were 25% lower than in monocultures, but total system yields were about ten times higher, contributing to food security and diversified incomes. This finding was supported by a similar profitability of both production systems. Cocoa agroforestry contributed to climate change mitigation by storing 2.5 times more carbon and to adaptation by lowering mean temperatures and buffering temperature extremes. We found no significant differences in relation to the main soil parameters. The effect of the type of production system on disease incidence depended on the fungal species. The few available studies comparing biodiversity showed a higher biodiversity in cocoa agroforestry systems. Increased and specific knowledge on local tree selections and local socio-economic and environmental conditions, as well as building and enabling alternative markets for agroforestry products, could contribute to further adoption and sustainability of cocoa agroforestry systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000447166",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/abb053","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/447166","en","Institute of Physics",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","economic performance||system yield||pests and diseases||biodiversity||sustainability||theobroma cacao","Cocoa agroforestry systems versus monocultures: a multi-dimensional meta-analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-22T08:39:41Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85093099914",,"000576065000001","Environ.

Our study aims to capture the impact of the 2018 European heatwave on the terrestrial ecosystem through the lens of a high-resolution solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) data acquired from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite. SIF is proposed to be a direct proxy for gross primary productivity (GPP) and thus can be used to draw inferences about changes in photosynthetic activity in vegetation due to extreme events. We explore spatial and temporal SIF variation and anomaly in the spring and summer months across different vegetation types (agriculture, broadleaved forest, coniferous forest, and mixed forest) during the European heatwave of 2018 and compare it to non-drought conditions (most of Southern Europe). About one-third of Europe’s land area experienced a consecutive spring and summer drought in 2018. Comparing 2018 to mean conditions (i.e., those in 2015–2017), we found a change in the intra-spring season SIF dynamics for all vegetation types, with lower SIF during the start of spring, followed by an increase in fluorescence from mid-April. Summer, however, showed a significant decrease in SIF. Our results show that particularly agricultural areas were severely affected by the hotter drought of 2018. Furthermore, the intense heat wave in Central Europe showed about a 31% decrease in SIF values during July and August as compared to the mean over the previous three years. Furthermore, our MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and OCO-2 comparative results indicate that especially for coniferous and mixed forests, OCO-2 SIF has a quicker response and a possible higher sensitivity to drought in comparison to MODIS’s fPAR (fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) when considering shorter reference periods, which highlights the added value of remotely sensed solar-induced fluorescence for studying the impact of drought on vegetation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000447705",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs12193249","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/447705","en","MDPI",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","chlorophyll fluorescence||remote sensing||ecosystems||spring–summer||forest","Capturing the impact of the 2018 european drought and heat across different vegetation types using OCO-2 solar-induced fluorescence",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-25T03:14:35Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85092762842",,"000586682500001","Remote Sens.","19","Remote Sensing","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We present a novel method to quantify FLS extent bias by comparing forecasts with satellite observations. Evaluating a four-month period, we show that COSMO-1, the MeteoSwiss high-resolution operational model, exhibits a considerable negative FLS bias during wintertime. To study the cause, we conduct a series of sensitivity experiments for a representative case study, where COSMO-1 dissipated extensive FLS erroneously. Replacing the one-moment bulk microphysics parameterisation scheme by a two-moment scheme, as well as increasing the number of vertical levels, did not show any improvements. The FLS dissipation was delayed (but not prevented) by decreasing the lower bound imposed on the turbulent diffusion coefficients from 0.4 to 0.01 m(2)center dot s(-1), or by reducing horizontal grid spacing from 1.1 km to 550 m. Additionally, simulations at 1.1-km grid spacing with smoothed orography led to more extensive FLS than the same simulations without smoothed orography. An analysis of the cloud water budget revealed that the model's advection scheme is causing a loss of liquid water content near the cloud top. A simulation with an alternative terrain-following coordinate system, in which the vertical coordinates are quasihorizontal near the cloud top, reduced the loss of cloud water through advection and improved the evolution of FLS in the case study. In combination, our findings suggest that the advection scheme exhibits numerical diffusion, which promotes spurious mixing in the vertical of cloudy and adjacent cloud-free grid cells in terrain-following vertical coordinates; this process can become the root cause for too rapid dissipation of FLS during nighttime in complex terrain.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438688",,"0035-9009||1477-870X",,"10.1002/qj.3849","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438688","en","John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Complex terrain||Mist/Fog/Visibility||Numerical methods and NWP||Physical phenomenon||Satellite observations||Sensitivity study||Tools and methods","Identifying the key challenges for fog and low stratus forecasting in complex terrain",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-09-06T12:43:21Z","2021-06-16",,,"yes",,,,"Towards an operational fog forecasting system (Fog4Cast)","ETH-17 16-2||ETH-17 16-2","10.13039/501100003006||10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ||ETHZ","ETH Grants||ETH Grants",,,,"85089752989",,"000562009100001","Q.

Yet, the different evolutionary mechanisms, and their envi-ronmental drivers, by which certain populations become more drought tolerant than others is still little understood. We studied adaptation to drought in 16 silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) populations from the French Mediterranean Alps by combining observa-tions on seedlings from a greenhouse experiment (N =  8,199) and on adult tress in situ (N  =  315). In the greenhouse, we followed half-sib families for four growing seasons for growth and phenology traits, and tested their water stress response in a ""drought until death"" experiment. Adult trees in the field were assessed for δ13C, a proxy for water use efficiency, and genotyped at 357 SNP loci. SNP data was used to gen-erate a null expectation for seedling trait divergence between populations in order to detect the signature of selection, and 31 environmental variables were used to identify the selective environment. We found that seedlings originating from popula-tions with low soil water capacity grew more slowly, attained a smaller stature, and resisted water stress for a longer period of time in the greenhouse. Additionally, adult trees of these populations exhibited a higher water use efficiency as evidenced by their δ13C. These results suggest a correlated evolution of the growth-drought toler-ance trait complex. Population divergence in bud break phenology was adaptive only in the second growing season, and evolved independently from the growth-drought tolerance trait complex. Adaptive divergence in bud break phenology was principally driven by the inter- and intra-annual variation in temperature at the geographic origin of the population. Our results illustrate the different evolutionary strategies used by populations to cope with drought stress at the range limits across a highly heteroge-neous landscape, and can be used to inform assisted migration programs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000420862",,"1752-4571||1752-4563",,"10.1111/eva.13029","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/420862","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Adaptive divergence||Assisted migration||Climate change||Demography||Drought tolerance||Phenology||Quantitative genetics||δ13C","Adaptation to drought is coupled with slow growth, but independent from phenology in marginal silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) populations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-17T09:36:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85087606639",,"000540462300001","Evol.

They arose through the symbiotic integration of a prokaryotic cell into an eukaryotic host cell and still contain their own genomes with distinct genomic information. Plastid genomes accommodate essential genes and are regularly utilized in biotechnology or phylogenetics. Different assemblers that are able to assess the plastid genome have been developed. These assemblers often use data of whole genome sequencing experiments, which usually contain reads from the complete chloroplast genome.  Results The performance of different assembly tools has never been systematically compared. Here, we present a benchmark of seven chloroplast assembly tools, capable of succeeding in more than 60% of known real data sets. Our results show significant differences between the tested assemblers in terms of generating whole chloroplast genome sequences and computational requirements. The examination of 105 data sets from species with unknown plastid genomes leads to the assembly of 20 novel chloroplast genomes.  Conclusions We create docker images for each tested tool that are freely available for the scientific community and ensure reproducibility of the analyses. These containers allow the analysis and screening of data sets for chloroplast genomes using standard computational infrastructure. Thus, large scale screening for chloroplasts within genomic sequencing data is feasible.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000444131",,"1474-760X",,"10.1186/s13059-020-02153-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444131","en","BioMed Central",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A systematic comparison of chloroplast genome assembly tools",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-02T07:26:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"81314093",,,,,"Genome Biol",,"Genome Biology","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Regardless of the crop, the basic principle of plant breeding always remains the same: it is based on genetic diversity, which either arose naturally or was created by humans using various methods. The resulting plants are then characterised in detail, evaluated in the field over many years, and ultimately registered in the catalogue of varieties after being officially approved. Over the past decades, the range of methods available for plant breeding has continually been extended. Mutation breeding can be used to increase genetic diversity, and genetic engineering makes it possible to introduce genes across the species barrier. Genome editing, the latest set of tools, can be used to make directed changes at a specific position in the genome of a crop species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000447313",,,,"10.5281/zenodo.4044173","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/447313","en","Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Plant breeding - from cross breeding to genome editing",,"Other Publication","Open access",,,"2020-10-22T13:56:13Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3","Swiss Academies Factsheets","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We present LWFBrook90R, an enhanced implementation of the well-established, process-based SVAT model LWF-Brook90 for the R environment for statistical computing. The package provides new functions and sub-models for model parameterization, and facilitates parallel computing, sensitivity analysis and inverse calibration of the model. A case study comprising i) basic forward water balance simulations for temperate grassland vegetation, deciduous and evergreen forest, ii) a parallelized sensitivity analysis, and iii) Bayesian calibrations based on soil water storage observed in a poplar (Populus nigra × P. maximowiczii) Short Rotation Forest (SRF) demonstrates the utility of the R package. The sensitivity analysis revealed parameters affecting plant-available soil water storage capacity and the vegetation's timing and level of water demand to be most important for the annual course of simulated soil water storage, with seasonal and interannual differences in parameter importance rankings. The subsequent calibration yielded a very high agreement between daily simulated and observed soil water storage (0-200 cm soil depth) for the calibration and validation datasets, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of 0.97 and 0.95, respectively. The final model predicted high though realistic rates of annual evapotranspiration (2011: 844 ± 3.8 mm y-1, 2012: 733 ± 4.5 mm y-1) for the poplar SRF, regularly exceeding grass reference evaporation (ET0) by 20-47% during the months of the growing season. However, basing calibrations solely on observed soil water storage probably resulted in biased partitioning of evapotranspiration towards interception losses. The integration of the LWF-Brook90 hydrological model into R with its wide variety of extensions was successfully tested and may provide efficient, reliable and reproducible water balance predictions by facilitating complex statistical analyses and large-scale applications of the model.",,,,"0168-1923||1873-2240",,"10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.108023","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/417994","en","Elsevier",,,,"Climate impact||Water balance||Evapotranspiration||Model calibration||Sensitivity analysis||Short rotation","Advancing simulations of water fluxes, soil moisture and drought stress by using the LWF-Brook90 hydrological model in R",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-06-03T15:48:37Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85085556468",,"000556177600004","Agric. for. meteorol.",,"Agricultural and Forest Meteorology","291","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Nevertheless, methods to monitor the intrinsically hard-to-phenotype early development of wheat are yet rare. We aimed to develop proxy measures for the rate of plant emergence, the number of tillers, and the beginning of stem elongation using drone-based imagery. We used RGB images (ground sampling distance of 3 mm pixel-1) acquired by repeated flights (≥ 2 flights per week) to quantify temporal changes of visible leaf area. To exploit the information contained in the multitude of viewing angles within the RGB images, we processed them to multiview ground cover images showing plant pixel fractions. Based on these images, we trained a support vector machine for the beginning of stem elongation (GS30). Using the GS30 as key point, we subsequently extracted plant and tiller counts using a watershed algorithm and growth modeling, respectively. Our results show that determination coefficients of predictions are moderate for plant count (R 2 = 0:52), but strong for tiller count (R 2 = 0:86) and GS30 (R 2 = 0:77). Heritabilities are superior to manual measurements for plant count and tiller count, but inferior for GS30 measurements. Increasing the selection intensity due to throughput may overcome this limitation. Multiview image traits can replace hand measurements with high efficiency (85-223%). We therefore conclude that multiview images have a high potential to become a standard tool in plant phenomics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000439415",,,,"10.34133/2020/3729715","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/439415","en","AAAS",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Repeated Multiview Imaging for Estimating Seedling Tiller Counts of Wheat Genotypes Using Drones",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-09-09T15:06:32Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"79986402",,,,,,,"Plant Phenomics","2020","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Progeny testing procedures of half-sib families can only measure general combining ability (GCA) due to the unknown pollen donor. In tall fescue, genetic studies using HS mating and application of molecular markers for paternity identification in polycross progenies are so far limited. In this study, 960 genotypes from sixteen half-sib families of tall fescue derived from polycrosses, along with their corresponding parental genotypes were evaluated for agro-morphological traits in the field during 2016 and 2017. Genetic diversity of the parental genotypes was assessed using twenty EST-SSR markers and then a minimal set of primers was used to identify the most likely male parent in the polycross progenies. Considerable genetic variation was observed among the parental genotypes based on both morphological and molecular assessments. Moderate to high estimates of narrow sense heritability (0.53–0.84) for morphological traits indicated that phenotypic selection can be successful to achieve genetic progress. The EST-SSR markers allowed to identify a unique paternal parent in 177 of the offspring which were divided into 66 full-sib families. The number of genotypes per full-sib family varied from 1 to 11. Marker data used to identify full-sib families, estimate specific combining ability (SCA), and select siblings based on the genetic value of both parents. No clear association was found between GCA of parents and the corresponding SCA for forage yield, indicating that both additive and dominant gene actions may play a role in the genetic control of this trait. The obtained results highlighted the importance of marker-based paternity identification to increase gain from selection in polycross breeding programs of tall fescue. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",,,,"0014-2336||1573-5060",,"10.1007/s10681-020-02671-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432189","en","Springer",,,,"Polycross||Tall fescue||Genetic analysis||Paternity testing||EST-SSR marker","Enhanced polycross breeding of tall fescue through marker-based paternity identification and estimation of combining ability",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-08-21T03:18:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85089394107",,"000560196500001","Euphytica (Wagening.)","9","Euphytica","216","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Based on the FLUXNET2015 Dataset, we found that relative humidity (RH) is a more important driver of ET than temperature. While actual ET decrease at reduced RH, potential ET increases, consistently with the complementary relationship (CR) framework stating that the fraction of energy not used for actual ET is dissipated as increased sensible heat flux that in turn increases potential ET. In this study, we proposed an improved CR formulation requiring no parameter calibration and assessed its reliability in estimating ET both at site-level with the FLUXNET2015 Dataset and at basin-level. Using the ERA-Interim meteorological dataset for 1979-2017 to calculate ET, we found that the global terrestrial ET showed an increasing trend until 1998, while the trend started to decline afterwards. Such decline was largely associated with a reduced RH, inducing water stress conditions that triggered stomatal closure to conserve water. For the first time, this study quantified the global-scale implications of changes in RH on terrestrial ET, indicating that the temperature-driven acceleration of the terrestrial water cycle will be likely constrained by terrestrial vegetation feedbacks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000440992",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab9967","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/440992","en","IOP Publishing",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","terrestrial evapotranspiration||relative humidity||global warming||stomata regulation","Stomatal response to decreased relative humidity constrains the acceleration of terrestrial evapotranspiration",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-09-17T12:02:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,"ICOS-CH Phase 2","173691","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,,"85091159611",,"000565753300001","Environ.

The factors determining richness and composition of seed mycobiomes are poorly understood, but might be an important determinant for tree health. We assessed the relative impact of host identity, site, several site-specific environmental factors, and whether the host was sampled in its native or non-native distribution range, on the richness and composition of fungal seed endophytes of nine tree species across 15 sites in Europe and North America. Our results show that fungal richness was affected by host identity, but not by environmental variables or host distribution range. Fungal community composition was primarily driven by host identity, and to a lesser extent by environment. Around 25% of the 2147 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were generalists appearing on both continents and in both gymnosperms and angiosperms. Around 63% of the ASVs appeared in only gymnosperms or angiosperms, and 33% of the ASVs were associated with a single host species, while none were found in all tree species. Our results suggest that although seed trade might facilitate movements of fungi, their establishment and spread in the new environment might be limited by host availability. © FEMS 2020.",,,,"0168-6496||1574-6941",,"10.1093/femsec/fiaa166","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/439495","en","Oxford University Press",,,,"plant pathogens||seed-associated fungi||host affinity||site affinity||distribution range||climatic factors","Drivers of richness and community composition of fungal endophytes of tree seeds",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-09-10T05:49:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85090176755",,"000575458400020","FEMS microbiol. ecol.","9","FEMS Microbiology Ecology","96","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The Nile Delta has significant anthropogenic emissions of CO2 from urban areas and irrigated farming. It is surrounded by the Sahara desert and the Mediterranean Sea, minimizing the confounding influence of CO2 sources in surrounding areas. We compiled the observed spatial and temporal variations of XCO2 in the Nile Delta region (XCO2,del), and found that values for XCO2,del were on average 1.1 ppm higher than XCO2,des (mean XCO2 in desert area). We modelled the expected enhancements of XCO2 over the Nile Delta based on two global CO2 emission inventories, EDGAR and ODIAC. Modelled XCO2 enhancements were much lower, indicating underestimation of CO2 emissions in the Nile Delta region by mean factors of 4.5 and 3.4 for EDGAR and ODIAC, respectively. Furthermore, we captured a seasonal pattern of XCO2 enhancement (ΔXCO2), with significantly lower ΔXCO2 during the summer agriculture season in comparison to other seasons. Additionally, we used solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) measurement from OCO-2 to understand how the CO2 emissions are related to agricultural activities. Finally, we estimated an average emission of CO2 from the Nile Delta from 2014–2019 of 470 Mt CO2/year, about 1% of global anthropogenic emissions, which is significantly more than estimated hitherto.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000422142",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab9cfe","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/422142","en","Institute of Physics",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Anthropogenic CO2 emissions assessment of Nile Delta using XCO2 and SIF data from OCO-2 satellite",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-24T09:53:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091674787",,"000570723800001","Environ.

The global food system is one of the main contributors to climate change, biodiversity and ecosystem service loss, human health and animal welfare issues, as well as to insufficient livelihood conditions along the entire food supply chain. Creating a common, transparent standard for identifying food system impacts, their measurement and cost to society is key for the transformation towards a sustainable and resilient food system. By proposing a concrete methodology to calculate the true cost of food and applying it to Switzerland, this thesis aims to contribute to the discussion and highlight its importance.  The methodology defined assesses food system impacts on natural resources, livelihoods, human health, economy and animal welfare. 100 externalities were collected across all of these areas, of which 28 were prioritized based on their relevance and feasibility to be quantified. The true cost of (i) the national Swiss food system and (ii) eight conventionally produced Swiss products (apple, potato, carrot, wheat, milk, cheese, chicken and beef) is then approximated based on the prioritized externalities. This results in (i) national level external costs of 0.87 (0.61 - 1.12) CHF per CHF spent. Total national level costs amount to 70 (60 - 79) billion CHF, i.e. the sum of 37 billion CHF of national food expenditure and 33 (23-42) billion CHF of external costs. The latter are driven by human health, (14.8 billion CHF) and biodiversity (10.4 billion CHF) costs, with livelihood costs underestimated due to limited data availability. On a product level (ii), based only on environment, biodiversity and human health costs, cheese, chicken, and beef cause the highest external costs: 0.20 CHF (53% higher than retail price), 0.49 CHF (+38%) and 2.14 CHF (+125%) per 100 kcal, respectively.  The results illustrate the urgency of Swiss food system transformation. This is evident despite an underestimation of true costs by focusing on only 28 externalities, limited data availability and data accessibility. Swiss food system stakeholders are called to design a food system where sustainable choices are facilitated and incentivized along the entire supply chain. Based on both a transparent standard for measuring food system impacts and focusing on increasing consumer awareness, two things in particular should be strived for. First, reducing external costs of the current food system, e.g. by reducing food waste. Second – more crucially –, reducing external costs by shifting current production and consumption patterns. This includes redirecting agricultural support from products with high external costs, such as intensively farmed beef, to products with low external costs.  In 2021, the United Nations will host a Food Systems Summit targeting food system transformation. Switzerland could play a key role in this transformation by co-creating an improved methodology for measuring food system impacts with all relevant stakeholders. Food system transformation, based on measurable and transparent targets, both in terms of food system costs and benefits, represents an unmissable opportunity for achieving sustainable development, and now is the time to take it.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000473289",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473289","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","True Cost of Food||Food System Transformation||Sustainable Food Systems","Moving Towards a Sustainable Swiss Food System: An Estimation of the True Cost of Food in Switzerland and Implications for Stakeholders",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2021-03-07T16:12:02Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We conducted a meta-analysis on experimental data to evaluate the contributions of combining organic and mineral nitrogen (N) applications to the three pillars of CSA for maize (Zea mays). Linear mixed effect modeling was carried out for; (i) grain productivity and agronomic efficiency of N (AE) inputs, (ii) inter-seasonal yield variability, and (iii) changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) content, while accounting for the quality of organic amendments and total N rates. Results showed that combined application of mineral and organic fertilizers leads to greater responses in productivity and AE as compared to sole applications when more than 100 kg N ha-1 is used with high-quality organic matter. For yield variability and SOC, no significant interactions were found when combining mineral and organic fertilizers. The variability of maize yields in soils amended with high-quality organic matter, except manure, was equal or smaller than for sole mineral fertilizer. Increases of SOC were only significant for organic inputs, and more pronounced for high-quality resources. For example, at a total N rate of 150 kg N ha-1 season-1, combining mineral fertilizer with the highest quality organic resources (50:50) increased AE by 20% and reduced SOC losses by 18% over 7 growing seasons as compared to sole mineral fertilizer. We conclude that combining organic and mineral N fertilizers can have significant positive effects on productivity and AE, but only improves the other two CSA pillars yield variability and SOC depending on organic resource input and quality. The findings of our meta-analysis help to tailor a climate smart integrated soil fertility management in SSA.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000445180",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0239552","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/445180","en","Public Library of Science",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Combining organic and mineral fertilizers as a climate-smart integrated soil fertility management practice in sub-Saharan Africa: A meta-analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-09T03:04:35Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091622391",,"000576265600041","PLoS ONE","9","PLoS ONE","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Methods and Results In the laboratory, BCAs were applied against F. graminearum on maize stalk pieces. Clonostachys rosea inhibited the perithecia development and ascospore discharge when applied before, simultaneously with and after the pathogen. In the field, we simulated a system with high disease pressure, that is, a maize‐wheat rotation under no‐tillage, by preparing maize stalks inoculated with F. graminearum. The infected stalks were treated with formulations of C. rosea selected in vitro or the commercial BCA strain Trichoderma atrobrunneum ITEM908 and exposed to field conditions over winter and spring between winter wheat rows. Monitoring with spore traps and of FHB symptoms, as well as quantification of F. graminearum incidence and DNA in harvested grain revealed significant reductions by C. rosea by up to 85, 91, 69 and 95% compared with an inoculated but untreated positive control, respectively. Deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN) contents were reduced by up to 93 and 98%, respectively. Treatments with T. atrobrunneum were inconsistent, with significant reductions of DON and ZEN under warm and wet climatic conditions only.  Conclusions The findings support the application of C. rosea against F. graminearum on residues of maize to suppress the primary inoculum of FHB.  Significance and Impact of the Study As sustainable agriculture requires solutions to control FHB, hence, the application of C. rosea during the mulching of maize crop residues should be evaluated in on‐farm experiments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000410963",,"1364-5072||1365-2672",,"10.1111/jam.14634","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/410963","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"From laboratory to the field: biological control of Fusarium graminearum on infected maize crop residues",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-04-21T13:27:46Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85083459769",,"000526155900001","J. appl. microbiol.

The extracts obtained with the most efficient solvents (tannins: 75% water and 25% methanol; saponins: pure methanol) were then used in vitro. The treatments consisted of two substrate types (high-forage (HF) or high-concentrate (HC) diets) and five extract combinations (tannins: saponins, 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 0:1) added at 2 mg/mL in incubation liquid. In vitro incubation was performed in four runs, with each treatment being represented with two replicates per run. The addition of plant extracts rich in tannins and saponins, either individually or in combination, decreased the methane proportion of total gas in both the HF (p < 0.05) and HC (p < 0.05) diets. The effects of the plant extracts rich in tannins and saponins were generally additive in mitigating methane emissions. Favorable associative effects between the extracts were observed in the ammonia concentration, both in the HF (p < 0.001) and HC (p < 0.01) diets and in the methane proportion of total gas, with a 1:3 mixture of tannins and saponins added to the HC diet (p < 0.05).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000437409",,"2076-2615",,"10.3390/ani10091531","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/437409","en","MDPI",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Plant secondary compounds||Methanogenesis||Nitrogen||Ruminants","Combination Effects of Plant Extracts Rich in Tannins and Saponins as Feed Additives for Mitigating in Vitro Ruminal Methane and Ammonia Formation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-08-31T06:39:02Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85093878311",,"000580767800001",,"9","Animals","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We used the DayCent model to predict regional N inputs, outputs, and balances of Swiss soils under (1) a range of N fertilizer input levels (0–300% of recommended crop-specific rates) and (2) organic fertilization, reduced tillage or cover cropping at the recommended input of N. The crops included wheat, maize, and root/tuber crops and legumes. Decreasing N inputs reduced the environmental impact by 13.5–51.3 kg N ha- 1, but it also reduced the yield by 6.8–44.8 kg N ha- 1. Increasing N inputs led to an increase in yield by 5.6–29.5 kg N ha- 1, but with additional losses of 14.9–181.8 kg N ha- 1 into the environment. Harvested crop N and NO3- leaching accounted for 30–59% and 27–62% of fertilizer-derived changes in total N output, respectively. Converting conventional to organic cropping led to a mean increase in soil N balance by 0.3–62.6 kg N ha- 1. The soil N balance increased the most by using partially decomposed organic fertilizer in combination with cover cropping and reduced tillage. However, this positive N balance was mainly due to a reduction in N removal with harvest and NO3- leaching. The use of highly decomposable organic matter and cover cropping did not lead to any N yield penalty while decreasing NO3- leaching. These results highlight that organic practices combined with reduced tillage and cover cropping can optimize the use and recovery of N resources. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",,,,"1385-1314||1573-0867",,"10.1007/s10705-020-10078-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/425955","en","Springer",,,,"Soil N balance||N loss||N leaching and N2O emissions||Crop N fixation||Regional simulation","Simulation of a regional soil nitrogen balance in Swiss croplands",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-07-12T04:08:51Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85087382939",,"000543613100001","Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst",,"Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems","118","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We investigated the effect of diffuse light on photosynthesis over a gradient of diffuse light fractions ranging from 100% diffuse (overcast sky) to 11% diffuse light (clear‐sky conditions). Gross primary productivity (GPP) increased with diffuse fraction and thus was greater under diffuse than direct light conditions if the absolute photon flux density per unit surface area was kept constant. Mean leaf tilt angle (MTA) and canopy height were found to be the best predictors of the diffuse versus direct radiation effect on photosynthesis. Climatic factors, such as the drought index and growing degree days (GDD), had a significant influence on initial quantum yield under direct but not diffuse light conditions, which depended primarily on MTA. The maximum photosynthetic rate at 2,000 µmol m−2 s−1 photosynthetically active radiation under direct conditions strongly depended on GDD, MTA, leaf area index (LAI) and the interaction between MTA and LAI, while under diffuse conditions, this parameter depended mostly on MTA and only to a minor extent on canopy height and their interaction. The strongest photosynthesis enhancement under diffuse light was found for wheat, barley and rapeseed, whereas the lowest was for pea. Thus, we suggest that measuring canopy architecture and diffuse radiation will greatly improve GPP estimates of global cropping systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000423456",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15226","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/423456","en","John Wiley & Sons",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","absorbed radiation||agriculture||diffuse radiation||eddy‐covariance||gross primary production||leaf area index||photosynthesis enhancement||photosynthetic active radiation","Canopy photosynthesis of six major arable crops is enhanced under diffuse light due to canopy architecture",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-28T02:41:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,"The role of diffuse radiation for a long-term arable crop rotation at Oensingen, Switzerland (Acronym: DiRad Oensingen)","146373","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,"85087939302",,"000548687700001","Glob.

This indicates a large potential to adapt to different soil conditions over long time periods. Recent changes in tree mineral nutrition across Europe raise the question to what degree beech can acclimate to changing soil conditions in the short term. In this study, we aimed at assessing the plasticity of root traits and rhizosphere properties of young beech trees from populations that are adapted to either high or low nutrient supply, when growing in soils differing in their fertility. We sampled beech saplings from two forest sites of contrasting nutrient supply, most distinctly in terms of phosphorus. We grew them for 2 years in rhizoboxes in mineral soil either from their own site or from the other site. We assessed the influence of the factors “plant origin” and “current soil” on root traits and rhizosphere properties. Fine root traits related to growth (biomass, length), architecture (branching), and morphology (diameter) responded strongly to the factor “current soil.” Provenance (factor “plant origin”) modified the response. The modifying effect was consistent with an influence of the plant status in those nutrients, which were not in sufficient supply in the soil. An additional genotypic difference in the sensitivity of the beech saplings to different soil nutrient supply could not be excluded. Fine root parameters normalized for length, mass, or volume (root tip density and frequency, specific root length and area, and root tissue density) did not differ among the treatments. Differences in percentage of mycorrhizal root tips and rhizosphere parameters related to phosphorus mobilization potential (pH, abundance of organic acid anions, and phosphatase activity) were small and mainly determined by the “current soil.” Provenance had only a minor modifying effect, possibly due to differences in the ability of the plants to transfer carbon compounds from the shoot to the root and the fungal partner. Our results indicate a high plasticity of young beech trees to adapt their root system to different soil nutrient supply, thereby also taking into account internal nutrient reserves.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460452",,"2624-893X",,"10.3389/ffgc.2020.535117","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460452","en","Frontiers Media",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Root growth||Root architecture||Root morphology||Mycorrhizal colonization||Rhizosphere||Potential phosphatase activity||Organic acid anions||Acid forest soils","Plant nutritional status explains the modifying effect of provenance on the response of beech sapling root traits to differences in soil nutrient supply",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-08T08:13:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85106189404",,"000576473500001",,,"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Several studies have developed methods for wheat head detection from high-resolution RGB imagery based on machine learning algorithms. However, these methods have generally been calibrated and validated on limited datasets. High variability in observational conditions, genotypic differences, development stages, and head orientation makes wheat head detection a challenge for computer vision. Further, possible blurring due to motion or wind and overlap between heads for dense populations make this task even more complex. Through a joint international collaborative effort, we have built a large, diverse, and well-labelled dataset of wheat images, called the Global Wheat Head Detection (GWHD) dataset. It contains 4700 high-resolution RGB images and 190000 labelled wheat heads collected from several countries around the world at different growth stages with a wide range of genotypes. Guidelines for image acquisition, associating minimum metadata to respect FAIR principles, and consistent head labelling methods are proposed when developing new head detection datasets.

We find that the aggregated public interest in pesticides and plant protection products has increased substantially in recent years, especially since 2017. This trend can be attributed to search terms related to pesticides, while the interest in search terms related to plant protection products remained stable. Since the term 'pesticides' has a more negative connotation than 'plant protection products', the increased public interest might be linked to a higher negative perception of environment and human health impacts of pesticides. We also find evidence which supports the hypothesis that growing public concerns on pesticide use contributed to the launches of two popular initiatives aiming to restrict pesticide use in Switzerland. At the same time, our results support that the launch of these initiatives amplified public concerns regarding pesticides. We conclude that Google Trends is a useful tool for the timely detection of ongoing environmental and agricultural discussions, which might otherwise be unobserved. Therefore, it can generate helpful insights and contribute to agricultural policy problem framing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000431866",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab9af5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/431866","en","The Electrochemical Society",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Tracking societal concerns on pesticides – a Google Trends analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-08-18T09:12:30Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091975609",,"000563247300001","Environ.

In cranberries, phytoplasma infection causes false blossom disease, which is vectored by blunt-nosed leafhoppers (Limotettix vaccinii Van Duzee). We explored how phytoplasma infection of vegetative cranberry tissues affects the developmental performance and host preferences of L. vaccinii, and compared volatile emissions and phytohormone levels of infected and uninfected plants. In no-choice performance assays, L. vaccinii survival was similar on infected and uninfected cranberry plants. However, nymphs on infected plants took longer to reach adulthood, and produced larger adults, than those on uninfected plants. In oviposition tests, L. vaccinii females laid more eggs on uninfected than phytoplasma-infected cranberry plants. Olfactometer studies revealed preferences of L. vaccinii nymphs and adults for odors of uninfected plants when compared to clean air but not when compared to infected plants. Uninfected plants emitted higher amounts of volatiles than infected plants, particularly (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1, 3, 7-nonatriene, dodecane, and germacrene-D; however, we observed no effect of infection on phytohormone levels. Overall, our data show an oviposition preference of L. vaccinii for healthy plants, whereas our attraction data show no preference between infected and uninfected plants. While slower development on phytoplasma-infected cranberry plants led to larger adult size, there was no evidence for any beneficial effects of infection on other L. vaccinii performance parameters. Results from these studies are of relevance to understand tripartite plant-phytoplasma-insect vector interactions and are discussed in the context of the vector manipulation hypothesis. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,,,"0098-0331||1573-1561",,"10.1007/s10886-019-01137-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432233","en","Springer",,,,"Vaccinium macrocarpon||Blunt-nosed leafhoppers||No-choice tests||Olfactometer assays||Volatile compounds||Phytohormones","Phytoplasma Infection of Cranberry Affects Development and Oviposition, but Not Host-Plant Selection, of the Insect Vector Limotettix vaccinii",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-08-22T02:56:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85076930388",,"000561062100009","J.

Therefore, part-time grazing combined with indoor feeding of fresh herbage (‘cut-and-carry’) allows to maintain the advantages of fresh-herbage-based diets. However, consequences for environmental nitrogen losses, animal behaviour and ruminal metabolism are decisive for its implementation. Animal performance, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), reticulo-ruminal pH and feeding/locomotive behaviour were compared in six cows subjected either to full-time grazing (system F) or to part-time grazing system with indoor feeding of fresh herbage and concentrate (system P). Biweekly samplings were performed on six lactating cows per treatment in spring, summer and autumn. Nitrogen (N) balance was calculated from estimated N intake and N output via faeces, urine and milk. Reticulo-ruminal pH was recorded using a wireless data recorder. Eating and locomotive behaviour were measured with noseband sensors and pedometers. In spring, but not later, herbage intake per unit of body weight was higher for system F compared to system P cows. Eating time was shorter by 15% in P compared to F cows. Across systems, NUE declined from spring to summer/autumn from about 300 to 200 g milk protein N/kg N intake. Reticulo-ruminal pH was more variable under part-time grazing conditions, with a pronounced decrease subsequent to offering the herbage indoors. The part-time grazing system resulted in similar or higher NUE than full-time grazing.

Four diets differing in forage type but with equal estimated milk production potential and a forage:concentrate ratio of 0.85 : 0.15 were compared regarding their effect on feed intake, milk yield and milk properties. The forages tested were hay, grass silage, conventional short-chopped and long-chopped maize silage subjected to a novel processing technology (Shredlage®). Twenty-four dairy cows were fed two of the four diets in two consecutive runs in an incomplete (4 × 2) Latin-square design (n = 12 per diet). Each experimental period lasted 22 d, with 12 d of adaptation and 10 d of sampling. During sampling, feed intake and milk yield were recorded daily, milk composition and coagulation properties were determined four times. The composition of the diet ingredients was analysed weekly. Data were analysed with a mixed model considering feed, period and their interaction as fixed effects. Stage of lactation, milk yield and milk composition from the pre-experimental period were used as covariates in the model. Dry matter intake was lower with the long-chopped processed maize silage compared to the other three groups. There were some diet differences in intakes of net energy for lactation and absorbable protein in the duodenum, but this did not result in changes in milk yield. The milk fat content was higher with the grassland-based diets compared to the maize silage diets. No treatment effect on milk acidity and rennet coagulation properties was observed. In conclusion, there were no indications for specific physico-chemical properties of milk from a hay-based diet, and maize processing technology was not of large effect either. Future investigations should focus on sensory differentiation of the milk produced with different forages.",,,,"0022-0299||1469-7629",,"10.1017/s0022029920000801","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/443356","en","Cambridge University Press",,,,"cheese-making properties||Chop length||Grass silage||Maize silage||Shredlage","Effect of feeding hay vs. silages of various types to dairy cows on feed intake, milk composition and coagulation properties",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-09-29T08:06:09Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091807444",,"000572945900013","J.

However, this neofunctionalisation event has not been confirmed and the DODA gene lineage exhibits numerous gene duplication events, whose evolutionary significance is unclear.  •	To address this, we functionally characterised 23 distinct DODA proteins for l ‐DOPA 4,5‐dioxygenase activity, from four betalain‐pigmented and five anthocyanin‐pigmented species, representing key evolutionary transitions across Caryophyllales. By mapping these functional data to an updated DODA phylogeny, we then explored the evolution of l ‐DOPA 4,5‐dioxygenase activity.  •	We find that low l ‐DOPA 4,5‐dioxygenase activity is distributed across the DODA gene lineage.

Here we quantified and isotopically characterized DBC from the second largest river on Earth, the Congo, using 12 samples collected across three annual hydrographs from 2010 to 2012. We find that the Congo River exports an average of 803 ± 84 Gg-C as DBC per year, comprising 7.5% of the river's average annual dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux (10.7 ± 1.2 Tg-C yr−1). Concentrations of DBC were strongly correlated with discharge and DOC concentration, indicating transport limitation for DBC flux from the Congo River Basin. Stable carbon isotopic signatures of DBC revealed a seasonal shift in pyrogenic source from forest dominant to an increasing contribution from savannah biomass, which derives from the North-South bimodal hydrologic regime within the basin. Our results also indicate that black carbon produced within the Congo Basin is exported by the river on relatively short time scales and that total DBC export will increase with climate change predictions for the central African region. ©2020.

Specifically, rising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels over the past century are expected to have increased the intrinsic water‐use efficiency (iWUE) of tropical trees while the ecosystem is gradually pushed into progressive nutrient limitation. Due to the long‐term character of these changes, however, observational datasets to validate both paradigms are limited in space and time. In this study, we used a unique herbarium record to go back nearly a century and show that despite the rise in CO2 concentrations, iWUE has decreased in central African tropical trees in the Congo Basin. Although we find evidence that points to leaf‐level adaptation to increasing CO2—that is, increasing photosynthesis‐related nutrients and decreasing maximum stomatal conductance, a decrease in leaf δ13C clearly indicates a decreasing iWUE over time. Additionally, the stoichiometric carbon to nitrogen and nitrogen to phosphorus ratios in the leaves show no sign of progressive nutrient limitation as they have remained constant since 1938, which suggests that nutrients have not increasingly limited productivity in this biome. Altogether, the data suggest that other environmental factors, such as increasing temperature, might have negatively affected net photosynthesis and consequently downregulated the iWUE.

The resulting linear assembly lacks diversity because it does not contain allelic variation, a drawback of linear references that causes reference allele bias. High nucleotide diversity and the separation of individuals by hundreds of breeds make cattle ideally suited to investigate the optimal composition of variation-aware references.  Results We augment the bovine linear reference sequence (ARS-UCD1.2) with variants filtered for allele frequency in dairy (Brown Swiss, Holstein) and dual-purpose (Fleckvieh, Original Braunvieh) cattle breeds to construct either breed-specific or pan-genome reference graphs using the vg toolkit. We find that read mapping is more accurate to variation-aware than linear references if pre-selected variants are used to construct the genome graphs. Graphs that contain random variants do not improve read mapping over the linear reference sequence. Breed-specific augmented and pan-genome graphs enable almost similar mapping accuracy improvements over the linear reference. We construct a whole-genome graph that contains the Hereford-based reference sequence and 14 million alleles that have alternate allele frequency greater than 0.03 in the Brown Swiss cattle breed. Our novel variation-aware reference facilitates accurate read mapping and unbiased sequence variant genotyping for SNPs and Indels.  Conclusions We develop the first variation-aware reference graph for an agricultural animal (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3759712). Our novel reference structure improves sequence read mapping and variant genotyping over the linear reference. Our work is a first step towards the transition from linear to variation-aware reference structures in species with high genetic diversity and many sub-populations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000428682",,"1474-760X",,"10.1186/s13059-020-02105-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/428682","en","BioMed Central",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Variation-aware genome graph||Sequence variant genotyping||Reference allele bias","Bovine breed-specific augmented reference graphs facilitate accurate sequence read mapping and unbiased variant discovery",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-07-27T14:57:21Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Compiling a population-specific haplotype reference panel to facilitate the fine-mapping of pleiotropic QTL in cattle","185229","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85088810735",,"000556681200003","Genome Biol","1","Genome Biology","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Moreover, it contaminates the cereal grains with health-threatening mycotoxins, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), jeopardizing food and feed safety. Plant-based biopesticides, i.e. botanicals, have recently gained increased interest in crop protection as alternatives to synthetic chemical products. The main objective of this study was to test the control efficacy of botanicals based on white or Indian/Oriental mustard seed flours (Tillecur – Ti, Pure Yellow Mustard – PYM, Pure Oriental Mustard – POM, Oriental Mustard Bran – OMB) on F. graminearum infection and mycotoxin accumulation in wheat grain. Botanicals at 2% concentration showed a higher efficacy in inhibiting mycelium growth in vitro compared with a prothioconazole fungicide (F). In the growth chamber experiment under controlled conditions, the spraying agents reduced DON content in grain in the following order: F = Ti = PYM > POM > OMB. The antifungal activity of the botanicals may be attributed to their bioactive matrices containing isothiocyanates (ITCs) and phenolic acids. Allyl ITC was detected in POM and OMB at 8.38 and 4.48 mg g–1, while p-hydroxybenzyl ITC was found in Ti and PYM at 2.56 and 2.44 mg g–1, respectively. Considerable amounts of various phenolic acids were detected in all botanicals. Under field conditions, only the use of F significantly decreased F. graminearum infection and DON content in grain. An additional important finding of this study is that disease control was more difficult when infection was done with ascospores than conidia, which might have several potential implications considering that ascospores are more important in Fusarium head blight epidemics. Our results suggest that mustard-based botanicals are promising biopesticides for the control of Fusarium head blight in small-grain cereals, but for field applications, an appropriate formulation is necessary to stabilize and prolong the antifungal activity, especially against ascospores.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000427674",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2020.01595","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/427674","en","Frontiers Media",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Fusarium head blight||Antifungal botanical||Isothiocyanate||Phenolic acids||Mycotoxin||Conidia||Ascospores||Wheat","Control of Fusarium graminearum in Wheat With Mustard-Based Botanicals: From in vitro to in planta",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-07-21T09:18:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85088990822",,"000558899000001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, its injudicious abstraction and rapidly increasing contamination are posing a severe threat for sustainable water supply worldwide. Geographical Information System (GIS)-based groundwater quality evaluation using Groundwater Quality Index (GQI) has been proved to be a cost-effective tool for assessing groundwater quality and its variability at a larger scale. However, the conventional GQI approach is unable to deal with uncertainties involved in the assessment of environmental problems. To overcome this limitation, a novel hybrid framework integrating Fuzzy Logic with the GIS-based GQI is proposed in this study for assessing groundwater quality and its spatial variability. The proposed hybrid framework is demonstrated through a case study in a hard-rock terrain of Southern India using ten prominent groundwater-quality parameters measured during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Two conventional GIS-based GQI models GQI-10 (using all the ten groundwater-quality parameters) and GQI-7 (using seven ‘concerned/critical’ groundwater-quality parameters) as well as hybrid Fuzzy-GIS-based GQI (FGQI) models (using seven critical parameters) were developed for the two seasons and the results were compared. The Trapezoidal membership functions classified the model input parameters into ‘desirable’, ‘acceptable’ and ‘unacceptable’ classes based on the experts’ knowledge and water quality standards for drinking purposes. The concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO42− in groundwater were found within the WHO desirable limits for drinking water throughout the year, while the concentrations of seven parameters (TDS, NO3−-N, Na+, Cl−, K+, F− and Hardness) exceed their permissible limits during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. A comparative evaluation of GQI models revealed that the FGQI model predicts groundwater quality better than the conventional GQI-10 and GQI-7 models. GQI modeling results suggest that the groundwater of most of eastern and southern parts (∼60% in pre-monsoon season; ∼90% in post-monsoon season) of the study area is unsuitable for drinking. Further, the groundwater quality deteriorates during post-monsoon seasons compared to pre-monsoon seasons, which indicates an increased influx of contaminants from different industries, mining areas, waste disposal sites and agricultural fields during monsoon seasons. This finding calls for the strict enforcement of regulations for proper handling of effluents from various contamination sources in the study area. It is concluded that the fuzzy logic-based decision-making approach (FGQI) is more reliable and pragmatic for groundwater-quality assessment and analysis at a larger scale. It can serve as a useful tool for the water planners and decision makers in efficiently monitoring and managing groundwater quality at watershed or basin scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000415262",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2020.115867","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/415262","en","Elsevier",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Drinking water quality||Fuzzy logic||Groundwater quality index||WHO||BIS||Groundwater contamination||Hard-rock aquifer","Assessing groundwater quality for drinking water supply using hybrid fuzzy-GIS-based water quality index",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-16T07:09:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85084375691",,"000537695500009","Water Res.",,"Water Research","179","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the Atlantic Forest of northern Argentina, large areas have been replaced by loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) monocultures. Plant and litter transformation, together with harvesting operations, change microclimatic conditions and edaphic properties. Management practices such as thinning promote the development of native understory vegetation and could counterbalance negative effects of forest replacement on soil. Here, the effects of pine plantations and thinning on physical, chemical and microbiological soil properties were assessed. Bacterial, archaeal, and fungal community structure were analyzed using a metabarcoding approach targeting ribosomal markers. Forest replacement and, to a lesser extent, thinning practices in the pine plantations induced significant changes in soil physico-chemical properties and associated shifts in bacterial and fungal communities. Most measured physical and chemical properties were altered due to forest replacement, but a few of these properties reached values similar to natural forests under the thinning operation. Fungal alpha diversity decreased in pine plantations, whereas bacterial alpha diversity tended to increase but with little statistical support. Shifts in community composition were observed for both fungal and bacterial domains, and were mostly related to changes in plant understory composition, soil carbon, organic matter, water content, pH and bulk density. Among several other changes, highly abundant phyla such as Proteobacteria (driven by many genera) and Mortierellomycota (mainly driven by Mortierella) decreased in relative abundance in the plantations, whereas Acidobacteria (mainly driven by Acidothermus and Candidatus Koribacter) and Basidiomycota (mainly driven by the ectomycorrhiza Russula) showed the opposite response. Taken together, these results provide insights into the effects of forest replacement on belowground properties and elucidate the potentially beneficial effect of thinning practices in intensive plantation systems through promoting the understory development. Although thinning did not entirely counterbalance the effects of forest replacement on physical, chemical and biological soil properties, the strategy helped mitigating the effects and might promote resilience of these properties by the end of the rotation cycle, if subsequent management practices compatible with the development of a native understory vegetation are applied.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429369",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2020.01491","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429369","en","Frontiers Media",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Thinning Partially Mitigates the Impact of Atlantic Forest Replacement by Pine Monocultures on the Soil Microbiome",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-07-31T02:58:30Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85088433057",,"000553847800001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Simultaneously, the global biodiversity crisis accentuates the need of fostering biodiversity within cities. Policies supporting urban nature conservation need to understand people's acceptance of biodiversity‐friendly greenspace management. We surveyed more than 2,000 people in 19 European cities about their attitudes toward near‐natural urban grassland management in public greenspaces, and related their responses to nine sociocultural parameters. Results reveal that people across Europe can support urban biodiversity, yet within the frames of a generally tidy appearance of public greenery. Younger people and those using greenspaces for a greater variety of activities were more likely to favor biodiversity‐friendly greenspace management. Additionally, people who were aware of the meaning of biodiversity and those stating responsibility for biodiversity conservation particularly supported biodiversity‐friendly greenspace management. Our results point at explicit measures like environmental education to increase public acceptance of policies that facilitate nature conservation within cities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000414729",,"1755-263X",,"10.1111/conl.12718","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/414729","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biodiversity conservation||Biodiversity-friendly greenspace management||Environmental education||Environmental policy||Environmental responsibility||Lawn alternative||Maintenance intensity||Sustainable cityplanning||Urban grassland vegetation||Urban meadow","Public attitudes toward biodiversity‐friendly greenspace management in Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-14T07:01:33Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85084435645",,"000531897600001","Conserv. lett.","4","Conservation Letters","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Negative side-effects of large scale plantations including the invasive behavior of Eucalyptus trees outside of regular plantations have become apparent. This study uses medium resolution, multi-spectral imagery of the Sentinel 2 satellites to map Eucalyptus across Portugal and parts of Spain with a focus on Natura 2000 areas inside Portugal, that are protected under the European birds and habitats directives. This method enables the detection of small incipient as well as mixed populations outside of regular plantations. Ground truth maps were compiled using field surveys as well as high resolution satellite imagery and were used to train Feedforward Neural Networks. These models predict Eucalyptus tree cover with a sensitivity of up to 75.7% as well as a specificity of up to 95.8%. The overall accuracy of the prediction is 92.5%. A qualitative assessment of Natura 2000 areas in Portugal has been performed and 15 areas have been found to be affected by Eucalyptus of which 9 are strongly affected. This study demonstrates the applicability of multi-spectral imagery for tree-species classification and invasive species control. It provides a probability-map of Eucalyptus tree cover for the western Iberian peninsula with 10 m spatial resolution and shows the need for monitoring of Eucalyptus in protected areas.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429609",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs12142176","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429609","en","MDPI",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Eucalyptus||Map||Natura 2000||Invasive species||Portugal||Artificial neural networks||Sentinel 2","Mapping of Eucalyptus in Natura 2000 Areas Using Sentinel 2 Imagery and Artificial Neural Networks",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-08-03T02:48:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85088636923",,"000558035900001","Remote Sens.","14","Remote Sensing","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Prediction models can be trained on recent or historic phenotypic data and increasingly available genotypic data. This enables the adoption of genomic selection also in under-used legume crops such as common bean. Beans are an important staple food in the tropics and mainly grown by smallholders under limiting environmental conditions such as drought or low soil fertility. Therefore, genotype-by-environment interactions (G × E) are an important consideration when developing new bean varieties. However, G × E are often not considered in genomic prediction models nor are these models implemented in current bean breeding programs. Here we show the prediction abilities of four agronomic traits in common bean under various environmental stresses based on twelve field trials. The dataset includes 481 elite breeding lines characterized by 5,820 SNP markers. Prediction abilities over all twelve trials ranged between 0.6 and 0.8 for yield and days to maturity, respectively, predicting new lines into new seasons. In all four evaluated traits, the prediction abilities reached about 50–80% of the maximum accuracies given by phenotypic correlations and heritability. Predictions under drought and low phosphorus stress were up to 10 and 20% improved when G × E were included in the model, respectively. Our results demonstrate the potential of genomic selection to increase the genetic gain in common bean breeding. Prediction abilities improved when more phenotypic data was available and G × E could be accounted for. Furthermore, the developed models allowed us to predict genotypic performance under different environmental stresses. This will be a key factor in the development of common bean varieties adapted to future challenging conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000425336",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2020.01001","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/425336","en","Frontiers Media",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Genomic selection||genotype x environment interactions||common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)||genome-wide association studies (GWAS)||drought||low phosphorus stress||plant breeding","Genomic Prediction of Agronomic Traits in Common Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)

Non-destructive measurement methods are indispensable to quantify dynamic growth traits. For closing the phenotyping gap, we have developed an automated phenotyping platform, GrowScreen-Agar, for non-destructive characterization of root and shoot traits of plants grown in transparent agar medium.  Results The phenotyping system is capable to phenotype root systems and correlate them to whole plant development of up to 280 Arabidopsis plants within 15 min. The potential of the platform has been demonstrated by quantifying phenotypic differences within 78 Arabidopsis accessions from the 1001 genomes project. The chosen concept ‘plant-to-sensor’ is based on transporting plants to the imaging position, which allows for flexible experimental size and design. As transporting causes mechanical vibrations of plants, we have validated that daily imaging, and consequently, moving plants has negligible influence on plant development. Plants are cultivated in square Petri dishes modified to allow the shoot to grow in the ambient air while the roots grow inside the Petri dish filled with agar. Because it is common practice in the scientific community to grow Arabidopsis plants completely enclosed in Petri dishes, we compared development of plants that had the shoot inside with that of plants that had the shoot outside the plate. Roots of plants grown completely inside the Petri dish grew 58% slower, produced a 1.8 times higher lateral root density and showed an etiolated shoot whereas plants whose shoot grew outside the plate formed a rosette. In addition, the setup with the shoot growing outside the plate offers the unique option to accurately measure both, leaf and root traits, non-destructively, and treat roots and shoots separately.  Conclusions Because the GrowScreen-Agar system can be moved from one growth chamber to another, plants can be phenotyped under a wide range of environmental conditions including future climate scenarios. In combination with a measurement throughput enabling phenotyping a large set of mutants or accessions, the platform will contribute to the identification of key genes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000426693",,"1746-4811",,"10.1186/s13007-020-00631-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/426693","en","BioMed Central",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Arabidopsis||Robotised||Imaging||Root system architecture||Screening||Non-destructive||1001 genomes project||Hoagland solution","The platformGrowScreen-Agarenables identification of phenotypic diversity in root and shoot growth traits of agar grown plants",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-07-17T02:40:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85089109583",,"000544856000001","Plant methods","1","Plant Methods","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Carnivorous plants have turned the tables by capturing and consuming nutrient-rich animal prey, enabling them to thrive in nutrient-poor soil. To better understand the evolution of botanical carnivory, we compared the draft genome of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) with that of its aquatic sister, the waterwheel plant Aldrovanda vesiculosa, and the sundew Drosera spatulata. We identified an early whole-genome duplication in the family as source for carnivory-associated genes. Recruitment of genes to the trap from the root especially was a major mechanism in the evolution of carnivory, supported by family-specific duplications. Still, these genomes belong to the gene poorest land plants sequenced thus far, suggesting reduction of selective pressure on different processes, including non-carnivorous nutrient acquisition. Our results show how non-carnivorous plants evolved into the most skillful green hunters on the planet.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000444128",,"0960-9822||1879-0445",,"10.1016/j.cub.2020.04.051","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444128","en","Cell Press",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Droseraceae||WRKY transcription factors||tissue-specific genes||Gene loss||whole-genome duplications||transposon classification||Neofunctionalization||jasmonate signaling","Genomes of the Venus Flytrap and Close Relatives Unveil the Roots of Plant Carnivory",,"Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-02T07:23:05Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,"81314158",,"85085305529",,"000548517000009","Curr Biol","12","Current Biology","30","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This selection process not only affected aboveground parts of plants, but in some cases also reduced root biomass, with potentially large consequences for the amount of organic carbon (OC) transferred to the soil. To study the effect of wheat breeding for high-yielding cultivars on subsoil OC dynamics, two old and two new wheat cultivars from the Swiss wheat breeding program were grown for one growing season in 1.5 m deep lysimeters and pulse labeled with 13CO2 to quantify the amount of assimilated carbon that was transferred belowground and can potentially be stabilized in the soil. The results show that although the old wheat cultivars with higher root biomass transferred more assimilated carbon belowground compared to more recent cultivars, no significant differences in net rhizodeposition were found between the different cultivars. As a consequence, the long-term effect of wheat cultivar selection on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks will depend on the amount of root biomass that is stabilized in the soil. Our results suggest that the process of wheat selection for high-yielding cultivars resulted in lower amounts of belowground carbon translocation, with potentially important effects on SOC stocks. Further research is necessary to quantify the long-term importance of this effect.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000420114",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-17-2971-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/420114","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The soil organic carbon stabilization potential of old and new wheat cultivars: a 13CO2-labeling study",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-12T12:57:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Carbon isotope fractionation during leaf and root respiration as a function of nitrogen nutrition||An integrated experiment-model approach to elucidate plant-soil interactions and N transformation in aggregated soils","153545||160232","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT||Projekte MINT",,,,"85090441596",,"000541605100001",,"11","Biogeosciences","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Second, we investigate the extraction of the in season traits of early vigor, leaf area index (LAI), and senescence dynamic from images of a soybean (Glycine max) field phenotyping experiment and show that it is possible to rate early vigor, senescence dynamics, and track the LAI development between LAI 1 and 4.5. Third, we identify the start of green up, green peak, senescence peak, and end of senescence in the phenological signal. Fourth, we extract the timing of these points and show how this information can be used to assess the impact of phenology on harvest traits (yield, thousand kernel weight, and oil content).

This paper explores the food (in)security among smallholder farmers and pastoralists using a sample of 175 households in three agro-food value chains of wheat, dairy, and beef in the north-west Mt. Kenya region. The study seeks to answer if a farmer’s participation in a particular agro-food value chain determines his/her food security situation. We use the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and two Poisson regression models, parsimonious and full, to assess the household food security status and determinants of food security among the smallholder farmers and pastoralists. The results show that 61% of the households were either mildly, moderately, or severely food insecure. Households in the beef value chain experienced relatively higher incidences of food insecurity compared to households in the wheat and dairy value chains. The HFIAS scores revealed a wide gap between households with minimum and maximum score. Household size, income and income-related variables (ability to save and borrow to meet family needs), transport assets, membership in farmers’ associations, and household energy were significant in determining household food security, while access to credit and to extension services was not. Strategies that focus on boosting smallholder farmers’ incomes, building strong and resilient farmers associations to improve inclusive and equitable value chains have the potential to get smallholder farmers out of recurrent food insecurity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507618",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su12124999","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507618","en","MDPI",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","smallholders||pastoralists||poisson regression||beef||wheat||dairy","Linking Household Food Security and Food Value Chains in North West Mt.

Assessing the influence of forage species on net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) is key to develop management strategies that can help to mitigate climate change, while optimizing productivity of these systems. However, little is known about the effect of forage species on CO2 exchange fluxes and net biome production (NBP), considering: species ecophysiological responses; growth and fallow periods separately; and the management associated with the particular sown species. Our study assesses the influence of cereal monocultures vs. cereal legume mixtures on (1) ecosystem scale CO2 fluxes, for the whole crop season and separately for the two periods of growth and fallow; (2) potential sensitivities of CO2 exchange related to short-term variations in light, temperature and soil water content; and (3) NBP during the growth period; this being the first long term (seven years) ecosystem scale CO2 fluxes dataset of an intensively managed forage system in the Pyrenees region. Our results provide strong evidence that cereal-legume mixtures lead to higher net CO2 uptake than cereal monocultures, as a result of higher gross CO2 uptake, while respiratory fluxes did not significantly increase. Also, management associated with cereal legume mixtures favoured vegetation voluntary regrowth during the fallow period, which was decisive for the cumulative net CO2 uptake of the entire crop season. All cereal legume mixtures and some cereal monocultures had a negative NBP (net gain of C) during the growth period, indicating C input to the system, besides the yield. Overall, cereal legume mixtures enhanced net CO2 sink capacity of the forage system, while ensuring productivity and forage quality.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000463931",,"1810-6277||1810-6285",,"10.5194/bg-2020-173","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/463931","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ecosystem respiration (Reco)||Gross primary production (GPP)||light response||management||monocultures||net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE)","Cereal-legume mixtures increase net CO2 uptake in a forage system of the Eastern Pyrenees",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2021-01-20T09:33:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biogeosci. discuss.",,"Biogeosciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Measurements comprise two years (2010/2011) of manual static chamber measurements of CH4 and N2O, five years of continuous eddy covariance (EC) measurements (CO2/H2O – 2010–2014) and three years (2012–2014) of EC measurement of CH4 and N2O. Intensive grassland management included both regular and sporadic management activities. Regular management practices encompassed mowing (3–5 cuts per year) with subsequent organic fertilizer amendments and occasional grazing whereas sporadic management activities comprised grazing or similar activities. The primary objective of our measurements was to compare pre-ploughing to post-ploughing GHG exchange and to identify potential memory effects of such a substantial disturbance on GHG exchange and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) budgets. In order to include measurements carried with different observation techniques, we tested two different measurement techniques jointly in 2013, namely the manual static chamber approach and the eddy covariance technique, to quantify the GHG exchange from the observed grassland site. Our results showed that there were no memory effects on N2O and CH4 emissions after ploughing, whereas the CO2 uptake of the site considerably increased when compared to post-restoration years. In detail, we observed large losses of CO2 and N2O during the year of restoration. In contrast, the grassland acted as a carbon sink under usual management, i.e. the time periods (2010–2011 and 2013–2014). Enhanced emissions/emission peaks of N2O (defined as exceeding background emissions < 0.21 ± 0.55 nmol m−2s−1 (SE = 0.02) for at least two sequential days and the seven-day moving average exceeding background emissions) were observed for almost seven continuous months after restoration as well following organic fertilizer applications during all. Net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEECO2) showed a common pattern of increased uptake of CO2 in spring and reduced uptake in late fall. NEECO2 dropped to zero and became positive after each harvest event. Methane (CH4) exchange in contrast to N2O showed minor net uptake of methane seen by the static chambers and small net release of methane seen by the eddy covariance method. Overall, CH4 exchange was of negligible importance for both, the GHG budget as well as for the carbon budget of the site. Our results stress the inclusion of grassland restoration events when providing cumulative sums of C sequestration and/or global warming potentials (GWPs). Consequently, this study further highlights the need for continuous long-term GHG exchange observations as well as the implementation of our findings into biogeochemical process models to track potential GHG mitigation objectives as well as to predict future GHG emission scenarios reliably.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000420863",,"1810-6277||1810-6285",,"10.5194/bg-2020-141","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/420863","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Eddy covariance||Global warming potential||Manual static chamber||Management||Background greenhouse gas emissions||Ploughing||Fertilization","Memory effects on greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, N2O and CH4) following grassland restoration?",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"2020-06-17T10:04:44Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Robust models for assessing the effectiveness of technologies and managements to reduce N2O emissions from grazed pastures (Models4Pastures)","154245||154245","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","FACCE-JPI||FACCE-JPI",,,,,,,"Biogeosci. discuss.",,"Biogeosciences Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

When the fertilizers are applied to agricultural sites, U can either accumulate in the soil or leach to ground and surface waters. We analyzed the U fluxes at three arable and three grassland agricultural sites on the Swiss plateau for 1 year. We calculated all inputs and outputs to the soils, modeled the speciation of U in the soil solution and investigated the possible leaching of U along preferential flow paths. We found that all sites showed positive U budgets (+0.9–6.6 g ha–1 y–1), indicating an accumulation of U. However, the accumulation of U was low and a doubling of U concentration in the surface soil would need 850–2,660 years assuming today’s U fluxes. Mineral P fertilizers were the quantitatively most important input, followed by manure application and mineral weathering (only important in the soils developed on limestone). While at sites with slightly acidic pH only little U (<0.01 μg L–1) was leached, the U leaching increased at neutral pH values, because of the formation of carbonato-U complexes. In all soil solutions, the U concentrations (≤0.8 μg L–1) were below legal threshold values and comparable to local drinking and surface waters. We found no indication for enhanced U leaching along preferential flow paths.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000423497",,"2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2020.00054","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/423497","en","Frontiers Media",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Uranium||Metal flux||Metal leaching||Agriculture||Mineral P fertilizer","Uranium Budget and Leaching in Swiss Agricultural Systems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-29T06:30:35Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Stable metal isotopes as tools to assess enrichment and sources of trace metals in soils and crops to improve sustainability of agricultural systems","145195","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 69: Gesuch",,,,"85086789354",,"000543162600001","Front.

Online analysis of SP in ambient air has been achieved recently, yet those approaches only allowed addressing large areas (footprints) on the basis of strong changes in surface atmospheric N2O concentrations. Here, we combined laser spectroscopy with automated static flux chambers to measure, for the first time, SP of low N2O fluxes with high sensitivity and temporal resolution and to explore its spatial variability. The measurements were then used to test the N2O isotope module SIMONE in combination with the biogeochemical model LandscapeDNDC to identify N2O source processes. End‐member mixing analysis of the data revealed denitrification as the predominant N2O source. This finding was independent of the soil water content close to the soil surface, suggesting that N2O production in the subsoil under high water‐filled pore space conditions outweighed the potential production of N2O by nitrification closer to the surface. Applying the SIMONE‐LandscapeDNDC model framework to our field site showed that the modeled SP was on average 4.2‰ lower than the observed values. This indicates that the model parameterization reflects the dominant N2O production pathways but overestimates the contribution of denitrification by 6%. Applying the stable isotope‐based model framework at other sites and comparing with other models will help identifying model shortcomings and improve our capability to support N2O mitigation from agricultural ecosystems.

Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) has evolved as a flexible and cost-effective technique frequently used in plant breeding. Several GBS pipelines are available to genetically characterize single genotypes but these are not able to represent the genetic diversity of buckwheat accessions that are maintained as genetically heterogeneous, open-pollinating populations. Here we report the development of a GBS pipeline which, rather than reporting the state of bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), resolves allele frequencies within populations on a genome-wide scale. These genome-wide allele frequency fingerprints (GWAFFs) from 100 pooled individual plants per accession were found to be highly reproducible and revealed the genetic similarity of 20 different buckwheat accessions analysed in our study. The GWAFFs cannot only be used as an efficient tool to precisely describe buckwheat breeding material, they also offer new opportunities to investigate the genetic diversity between different buckwheat accessions and establish variant databases for key material. Furthermore, GWAFFs provide the opportunity to associate allele frequencies to phenotypic traits and quality parameters that are most reliably described on population level. This is the key to practically implement powerful genomics-assisted breeding concepts such as marker-assisted selection and genomic selection in future breeding schemes of allogamous buckwheat.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000411026",,,,"10.3986/fbg0063","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/411026","en","Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench)||Genotyping by sequencing (GBS)||population genomics||genome-wide allele frequency fingerprints (GWAFFs)","Genetic characterization of buckwheat accessions through genome-wide allele-frequency fingerprints","GENETSKA KARAKTERIZACIJA VZORCEV AJDE Z ODTISI FREKVENCE ALELOV V GENOMU","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-04-22T06:46:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","Folia Biologica et Geologica","61","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Before 2018, the 2003 millennial drought was often invoked as the example of a “hotter drought”, and was classified as the most severe event in Europe for the last 500 years. First insights now confirm that the 2018 drought event was climatically more extreme and had a greater impact on forest ecosystems of Austria, Germany and Switzerland than the 2003 drought. Across this region, mean growing season air temperature from April to October was more than 3.3°C above the long-term average, and 1.2 °C warmer than in 2003. Here, we present a first impact assessment of the severe 2018 summer drought and heatwave on Central European forests. In response to the 2018 event, most ecologically and economically important tree species in temperate forests of Austria, Germany and Switzerland showed severe signs of drought stress. These symptoms included exceptionally low foliar water potentials crossing the threshold for xylem hydraulic failure in many species and observations of widespread leaf discoloration and premature leaf shedding. As a result of the extreme drought stress, the 2018 event caused unprecedented drought-induced tree mortality in many species throughout the region. Moreover, unexpectedly strong drought-legacy effects were detected in 2019. This implies that the physiological recovery of trees was impaired after the 2018 drought event, leaving them highly vulnerable to secondary drought impacts such as insect or fungal pathogen attacks. As a consequence, mortality of trees triggered by the 2018 events is likely to continue for several years. Our assessment indicates that many common temperate European forest tree species are more vulnerable to extreme summer drought and heat waves than previously thought. As drought and heat events are likely to occur more frequently with the progression of climate change, temperate European forests might approach the point for a substantial ecological and economic transition. Our assessment also highlights the urgent need for a pan-European ground-based monitoring network suited to track individual tree mortality, supported by remote sensing products with high spatial and temporal resolution to track, analyse and forecast these transitions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000414790",,"1439-1791||1618-0089",,"10.1016/j.baae.2020.04.003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/414790","en","Elsevier",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Drought stress||Hotter drought||Recovery||Temperate forests||Tree mortality","A first assessment of the impact of the extreme 2018 summer drought on Central European forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-14T10:55:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,"ICOS-CH Phase 2","173691","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,,"85085966699",,"000542433700009","Basic Appl.

Subsequently, 2 × 6 cows per dietary group were investigated in a tied-housing system and respiration chambers. Substantially higher proportions of favorable milk fatty acids were recovered in L cows when compared with C cows at the group level, making the analysis of bulk milk a suitable control instrument for retailers. Linseed supplementation resulted in a slightly lower diurnal course of CH4 emission intensity than the control at the group and individual levels. However, we found no more than a trend for a CH4 mitigating effect, unlike in other studies supplementing similar linseed lipid levels. Feed supplements in concentrations that lead to a significant reduction in CH4 emissions must show whether the reduction potential determined at the group and individual levels is comparable.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000422327",,"2076-2615",,"10.3390/ani10061091","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/422327","en","MDPI",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Methanogenesis||Methane mitigation||Lipid||Ruminant||Cattle||Emission measurement","Methane Emissions and Milk Fatty Acid Profiles in Dairy Cows Fed Linseed, Measured at the Group Level in a Naturally Ventilated Housing and Individually in Respiration Chambers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-25T06:21:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85087001346",,"000550858900001",,"6","Animals","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Photosynthetic capacity was previously shown to increase as temperature declines with increasing elevation, counteracting enzyme-kinetic effects. Primary production declines, nonetheless, due to decreasing light availability. We aimed to predict leaf-trait and production gradients from first principles, using published data to test an emerging theory whereby photosynthetic traits and primary production depend on optimal acclimation and/or adaptation to environment. We re-analysed published data for 210 species at 25 sites, fitting linear relationships to elevation for both predicted and observed photosynthetic traits and primary production. Declining leaf-internal/ambient CO2 ratio (χ) and increasing carboxylation (Vcmax) and electron-transport (Jmax) capacities with increasing elevation were predicted. Increases in leaf nitrogen content with elevation were explained by increasing Vcmax and leaf mass-per-area. Leaf and soil phosphorus covaried, but after controlling for elevation, no nutrient metric accounted for any additional variance in photosynthetic traits. Primary production was predicted to decline with elevation. This analysis unifies leaf and ecosystem observations in a common theoretical framework. The insensitivity of primary production to temperature is shown to emerge as a consequence of the optimisation of photosynthetic traits. © 2020 The Authors.

However, there is limited understanding of the response of fungal communities to different aluminum concentrations across different genotypes. Here, we used metabarcoding of fungal ribosomal markers to assess the effects of aluminum stress on the rhizosphere fungal community of aluminum-tolerant and aluminum-sensitive soybean genotypes. Shifts in fungal community structure were related to changes in plant biomass, fungal abundance and soil chemical properties. Aluminum stress increased the difference in fungal community structure between tolerant and sensitive genotypes. Penicillium, Cladosporium and Talaromyces increased with increasing aluminum concentration. These taxa associated with the aluminum-tolerant genotypes were enriched at the highest aluminum concentration. Moreover, complexity of the co-occurrence network associated with the tolerant genotypes increased at the highest aluminum concentration. Collectively, increasing aluminum concentrations magnified the differences in fungal community structure between the two studied tolerant and sensitive soybean genotypes. This study highlights the possibility to focus on rhizosphere fungal communities as potential breeding target to produce crops that are more tolerant toward heavy metal stress or toxicity in general.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000421447",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2020.01177","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/421447","en","Frontiers Media",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Rhizosphere Soil Fungal Communities of Aluminum-Tolerant and -Sensitive Soybean Genotypes Respond Differently to Aluminum Stress in an Acid Soil",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-20T03:11:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85086396698",,"000541837400001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we present an empirical function to correct the TGS 2600 signal for temperature and (absolute) humidity effects and address the long-term reliability of two identical sensors deployed from 2012 to 2018. We assess the performance of the sensors at 30 min resolution and aggregated to weekly medians. Over the entire period the agreement between TGS-derived and reference CH4 mole fractions measured by a high-precision Los Gatos Research instrument was R2=0.42, with better results during summer (R2=0.65 in summer 2012). Using absolute instead of relative humidity for the correction of the TGS 2600 sensor signals reduced the typical deviation from the reference to less than ±0.1 µmol mol−1 over the full range of temperatures from −41 to 27 ∘C. At weekly resolution the two sensors showed a downward drift of signal voltages indicating that after 10–13 years a TGS 2600 may have reached its end of life. While the true trend in CH4 mole fractions measured by the high-quality reference instrument was 10.1 nmolmol−1yr−1 (2012–2018), part of the downward trend in sensor signal (ca. 40 %–60 %) may be due to the increase in CH4 mole fraction because the sensor voltage decreases with increasing CH4 mole fraction. Weekly median diel cycles tend to agree surprisingly well between the TGS 2600 and reference measurements during the snow-free season, but in winter the agreement is lower. We suggest developing separate functions for deducing CH4 mole fractions from TGS 2600 measurements under cold and warm conditions. We conclude that the TGS 2600 sensor can provide data of research-grade quality if it is adequately calibrated and placed in a suitable environment where cross-sensitivities to gases other than CH4 are of no concern.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000416949",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-13-2681-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/416949","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Long-term reliability of the Figaro TGS 2600 solid-state methane sensor under low-Arctic conditions at Toolik Lake, Alaska",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-27T16:04:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85085748473",,"000537699800001","Atmos. meas. tech.","5","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Traditional yam cropping practices in West Africa deliver low yields and lead to environmental degradation. In the context of a ‘research for development’ project, we developed and implemented a participatory and transdisciplinary research approach as a means to derive more sustainable yam production practices. We identified and studied different soil and plant management technologies adapted to varying biophysical and socio-economic contexts. For this purpose, we established innovation platforms (IPs) in four yam growing regions of West Africa, to validate the new technologies and to promote their adoption. These co-developed technologies were set up and tested first in researcher-managed plots before doing the same in farmer-managed plots.

Both have substantial inputs into environmental strategies and policies calling for biodiversity conservation aimed to directly increase ecosystem services. The scientific literature concurs that as biological diversity increases so do ecosystem functions and services in grasslands. While the evidence for this is strong, the majority comes from controlled small-scale biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiments. Thus, it is unclear whether the scientific basis for implementing BEF relationships into practice is sufficiently evidenced. Here we explore the applicability of findings from BEF experiments to the conservation and management of temperate grassland, a widespread and potentially highly biodiverse habitat. While we acknowledge that BEF research can reveal insights into fundamental mechanisms, the saturation of biodiversity effects at low levels and unrealistic (management) treatments widely impede the applicability of these experimental results to permanent grasslands. Additionally, the integration of BEF research results into practice is considerably hampered by experimental studies not answering stakeholders' crucial questions, e.g. is there evidence of biodiversity conservation potentials? Thus, stakeholders do not have a strong evidence base for taking decisions for the addressed management goals, except intensive production in (species-poor) temporary grasslands. If BEF work is to inform stakeholders future research needs to overcome unrealistic management, missing stakeholder involvement and ineffective communication. A new generation of applied BEF experiments employing applied, multi-actor approaches is needed to facilitate the relevance of BEF research for nature conservation, agriculture and land management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000408710",,"0006-3207||1873-2917",,"10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108552","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/408710","en","Elsevier",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","BEF research||Biodiversity crisis||Real-world grassland management||Ecosystem services||Knowledge generation||Plant species richness","Do biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments inform stakeholders how to simultaneously conserve biodiversity and increase ecosystem service provisioning in grasslands?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-04-07T07:24:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies","774124","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85082701307",,"000532824200025","Biol Conserv",,"Biological Conservation","245","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Furthermore, future projections of the considered indices until the end of the 21st century are analyzed for two greenhouse gas scenarios (Representative Concentrations Pathways RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The validation reveals good results for indices that are based on one or two climate variables only and on simple temporal aggregations. Indices that involve multiple climate variables, complex temporal statistics or extreme conditions are less well represented. The climate projection analysis indicates an intensification of temperature-related extreme events such as heat waves. In general, climate change signals in the indices considered are subject to three main patterns: a horizontal pattern across Switzerland, a vertical pattern depending on elevation and a temporal pattern with an intensification of change in the course of the 21st century. Changes are in most cases more pronounced for the high-emission RCP8.5 scenario compared to the mitigation scenario RCP2.6. Overall, the projections indicate a challenging 21st century climate for the agricultural sector.

In parallel to these major vegetation alterations, the impact of water scarcity also has prominent effects on soil processes mediated by the microbiome such as the transformation of organic matter, heterotrophic respiration, microbial uptake as well as nutrient mineralization. Although currently little explored, shifts in the interplay occurring between tree functioning and soil microbial processes may be crucial during tree mortality events and may feed back on ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling. We will present a multidisciplinary setup to mechanistically explore how water limitation acts synergistically on the interplay between trees and soil microorganisms, with potential consequences for ecosystem biogeochemical fluxes.  The experimental setup focusses on a key temperate forest species, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), which is currently facing high mortality rates in several inner-Alpine valleys of Europe due to drier climatic conditions during parts of the year. We make use of small scale mesocosms featuring young trees and soil collected from a drought-affected natural forest. The mesocosms are treated with different levels of water availability under controlled conditions. Plant growth and physiological changes related to water limitation are investigated in parallel to various soil properties. State-of-the-art isotopic labelling techniques are used to trace alterations in carbon and nitrogen transfers within the plant-soil-microbe continuum. We will specifically test whether extended periods of drought suppress the flux of carbon from plants to soil and lead plants to invest more in the maintenance of fine root systems. Moreover, we will follow the potential changes in the rates of decomposition, mineralization and incorporation of plant debris into soil organic matter over time and link them to potential alterations of the soil microbiota. These experimental observations will be validated by measurements in drought-affected Scots pine forests in inner-Alpine valleys. We expect the outcomes of this work to advance the fundamental understanding of the alterations occurring in the plant-soil-microbe system related to drought as well as to improve the detection of mechanisms leading to Scots pine mortality.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000457243",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-3963","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/457243","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Potential consequences of water limitation and drought-induced tree mortality on carbon and nitrogen cycling",,"Other Conference Item","Open access",,,"2020-12-18T16:38:28Z",,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2020","May 4-8, 2020","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To examine these processes in black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens L.; Diptera: Stratiomyidae) larvae, two protocols were developed. Protocol 1 describes a method to produce viable, sterile black soldier fly larvae and a gentle method for diet sterilization. Sterile black soldier fly larvae can be used to study the diverse role of microbes in larval development. Nutrient requirements of sterile black soldier fly larvae are met only through diet. Viable sterile black soldier fly larvae were consistently generated using a four-step treatment with alternating immersions of eggs for 2 min each in ethanol (70%) and sodium hypochlorite (0.6%), over two cycles. A nonthermal method of diet sterilization, namely high-energy electron beam (HEEB) treatment, was introduced. Subsequently, growth of sterile black soldier fly larvae was observed on the HEEB-treated diets (40, 60, and 40% of replicates with poultry feed, liver pie, and an artificial diet, respectively) but not on autoclaved diets. In Protocol 2, we propose a novel method to collect frass from individual larvae. We then measured the metabolites in frass, using high-pressure liquid chromatography. Results on metabolites confirmed the influence of digestion. For instance, succinate increased from 1 to 2 and 7 μmol/g sample from diet to gut homogenate and frass, respectively. The collection method is a promising tool to estimate the diet and nutrient requirements of black soldier fly larvae, thus increasing the performance and reliability of black soldier fly larvae rearing. We discuss in detail the possible applications and limitations of our methods in black soldier fly larvae research.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000423481",,"0970-3837||1536-2442",,"10.1093/jisesa/ieaa057","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/423481","en","University of Arizona Library",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Insect||Digestion||Microorganism||Sterile||Frass collection","Novel Experimental Methods for the Investigation of Hermetia illucens (Diptera: Stratiomyidae) Larvae",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-29T05:59:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85087320414",,"000546017500001","J.

Ces dernières pages montrent que Fallou avait une vue très moderne du concept de fonctions du sol. Il indique ainsi que le sol n’est pas seulement important pour la production agricole, mais aussi comme fournisseur de matières premières (tourbe et sable), régulateur (cycle de l’eau) et substrat (plantes et autres organismes). Il observe ensuite que ces fonctions dépendent de l’évolution de facteurs « naturels » (mécaniques par érosion-sédimentation ou chimiques par altération organique et minérale) ou « artificiels » (anthropiques) et décrit la mise en solution par le sol des éléments nutritifs de la plante. Ces réflexions amènent Fallou à évoquer le rôle de ce qu'il nomme ""engrais"" (fumier, marne et chaux) et à développer un point de vue optimiste quant à la pérennité de la fertilité du sol sous l’action raisonnée de l’Homme. Ainsi se clôt la série d’articles consacrés à la première partie de l’ouvrage de Fallou, le texte original étant accompagné de quelques commentaires critiques sur ce Chapitre.||In nine previous papers (Feller et al., 2008, 2015, 2019 ; Frossard et al., 2009, 2011, 2019 ; Aeschlimann et al., 2010, 2018, 2020) a com-plete (except for Chapter 2 with extracts only) French translation of Fallou’s Foreword, Introduction and Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, i.e. respectively “Genesis”, “State”, “Nature”, “Extension”, “Stratification”, “Diversity”, and “Classification” of the soil was published and analyzed. The present contribution provides a full French version, this time of Chapter 8 titled “Function of the Soil ». In these last pages Fallou shows that he has developed a very modern conception of the functions of the soil. He first emphasizes that the soil is important not only for the agricultural production, but also as provider of raw materials (peat and sand), as regulator (water cycle), and as substrate for all plants and other organisms. He also notes that these functions depend on the evolution of ""natural"" (i.e. either mechanical due to erosion-sedimentation, or chemical through organic and mineral weathering) as well as ""artificial"" factors, and describes how nutrients are being dissolved in the soil to feed the plants. He finally evokes the role played by what he calls ""fertilisers"" (manure, marl and lime) and argues that the soil fertility is likely to be sustainable provided human actions remain appropriate. This Chapter represents the end of the first part of Fallou’s book and is accompanied by some critical comments",,,,"1252-6851",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460470","fr","Association Française pour l'Etude du Sol",,,,"Pédologie||fonction du sol||histoire||Fallou||Pedology||function of the soil||history","Friedrich Albert FALLOU (1794-1877) et sa « Pedologie » X - Chapitre 8 « Fonction du sol »",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-08T08:33:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Étude et Gestion des Sols","27","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This ‘carbon allocation’ to structural growth is a dynamic process influenced by internal and external (e.g., climatic) drivers. While radial variability in wood formation and its resulting structure have been intensively studied, their variability along tree stems and subsequent impacts on ABIstem remain poorly understood. We collected wood cores from mature trees within a fixed plot in a well-studied temperate Fagus sylvatica L. forest. For a subset of trees, we performed regular interval sampling along the stem to elucidate axial variability in ring width (RW) and wood density (ρ), and the resulting effects on tree- and plot-level ABIstem. Moreover, we measured wood anatomical traits to understand the anatomical basis of ρ and the coupling between changes in RW and ρ during drought. We found no significant axial variability in ρ because an increase in the vessel-to-fiber ratio with smaller RW compensated for vessel tapering towards the apex. By contrast, temporal variability in RW varied significantly along the stem axis, depending on the growing conditions. Drought caused a more severe growth decrease, and wetter summers caused a disproportionate growth increase at the stem base compared with the top. Discarding this axial variability resulted in a significant overestimation of tree-level ABIstem in wetter and cooler summers, but this bias was reduced to ~2% when scaling ABIstem to the plot level. These results suggest that F. sylvatica prioritizes structural carbon sinks close to the canopy when conditions are unfavorable. The different axial variability in RW and ρ thereby indicates some independence of the processes that drive volume growth and wood structure along the stem. This refines our knowledge of carbon allocation dynamics in temperate diffuse-porous species and contributes to reducing uncertainties in determining forest carbon fixation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000414852",,"0829-318X||1758-4469",,"10.1093/treephys/tpaa002","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/414852","en","Oxford University Press",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","carbon allocation||climate||Fagus sylvatica||forest productivity||quantitative wood anatomy||tree rings||wood density","Axial changes in wood functional traits have limited net effects on stem biomass increment in European beech (Fagus sylvatica)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-14T13:34:04Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85084101322",,"000537443000007",,"4","Tree Physiology","40","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

At the national scale, the gross nitrogen budget (GNB) is accepted as an indicator of pollution caused by nitrates. There is, however, little common EU-wide knowledge on the budget application and its comparability at the farm level for the detection of ground-and surface water pollution caused by nitrates and the monitoring of mitigation measures. Therefore, a survey was carried out among experts of various European countries in order to assess the practice and application of fertilization planning and nitrogen budgeting at the farm level and the differences between countries within Europe. While fertilization planning is practiced in all of the fourteen countries analyzed in this paper, according to current legislation, nitrogen budgets have to be calculated only in Switzerland, Germany and Romania. The survey revealed that methods of fertilization planning and nitrogen budgeting at the farm level are not unified throughout Europe. In most of the cases where budgets are used regularly (Germany, Romania, Switzerland), standard values for the chemical composition of feed, organic fertilizers, animal and plant products are used. The example of the Dutch Annual Nutrient Cycling Assessment (ANCA) tool (and partly of the Suisse Balance) shows that it is only by using farm-specific “real” data that budgeting can be successfully applied to optimize nutrient flows and increase N efficiencies at the farm level. However, this approach is more elaborate and requires centralized data processing under consideration of data protection concerns. This paper concludes that there is no unified indicator for nutrient management and water quality at the farm level. A comparison of regionally calculated nitrogen budgets across European countries needs to be interpreted carefully, as methods as well as data and emission factors vary across countries. For the implementation of EU nitrogen-related policies—notably, the Nitrates Directive—nutrient budgeting is currently ruled out as an entry point for legal requirements. In contrast, nutrient budgets are highlighted as an environment indicator by the OECD and EU institutions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000451161",,"2073-4441",,"10.3390/w12041197","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/451161","en","MDPI",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nitrogen budget||Nitrogen balance||Water pollution||Nitrates||Agriculture||Drinking water","Nitrogen Surplus – A Unified Indicator for Water Pollution in Europe?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-13T08:39:47Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4","Water","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We investigated the seasonal patterns of high-resolution solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) measured by the satellite Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) across the Amazonian ecoregions to assess the area´s phenology and extreme drought vulnerability. SIF is an indicator of the photosynthetic activity of chlorophyll molecules and is assumed to be directly related to gross primary production (GPP). We analyzed SIF variability in the Amazon basin during the period between September 2014 and December 2018. In particular, we focused on the SIF drought response under the extreme drought period during the strong El Niño in 2015–2016, as well as the 6-month drought peak period. During the drought´s peak months, the SIF decreased and increased with different intensities across the ecoregions of the Amazonian moist broadleaf forest (MBF) biome. Under a high temperature, a high vapor pressure deficit, and extreme drought conditions, the SIF presented differences from −31.1% to +17.6%. Such chlorophyll activity variations have been observed in plant-level measurements of active fluorescence in plants undergoing physiological responses to water or heat stress. Thus, it is plausible that the SIF variations in the ecoregions’ ecosystems occurred as a result of water and heat stress, and arguably because of drought-driven vegetation mortality and collateral effects in their species composition and community structures. The SIF responses to drought at the ecoregional scale indicate that there are different levels of resilience to drought across MBF ecosystems that the currently used climate- and biome-region scales do not capture. Finally, we identified monthly SIF values of 32 ecoregions, including non-MBF biomes, which may give the first insights into the photosynthetic activity dynamics of Amazonian ecoregions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000414699",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs12071202","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/414699","en","MDPI",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","SIF||Amazonia||El Niño||photosynthesis||OCO-2||seasonality||drought||extreme events||chlorophyll||fluorescence","OCO-2 Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Variability across Ecoregions of the Amazon Basin and the Extreme Drought Effects of El Niño (2015–2016)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-14T02:55:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85084263871",,"000537709600152","Remote Sens.","7","Remote Sensing","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Since then, many studies have been conducted to understand, monitor and improve agricultural systems. This paper presents results from the SolumScire project, focusing on the prediction of the spatial distribution of soil zones and topsoil properties, such as pH, soil organic matter (SOM) and clay content in agricultural fields through random forest algorithms. For this purpose, samples from 120 fields were investigated. The zoning and soil property prediction has an accuracy greater than 90%. This is supported by a high agreement of the derived zones with farmer’s observations. The trained models revealed a prediction accuracy of 94%, 89% and 96% for pH, SOM and clay content, respectively. The obtained models for soil properties can support precision field management, the improvement of soil sampling and fertilization strategies, and eventually the management of soil properties such as SOM.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000414698",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs12071116","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/414698","en","MDPI",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Soil property prediction||pH||Soil organic matter||Soil clay content||Precision agriculture||Copernicus mission||Sentinel||Multi-spectral imagery||Synthetic aperture radar imagery||Machine learning||Random forest","Understanding Fields by Remote Sensing: Soil Zoning and Property Mapping",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-14T02:55:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85084264499",,"000537709600066","Remote Sens.","7","Remote Sensing","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Cultivar mixtures offer yield benefits from the same land area, but the mechanisms behind this overyielding have not been completely worked out. One potential mechanism is improved competition with weeds. We use an experimental approach of varying barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypic and phenotypic diversity to test the hypothesis that increases in diversity have an impact on weed growth strategies and community assembly, or if responses are driven by barley performance. There was no effect of increasing barley mixture diversity on weed traits, either in terms of species means or the community-weighted mean. However, Functional Richness of the weed community decreased with increasing barley mixture diversity mainly as a result of reduced specific leaf area Functional Richness. This pattern was driven by a reduction in species richness of the weed community rather than by reduced variation within species. Whilst barley phenotype had different impacts on weed traits, there were no specific mixtures of phenotypes or genotypes that had consistent effects on community assembly or weed species responses. The competitive exclusion of weed species could have agronomic and environmental benefits, through better targeting or less frequent use of herbicides. Growing crop mixtures is one of many strategies available to improve agricultural sustainability and resilience, and one that has clear benefits.",,,,"0043-1737||1365-3180",,"10.1111/wre.12393","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/382438","en","Wiley",,,,"competitive exclusion||community assembly||crop mixture||functional diversity||Functional Richness||plant functional traits","Increased crop diversity reduces the functional space available for weeds",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2019-12-04T03:43:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Ecology and evolution in practice: A plant–plant interaction-based approach to the evolution of biodiversity effects on productivity","170645","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,"85075439553",,"000498256100001","Weed res.

To measure concentrations of myo-IP6 in alkaline soil extracts, solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is commonly used. However, overlap of the NMR peaks of myo-IP6 with several other peaks in the phosphomonoester region requires spectral deconvolution fitting (SDF) to partition the signals and quantify myo-IP6. At present, two main SDF approaches are in use; the first fits a Lorentzian/Gaussian lineshape to the myo-IP6 peaks directly to the baseline without an underlying broad signal, and the second fits a Lorentzian/Gaussian lineshape to the myo-IP6 peaks simultaneously with an underlying broad peak. The aim of this study was to compare the recovery of added myo-IP6 to soil extracts using both SDF procedures for six soil samples of diverse origin and differing concentrations of organic P (112 to 1505 mg P per kgsoil). The average recovery of total added myo-IP6 was 95% (SD 5) and 122% (SD 32) using SDF with and without an underlying broad signal, respectively. The recovery of individual peaks of myo-IP6 differed, most notably, the C5 phosphate peak of myo-IP6 was overestimated by up to 213% when a broad peak was not included in SDF. Based on the SDF procedure that includes a broad peak, concentrations of myo-IP6 ranged from 0.6 to 90.4 mg P per kgsoil, which comprised 1–23% of total phosphomonoesters. Our results demonstrate that the SDF procedure with an underlying broad signal is essential for the accurate quantification of myo-IP6 in soil extracts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000415006",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/c9em00485h","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/415006","en","Royal Society of Chemistry",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Quantitative measures of myo-IP6 in soil using solution 31P NMR spectroscopy and spectral deconvolution fitting including a broad signal",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-15T08:02:27Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Identifying the chemical nature of organic phosphorus in soil extracts with increasing molecular weight","169256","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85084190534",,"000546453900018","Environ Sci Process Impacts","4","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Grassland soils remain important reservoirs of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Herbivores may affect both C and N pools and these changes likely interact with increases in soil nutrient availability. Given the scale of grassland soil fluxes, such changes can have striking consequences for atmospheric C concentrations and the climate. Here, we use the Nutrient Network experiment to examine the responses of soil C and N pools to mammalian herbivore exclusion across 22 grasslands, under ambient and elevated nutrient availabilities (fertilized with NPK + micronutrients). We show that the impact of herbivore exclusion on soil C and N pools depends on fertilization. Under ambient nutrient conditions, we observed no effect of herbivore exclusion, but under elevated nutrient supply, pools are smaller upon herbivore exclusion. The highest mean soil C and N pools were found in grazed and fertilized plots. The decrease in soil C and N upon herbivore exclusion in combination with fertilization correlated with a decrease in aboveground plant biomass and microbial activity, indicating a reduced storage of organic matter and microbial residues as soil C and N. The response of soil C and N pools to herbivore exclusion was contingent on temperature – herbivores likely cause losses of C and N in colder sites and increases in warmer sites. Additionally, grasslands that contain mammalian herbivores have the potential to sequester more N under increased temperature variability and nutrient enrichment than ungrazed grasslands. Our study highlights the importance of conserving mammalian herbivore populations in grasslands worldwide. We need to incorporate local‐scale herbivory, and its interaction with nutrient enrichment and climate, within global‐scale models to better predict land–atmosphere interactions under future climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000404248",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15023","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/404248","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Carbon sequestration||Exclosure||Fertilization||Global change||Grazing||Herbivory||Nutrient dynamics||Nutrient enrichment||Nutrient Network (NutNet)||Soil microorganisms","Nutrient availability controls the impact of mammalian herbivores on soil carbon and nitrogen pools in grasslands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-03-11T03:12:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85082095246",,"000515181900001","Glob.

To better understand these relationships at a regional scale, we used nearly 800 observation years from 271 permanent long‐term forest monitoring plots across Switzerland, obtained between 1980 and 2017. We assimilated these data into the 3‐PG forest ecosystem model using Bayesian inference, reducing the bias of model predictions from 14% to 5% for forest stem carbon stocks and from 45% to 9% for stem carbon stock changes. We then estimated the productivity of forests dominated by Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica for the period of 1960–2018, and tested for productivity shifts in response to climate along elevational gradient and in extreme years. Simulated net primary productivity (NPP) decreased with elevation (2.86 ± 0.006 Mg C ha−1 year−1 km−1 for P. abies and 0.93 ± 0.010 Mg C ha−1 year−1 km−1 for F. sylvatica). During warm–dry extremes, simulated NPP for both species increased at higher and decreased at lower elevations, with reductions in NPP of more than 25% for up to 21% of the potential species distribution range in Switzerland. Reduced plant water availability had a stronger effect on NPP than temperature during warm‐dry extremes. Importantly, cold–dry extremes had negative impacts on regional forest NPP comparable to warm–dry extremes. Overall, our calibrated model suggests that the response of forest productivity to climate extremes is more complex than simple shift toward higher elevation. Such robust estimates of NPP are key for increasing our understanding of forests ecosystems carbon dynamics under climate extremes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000401681",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.15011","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/401681","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bayesian inference||Carbon cycling||Data assimilation||Drought||Ecosystem productivity||Extreme events||Fagus sylvatica||Inverse modeling||Model calibration||Picea abies","Assessing the response of forest productivity to climate extremes in Switzerland using model–data fusion",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-02-25T15:56:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,"ICOS-CH Phase 2","173691","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,,"85079726198",,"000513927400001","Glob.

Many previous results of this dC∕dN response were based on changes in carbon stocks from periodical soil and ecosystem inventories, associated with estimates of Nr deposition obtained from large-scale chemical transport models. This study and a companion paper (Flechard et al., 2020) strive to reduce uncertainties of N effects on C sequestration by linking multi-annual gross and net ecosystem productivity estimates from 40 eddy covariance flux towers across Europe to local measurement-based estimates of dry and wet Nr deposition from a dedicated collocated monitoring network. To identify possible ecological drivers and processes affecting the interplay between C and Nr inputs and losses, these data were also combined with in situ flux measurements of NO, N2O and CH4 fluxes; soil leaching sampling; and results of soil incubation experiments for N and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as surveys of available data from online databases and from the literature, together with forest ecosystem (BASFOR) modelling.  Multi-year averages of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in forests ranged from −70 to 826 g C m−2 yr−1 at total wet + dry inorganic Nr deposition rates (Ndep) of 0.3 to 4.3 g N m−2 yr−1 and from −4 to 361 g C m−2 yr−1 at Ndep rates of 0.1 to 3.1 g N m−2 yr−1 in short semi-natural vegetation (moorlands, wetlands and unfertilized extensively managed grasslands). The GHG budgets of the forests were strongly dominated by CO2 exchange, while CH4 and N2O exchange comprised a larger proportion of the GHG balance in short semi-natural vegetation. Uncertainties in elemental budgets were much larger for nitrogen than carbon, especially at sites with elevated Ndep where Nr leaching losses were also very large, and compounded by the lack of reliable data on organic nitrogen and N2 losses by denitrification. Nitrogen losses in the form of NO, N2O and especially were on average 27 % (range 6 %–54 %) of Ndep at sites with Ndep < 1 g N m−2 yr−1 versus 65 % (range 35 %–85 %) for Ndep > 3 g N m−2 yr−1. Such large levels of Nr loss likely indicate that different stages of N saturation occurred at a number of sites. The joint analysis of the C and N budgets provided further hints that N saturation could be detected in altered patterns of forest growth. Net ecosystem productivity increased with Nr deposition up to 2–2.5 g N m−2 yr−1, with large scatter associated with a wide range in carbon sequestration efficiency (CSE, defined as the NEP ∕ GPP ratio). At elevated Ndep levels (> 2.5 g N m−2 yr−1), where inorganic Nr losses were also increasingly large, NEP levelled off and then decreased. The apparent increase in NEP at low to intermediate Ndep levels was partly the result of geographical cross-correlations between Ndep and climate, indicating that the actual mean dC∕dN response at individual sites was significantly lower than would be suggested by a simple, straightforward regression of NEP vs. Ndep.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000407624",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-17-1583-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/407624","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Carbon-nitrogen interactions in European forests and semi-natural vegetation - Part 1: Fluxes and budgets of carbon, nitrogen and greenhouse gases from ecosystem monitoring and modelling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-03-31T10:03:32Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85083106625",,"000522159700001",,"6","Biogeosciences","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Accurately simulating gross primary production (GPP, ecosystem-level apparent photosynthesis) is key for satellite monitoring and Earth system model predictions under climate change. While robust models exist for describing leaf-level photosynthesis, predictions diverge due to uncertain photosynthetic traits and parameters which vary on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here, we describe and evaluate a GPP (photosynthesis per unit ground area) model, the P-model, that combines the Farquhar–von Caemmerer–Berry model for C3 photosynthesis with an optimality principle for the carbon assimilation–transpiration trade-off, and predicts a multi-day average light use efficiency (LUE) for any climate and C3 vegetation type. The model builds on the theory developed in Prentice et al. (2014) and Wang et al. (2017a) and is extended to include low temperature effects on the intrinsic quantum yield and an empirical soil moisture stress factor. The model is forced with site-level data of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and meteorological data and is evaluated against GPP estimates from a globally distributed network of ecosystem flux measurements. Although the P-model requires relatively few inputs, the R2 for predicted versus observed GPP based on the full model setup is 0.75 (8 d mean, 126 sites) – similar to comparable satellite-data-driven GPP models but without predefined vegetation-type-specific parameters. The R2 is reduced to 0.70 when not accounting for the reduction in quantum yield at low temperatures and effects of low soil moisture on LUE. The R2 for the P-model-predicted LUE is 0.32 (means by site) and 0.48 (means by vegetation type). Applying this model for global-scale simulations yields a total global GPP of 106–122 Pg C yr−1 (mean of 2001–2011), depending on the fAPAR forcing data. The P-model provides a simple but powerful method for predicting – rather than prescribing – light use efficiency and simulating terrestrial photosynthesis across a wide range of conditions. The model is available as an R package (rpmodel).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000409260",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-13-1545-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/409260","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"P-model v1.0: an optimality -based light use efficiency model for simulating ecosystem gross primary production",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-04-11T01:39:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,"next-generation Modelling of the biosphere - Including New Data streams and optimality approaches","181115","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Eccellenza",,,,"85083046142",,"000522159800001","Geosci. model dev.","3","Geoscientific Model Development","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The objectives of this study were to assess the level of social self-organization in food systems, to identify forms of social self-organization and the motivations behind them, and to analyze the benefits to food systems social-ecological resilience. We collected data from various actor groups at different levels of food systems using mixed methods. Analysis involved six indicators that were scored on a Likert scale. The study observed that smallholders in Kenya organized in women’s self-help groups, agro-ecological movements, and cooperatives, while in Bolivia the Guaraní indigenous people organized in movements addressing territorial integrity. Social self-organization was found to be important in resilience building at a community level and has potential to contribute to more sustainable food systems. However, more research on the link between social self-organization and policy change across scales would provide additional interesting insights.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507615",,"2160-1933||2160-1941",,"10.18848/2160-1933/cgp/v10i01/19-42","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507615","en","Common Ground Research Networks",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Social Self-Organization||Food Systems||Resilience||Kenya||Bolivia","Social Self-Organization and Social-Ecological Resilience in Food Systems: Lessons from Smallholder Agriculture in Kenya and Indigenous Guaraní Communities in Bolivia",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-09-29T11:07:43Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","Food Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Through this synthesis study, we identify the many interdependencies of each step in the collection and processing chain, and outline approaches to formalize and ensure a successful workflow and product development. Given the number of environmental conditions, constraints, and variables that could possibly be explored from UAS platforms, it is impractical to provide protocols that can be applied universally under all scenarios.

Existing scenarios of LULC changes during the Holocene are based on relatively simple assumptions and highly uncertain estimates of population changes through time. Archaeological and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions have the potential to refine these assumptions and estimates. The Past Global Changes (PAGES) LandCover6k initiative is working towards improved reconstructions of LULC globally. In this paper, we document the types of archaeological data that are being collated and how they will be used to improve LULC reconstructions. Given the large methodological uncertainties involved, both in reconstructing LULC from the archaeological data and in implementing these reconstructions into global scenarios of LULC, we propose a protocol to evaluate the revised scenarios using independent pollen-based reconstructions of land cover and climate. Further evaluation of the revised scenarios involves carbon cycle model simulations to determine whether the LULC reconstructions are consistent with constraints provided by ice core records of CO2 evolution and modern-day LULC. Finally, the protocol outlines how the improved LULC reconstructions will be used in palaeoclimate simulations in the Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project to quantify the magnitude of anthropogenic impacts on climate through time and ultimately to improve the realism of Holocene climate simulations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000466068",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-13-805-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/466068","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Development and testing scenarios for implementing  land use and land cover changes during the Holocene  in Earth system model experiments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-27T16:14:13Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,"85081251513",,"000518769300001","Geosci. model dev.","2","Geoscientific Model Development","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, complex interactions between environmental variables and vegetation on NEE remain unclear; and there is a lack of empirical data, especially from the high elevations and the Mediterranean region. A chamber-based survey of CO2 exchange measurements was carried out in two climatically contrasted grasslands (montane v. subalpine) of the Pyrenees; assessing the relative contribution of phenology and environmental variables on CO2 exchange at the seasonal scale, and the influence of plant functional type dominance (grasses, forbs and legumes) on the NEE light response. Results show that phenology plays a crucial role as a CO2 exchange driver, suggesting a differential behaviour of the vegetation community depending on the environment. The subalpine grassland had a more delayed phenology compared to the montane, being more temperature than water constrained. However, temperature increased net CO2 uptake at a higher rate in the subalpine than in the montane grassland. During the peak biomass, productivity (+74%) and net CO2 uptake (NEE +48%) were higher in the subalpine grassland than in the montane grassland. The delayed phenology at the subalpine grassland reduced vegetation's sensitivity to summer dryness, and CO2 exchange fluxes were less constrained by low soil water content. The NEE light response suggested that legume dominated plots had higher net CO2 uptake per unit of biomass than grasses. Detailed information on phenology and vegetation composition is essential to understand elevation and climatic differences in CO2 exchange.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000409123",,"0021-8596||1469-5146",,"10.1017/s0021859620000179","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/409123","en","Cambridge University Press",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Grasslands||Legumes||Light response||Subalpine||Net ecosystem exchange (NEE)","Phenology and plant functional type dominance drive CO2 exchange in seminatural grasslands in the Pyrenees",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-04-09T06:54:12Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85082707375",,,"J. agric. sci.","1-2","The Journal of Agricultural Science","158","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To date, the role of FGF and the respective receptors (FGFR) during the preimplantation phase in cattle are not fully characterized. We examined FGF1, FGF2, FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 in cyclic and early pregnant heifers at Days 12, 15, and 18 after insemination (Day 0). Endometrial FGF1 mRNA transcript abundance in heifers varied significantly with respect to the day after insemination, the pregnancy status, and their interaction. The expression was higher in nonpregnant than in pregnant heifers at Day 18. The conceptus transcripts abundance of FGFR2 and FGFR3 were significantly lower at Day 15 than 18. In the endometrium, FGF1 protein abundance significantly decreased from Day 12 onwards and FGF2 protein abundance showed a minor, but a significant increase at Day 15 in comparison to Days 12 and 18. We concluded that the decrease in FGF1 mRNA expression in pregnant heifers at Day 18 points towards a potential contribution of FGF1 in the preimplantation process. Additionally, successful embryo elongation might require a spatiotemporal FGF2 protein increase in the endometrium.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000403151",,"1422-0067",,"10.3390/ijms21051584","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/403151","en","MDPI",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Angiogenesis||Bovine||Embryo||FGF2||Interferon-tau","Initiation of Conceptus Elongation Coincides with an Endometrium Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF2) Protein Increase in Heifers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-03-05T03:19:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85079903667",,"000524908500035","Int. j. mol. sci.","5","International Journal of Molecular Sciences","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, comparative in-depth studies are lacking. The growth and slaughter performance and the meat quality of 2 commercial dual-purpose hybrids (Lohmann Dual, LD; Novogen Dual, ND) and a layer hybrid (Lohmann Brown, LB) were compared with slow-growing broilers (Hubbard S757, HU), as used for organic production. The growth periods tested were 67, 84, and 126 D (the LB only). A total of 1,350 birds per hybrid were kept in 5 compartments of 20 m2. In a subsample, the carcass and meat quality were analyzed. The average daily gains and feed intake were quite similar in the ND, LD, and HU and were lower in the LB. Across 67 D, the FCR (kg feed/kg gain) of the HU was 2.62 compared with 2.81 and 2.83 in the ND and LD, respectively. The FCR of the LB was much lower (3.61). The breast angle, an indicator of the keel bone’s prominence, was largest in the HU, similar to that of the ND and the LD, and smallest in the LB. The breast meat proportions were always larger in the HU than in the ND and the LD at 21, 18, and 17%, respectively, and smallest in the LB (15%). The breast meat from the dual-purpose hybrids was similar, or slightly superior, to the HU in water-holding capacity and shear force and slightly inferior in intramuscular fat content. The LB meat did not differ much from that of the other hybrids. Growth for 126 D improved the carcass quality in the LB. In conclusion, both dual-purpose hybrids were competitive with slow-growing broilers, whereas this was not the case for the layer cockerels.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000403810",,,,"10.1016/j.japr.2019.10.005","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/403810","en","Oxford University Press",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","chick culling||carcass conformation||organic||performance","Growth, carcass, and meat quality of 2 dual-purpose chickens and a layer hybrid grown for 67 or 84 D compared with slow-growing broilers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-03-08T03:52:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85080089757",,"000529366700018",,"1","Journal of Applied Poultry Research","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We use an empirical example from Germany and focus on the prices of hay as well as feed wheat and barley. Our results show that regional and national droughts substantially increase hay prices by up to 15%, starting with a delay of about 3 months and lasting for about a year. In contrast, feed grain prices in our sample are not affected by regional or national droughts. These price responses can be linked to market integration, as the hay market is usually regionally organized while feed grains are traded transnationally.

There is consensus that, on single trophic levels, biodiversity sustains functions; however, to understand the full range of biodiversity effects, a holistic and multitrophic perspective is needed. Here, we apply methods from ecosystem ecology that quantify the structure and dynamics of the trophic network using ecosystem energetics to data from a large grassland biodiversity experiment. We show that higher plant diversity leads to more energy stored, greater energy flow and higher community-energy-use efficiency across the entire trophic network. These effects of biodiversity on energy dynamics were not restricted to only plants but were also expressed by other trophic groups and, to a similar degree, in aboveground and belowground parts of the ecosystem, even though plants are by far the dominating group in the system. The positive effects of biodiversity on one trophic level were not counteracted by the negative effects on adjacent levels. Trophic levels jointly increased the performance of the community, indicating ecosystem-wide multitrophic complementarity, which is potentially an important prerequisite for the provisioning of ecosystem services.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000401671",,"2397-334X",,"10.1038/s41559-020-1123-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/401671","en","Nature",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Biodiversity increases multitrophic energy use efficiency, flow and storage in grasslands",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-02-25T15:19:06Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85079812456",,"000515480900001","Nat Ecol Evol",,"Nature Ecology & Evolution","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Research often assumes that agricultural production—and thus, food security—are favoured by tenure security of resources (as represented by a “bundle of property rights”). However, research has not yet elucidated how food security is influenced by additional factors, represented within a “bundle of powers”. Guided by the Theory of Access developed by Ribot and Peluso, we explore the main factors in the respective bundles of rights and powers that influence household food security around north-west Mount Kenya. We interviewed 76 households—38 food secure and 38 food insecure—who were subsampled from a previous food security survey of 380 households. Results show that household food insecurity was not exclusively the result of a lack of private property rights as many farmers had retained their property rights. Instead, a major factor preventing access to productive resources was the difficulty faced by food insecure households in accessing farm technology (i.e. hand tools and implements). Access to authority and via social relations were significantly correlated with access to technology, so improving the latter must take into account the former.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507610",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su12051751","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507610","en","MDPI",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","access||food security||smallholders||Kenya||Mount Kenya||farm technology||theory of access","Applying the Theory of Access to Food Security among Smallholder Family Farmers around North-West Mount Kenya",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-09-29T11:01:19Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"5","Sustainability","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, constantly (e.g., sun illumination angle, ambient temperature) as well as rapidly (e.g., clouds) changing environmental conditions make it difficult to compare measurements taken even at short time intervals. This poses a great challenge for high-throughput field phenotyping (HTFP). The aim of this study was to i) set up a workflow for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) based HTFP of CT, ii) investigate different data processing procedures to combine information from multiple images into orthomosaics, iii) investigate the repeatability of the resulting CT by means of heritability, and iv) investigate the optimal timing for thermography measurements. Additionally, the approach was v) compared with other methods for HTFP of CT. The study was carried out in a winter wheat field trial with 354 genotypes planted in two replications in a temperate climate, where a UAV captured CT in a time series of 24 flights during 6 weeks of the grain-filling phase. Custom-made thermal ground control points enabled accurate georeferencing of the data. The generated thermal orthomosaics had a high spatial accuracy (mean ground sampling distance of 5.03 cm/pixel) and position accuracy [mean root-mean-square deviation (RMSE) = 4.79 cm] over all time points. An analysis on the impact of the measurement geometry revealed a gradient of apparent CT in parallel to the principle plane of the sun and a hotspot around nadir. Averaging information from all available images (and all measurement geometries) for an area of interest provided the best results by means of heritability. Correcting for spatial in-field heterogeneity as well as slight environmental changes during the measurements were performed with the R package SpATS. CT heritability ranged from 0.36 to 0.74. Highest heritability values were found in the early afternoon. Since senescence was found to influence the results, it is recommended to measure CT in wheat after flowering and before the onset of senescence. Overall, low-altitude and high-resolution remote sensing proved suitable to assess the CT of crop genotypes in a large number of small field plots as is required in crop breeding and variety testing experiments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000406016",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2020.00150","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/406016","en","Frontiers Media",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Thermography||Unmanned aerial vehicle||Phenotyping||Plant breeding||Spatial correction||Low-altitude/high-resolution remote sensing||Anisotropy||Temperate climate","Assessment of Multi-Image Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Based High-Throughput Field Phenotyping of Canopy Temperature",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-03-20T17:50:08Z",,,,"yes",,,,"PhenoCOOL: Wheat and soybean phenotyping under cold conditions using growth as a dynamic trait","169542","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85081995358",,"000524735800001","Front.

Field experiments using mulch layers or botanicals were conducted in two consecutive years to investigate prevention measures with the potential to suppress FHB and reduce mycotoxins in wheat. We simulated a system with high disease pressure, i.e. maize-wheat rotation under no-tillage, by applying maize residues artificially inoculated with Fusarium graminearum in field plots after wheat sowing. For mulch layers, a novel cut-and-carry biofumigation approach was employed. Cover crops grown in separate fields were harvested in autumn, chopped and applied directly onto the inoculated maize residues after wheat sowing. Mulch layers of white mustard (Sinapis alba), Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) or berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum) were applied. Botanicals included aqueous extracts of white mustard seed flours or milled Chinese galls and were applied to inoculated maize residues after wheat sowing in autumn or at wheat tillering in spring. Mulch layers of white mustard, Indian mustard or clover consistently suppressed Fusarium infection in both years and decreased mycotoxin contents in wheat grain, i.e. deoxynivalenol by up to 50 %, 58 % and 56 %, and zearalenone by up to 76 %, 71 % and 87 %, respectively. Botanicals were more effective in the second year, when the disease pressure was higher, reducing deoxynivalenol and zearalenone contents in grain by 22%–42% and 60%–78%, respectively. However, there were no clear differences between autumn and spring applications of botanicals on disease pressure and mycotoxin contamination. Mulch layer treatments improved grain yield up to 15 % compared with the positive control, while the botanicals had a minor impact on crop yield. Within the context of sustainable crop protection, cereal growers could benefit from the recommended prevention strategies by decreasing the risk of mycotoxin contamination in harvest products and thus improving grain yield and quality.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000381699",,"0378-4290||1872-6852",,"10.1016/j.fcr.2019.107681","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/381699","en","Elsevier",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Fusarium graminearum||Mycotoxin||Wheat||Mustard||Clover","Prevention of Fusarium head blight infection and mycotoxins in wheat with cut-and-carry biofumigation and botanicals",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-11-29T21:51:47Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85075559646",,"000509631600009","Field crops res.",,"Field Crops Research","246","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, little is known about how herbivory on maternal plants affects offspring fitness. Furthermore, while inbreeding is known to reduce plant reproductive output, previous studies have not explored whether and how such effects may extend across generations. Here, we addressed the transgenerational consequences of herbivory and maternal plant inbreeding on the reproduction of Solanum carolinense offspring.  Methods Manduca sexta caterpillars were used to inflict weekly damage on inbred and outbred S. carolinense maternal plants. Cross‐pollinations were performed by hand to produce seed from herbivore‐damaged outbred plants, herbivore‐damaged inbred plants, undamaged outbred plants, and undamaged inbred plants. The resulting seeds were grown in the greenhouse to assess emergence rate and flower production in the absence of herbivores. We also grew offspring in the field to examine reproductive output under natural conditions.  Results We found transgenerational effects of herbivory and maternal plant inbreeding on seedling emergence and reproductive output. Offspring of herbivore‐damaged plants had greater emergence, flowered earlier, and produced more flowers and seeds than offspring of undamaged plants. Offspring of outbred maternal plants also had greater seedling emergence and reproductive output than offspring of inbred maternal plants, even though all offspring were outbred. Moreover, the effects of maternal plant inbreeding were more severe when plant offspring were grown in field conditions.  Conclusions This study demonstrates that both herbivory and inbreeding have fitness consequences that extend across generations even in outbred progeny.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000405048",,"1914-2016:||0002-9122",,"10.1002/ajb2.1402","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/405048","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","fitness||flower and fruit production||herbivory||horsenettle||inbreeding depression||Manduca sexta||maternal effects||seed germination||Solanaceae||transgenerational effects","Transgenerational impacts of herbivory and inbreeding on reproductive output in Solanum carolinense",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-03-16T08:20:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85077977346",,"000517463600012","Am.

Yet, reciprocal effects are poorly understood as studies of plant–plant interactions usually estimate only benefits for associated species, while how another trophic level may mediate direct and indirect feedback effects for ecosystem engineers is hardly considered. Methods We ran a field experiment with two ecosystem engineers (Arenaria tetraquetra and Hormathophylla spinosa) blooming either alone or with associated plants to decompose net effects and to test the hypothesis that pollinator-mediated interactions provide benefits that balance costs of facilitation by ecosystem engineers. Important Findings We found that net costs of facilitation are accompanied by pollinator-mediated benefits. Despite ecosystem engineers producing less flowers per plant, they were visited by more and more diverse pollinators per flower when blooming with associated plants than when blooming alone. Although seed production per plant was higher when ecosystem engineers bloomed alone, fruit set and seed set varied between species. In one case (Arenaria tetraquetra), fruit and seed sets were negatively affected by the presence of associated plants, whereas in another case (Hormathophylla spinosa), fruit set and seed set were higher and unaffected when ecosystem engineers bloomed with associated plants, respectively. Our findings suggest that besides experiencing direct costs, ecosystem engineers can also benefit from facilitating other species via increasing their own visibility to pollinators. Thus, we highlight that pollination interactions can compensate for costs of facilitation depending on ecosystem engineer species. This study illuminates how the outcome of direct plant–plant interactions might be mediated by indirect interactions including third players.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000376683",,"1752-9921||1752-993X",,"10.1093/jpe/rtz049","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/376683","en","Oxford University Press (OUP)",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Biodiversity||Commensalism||Ecosystem engineering||Mutualism||Niche construction||Three-way interactions","Pollination interactions reveal direct costs and indirect benefits of plant–plant facilitation for ecosystem engineers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-11-11T10:18:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Ecology and evolution in practice: A plant–plant interaction-based approach to the evolution of biodiversity effects on productivity||The impact of land-use change and species invasion on biodiversity and ecological networks","180195||180195||170645||180195","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||Scientific Exchanges",,,,"85084508950",,"000529932500014","J.

The aim of this work was to determine a) whether SF remains functional in a tetraploid population and b) whether the SF mutation expresses dominance in heterozygous pollen grains. A tetraploidized plant carrying SF alleles was self-pollinated to create a segregating F2 population. In the F2 individuals, pollen compatibility ranged between 38% and 84% showing that SF remained functional. The SF locus genotype was the main determinant of pollen compatibility explaining 78% of the variation. The observed segregation was significantly different from the expected under both SF being dominant or recessive models (P(χ2)≤0.001) and tended to be intermediate between them, indicating partial dominance or additive gene action. The frequency of the different genotypes suggested that pollen grains homozygous for the mutation have a competitive advantage over heterozygous pollen and that pollen compatibility is affected by the interaction with additional loci.

Similar to other biowaste treatment technologies, co-conversion could compensate for variability in the composition of biowastes. Using detailed nutrient analyses, this study assessed whether mixing biowastes to similar protein and non-fibre carbohydrate (NFC) contents increased the performance and reduced the variability of BSFL treatment in comparison to the treatment of individual wastes. The biowastes examined were mill by-products, human faeces, poultry slaughterhouse waste, cow manure, and canteen waste. Biowaste formulations had a protein-to-NFC ratio of 1:1, a protein content of 14–19%, and a NFC content of 13–15% (dry mass). Performance parameters that were assessed included survival and bioconversion rate, waste reduction, and waste conversion and protein conversion efficiency. In comparison to poultry feed (benchmark), vegetable canteen waste showed the best performance and cow manure performed worst. Formulations showed significantly improved performance and lower variability in comparison to the individual wastes. However, variability in performance was higher than expected for the formulations. One reason for this variability could be different fibre and lipid contents, which correlated with the performance results of the formulations. Overall, this research provides baseline knowledge and guidance on how BSFL treatment facilities may systematically operate using biowastes of varying types and compositions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000373170",,"0956-053X||1879-2456",,"10.1016/j.wasman.2019.10.036","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/373170","en","Elsevier",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biological||Treatment||Waste||Conversion||Formulation||Hermetia illucens","Biowaste treatment with black soldier fly larvae: increasing performance through the formulation of biowastes based on protein and carbohydrates",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-10-28T10:44:59Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85074648913",,,"Waste Manag",,"Waste Management","102","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02070 - Dep.

However, flying in the low–Reynolds number regime remains challenging. High sensitivity to atmospheric turbulence compromises vehicle stability and control, and low aerodynamic efficiency limits flight duration. Conventional wing designs have thus far failed to address these two deficiencies simultaneously. Here, we draw inspiration from nature’s small flyers to design a wing with lift generation robust to gusts and freestream turbulence without sacrificing aerodynamic efficiency. This performance is achieved by forcing flow separation at the airfoil leading edge. Water and wind tunnel measurements are used to demonstrate the working principle and aerodynamic performance of the wing, showing a substantial reduction in the sensitivity of lift force production to freestream turbulence, as compared with the performance of an Eppler E423 low–Reynolds number wing. The minimum cruise power of a custom-built 104-gram fixed-wing drone equipped with the Separated Flow wing was measured in the wind tunnel indicating an upper limit for the flight time of 170 minutes, which is about four times higher than comparable existing fixed-wing drones. In addition, we present scaling guidelines and outline future design and manufacturing challenges.",,,,"2470-9476",,"10.1126/scirobotics.aay8533","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432659","en","AAAS",,,,,"A bioinspired Separated Flow wing provides turbulence resilience and aerodynamic efficiency for miniature drones",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-08-26T05:09:21Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"38","Science Robotics","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

P4 can be metabolized into various metabolites, of which some are biologically active. While some metabolites target the classical nuclear progesterone receptor (PR), neurosteroids bind the receptors of type A γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA-r) in the brain. According to the position of reduction within the molecule, metabolites of P4 can be characterized into C20-reduced progestogens (20α-dihydroprogesterone (20α-DHP) and 20β-dihydroprogesterone (20β-DHP)), C3-reduced progestogens (3α-dihydroprogesterone (3α-DHP) and 3β-dihydroprogesterone (3β-DHP)), 5α-reduced progestogens (5α-dihydroprogesterone (5α-DHP), allopregnanolone and isopregnanolone) and 5β-reduced progestogens (5β-dihydroprogesterone (5β-DHP), pregnanolone and epipregnanolone). We questioned whether the reduced progestogens are present in bovine plasma during the estrous cycle and whether their profiles differed from the profile of the common precursor P4 around the time of luteolysis. The analytes were monitored in plasma samples using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). While progestogens lagged behind the drop of P4 at luteolysis, they followed the profile of P4 during the estrous cycle. The abundance of P4 was predominant followed by allopregnanolone, pregnanolone, epipregnanolone and 20β-DHP. Further studies will need to focus particularly on the period around luteolysis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000385384",,"1879-3231||0093-691x",,"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.10.005","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/385384","en","Elsevier",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Progestogen||Estrous cycle||Bovine||LC-MS","Progestogen profiling in plasma during the estrous cycle in cattle using an LC-MS based approach",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-12-13T10:17:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85075454110",,"000505270100048","Theriogenology",,"Theriogenology","142","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The application of buttermilk-acidulated RP manure resulted in higher yields of cotton in all field trials and higher yields of soybean in all but one field trials. While on majority of the farms (18 out of 28), wheat yields increased with the application of buttermilk-acidulated RP compost, a quarter of the field trials (7 out of 28) exhibited yields lower than farmers’ practices. The study showed that it was possible to develop a locally adoptable solution to an agronomic constraint using locally available resources including the indigenous knowhow.

However, these forms alone do not explain the existence of, or account for the processes responsible for, a larger pool of “unresolved” organic P that exists in soils. We critically reviewed the historic literature and carried out a global compilation of quantitative data to understand the chemical nature of soil organic P, including insight on what might constitute unresolved forms. We identified five key eras spanning the mid-1800s to current. Understanding of the chemical nature of organic P has largely reflected the predominant analytical technique in use, which generally involved focusing on a particular class of organic P. While inositol phosphates have been a focus throughout most eras, quantitative data reveal that the composition of the majority of organic P (typically > 50%) in soil remains unresolved. Insight on its chemical nature has revealed that it is largely comprised of phosphomonoesters (P–O–C) and is associated with large molecular weight fractions, including the soil humic acid fraction. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that this is concomitant with the existence of a broad spectral feature that appears along with sharp peaks attributable to specific compounds in the phosphomonoester region of solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Here, we highlight the need to improve our understanding of the chemical nature and cycling of diverse forms of organic P in soil, including that of “unresolved” pools. This will necessitate the use of multiple techniques and approaches in soil biogeochemistry that require a holistic approach to understanding soil organic matter dynamics, and the association of organic P with soil organic carbon. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,,,"0065-2113||0065-2164",,"10.1016/bs.agron.2019.10.001","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460098","en","Elsevier",,,,"Complex organic P||Humic P||Phytate||SOP||Speciation||Unidentified P","The chemical nature of soil organic phosphorus – a critical review and global compilation of quantitative data",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-01-07T08:04:04Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000609006900003",,"1","Advances in Agronomy","160","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The same grasslands are a host of biodiversity and provide a wide range of other ecosystem services. Changes in the climatic conditions, population, consumer demands and policies, which put pressure on grasslands and grassland-based production, requires farmers to adapt. For farmers and their utility, two aspects are especially important in this context: expected income and stability of income, i.e. income risk. Farmers have a set of tools to adapt and influence grassland production, including the choice of the (plant) species diversity level in their grassland. Species diversity have been shown to increase yields and yield stability as well as that it can mitigate adverse effects of weather extremes, such as droughts. A key challenge is to transform these findings also into economic terms and to quantify these potential benefits of species diversity in terms of farmers’ utility. Empirical economic assessments of the effects of species diversity (‘diversity effects’) in grasslands that aim to value these effects from farmers’ perspectives have been conducted only in a limited number. Those studies that did such economic assessment usually focused on biomass yields (i.e. quantity of yield) and extensively managed grasslands and neglected essential aspects for farmers, such as forage quality, different management intensities, extreme weather events (e.g. droughts), market responses (e.g. hay prices) or differences in farm types. Droughts that are a severe risk for grasslands are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity in the future due to climate change. Understanding the economic consequences of drought effects and how species diversity, among other tools, can help to reduce adverse effects is important. Moreover, droughts can not only cause yield losses but also market response (e.g. hay prices response), which are equally important to farmers but not explored so far. The overall research goal of the thesis is to support farmers, extension services and policy makers by answering the question ‘What is the value of species diversity in grasslands for farmers?’. Therefore, we conduct an economic valuation of the diversity effect in grasslands from a farmers’ perspective in Chapter 2 to 4: In Chapter 2, we economically assess the diversity effects on expected yields, expected revenues and risk in intensively managed grasslands, considering biomass yields and forage quality. We find that species diversity increased biomass yields while it did not affect forage quality. Thus, species diversity increased quality-adjusted yields (biomass yields x forage quality) and potential revenues from milk production. Moreover, species diversity decreased farmers’ risk. In Chapter 3, we investigate the diversity effect on expected yields and revenues, considering biomass yields and forage quality across a wide range of management intensities. The results show that species diversity increased quality-adjusted yields and revenues across management regimes and that the benefits from species diversity can be as high as increasing management intensity. In Chapter 4, we analyze the diversity effect under increasing drought risks while considering hay yield and price responses to droughts as well as different farm types. We find that species diversity increased income and decreased risk. The diversity effect was independent of drought probability and the drought effect largely dependent on farm type. We complement the economic assessment of species diversity by an in-depth analysis of droughts effect hay prices and differences between drought effects on hay prices and feed grain prices (Chapter 5). We find that regional and national droughts substantially increased hay prices while feed grain prices were not affected in South Germany. The differences between hay and feed grain price responses can be linked to transport and transaction costs, thus, to market integration. Moreover, we provide supplementary analysis about biodiversity loss communication, public interest in biodiversity in climate change and societal concerns on pesticide use in the appendices of the thesis. In conclusion, the thesis adds to the existing knowledge of species diversity and its economic value by extending the (economic) assessment of species diversity. Considering key aspects for farmers, we show that species diversity is an economically relevant factor of production and that maintaining and reestablishing species diverse grasslands can contribute to future sustainable intensification of grassland-based production. Moreover, we provide new insights to the consequences of droughts on hay and feed grain prices and that these prices are differently affected. The knowledge on these drought effects on prices in combination with diversity effects in grasslands can help to better understand and mitigate adverse drought effects in grassland-based production, especially considering climate change. The gained insights in this thesis, about the species diversity effects and the drought effects, should be considered in farm management as well as in the decisions of policy makers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000447273",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/447273","en","ETH Zurich",,,,"Agricultural economics||Ecological economics||Biodiversity||Grassland||Weather extremes","Economic Perspective on Grasslands, Biodiversity and Weather Extremes",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment","2020-10-22T12:15:45Z","2023-10-23",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"26860",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02120 - Dep.

Until now, few studies have been conducted on the role of agriculture as a potential source for endocrine disrupting substances, such as the natural estrogens 17α-estradiol (E2α), 17β-estradiol (E2β), estrone (E1), and estriol (E3), in surface waters. This could be of particular concern because female livestock animals excrete natural estrogens during different stages of the estrous cycle and pregnancy through urine and feces. The majority of urinary and fecal livestock excretions are collected in the form of slurry. The fate of these estrogens in slurry is not yet fully understood. Slurries are applied in large amounts on agricultural areas as fertilizer. The export of slurry derived natural estrogens from agricultural areas is a potential source for estrogenic pollution in surface waters. Even at low nanograms per liter concentrations in surface waters, estrogens exert endocrine disrupting effects in fish – the most important, but not the only, recipient class of organisms. The aim of this doctoral thesis was to better understand the occurrence and fate of agriculturally derived natural estrogens in the environment and to evaluate their risk as pollutants for the aquatic environment. Specifically, the three main objectives were: 1) to determine concentrations of natural estrogens in slurry and to investigate their fate during slurry storage, 2) to quantify natural estrogen emissions to subsurface tile drains from agricultural areas fertilized with livestock slurry, and 3) to assess the prevalence of natural estrogens in surface waters with agriculturally dominated catchments.  The occurrence and fate of natural estrogens was studied in cattle and pig slurries. The effect of on farm slurry storage on natural estrogen concentrations in cattle slurry was investigated first by collecting and analysing slurry samples in different compartments of a dairy housing over four months. This study was complemented with a nationwide cattle and pig slurry pit monitoring, which aimed to determine average natural estrogen concentrations in Swiss livestock slurries. Natural estrogens in slurry were extracted with an adapted QuEChERS method and quantified with liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). During storage, natural estrogen concentrations remained relatively constant in different compartments of the dairy housing. Mean natural concentrations ranged from 138 to 861 ng/L and from 54 to 244 ng/L in Swiss cattle and pig slurries, respectively. 17α-Estradiol predominated in cattle slurries and E3 was most abundant in pig slurries. In Switzerland, the estimated annual load of total natural estrogens applied on agricultural areas through slurry applications was 36 mg/ha. The majority of the total natural estrogens (E2α+E2β+E1+E3) is emitted to the environment through wastewater treatment plant effluents (i.e., 68 %) and not through slurry applications. Natural estrogens were applied on tile-drained experimental fields in the form of cattle slurry, pig slurry or dissolved in water, and quantified in flow-proportionally collected drainage water. A liquid-liquid extraction followed by derivatization with dansyl chloride and the same LC-MS/MS method as for estrogens in slurry extracts were used for extraction and quantification of natural estrogens in drainage water. After pig and cattle slurry applications, concentration maxima in drainage water occurred immediately after rain events, with 73, 8, 37, and 60 ng/L for E2α, E2β, E1, and E3, respectively. The fractions of individual natural estrogens exported to tile drains after cattle and pig slurry applications were on average 0.26% and 0.18%, respectively. Lower exported fractions for estrogens applied in aqueous solution point at particle facilitated transport when applied in slurry. Preferential flow was proposed as main natural estrogen transport pathway to tile drains. Our estimation shows that in Switzerland annually 6.3 g of E2α, 0.6 g of E2β, 7.4 g of E1, and 7.7 g of E3 are emitted to surface waters through subsurface tile drains. Natural estrogen emissions from WWTPs were estimated to be three to four orders of magnitude higher than those from tile drains, i.e., 1.5 kg of E2β, 9.7 kg of E1, and 51.1 kg of E3. The prevalence of natural estrogens (derived from farming livestock) in streams and ponds was studied in the catchment of Lake Baldegg, which is a livestock farming dominated catchment in Switzerland. Passive samplers were deployed in one tributary, daily time-proportional water samples were collected in five tributaries for 30 days, and grab samples were taken in 12 ponds in the catchment. All monitoring campaigns were conducted at the beginning of the vegetation period, when slurry applications are most frequent. Aqueous samples were chemically analysed in the same way as drainage water samples and stream water samples additionally with ERα-CALUX – a bioassay for assessing total estrogenic activity. Certain natural estrogens were frequently detected and their mean concentrations were between below limit of detection (0.10 ng/L) and 0.55 ng/L for E2β and E1, respectively. Both passive sampling and bioassay results largely supported these findings. A Monte Carlo simulation underestimated measured mean natural estrogen concentrations by a factor of three to 11. Temporal estrogen occurrence patterns point to preferential flow from agricultural areas as the main emission process to surface waters. In ponds, natural estrogens were occasionally detected up to 8.6 ng/L for E2α.  Overall, our results showed that agriculture is a source for natural estrogens in surface waters. Slurry derived estrogens caused temporarily elevated estrogen concentrations in drainage and stream water, but in streams the European Union environmental quality standards (EU EQS) (0.4 ng/L for E2β and 3.6 ng/L for E1) were never exceeded for longer than a day. Our estimation demonstrated however, that in a stream impacted by agriculture and an effluent of a WWTP estrogen concentrations that exceed the threshold values might occur and human derived estrogens were the predominating estrogen source. Critical E1 concentrations for aquatic organisms occurred in one pond. Consequently, the risk for estrogen concentrations above the EU EQS seems to be elevated in ponds surrounded by agricultural landscapes as well as in small and medium sized streams impacted by both agriculture and WWTP effluents.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000475832",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/475832","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Occurrence and Fate of Agriculturally Derived Natural Estrogens in the Environment",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2021-03-22T17:16:54Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27087",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We first inject label-hierarchy knowledge into an arbitrary CNN-based classifier and empirically show that availability of such external semantic information in conjunction with the visual semantics from images boosts overall performance. Taking a step further in this direction, we model more explicitly the label-label and label-image interactions using order-preserving embeddings governed by both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries, prevalent in natural language, and tailor them to hierarchical image classification and representation learning.

An important resource for pastoralists, most livestock live in semi-arid and arid environments, where they roam during the day and are kept in enclosures (or bomas) during the night. Manure, although rich in nitrogen, is rarely used, and therefore accumulates in bomas over time. Here we present in-situ measurements of N2O fluxes from 46 bomas in Kenya and show that even after 40 years following abandonment, fluxes are still ~one magnitude higher than those from adjacent savanna sites. Using maps of livestock distribution, we scaled our finding to SSA and found that abandoned bomas are significant hotspots for atmospheric N2O at the continental scale, contributing ~5% of the current estimate of total anthropogenic N2O emissions for all of Africa.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000442199",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-020-18359-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/442199","en","Nature Publishing Group",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Livestock enclosures in drylands of Sub-Saharan Africa are overlooked hotspots of N2O emissions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-09-24T06:19:32Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091052398",,"000607162700001","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In addition to the nutritional benefits, pea is an invaluable agro-ecological asset for sustainable cropping systems through positive effects on soil fertility and soil microbial diversity. The symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria allows pea and other legume crops to supply the soil with nitrogen and, therefore, to significantly reduce the application of external nitrogen fertilisers. Therefore, pea plays an important role especially in low-input farming systems. The growing market for plant- based protein supply is likely to promote pea cultivation in the near future. However, pea production is severely challenged by various soil-borne pathogens that form a Pea Root Rot Complex (PRRC) causing root-rot diseases. Despite considerable progress in resistance breeding against individual pathogens, current pea varieties lack resistance against multiple interacting pathogens. The overall goal of this thesis was to contribute to the understanding of resistance against root rot pathogen complexes in pea. Chapter 1 gives an overview of the importance of pea as a future key player in agricultural systems and the food sector before introducing the pea root rot complex concept and its relevance for research on resistance. Furthermore, the most recent developments in molecular biology relevant for molecular plant breeding of pea are briefly summarised and an overview of quantitative real-time PCR relevant for research on microbial interactions in the pea root rot complex is given. Chapter 2 reviews the current knowledge of resistance against root- rot pathogens in major grain legumes, highlights the importance of the host genotype in determining the composition of plant-associated microbial communities and how the root associated microbiome relates to plant health. In addition, major findings on the role of root exudation in disease susceptibility and resistance of grain legumes are summarised. Finally, it delineates how this knowledge could be integrated in resistance breeding of grain legumes. In Chapter 3, a resistance screening assay was established based on infested soil from an agricultural field that showed severe pea root rot pressure. This approach was chosen in order to account for the whole rhizosphere microbiome - including the naturally occuring pathogen complex - in the assessment of root rot resistance in pea. The initial ITS- amplicon sequencing of the fungal rhizosphere community of diseased pea roots grown in the infested soil showed a root community of evenly abundant fungal taxonomic units not dominated by a few taxa. This finding points at complex interactions within the PRRC. Two hundred and sixty-one pea cultivars, landraces and breeding lines were screened for resistance on the naturally infested field soil in a controlled conditions experiment. The screening system allowed for a reproducible assessment of disease parameters among the tested genotypes. Broad sense heritabilities on the infested soil were H2 = 0.89 for plant emergence, H2 = 0.43 for root rot index and H2 = 0.51 for relative shoot dry weight. The resistance ranking was verified in an on-farm experiment with nine pea genotypes in two field sites: The controlled conditions root rot index showed a significant correlation with the resistance ranking in the field site with high PRRC infestation (Spearman's ρ = 0.73, p = .03). The screening system offers a tool for selection at early stages of the plant development, and for the study of plant resistance in the light of complex plant-microbe interactions. For Chapter 4, a subset of five resistant and three susceptible pea genotypes was selected based on the initial screening. In analogy to the previous experiment, a controlled conditions experiment was setup up in order to assess and validate resistance of the eight pea genotypes on four soils. Plant growth was significantly reduced on the three sick soils compared to the healthy soil. Despite the significantly different levels of disease pressure in the three infested soils (ANOVA: p < .001) and the strong genotype effect (p < .001), no significant soil × genotype interaction (p < .342) was found for plant growth reduction. In addition to disease assessments, ten key microbial taxa (eight putative pea pathogens and two putative beneficials) were quantified in the roots by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Fusarium solani, F. oxysporum and Aphanomyces euteiches were the most abundant pathogens in diseased roots from the three sick soils. Further, various levels of the pathogens F. avenaceum, F. redolens, Rhizoctonia solani, D. pinodella and Pythium sp. as well as the potential antagonist Clonostachys rosea were quantified by qPCR. The contribution of individual pathogens to root rot and growth reduction differed among the three sick soils: F. solani and F. oxysporum showed significant correlations (Spearman correlations; p < 0.05) with root rot index and relative shoot dry weight in the two soils with the highest infestation level; A. euteiches showed significant relations with disease in two sick soils from Germany. The quantities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were negatively correlated with root rot index and positively correlated with relative shoot dry weight in all sick soils. Furthermore, the root microbial composition differed significantly among the pea genotypes (PERMANOVA; p < .0001) and the soils (p < .0001) and a significant pea genotype × soil interaction was evidenced (p < .0001). In addition, resistant pea genotypes showed significantly lower F. solani and A. euteiches, and higher arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi abundance in the roots (Wilcoxon rank-sum test; p < .05). These results give insights into the complex interaction between key microorganisms of the PRRC and the plant, by pointing out potential key microorganisms in the root rot pathobiome. Further disentanglement of this complex and the validation of key microbial players can be harnessed by resistance breeding. Chapter 5 reviews the experimental approaches and results from the previous chapters before discussing the major findings and implications for future research and resistance breeding. I also raise the question if and how knowledge about complex soil microorganisms-plant feedbacks can be incorporated in resistance screenings and breeding efforts to conclude that today we are at a point where information on microbial complexes could indeed assist resistance breeding. However, our current state of knowledge does not yet allow to design specific microbiome-enabled selection-tools. This last chapter will also give short outlooks and indicate possible future lines of research in the field of microbe-mediated plant resistance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000452791",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/452791","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Plant-microbe interaction||disease resistance||plant breeding||Sustainable agriculture","The root rot complex of pea - Screening for resistance and quantification of microbial  key players in the rhizosphere",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2020-11-24T11:28:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"26792",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This enhanced thermal tolerance, which was associated with differential upregulation of three heat-shock protein genes, allowed aphids to occupy higher and warmer regions of infected host plants when displaced from cooler regions by competition with a larger aphid species, R. maidis. Infection thereby led to an expansion of the fundamental niche of the vector.

The resistant cultivar “Leccino” was compared to the susceptible cultivar “Cellina di Nardò”, in order to identify microbial taxa and parameters potentially involved in resistance mechanisms. Metabarcoding of 16S rRNA genes and fungal ITS2 was used to characterize both total and endophytic microbiota in olive branches and leaves. “Cellina di Nardò” showed a drastic dysbiosis after X. fastidiosa infection, while “Leccino” (both infected and uninfected) maintained a similar microbiota. The genus Pseudomonas dominated all “Leccino” and Xf-uninfected “Cellina di Nardò” trees, whereas Ammoniphilus prevailed in Xf-infected “Cellina di Nardò”. Diversity of microbiota in Xf-uninfected “Leccino” was higher than in Xf-uninfected “Cellina di Nardò”. Several bacterial taxa specifically associated with “Leccino” showed potential interactions with X. fastidiosa. The maintenance of a healthy microbiota with higher diversity and the presence of cultivar-specific microbes might support the resistance of “Leccino” to X. fastidiosa.

In this study we investigate whether the δ18OP can be used to elucidate the effect of soil pH on P cycling in grasslands. Soils and plants were sampled from different fertilisation and lime treatments of the Park Grass long term experiment at Rothamsted Research, UK. The soils were sequentially extracted to isolate different soil P pools, including available P and corresponding δ18OP values were determined. We did not observe changes in plant δ18OP value, but soil P δ18OP values changed, and lower δ18OP values were associated with higher soil pH values. At sites where P was not limiting, available P δ18OP increased by up to 3‰ when lime was applied. We show that the δ18OP method is a useful tool to investigate the effect of pH on soil P cycling under field conditions as it highlights that different soil processes must govern P availability as pH shifts. The next challenge is now to identify these underlying processes, enabling better management of soil P at different pH.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000399680",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-020-59103-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/399680","en","Nature Publishing Group",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Changes of oxygen isotope values of soil P pools associated with changes in soil pH",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-02-15T09:24:09Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85079080771",,"000562827100003","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Without undergoing a breeding process, it can be used to deploy natural resistances to established cultivars. New resistant cultivars could greatly reduce pesticide usage and yield losses caused by pathogens, thereby contributing to sustainable crop production. Cisgenesis is especially beneficial for vegetatively propagated crops like apple as its breeding is constrained by a long juvenility phase and allogamy. Apple breeding always results in a novel cultivar that should be able to outcompete (susceptible) established cultivars with a superior combination of favorable traits. In contrast, cisgenic plants should not differ from their original variety with the exception of the newly added trait. As a supportive tool in breeding, cisgenesis should allow a rapid adoption of disease resistant cultivars. Here we report the development of seven cisgenic lines, three carrying the scab resistance gene Rvi15 and four the fire blight resistance gene FB_MR5. The popular apple cultivar ‘Gala Galaxy’, which is highly susceptible to several diseases as scab and fire blight, was chosen to be modified by cisgenesis. We assessed disease resistance in the greenhouse confirming that the approach significantly improved disease resistance. The copy number of the cisgene was assessed by qPCR and the integration site was investigated using the targeted locus amplification (TLA) approach based on short-read sequencing. To further evaluate tree and fruit-related traits like growth habit, flowering time or fruit quality, a field trial with a fire blight resistant cisgenic line (C44.4.146) has been initiated. The design of the experiment gives the unique opportunity to compare this cisgenic line to its wild type but also to (natural) sport mutants of the same cultivar.

The coupling of non-cryogenic and tuneable light sources with different detection schemes, such as direct absorption quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS), cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) and off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (OA-ICOS), has enabled the production of commercially available and field-deployable N2O isotopic analyzers. In contrast to traditional isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), these instruments are inherently selective for position-specific 15N substitution and provide real-time data, with minimal or no sample pretreatment, which is highly attractive for process studies.  Here, we compared the performance of N2O isotope laser spectrometers with the three most common detection schemes: OA-ICOS (N2OIA-30e-EP, ABB – Los Gatos Research Inc.), CRDS (G5131-i, Picarro Inc.) and QCLAS (dual QCLAS and preconcentration, trace gas extractor (TREX)-mini QCLAS, Aerodyne Research Inc.). For each instrument, the precision, drift and repeatability of N2O mole fraction [N2O] and isotope data were tested. The analyzers were then characterized for their dependence on [N2O], gas matrix composition (O2, Ar) and spectral interferences caused by H2O, CO2, CH4 and CO to develop analyzer-specific correction functions. Subsequently, a simulated two-end-member mixing experiment was used to compare the accuracy and repeatability of corrected and calibrated isotope measurements that could be acquired using the different laser spectrometers.  Our results show that N2O isotope laser spectrometer performance is governed by an interplay between instrumental precision, drift, matrix effects and spectral interferences. To retrieve compatible and accurate results, it is necessary to include appropriate reference materials following the identical treatment (IT) principle during every measurement. Remaining differences between sample and reference gas compositions have to be corrected by applying analyzer-specific correction algorithms. These matrix and trace gas correction equations vary considerably according to N2O mole fraction, complicating the procedure further. Thus, researchers should strive to minimize differences in composition between sample and reference gases. In closing, we provide a calibration workflow to guide researchers in the operation of N2O isotope laser spectrometers in order to acquire accurate N2O isotope analyses. We anticipate that this workflow will assist in applications where matrix and trace gas compositions vary considerably (e.g., laboratory incubations, N2O liberated from wastewater or groundwater), as well as extend to future analyzer models and instruments focusing on isotopic species of other molecules.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000420259",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-13-2797-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/420259","en","Copernicus Publications",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"N2O isotopocule measurements using laser spectroscopy: analyzer characterization and intercomparison",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-15T03:06:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85086100749",,"000537743100003","Atmos. meas. tech.","5","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The relationship between rhizobial diversity and plant performance is not yet clear.  Many studies show lower rhizobial diversity is more beneficial to plant growth, but at the same time soils and legume roots contain large amounts of rhizobial and other root-associated bacterial diversity. This suggests we need to better understand the ecological factors that drive the diversity and composition of these microbes in space and time.  Understanding the ecological processes driving the diversity of rhizobia and other root-associated bacteria is a prerequisite to potentially manage their beneficial functions to plants. This thesis explores the biogeography and ecological drivers of root nodule bacterial diversity across temporal and spatial scales in rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), a South African-endemic legume crop. The main goal is to understand which factors determine rhizobial diversity and composition at the plant, field, and regional scales, and in both cultivated and wild rooibos populations.  Rooibos is adapted to acidic and sandy soils very poor in mineral nutrients and organic matter, and grows under low rainfall conditions (150-450 mm y-1. Rooibos has multiple adaptations to withstand mineral nutrient limitation, among which rhizobial symbioses play a central role. Rooibos associates to a diverse range of rhizobial genera, Mesorhizobium being the dominant group, but frequently interacting with Bradyrhizobium, Rhizobium, and Burkholderia. The plant is particularly interesting to study ecological drivers of rhizobial diversity because 1) plantations lie adjacent to wild populations across the landscape; 2) the plant grows in a climatically and edaphically heterogeneous region with high speciation rates; and 3) the crop has been recently domesticated (~70 years), providing a good analog to study rhizobial diversity before and after crop domestication.  This thesis is based on a dual marker approach, in which root nodule bacterial communities of rooibos were characterized using a functional and a taxonomic gene markers. We sequenced a 455 bp-long fragment of the rhizobial gene nodA (encoding an N-acyltransferase important to induce root nodulation), and a 817 bp-long fragment of the taxonomic marker gene gyrB (encoding a topoisomerase common to all bacterial taxa). This combination ensured a majority of the bacterial community of rooibos root nodules could be described.  The thesis starts providing a framework to assess how root microbial symbioses differ between cultivated and the ancestral counterparts of legumes. Given the coexistence of cultivated and wild populations, rooibos appears as a good study case upon which the framework could be developed. This framework provided theoretical and experimental basis to assess the ability of different cultivars to associate to, and benefit from, rhizobia from their wild ancestors. This provided a baseline from which a pot experiment growing rooibos on soils from cultivated and uncultivated soils was conceived. The aim of this experiment was to address how geographical and soil abiotic factors drive the diversity of root nodule bacteria in rooibos seedlings. The addition of sheep dung in the experiment revealed the diversity of rhizobia colonizing root nodules was weakly dependant on the soil environment, and strongly related to stochastic assembly processes driven by root biomass and geographic isolation. Rhizobial community composition displayed a strong geographical pattern, whereby different farms contained distinct rhizobial communities, and these became more different with geographic distance. Instead, the communities from plants grown on cultivated and uncultivated soils had low levels of dissimilarity. In a field survey, root nodules from cultivated and wild rooibos plants were collected, and their diversity was related to rooibos foliar nutrient concentrations, plant genotype, geographical location, and soil nutrient concentrations. This revealed that rooibos is nodulated by a core of dominant and widespread Mesorhizobium strains, but whose dominance depends on the geographical location more than any other factor. Organic rooibos cultivation maintained high levels of root nodule diversity at the field level, but had a homogenizing effect at the regional scale. There were established weak but significant links between rooibos foliar nutrient concentrations and rhizobial community structure, suggesting different rooibos populations may harbour distinct root nodule communities. In the pot experiment soils from cultivated and wild rooibos populations were mixed, as a way to increase the available rhizobial pools in the soil. This so-called community coalescence events could introduce rhizobial diversity from wild rooibos populations to arable land after seedling transplantation. This revealed that fertilization, despite not changing the composition of rhizobial communities, promoted the dominance of a larger number of taxa. It had a synergistic effect with soil mixing, whereby a Mesorhizobium OTU that was rare in plants grown on soils from cultivated and wild rooibos populations became dominant only after combining soil mixing and fertilizer addition. Higher soil rhizobial diversity, however, had no influence on any plant response. In summary, through the description of the predominant root nodule bacterial groups, this thesis shows that rooibos root nodule diversity is geographically structured, and weakly affected by the measured environmental factors. Rooibos cultivation appears as a homogenizing force of rhizobial diversity at regional scales, while soil mixing appears as an alternative to associate rooibos seedlings to rhizobia from unmanaged populations locally. Overall, this thesis shows that the ecological drivers of root nodule diversity differ across scales: at the root level, diversity increases probabilistically with root biomass; at the population level, local soil abiotic factors and potentially plant ecotypes define the composition of root nodule communities; and regionally, barriers to dispersal seem to drive divergence between rooibos root nodule communities. Over time, some evidence suggests rhizobial diversity is filtered out as the post-fire succession proceeds in the progress of rooibos from seedling to maturity. Future research should address how agronomic practices in rooibos farming can promote potential benefits of rhizobial symbioses under changing climatic conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000423576",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/423576","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Ecological processes governing the assembly of bacterial root nodule communities in rooibos (Aspalathus linearis)",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2020-06-29T11:17:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"26544",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The lack of long-term, ecosystem-scale measurements causes large uncertainties in Hg0 flux estimates. It currently remains unclear whether terrestrial ecosystems are net sinks or sources of atmospheric Hg0. Here, we show a detailed validation of direct Hg0 flux measurements based on the eddy covariance technique (Eddy Mercury) using a Lumex RA-915 AM mercury monitor. The flux detection limit derived from a zero-flux experiment in the laboratory was 0.22 ng m−2 h−1 (maximum) with a 50 % cutoff at 0.074 ng m−2 h−1. We present eddy covariance NEE measurements of Hg0 over a low-Hg soil (41–75 ng Hg g−1 in the topsoil, referring to a depth of 0–10 cm), conducted in summer 2018 at a managed grassland at the Swiss FluxNet site in Chamau, Switzerland (CH-Cha). The statistical estimate of the Hg0 flux detection limit under outdoor conditions at the site was 5.9 ng m−2 h−1 (50 % cutoff). We measured a net summertime emission over a period of 34 d with a median Hg0 flux of 2.5 ng m−2 h−1 (with a −0.6 to 7.4 ng m−2 h−1 range between the 25th and 75th percentiles). We observed a distinct diel cycle with higher median daytime fluxes (8.4 ng m−2 h−1) than nighttime fluxes (1.0 ng m−2 h−1). Drought stress during the measurement campaign in summer 2018 induced partial stomata closure of vegetation. Partial stomata closure led to a midday depression in CO2 uptake, which did not recover during the afternoon. The median CO2 flux was only 24 % of the median CO2 flux measured during the same period in the previous year (2017). We suggest that partial stomata closure also dampened Hg0 uptake by vegetation, resulting in a NEE of Hg0 that was dominated by soil emission. Finally, we provide suggestions to further improve the precision and handling of the “Eddy Mercury” system in order to assure its suitability for long-term NEE measurements of Hg0 over natural background surfaces with low soil Hg concentrations (< 100 ng g−1). With these improvements, Eddy Mercury has the potential to be integrated into global networks of micrometeorological tower sites (FluxNet) and to provide the long-term observations on terrestrial atmosphere Hg0 exchange necessary to validate regional and global mercury models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000411374",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-13-2057-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/411374","en","Copernicus Publications",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Eddy covariance flux measurements of gaseous elemental mercury over a grassland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-04-23T11:20:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85083873386",,"000529335800002","Atmos. meas. tech.","4","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In these commercial farming systems, this period represents almost 50% of the life, which totally comprises of 63 days, namely 21 days of incubation followed by 42 days of the growing period. Per se, the supply of nutrients provided by the yolk sack is limited towards the end of embryogenesis prior to hatching. An imbalance between the increasing embryo requirements and the limited nutrient reserves in the egg confines the development and growth of the embryo pre-hatch. During the pre-hatching period, the availability of nutrients may differentially impact on the development of the immune system and modify inflammatory responses, specifically in fast growing broiler chicken. Clearly, a functionally more advanced immune system may decrease the susceptibility to post-hatching diseases. The innate immune system in chickens is the first line of defense against pathogens that cause a wide range of infections. The response of the innate immunity in chickens is very important, especially at early age post-hatch, as the adaptive immunity is immature at this stage. While most available studies addressing the effect of genetic selection of chickens on the immune response have focused on the adaptive immune response, only few studies investigated this effect on the innate immune response. Therefore, the knowledge about the impact of the genetic selection for growth and meat production of today’s modern broiler chickens on the innate immune response is scarce. The aim of the current thesis was to assess characteristics of the developing innate immune system of chickens. Two experiments were conducted to investigate whether the immune system of chickens post-hatch (A) displays a variation between local and broiler types, and (B) is affected by in ovo feeding of nutritious and immunostimulant substances. In experiment A, the effect of different chicken broiler types, namely [Ross-308 and Cobb] and local types, namely [Appenzeller Spitzhauben (AS), Appenzeller Barthuhn (AB), and Schweizerhuhn (SH)] on the development of the immune system was assessed. In experiment B, the effect of in ovo feeding of glucose and butyric acid (BA) as nutrients, and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG) as immunostimulant on the development of the immune system was assessed. In both experiments, the body weight at hatch as well as the body weight, immune organ [bursa fabricii (bursa), spleen and thymus] weight, the gene expression of several innate-immune related genes (IL1β, IL6, IL8L2, TLR1β, TLR3, TLR15, TLR21, CATHB1, MBL2) in the bursa and spleen were studied at days 7 and 14 post-hatch. Experiment A revealed that the genetic selection of broilers in favour of growth has contributed to a decline in the relative size of the immune organs as the relative amount of muscle tissue has increased. Whether this decreased immune organ weight has effects on the functionality and magnitude of immune response could not be confirmed by gene expression analyses. Although a chicken-type effect for most of the studied basal gene expression levels was found (IL1β, IL8L2, TLR1β, TLR15, TLR21 and MBL2, p < 0.05), a high variation was seen in both, the local and broilers types. Experiment B showed that in ovo feeding of glucose numerically led to an increase of the body weight of chickens at hatch and on day 7. Moreover, in ovo feeding of glucose led to the tendency of an increase in immune organ weight (bursa of on days 7 and 14, and spleen on day 7). In addition, in ovo feeding of glucose affected (p < 0.05) the expression of some immune-related genes such as IL1β, IL6, TLR3, TLR15, TLR21, and MBL2, but this moderate response was neither consistent in time, between both tissues nor between the two supplemented dose-levels. This suggests that the physiological and immunological responses of broiler chickens early post-hatch are not strongly affected by the applied nutrient supplementation during embryogenesis. The outcome of this thesis provides weak, yet interesting indications of the genetic variation between different chicken types in terms of the response of the innate immune system during early life post-hatch. However, as this genetic variation was not largely observed between broiler and local chicken types, a general conclusion regarding possible genetic selection effects on the innate immune system cannot be drawn. The study provides first insights into understanding the response of the innate immune system after hatching towards nutritious and immunostimulant supplementation during embryogenesis.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000421017",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/421017","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Understanding the innate immune response of chickens",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2020-06-18T10:24:10Z","2021-06-18",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"26695",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Disturbances such as hot and dry summers in 2003, 2015 and 2018 and extended periods of cold weather in 2013 and 2017 affected Swiss agricultural production. While the regulation of food imports allows ensuring food security for Swiss residents, economic effects of climatic disturbances on the activities of actors operating within the system (e.g. agro-input suppliers, farmers, processors) remains a challenge. On the other hand, the Swiss food system is heavily reliant on state support for its functioning. The reduction of state support, which is a current global trend, would represent a significant shock for the Swiss actors. Hence, this dissertation explored the ability of the Swiss food system to function despite (a) the increasing climatic disturbances and (b) removal of border protection (free trade) with the European Union. To represent the Swiss food system, we chose four value chains: milk, beef, wheat and potato. Resilience of these value chains is essential for the Swiss food system, as they are the base for the traditional Swiss diet and account for 41% of the total agricultural value of the country. The thesis relies on a combination of quantitative surveys among producers, processors and consumers; and a transdisciplinary research approach based on engagement with stakeholders.   Paper 1 addresses resilience of four value chains to the effects of potentially introducing a free trade with the EU based on stakeholder surveys and workshops. The results suggest that the Swiss value chains do not possess resilience capacity to secure the current level of self-sufficiency by withstanding the effects of the free trade scenario. Furthermore, we identified that the studied value chains have limited adaptive capacity due to the side-effects (e.g. a strategy of one actor negatively affects other actors) and limitations (e.g. insufficient consumer loyalty) of strategies aimed at coping with the effects of free trade. Also, the results suggest that an increase of specific resilience to the effects of free trade has a potential to decrease overall resilience of the value chains.   Paper 2 presents measures to increase resilience of the value chains to drought identified at stakeholder workshops. The measures are mostly focused on the production activity and are aimed to avoid production disruptions and mitigate economic losses among farmers. While some of these measures (e.g. irrigation, drought-resistance varieties, off-farm income) can be implemented by farmers themselves, other measures (e.g. compensating prices, adjustment of quality requirements) require interventions from stakeholders including post-production actors (processors, retailers) as well as consumers. However, our results indicate that such implementation is hampered by conflicting interests, disproportional exposure of actors to climate disturbances and the lack of motivation by the actors to act beyond securing their own operational needs.    Paper 3 summarizes results of consumer surveys and stakeholder workshops in order to investigate whether consumers could contribute to the resilience of the food value chains in case of an extreme weather disturbance. The results of the consumer surveys suggest that Swiss consumers favor the idea to pay more for food if farmers are affected. On the other hand, practitioners expressed several concerns regarding feasibility and implementation of consumer support in practice.   The results of the studies on both scenarios, drought and free trade, suggest that an increase of resilience in one activity can have negative implications on other activities. Hence, we conclude that resilience assessment and enhancement should be based on systemic approaches that allow capturing broader effects of resilience than those of just individual actors. Furthermore, the results suggest that resilience of the value chains is subject to conflicting interests of value chains’ actors. This emphasizes the need for further research on motivations for actors to accommodate strategies that enhance resilience of their value chains along with the strategies that increase their individual resilience.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000477336",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477336","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Resilience||food value chains","Resilience of the Swiss food system",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::650 - Management & auxiliary services","2021-04-01T13:54:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27027",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we used a dilution-to-extinction approach to simulate diversity loss in a methanotrophic landfill cover soil community. Combining analyses of CH4 flux and community structure, we found a linear decrease of CH4 oxidation rates with the number of taxonomic units lost.

In order to benefit human nutrition bovine milk fatty acid composition and phenol content are effectively manipulated by the cow’s diet. However, response times taken for these alterations to occur have not been quantified. In the present study, fatty acid composition and phenol content of the milk were evaluated after three days of feeding six cows six different diets, supplemented with six different tanniferous plants (hazel, silver birch, blackcurrant, grape vine, wood avens and rosebay willow with total tannin concentrations of 26, 36, 42, 52, 55 and 79 g/kg dry matter, respectively). Lucerne was applied as the low-phenol control diet. Substantial changes in total phenols and fatty acids were found in milk samples after just three days. Proportions of cis-9 trans-11 C18:2 and trans-11 C18:1 declined by 29 and 68%, respectively, in comparison to milk from cows fed lucerne, indicating a definitive ruminal biohydrogenation response. However, there were no significant effects between test plants and lucerne when comparing C18:3 n-3 and C18:2 n-6 proportions in milk fat. So, it was demonstrated that phenols and certain individual fatty acids in bovine milk can be rapidly modified by adding specific tanniferous plants to the diet.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000461486",,"1230-1388",,"10.22358/jafs/131171/2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461486","en","Omnitech Press",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Blackcurrant||Grape vine||Hazel||Rosebay willow||Silver birch||Wood avens","Rapid responses in bovine milk fatty acid composition and phenol content to various tanniferous forages",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-01-12T06:43:12Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Identification of the presence of positive associative effects in dairy cattle: Environmental and animal health effects of suitable plant species combinations exceed adverse side-effects on digestion and metabolism.","ETH-49 15-1","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,,,,"000604267000002","J.

The discovery of over 80 nests in Switzerland, southern Germany and Scotland enabled for the first time a closer investigation of its nesting biology and prompted the assessment of the species’ phenology, distribution and habitat. O. uncinata nested in self-excavated burrows inside the bark of both living trunks and dead stumps of Pinus sylvestris. The nests were excavated at a height of 10–220 cm above ground either on the underside of prominences of longitudinal bark ribs or inside beetle borings and extended more or less vertically upwards. They consisted of a single straight to slightly curved burrow with rarely one to three side burrows, had a total length of 1.2–12.0 cm and contained 1–6 brood cells. The brood cells, which faced downwards with the larval provisions being located in the upper cell half, were separated from each other by one-layered walls of chewed leaves (“leaf pulp”). The nests were sealed with a plug of 2–4 closely adjacent walls of leaf pulp. DNA metabarcoding of cell and plug walls revealed that Potentilla and Fragaria (Rosaceae) served as leaf pulp sources. Pre-imaginal mortality amounted to 77%, partly caused by brood parasites such as Sapyga similis (Sapygidae) and Cacoxenus indagator (Drosophilidae) or predators such as snakeflies (Raphidioptera). At low elevations, O. uncinata needs one year for its development and overwinters as imago inside the nest, whereas in the subalpine zone of the Alps it has a two-year cycle passing the first winter as prepupa and the second winter as imago. O. uncinata starts to emerge between the end of March at low elevations and the end of May at higher elevations qualifying as an early flying bee like the other European O. (Melanosmia) species. The distribution of O. uncinata in Central Europe and Scotland largely coincides with the occurrence of P. sylvestris. As in the pine, it extends over a wide altitudinal range from below 100 m up to 1900 m a.s.l. and encompasses dry and wet as well as warm and cold habitats including open pine forests, inner and outer forest edges dominated by pine and isolated pine groups. At a few locations in the subalpine zone of the Alps, O. uncinata occurs in the absence of P. sylvestris; here, the thick bark of Larix decidua serves as a substitute nesting substrate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000444424",,"2535-0889",,"10.3897/ALPENTO.4.53489","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444424","en","Pensoft Publishers",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Anthophila||Apiformes||Mandibular strength||Osmiini||Rhagium||X-raying","Unique nesting biology of Osmia ( Melanosmia) uncinata, a Palaearctic osmiine bee specialized on thick-barked conifers (Hymenoptera, Megachilidae)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-10-04T02:48:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091668092",,"000553973700001",,,"Alpine Entomology","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Experimental feeding lasted for 21 days. Measurements and collection of milk, faeces and urine spot samples were performed in weeks 0 (baseline), 1 and 3. All cows were kept in one herd on pasture; fresh grass and grass hay were provided in the barn during night. Milk yield was recorded and cows wore sensor halters for recording chewing activity. In urine, total nitrogen and purine derivatives were measured; faeces were analyzed for protein, fibre and particle fractions; in milk, solid concentrations were determined. The data was analyzed with a general linear model. Cows did not show differences in general eating and rumination behaviour, but needed time to accept the tannin-containing pellets. Milk yield and composition were not affected by treatment, except for lactose content. No relevant differences between treatments were found for urinary and faecal parameters. In conclusion, although technically easy to supplement, pellets containing chestnut tannin extract were not readily accepted by the cows and effects on protein digestion and metabolism were not found. Successful on-farm application of chestnut extract in order to improve nitrogen efficiency therefore seems questionable.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000421560",,"1230-1388",,"10.22358/jafs/121053/2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/421560","en","The Kielanowski Institute of Animal Physiology and Nutrition, PAS",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","cattle||protein efficiency||low-input||hydrolysable tannin||field experiment||chewing sensor","Graded supplementation of chestnut tannins to dairy cows fed protein-rich spring pasture: effects on indicators of protein utilization",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-06-22T06:33:50Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000543302000001","J.

In diapausing carnivores and marsupials, growth arrest of the blastocyst is coincident with a quiescent corpus luteum (CL). In the roe deer, progesterone is produced throughout diapause and the blastocyst exhibits very slow growth. To date, early roe deer embryos of known age have not been described. Therefore, it is not known at which stage and at what pace the roe deer embryo enters diapause. To collect multiple embryos of known gestational age, we performed cycle synchronization and superovulation in captive roe deer prior to artificial insemination (AI) and natural breeding (NB), respectively. Superovulatory responses were evaluated based on ultrasonographic detection of CL formation on the day of in vivo embryo flushing and on plasma progesterone (P4) analysis. In total, 33 superovulation treatments resulted in 6.6 ± 2.2 (mean ± SD) CL per doe on the day of embryo flushing. At days 6 and 7 after AI, 37 multicellular embryos up to the morula stage were retrieved from 8 does. At day 12 and 13 after natural breeding, 28 embryos, mainly at the blastocyst stage (n=20), were collected from 7 does. Multiple embryos could be collected from single animals, proving the feasibility of superovulation in this species. Compared to other diapausing and non-diapausing species where blastocysts have formed at days 6 – 8, roe deer embryo development appeared to be already decelerated prior to the blastocyst stage. The roe deer might therefore be well suited as a model to investigate mechanisms regulating embryonic growth velocity with respect to cell cycle control. © 2020 Third International Symposium on Embryonic Diapause.",,,,,,"10.1530/biosciprocs.10.012","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456855","en","BioScientifica",,,,,"Gliding into diapause: early embryo development in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)",,"Conference Paper","Metadata only","Proceedings of III International Symposium on Embryonic Diapause",,"2020-12-17T13:02:46Z",,,,"yes","3rd International Symposium on Embryonic Diapause","June 2-6, 2019","Ascona, Switzerland","Embryonic Diapause in roe deer: a model for deciphering the control of developmental velocity","159734","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,,,,"Bioscientifica Proceedings","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While the rut takes place in July/August, rapid embryo elongation and implantation take place in December/January, after a five month period of embryonic diapause. The post-implantation development lasts another five months and an average of two fawns are born in May. As fertilization and subsequent implantation are decoupled, the roe deer offers the opportunity to study changes in hormones, embryonic and endometrial morphology and transcriptome dynamics, as well as the uterine microenvironment in a high time-dimension. So far, it has been shown that peripheral increases in prolactin, estradiol-17β and progesterone are a consequence, rather than the cause of reactivation of embryo development. Increased uterine secretions and the presence of embryonic cell organelles coincide with embryo elongation. This suggests that the “quiet embryo” hypothesis might hold for diapausing embryos. The factors controlling embryonic developmental pace in the roe deer are yet to be identified. We propose a multi-omics approach to determine the temporal molecular changes during diapause, prior to embryo elongation, which morphologically marks the reactivation of embryo development, and upon elongation. Thereby, we will obtain insights into the molecular mechanisms and environmental cues that inhibit and drive cell proliferation. By data integration, we aim at identifying the origin of the factors associated with reduced embryonic developmental pace. The knowledge of a species-independent mechanism driving embryo development past the blastocyst stage is of high interest to reproductive biologists and for species conservation programs.",,,,,,"10.1530/biosciprocs.10.004","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465524","en","BioScientifica",,,,"Embryonic diapause||European roe deer||Embryo-meternal communication","Embryonic diapause in the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)",,"Conference Paper","Metadata only","Proceedings of III International Symposium on Embryonic Diapause",,"2021-01-26T07:51:36Z",,,,"yes","3rd International Symposium on Embryonic Diapause","June 2-6, 2019","Ascona, Switzerland","Embryonic Diapause in roe deer: a model for deciphering the control of developmental velocity||Embryonic Diapause: pluripotency on hold?","159734||185026","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,,,,"Bioscientifica Proceedings","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Extreme Ereignisse wie Stürme, Überschwemmungen, Trocken- und Hitzeperioden haben direkte Auswirkungen auf unsere Lebenswelt und unseren Alltag. Weniger offensichtlich aber von grosser Tragweite sind die Einflüsse, die der Klimawandel auf die Jahreszeiten ausübt. Die Verschiebung von Blüh- und Ernteterminen, der Rückgang von Schneetagen in höheren Lagen und gar das Ausbleiben von Winterschnee im Mittelland zeigt vor allem mit Blick über mehrere Jahre und Jahrzehnte die gravierenden Folgen für die Umwelt aber auch für Landwirtschaft, Tourismus und Raumplanung. In phänologischen Beobachtungen – breit gefasst definiert als jahreszeitlich wiederkehrende Erscheinungsformen in der Umwelt – lassen sich sinnlich und alltäglich die Veränderungen erfahren, die der Klimawandel mit sich bringt. Darüber hinaus bilden die Überlieferungen dieser Beobachtungen von Generation zu Generation wichtige Brücken in Familiengeschichten und wichtigen Ortsbeschreibungen. Vor allem aber bringen uns die Beobachtungen näher, wie eng Mensch und Natur schon immer verbunden waren. Am Geographischen Institut der Universität Bern hat phänologische Forschung eine lange Tradition. Was in den späten 1960er-Jahren als Beobachtungsnetz und Datengrundlage für die Raum- und Agrareignungsplanung begann, mündete 1970 in die erste komplette Saison des Beobachtungsprogramms BernClim und bildet heute zusammen mit dem Datenschatz des Schweizer Phänologie Beobachtungsnetzes von MeteoSchweiz das Rückgrat für raum-zeitliche Beschreibungen seit Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts. Beobachtungen seit dem Spätmittelalter bieten darüber hinaus die einmalige Möglichkeit, auch langfristige Veränderungen des Klimas zu zeigen. Zum 50-jährigen Bestehen des Beobachtungsprogramms BernClim entstand die vorliegende Broschüre. Über die Aktivitäten in Bern hinaus kommen auch Forschende zu Wort, die sich mit ebenso viel Herzblut und Ausdauer für die phänologischen Beobachtungen und Auswertungen an anderen Institutionen engagieren. Sie forschen mit Pflanzen- und Tierbeobachtungen, im Wald und auf dem Feld und ziehen Schlüsse aus Wetterdaten, Schnee- und Gewässermessungen. Die Grundlage für viele der hier präsentierten Jahreszeiten-Geschichten bilden Beobachtungen, die zum grossen Teil von Freiwilligen und oft über Jahre und Jahrzehnte gemacht wurden. Phänologie ist ohne dieses Engagement nicht möglich und bringt die Herausforderung mit sich, aus vielen individuellen Beobachtungen ein systematisches, grösseres Bild zu zeichnen. Die Publikation dieser Broschüre wurde durch die Sebastiana-Stiftung, das Oeschger-Zentrum für Klimaforschung (OCCR) und die Kommission für Phänologie und Saisonalität (KPS) der Akademie der Naturwissenschaften Schweiz (SCNAT) unterstützt. Gewidmet ist sie allen, die sich dafür einsetzen, das Zusammenspiel zwischen Mensch und Natur aus jahreszeitlicher Perspektive zu dokumentieren und besser zu verstehen.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000457612",,,,"10.4480/GB2020.G97.01","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/457612","de","Geographisches Institut der Universität Bern",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","climate change||seasonality","Klimawandel und Jahreszeiten",,"Report","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences","2020-12-21T08:16:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Geographica Bernensia","G97","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, little is known about the natural occurrence and competitiveness of such hybrids. We collected naturally formed hybrids between Festuca apennina, Festuca pratensis, and Lolium perenne in different habitats of Switzerland and the British Isles and studied their origin, the ease of their spontaneous formation, and their competitiveness with parental species. A special attention was paid to the largely sterile triploid forms and their rare sexual progeny. The triploid hybrid F. apennina x F. pratensis proved to be widespread and often highly competitive in Swiss permanent pastures. The majority of these hybrids originated from F. apennina as the seed parent although little or no F. apennina grew nearby. In an experimental setting with ample F. pratensis pollen provided by neighbouring plants, up to 20 % of seeds from open pollinated F. apennina plants were interspecific hybrids; among seeds collected in natural habitats, only 0.35 % were hybrids. At an experimental site at 1 000 m altitude, these triploid hybrids grew much more vigorously than corresponding tetraploid pure F. apennina, confirming their great competitiveness at such altitudes in permanent grasslands. The triploid hybrids were only marginally fertile suggesting that vegetative propagation by rhizomes is the cause of their competitive success in grassland. Moreover, triploid progeny retained the chromosome constitution of their mother plants indicating the possibility of apomixis. Natural triploid F. pratensis x L. perenne hybrids were partially female fertile (a seed set of 0.1 % or less) whereas diploid hybrids did not produce any viable seeds. Progenies of these triploids showed considerable chromosome alterations, such as loss of a genome or recombination due to homoeologous pairing, and only rarely the chromosome constitution of the triploid mother plant was retained. It was concluded that natural triploid interspecific hybrids could expand the range of their progenitor species and might function as bridges transferring genes between them.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000448993",,"0006-3134||1573-8264",,"10.32615/bp.2020.111","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448993","en","Springer",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Festuca apennina||Festuca pratensis||Lolium perenne||triploid hybrid","Spontaneous natural formation of interspecific hybrids within the Festuca-Lolium complex",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-01T08:22:06Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000579316200001","Biol. plant.

However, insight into their distribution and cycling in soil remains limited, particularly of lower-order IP (IP5 and IP4). This is because the quantification of lower-order IP typically requires a series of chemical extractions, including hypobromite oxidation to isolate IP, followed by chromatographic separation. Here, for the first time, we identify the chemical nature of organic P in four soil extracts following hypobromite oxidation using solution 31P NMR spectroscopy and transverse relaxation (T2) experiments. Soil samples analysed include A horizons from a Ferralsol (Colombia), a Cambisol and a Gleysol from Switzerland, and a Cambisol from Germany. Solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of the phosphomonoester region in soil extracts following hypobromite oxidation revealed an increase in the number of sharp signals (up to 70) and an on average 2-fold decrease in the concentration of the broad signal compared to the untreated soil extracts. We identified the presence of four stereoisomers of IP6, four stereoisomers of IP5, and scyllo-IP4. We also identified for the first time two isomers of myo-IP5 in soil extracts: myo-(1,2,4,5,6)-IP5 and myo-(1,3,4,5,6)-IP5. Concentrations of total IP ranged from 1.4 to 159.3 mg P per kg soil across all soils, of which between 9 % and 50 % were comprised of lower-order IP. Furthermore, we found that the T2 times, which are considered to be inversely related to the tumbling of a molecule in solution and hence its molecular size, were significantly shorter for the underlying broad signal compared to for the sharp signals (IP6) in soil extracts following hypobromite oxidation. In summary, we demonstrate the presence of a plethora of organic P compounds in soil extracts, largely attributed to IPs of various orders, and provide new insight into the chemical stability of complex forms of organic P associated with soil organic matter.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000449957",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-17-5079-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/449957","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Identification of lower-order inositol phosphates (IP5 and IP4) in soil extracts as determined by hypobromite oxidation and solution 31P NMR spectroscopy",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-11-05T20:14:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Identifying the chemical nature of organic phosphorus in soil extracts with increasing molecular weight","169256","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85094623943",,"000584389000001",,"20","Biogeosciences","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To address the lack of quantification and understanding of seasonality in soil respiration of tropical forests in the Congo Basin, soil CO2 fluxes and potential controlling factors were measured annually in two dominant forest types (lowland and montane) of the Congo Basin over 2 years at varying temporal resolution. Soil CO2 fluxes from the Congo Basin resulted in 3.45 ± 1.14 and 3.13 ± 1.22 µmol CO2 m−2 s−1 for lowland and montane forests, respectively. Soil CO2 fluxes in montane forest soils showed a clear seasonality with decreasing flux rates during the dry season. Montane forest soil CO2 fluxes were positively correlated with soil moisture, while CO2 fluxes in the lowland forest were not. Smaller differences of δ13C values of leaf litter, soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil CO2 indicated that SOC in lowland forests is more decomposed than in montane forests, suggesting that respiration is controlled by C availability rather than environmental factors. In general, C in montane forests was more enriched in 13C throughout the whole cascade of carbon intake via photosynthesis, litterfall, SOC, and soil CO2 compared to lowland forests, pointing to a more open system. Even though soil CO2 fluxes are similarly high in lowland and montane forests of the Congo Basin, the drivers of them seem to be different, i.e., soil moisture for montane forest and C availability for lowland forest.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456954",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-17-6207-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456954","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Seasonality, drivers, and isotopic composition of soil CO2 fluxes from tropical forests of the Congo Basin",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-12-17T16:52:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85097591608",,"000599338300003",,"23","Biogeosciences","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study aimed at drawing lessons regarding use of SMS recording system among dairy farmers. Of the 210 participants, 85% were farmers and 25% were other dairy value chain players. Farmers were from eight intervened (monitored for 18 months) and eight control Milk Bulking Groups (MBG).

Milk production was the most recorded data and analyses showed that mean yield in litres per cow (10.7 +/- 0.14) was similar to average estimate in literature for Malawi (10.4 +/- 1.57). Household daily milk consumption (1.2 +/- 0.04), milk sold through formal market (610.0 +/- 55) and amount of milk rejected per day per MBG (5.9 +/- 0.86) in litres were captured.

These correlations generally suffer from covariation of other confounding variables related to climate and other growth-limiting factors, as well as large uncertainties in total (dry + wet) reactive nitrogen (Nr) deposition. We propose a methodology for untangling the effects of Ndep from those of meteorological variables, soil water retention capacity and stand age, using a mechanistic forest growth model in combination with eddy covariance CO2 exchange fluxes from a Europe-wide network of 22 forest flux towers. Total Nr deposition rates were estimated from local measurements as far as possible. The forest data were compared with data from natural or semi-natural, non-woody vegetation sites.  The response of forest net ecosystem productivity to nitrogen deposition (dNEP ∕ dNdep) was estimated after accounting for the effects on gross primary productivity (GPP) of the co-correlates by means of a meta-modelling standardization procedure, which resulted in a reduction by a factor of about 2 of the uncorrected, apparent dGPP ∕ dNdep value. This model-enhanced analysis of the C and Ndep flux observations at the scale of the European network suggests a mean overall dNEP ∕ dNdep response of forest lifetime C sequestration to Ndep of the order of 40–50 g C per g N, which is slightly larger but not significantly different from the range of estimates published in the most recent reviews. Importantly, patterns of gross primary and net ecosystem productivity versus Ndep were non-linear, with no further growth responses at high Ndep levels (Ndep > 2.5–3 g N m−2 yr−1) but accompanied by increasingly large ecosystem N losses by leaching and gaseous emissions. The reduced increase in productivity per unit N deposited at high Ndep levels implies that the forecast increased Nr emissions and increased Ndep levels in large areas of Asia may not positively impact the continent's forest CO2 sink. The large level of unexplained variability in observed carbon sequestration efficiency (CSE) across sites further adds to the uncertainty in the dC∕dN response.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000407627",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-17-1621-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/407627","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Carbon-nitrogen interactions in European forests and semi-natural vegetation - Part 2: Untangling climatic, edaphic, management and nitrogen deposition effects on carbon sequestration potentials",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-03-31T10:08:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85083101797",,"000522159700002",,"6","Biogeosciences","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They can be used to construct national GHG inventories using a Tier 3 approach. However, accurate simulations of nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes remain challenging. Models are limited by our understanding of soil‐plant‐microbe interactions and the impact of uncertainty in measured input parameters on simulated outputs. To improve model performance, thorough evaluations against in situ measurements are needed. Experimental data of N2O emissions under two management practices (control with typical fertilization versus increased clover and no fertilization) were acquired in a Swiss field experiment. We conducted a multimodel evaluation with three commonly used biogeochemical models (DayCent in two variants, PaSim, APSIM in two variants) comparing four years of data. DayCent was the most accurate model for simulating N2O fluxes on annual timescales, while APSIM was most accurate for daily N2O fluxes. The multimodel ensemble average reduced the error in estimated annual fluxes by 41% compared to an estimate using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)‐derived method for the Swiss agricultural GHG inventory (IPCC‐Swiss), but individual models were not systematically more accurate than IPCC‐Swiss. The model ensemble overestimated the N2O mitigation effect of the clover‐based treatment (measured: 39–45%; ensemble: 52–57%) but was more accurate than IPCC‐Swiss (IPCC‐Swiss: 72–81%). These results suggest that multimodel ensembles are valuable for estimating the impact of climate and management on N2O emissions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000401680",,"0148-0227||2169-8953||2169-8961",,"10.1029/2019jg005261","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/401680","en","American Geophysical Union",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Multimodel Evaluation of Nitrous Oxide Emissions From an Intensively Managed Grassland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-02-25T15:44:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Robust models for assessing the effectiveness of technologies and managements to reduce N2O emissions from grazed pastures (Models4Pastures)","154245||154245","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","FACCE-JPI||FACCE-JPI",,,,"85081031425",,"000538019700015","J. geophys. res.

The role of VEGFA and its receptors is not fully characterised in bovine reproduction. We analysed the mRNA expression of VEGFA isoforms 121, 165 and 189, and VEGF receptors 1 and 2 in three experimental settings (A, B and C). We compared intercaruncular endometrium of cyclic to pregnant heifers at Days 12, 15 and 18 post insemination (Day 0), and between Day 15 and Day 18 conceptuses (A). We further compared caruncular versus intercaruncular endometrium at Day 15 (B), and endometrium of heifers carrying embryos originating from somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) versus in vitro fertilisation (IVF) at Day 18 (C). Endometrial VEGFA protein was localised and quantified. Pregnant heifers displayed lower intercaruncular endometrial mRNA expression of VEGFA-121 (p = 0.045) and VEGFA-189 (p = 0.009) as well as lower VEGFA protein abundance (p < 0.001) at Day 15. The VEGFA protein was localised in intercaruncular luminal, glandular epithelium and in tunica muscularis of blood vessels. At Day 15, caruncular endometrium displayed higher VEGFA mRNA expression than intercaruncular endometrium (p < 0.05). Intercaruncular endometrial VEGFA protein at Day 18 was higher in abundance in SCNT than in IVF (p = 0.038). Therefore, during preimplantation in cattle, there may be a need for timely physiological reduction in intercaruncular endometrial VEGFA expression in favour of the caruncular area to facilitate a gradient towards the implantation sites. A higher expression of VEGFA in SCNT may predispose for later placentation abnormalities frequently observed following SCNT.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000396515",,"1422-0067",,"10.3390/ijms21020544","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/396515","en","MDPI",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","angiogenesis||bovine||conceptus||endometrium||IVF||SCNT","Vascular endothelial growth factor a and VEGFR-1 change during preimplantation in heifers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-02-02T14:13:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85078279031",,"000515380000174","Int. j. mol. sci.","2","International Journal of Molecular Sciences","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Turnover can be quantified using mean residence time (MRT); however, to date there is little information on MRT of P in soil P pools. We introduce an approach to quantify MRT of P in sequentially extracted inorganic soil P pools using data from isotope exchange kinetic experiments. Our analyses of 53 soil samples from the literature showed that MRT of labile P (resin- and bicarbonate-extractable P) was on the order of minutes to hours for most soils, MRT in NaOH-extractable P (NaOH-P) was in the range of days to months, and MRT in HCl-extractable P (HCl-P) was on the order of years to millennia. Multiple-regression models were able to capture 54 %–63 % of the variability in MRT among samples and showed that land use was the most important predictor of MRT of P in labile and NaOH pools. MRT of P in HCl-P was strongly dependent on pH, as high-pH soils tended to have longer MRTs. This was interpreted to be related to the composition of HCl-P. Under high pH, HCl-P contains mostly apatite, with a low solubility, whereas under low-pH conditions, HCl-P may contain more exchangeable P forms. These results suggest that current land surface models underestimate the dynamics of inorganic soil P pools and could be improved by reducing model MRTs of the labile and NaOH-P pools, considering soil-type-dependent MRTs rather than universal exchange rates and allowing for two-way exchange between HCl-P and the soil solution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000399324",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-17-441-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/399324","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Estimates of mean residence times of phosphorus in commonly considered inorganic soil phosphorus pools",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-02-14T03:18:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Forms and dynamics of soil phosphorus along a climosequence on basalt-derived soils (CLIMP)","162422","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85078875943",,"000510401200001",,"2","Biogeosciences","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the present study, a commercial powdery product containing EO from eucalyptus, thyme and anise was fed at 25 g/day (= 5 g EO; following the producer’s recommendation) to 24 cows yielding 36 kg/day of energy-corrected milk (ECM). Feed intake and milk yield were recorded. The milk composition was analysed using an infrared spectrophotometer, and the coagulation properties were determined on a Lattodinamografo. Milk total phenol content and antioxidant capacity were photometrically analysed. The EO feeding resulted in a dry matter intake (DMI) which was higher by 4% compared to the control group, whereas ECM (32.8 vs 32.0 kg/day) was slightly but not significantly higher. Feed efficiency (1.67 vs 1.64 kg DMI/kg ECM) was not affected. The EO supplementation did not affect milk composition (fat, protein, lactose and urea) and coagulation properties. It significantly increased somatic cell count, but to an uncritical level. The EO did not enhance total phenol content and antioxidant capacity of milk. In conclusion, the investigated EO mix could be used for its main purpose according to the producer’s statements, namely to combat respiratory diseases, without impairing milk yield as well as milk compositional and technological properties. Higher supplementation levels than those recommended might have more pronounced effects on the variables investigated. Further studies are required to evaluate if the supplementation with higher doses would be favourable or unfavourable.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000411151",,"1230-1388",,"10.22358/jafs/118208/2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/411151","en","Omnitech Press",,"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","milk fat||milk protein||milk yield||phenols||plant extracts||cheese-making properties","Effects of mixed essential oils from eucalyptus, thyme and anise on composition, coagulation properties and antioxidant capacity of the milk of dairy cows",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-04-23T02:29:32Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85089919728",,"000524176900001","J.

Yet, the mechanisms driving these often‐positive biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships are not well understood. Spatial resource partitioning across vertical resource gradients is one of the main hypothesized causes for enhanced ecosystem functioning in more biodiverse grasslands. Spatial resource partitioning occurs if species differ in where they acquire resources and can happen both above‐ and belowground. However, studies investigating spatial resource partitioning in grasslands provide inconsistent evidence. We present the results of a meta‐analysis of 21 data sets from experimental species‐richness gradients in grasslands. We test the hypothesis that increasing spatial resource partitioning along vertical resource gradients enhances ecosystem functioning in diverse grassland plant communities above‐ and belowground. To test this hypothesis, we asked three questions. (1) Does species richness enhance biomass production or community resource uptake across sites? (2) Is there evidence of spatial resource partitioning as indicated by resource tracer uptake and biomass allocation above‐ and belowground? (3) Is evidence of spatial resource partitioning correlated with increased biomass production or community resource uptake? Although plant species richness enhanced community nitrogen and potassium uptake and biomass production above‐ and belowground, we found that plant communities did not meet our criteria for spatial resource partitioning, though they did invest in significantly more aboveground biomass in higher canopy layers in mixture relative to monoculture. Furthermore, the extent of spatial resource partitioning across studies was not positively correlated with either biomass production or community resource uptake. Our results suggest that spatial resource partitioning across vertical resource gradients alone does not offer a general explanation for enhanced ecosystem functioning in more diverse temperate grasslands.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000378037",,"0012-9658||1939-9170",,"10.1002/ecy.2905","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/378037","en","Wiley",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","grassland||niche complementarity||niche partitioning||productivity||resource uptake||resources||standing root biomass","Limited evidence for spatial resource partitioning across temperate grassland biodiversity experiments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-11-16T03:28:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85074800993",,"000494613500001","Ecol.","1","Ecology","101","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Associated short-term effects have been well investigated and include physiological, behavioural and emotional stress reactions. Little is known about possible long-term effects of horned versus disbudded cattle. There is evidence that horn status influences the social rank and the quantity and quality of social interactions. Previous social and non-social experiences during rearing may impact stress reactivity, which can be investigated from both physiological and behavioural points of view. Physiological short-term stress reactions include an increase in catecholamine and cortisol concentrations through activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In case of prolonged experience of adverse stimuli, a modified HPA axis reactivity comprising of an altered adrenal cortisol responses to adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] may occur. Behavioural stress reactivity can be evaluated by challenging individuals to experimental, mainly fear-eliciting situations. Being highly variable between individuals and stable across time and contexts, individual behavioural stress reactivity may also impact reactions to pre-slaughter stress and, therefore, its influences on meat quality. The present study investigated possible long-term effects of disbudding in fattening cattle by focusing on possible differences between horned and disbudded cattle regarding to HPA axis reactivity, behaviour, pre-slaughter stress just before slaughter and meat quality. We used 81 bulls (experiment 1 [E1]) and 71 heifers (experiment 2 [E2]) reared under different conditions: groups of i) exclusively horned cattle (H+), ii) exclusively disbudded cattle (H-) and, additionally for E1, iii) mixed cattle (half horned, half disbudded, M). At slaughter, half of the bulls of each rearing condition were slaughtered under one of two slaughter conditions: with limited stress (LS) or with supplementary stress (SS) during the 30 minutes before slaughter. During rearing, we investigated the HPA axis reactivity and its repeatability using repeated ACTH challenges (first challenge before disbudding, the second and third at 11 months) and spontaneous (general activity and synchrony) and reactive (during novel object and food competition tests (NOT and FCT, respectively)) behaviours. At slaughter, we studied physiological stress reactivity and meat quality (physical, chemical and sensory traits). The repeatability of adrenal cortisol responses was weak and moderate, when the physiological state between challenges varied or did not change, respectively. Although standardizing the time of day of ACTH challenges improved the repeatability, the readout remains questionable. Horned bulls of unmixed rearing groups showed greater cortisol responses after disbudding than unmixed H- bulls. Compared to H- animals, horned bulls and heifers showed greater general activity in the field (E1 and E2) and greater levels of agonistic behaviour during FCT, due to higher levels of agonistic interactions with contact (E1) and without contact (E2). During NOTs, H+ bulls of unmixed and mixed groups showed more exploration and less locomotion, possibly indicating less fearfulness, than H- bulls, whereas the opposite effect was found for heifers in E2. A supplementary stress at slaughter increased the physiological stress response, especially in unmixed rearing groups, and decreased meat juiciness. In unmixed groups, horned bulls had colder carcasses, shorter sarcomeres (also within mixed groups), and less tender meat than H- bulls. Our study revealed several novel long-term effects of disbudding. Only if reared in unmixed groups, horned and disbudded cattle differed in HPA axis reactivity and behaviour, pre-slaughter stress levels and meat quality. Additionally, supplementary pre-slaughter stress just before slaughter affected pre-slaughter stress levels and meat quality. Further research is needed to refine our understanding of these results, improve the assessment parameters and extend these findings of the horn status to other contexts, including, for example, dairy cows, on-farm experiments and human– animal relationships.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000440365",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/440365","en","ETH Zurich",,,,"Horns||Beef cattle||Behaviour||Stress physiology||Pre-slaughter stress||Meat quality","Long-term effects of disbudding: stress reactivity, behaviour and meat quality in young fattening cattle",,"Doctoral Thesis","Embargoed",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture","2020-09-14T10:38:46Z","2023-09-14",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"26550",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In Switzerland, the Swiss Plateau, an orographic basin home to a large part of the population, is prone to FLS during wintertime. The Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology in Switzerland, MeteoSwiss, employs a 1.1\,km-resolution version of the COSMO model (COSMO-1). Previous studies and feedback from forecasters who use COSMO-1 forecasts on a daily basis have assessed the model's performance regarding FLS as insufficient.  We develop a satellite-based spatial verification method which objectively confirms that the model underestimates FLS. Too early dissipation of FLS stands out as a major issue. We conduct sensitivity studies and analyse the temperature and liquid water content budgets of a case where the model erroneously dissipated extensive FLS during nighttime. We identify a mechanism so far neglected in the literature to be the main driver for the erroneous FLS dissipation: Terrain-following vertical coordinates exhibit sloping vertical coordinate surfaces in the lower atmosphere where FLS occur -- even in regions with only hilly terrain such as the Swiss Plateau. The sloping coordinate surfaces intersect the flat cloud tops of FLS. In cases where horizontal advection is present, spurious implicit numerical diffusion of the horizontal advection scheme results in excessive vertical mixing which finally promotes FLS dissipation. To alleviate the problem of implicit numerical diffusion associated with sloping vertical coordinate surfaces we propose a new LOcally Smoothed Vertical Coordinate (LOSVEC). LOSVEC  takes advantage of the fact that over moderately hilly terrain, more aggressive smoothing of the coordinate surfaces is possible. We demonstrate the advantages of LOSVEC based on a case study and apply the developed satellite-based FLS verification method to a month-long period to quantify the positive impact. NWP models still need to undergo considerable advancements to achieve accurate FLS forecasts. Our work emphasises that a novel vertical coordinate formulation with faster decay of the orography signal with height is a key point to address in future model development.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000469744",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/469744","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Atmosphere||Fog||Numerical weather prediction||stratus cloud","Improving forecasts of fog and low stratus in a high-resolution numerical weather prediction model",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2021-02-16T13:37:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27245",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We analysed 26,090 ejaculates of 794 Brown Swiss bulls to assess ejaculate volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility, sperm head and tail anomalies and insemination success. The heritability of the six semen traits was between 0 and 0.26. Genome-wide association testing on 607,511 SNPs revealed a QTL on bovine chromosome 6 that was associated with sperm motility (P = 2.5 x 10−27), head (P = 2.0 x 10−44) and tail anomalies (P = 7.2 x 10−49) and insemination success (P = 9.9 x 10−13). The QTL harbors a recessive allele that compromises semen quality and male fertility. We replicated the effect of the QTL on fertility (P = 7.1 x 10−32) in an independent cohort of 2481 Brown Swiss bulls. The analysis of whole-genome sequencing data revealed that a synonymous variant (BTA6:58373887C>T, rs474302732) in WDR19 encoding WD repeat-containing protein 19 was in linkage disequilibrium with the fertility-associated haplotype. WD repeat-containing protein 19 is a constituent of the intraflagellar transport complex that is essential for the physiological function of motile cilia and flagella. Bioinformatic and transcription analyses revealed that the BTA6:58373887 T-allele activates a cryptic exonic splice site that eliminates three evolutionarily conserved amino acids from WDR19. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the BTA6:58373887 T-allele decreases protein expression. We make the remarkable observation that, in spite of negative effects on semen quality and bull fertility, the BTA6:58373887 T-allele has a frequency of 24% in the Brown Swiss population. Our findings are the first to uncover a variant that is associated with quantitative variation in semen quality and male fertility in cattle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000415059",,"1553-7390||1553-7404",,"10.1371/journal.pgen.1008804","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/415059","en","Public Library of Science",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Activation of cryptic splicing in bovine WDR19 is associated with reduced semen quality and male fertility",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-05-15T09:11:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85085586225",,"000538052400010","PLoS Genet","5","PLoS Genetics","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Future projections of these terrestrial greenhouse gas fluxes are strikingly divergent, leading to major uncertainties in projected global warming. Here we analyse the large increase in terrestrial N2O emissions over the past 21 000 years as reconstructed from ice-core isotopic data and presented in part 1 of this study. Remarkably, the increase occurred in two steps, each realized over decades and within a maximum of 2 centuries, at the onsets of the major deglacial Northern Hemisphere warming events. The data suggest a highly dynamic and responsive global N cycle. The increase may be explained by an increase in the flux of reactive N entering and leaving ecosystems or by an increase in N2O yield per unit N converted. We applied the LPX-Bern dynamic global vegetation model in deglacial simulations forced with Earth system model climate data to investigate N2O emission patterns, mechanisms, and C–N coupling. The N2O emission changes are mainly attributed to changes in temperature and precipitation and the loss of land due to sea-level rise. LPX-Bern simulates a deglacial increase in N2O emissions but underestimates the reconstructed increase by 47 %. Assuming time-independent N sources in the model to mimic progressive N limitation of plant growth results in a decrease in N2O emissions in contrast to the reconstruction. Our results appear consistent with suggestions of (a) biological controls on ecosystem N acquisition and (b) flexibility in the coupling of the C and N cycles during periods of rapid environmental change. A dominant uncertainty in the explanation of the reconstructed N2O emissions is the poorly known N2O yield per N lost through gaseous pathways and its sensitivity to soil conditions. The deglacial N2O record provides a constraint for future studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429152",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-17-3511-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429152","en","Copernicus",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"N2O changes from the Last Glacial Maximum to the preindustrial – Part 2: terrestrial N2O emissions and carbon–nitrogen cycle interactions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-07-30T07:13:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85088494212",,"000548520500003",,"13","Biogeosciences","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The aim of the current study was to identify the impact of the embryonic diapause period on follicle number and oocyte quality in the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). In this species, the embryo undergoes five months of developmental delay. We have determined the antral follicle count (AFC), oocyte morphological quality, oocyte meiotic resumption capacity and the transcriptome profile in immature (GV) and in vitro matured (MII) oocytes obtained during embryonic diapause and after embryo reactivation. A drop in AFC, number of oocytes suitable for in vitro maturation and oocytes reaching the MII stage was observed after embryonic reactivation. A large impact of the diapause period was evident when MII oocytes were compared against GV oocytes using an RNA-seq approach. A total of 1028 genes significantly differed between MII and GV oocytes during diapause and 1795 genes after reactivation. These genes included PDE3A and SOD2, known for being involved in oocyte meiotic arrest and oxidative stress. In addition, tumour-related genes included NDRG3, NCSTN and UGDH, which have been associated with cell proliferation, migration and metabolism, were found. Comparing diapause versus reactivation, differential transcript abundance in both GV and MII oocytes was observed (44 and 32 differentially expressed genes, respectively). Our results suggest that the embryonic diapause and reactivation periods modulate follicular dynamics, influencing the oocyte towards lower quality after reactivation. This is may be related to increased apoptosis, abnormal mitochondria function/structure and metabolic dysfunction in the maturing oocyte. © 2020 Third International Symposium on Embryonic Diapause.",,,,,,"10.1530/biosciprocs.10.015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456854","en","BioScientifica",,,,,"Embryonic diapause modulates ovarian follicular dynamics and oocyte quality in the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)",,"Conference Paper","Metadata only","Proceedings of III International Symposium on Embryonic Diapause",,"2020-12-17T12:54:50Z",,,,"yes","3rd International Symposium on Embryonic Diapause","June 2-6, 2019","Ascona, Switzerland","Embryonic Diapause in roe deer: a model for deciphering the control of developmental velocity||Embryonic Diapause: pluripotency on hold?","159734||185026","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,,,,"Bioscientifica Proceedings","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Across Europe, PG exists in many contrasting managed or unmanaged environments where it contributes to feed supply, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, aesthetic value, recreation, clean water and prevention of soil loss.  The delivery of these PG ecosystem services is under threat by land use change, climate change and sub-optimal management. We carried out a survey among experts to assess the threats within their countries. Respondents described the main PG-types, together with their areas, and assessed to what extent a particular PG-type is threatened by intensification, land use change, climate change or nitrogen (N) depositions. Threats were scored on a three-point scale: no, small or great. Replies were received from 11 countries (CH, CZ, DE, ES, HU, IT, ME, NL, PL, SE, UK), representing the main biogeographic zones in Europe. The dataset contained 83 PG- types on a total area of 25 Mha. Abandonment, heat and drought stress and conversion to temporary grassland were considered as the largest threats, each considered as a great threat on PG-types covering 8 to 9 Mha (~35%). The second largest group comprised N depositions, conversion to arable land and intensification, each as a great threat on PG-types covering 4 to 5 Mha (~20%).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000448642","978-952-326-944-6||978-952-326-945-3",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448642","en","Wageningen Academic Publishers",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","abandonment||climate||intensification||land use||N deposition||expert survey","European permanent grasslands mainly threatened by abandonment, heat and drought, and conversion to temporary grassland",,"Conference Paper","Open access","Proceedings of the 28th General Meeting of the European Grassland Federation",,"2020-10-29T16:05:12Z",,,,"yes","28th General Meeting of the European Grassland Federation (EGF 2020) (virtual)","October 19-22, 2020","Helsinki, Finland","Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies","774124","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,,,,"Grassland Science in Europe","25","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The typology consists of eight first-level and 18 subordinate second-level classes, based on management intensity, productivity potential, presence of woody plants and grassland renewal intervals. It is applicable both at field and regional scales and is cross-referenced with existing classification schemes such as the EUNIS and Natura 2000 habitats classes.

Agricultural intensification undermines the delivery of many public ecosystem services at local level. Organic farming might decrease the environmental impact of intensive food and feed production on grasslands and could therefore be able to sustain both private and public ecosystem services. A systematic literature search of scientific publications revealed the absence of literature on the impact of organic farming on ecosystem services in grasslands. Thus, the project ServiceGrass was initiated to explore effects of organic grassland farming on several ecosystem services and their simultaneous provisioning, i.e. multifunctionality, in Switzerland. The principal aim of the project is to compare the ability of organic and conventional grasslands to deliver ecosystem services at plot and farm levels, including management intensification as a major driver. We aim at up-scaling results from grassland plots to farm- and sector-level in order to draw conclusions on the realized ecosystem services portfolio of both farming systems. Findings of this project will underline strengths and weaknesses of organic and conventional farming systems in delivering multiple ecosystem services for sustainable future grassland management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000448597","978-952-326-945-3||978-952-326-944-6",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448597","en","Wageningen Academic Publishers",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","environmental impacts||economic assessment||grassland management||intensification||multifunctionality||sustainable agriculture","Effects of organic farming on ecosystem services and multifunctionality in Switzerland: the ServiceGrass project",,"Conference Paper","Open access","Proceedings of the 28th General Meeting of the European Grassland Federation",,"2020-10-29T13:27:50Z",,,,"yes","28th General Meeting of the European Grassland Federation (EGF 2020) (virtual)","October 19-22, 2020","Helsinki, Finland","Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies","774124","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,,,,"Grassland Science in Europe","25","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Two main enzymatic processes involved in soil P cycling are known to alter the oxygen isotopic composition of phosphate (δ18O-P), each in a different way, through the cleavage of the P–O bond: the intracellular P turnover and the organic P hydrolysis. The former induces isotopic equilibration between phosphate and water and is considered the major process affecting soil available P via microbial P release. The latter induces depleted δ18O-P in the phosphate released from the mineralization of organic P. We studied P dynamics in organic horizons of two contrasting soils (low- and high-P availability) from temperate beech forests. We labeled the soil with 18O-enriched water and followed changes in the δ18O-P of different soil P pools in the presence or absence of added leaf litter during 3 months of incubation. δ18O-P values of almost all P pools progressively increased indicating oxygen incorporation from the enriched soil water into phosphate via the above-mentioned enzymatic processes. δ18O-P of available P increased more in the P-rich soil than in the P-poor soil and approached the isotopic equilibrium between phosphate and water, revealing the impact of microbial P release into the available P pool. However, in the P-poor soil, the available P brought the isotopic signature induced by phosphatase enzymes, indicating that it was mostly originated from the hydrolysis of organic P. Therefore, under P-limiting conditions, the isotopic effect of organic P hydrolysis can outweigh the isotopic equilibrium effect. Finally, two independent isotopic approaches with 33P and δ18O-P provided very similar estimates of P exchanged between the available P and other inorganic soil pools. This suggests that δ18O-P can be successfully used to trace P fluxes, provided that the underlying processes do not break the P–O bonds of the phosphate molecule.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000447182",,"2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2020.564778","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/447182","en","Frontiers Media",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Soil||Isotopic labeling||Phosphatase||Microbial phosphorus||Mineralization","In or Out of Equilibrium?

However, a substantial increase in food production with a concomitant reduction of its environmental footprint presents a significant challenge and requires the development of nutrient efficient and sustainable strategies. Here, multi-trophic aquaponic systems, which reduce nutrient loss to the environment through the co-cultivation of plants and aquatic animals, may present a solution. These systems consist of various compartments, with each compartment having its own specific function as part of the total system. This compartmentalization of functions creates a range of unique microenvironments, each of which supports the development of a unique microbial community. This high microbial diversity makes aquaponics an attractive soilless model system for the study of nutrient transformation processes. In particular, the nitrogen cycle is of importance, as its disruption is not only detrimental to plant and animal growth but has environment-wide consequences. This dissertation deepens the understanding of aquaponic system-specific nitrogen transformation processes through the characterization of individual interactions in the aquaponic compartments on both a chemical and a microbial level. To this end, next-generation DNA sequencing was used to characterize localized microbial community composition and diversity and was combined with chemical analyses to determine nutrient content and abiotic parameter values. Significant differences in nitrogen composition and abiotic parameters were observed between the individual compartments of the aquaponic system. These differences could be responsible for the unique microenvironments that, in turn, give rise to specific microbial communities and, thus, foster further specialization of compartment function. Notable differences were especially observed between the aerobic and anaerobic compartments regarding archaeal and bacterial composition. While this work investigated both the presence and composition of bacterial and archaeal communities, it also points to the importance of determining their active role in the nitrogen cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000464851",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/464851","en","ETH Zurich",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Characterization of nitrogen dynamics in an aquaponic system",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture","2021-01-22T14:10:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27159",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Original Braunvieh (OB) is a local cattle breed of Switzerland used for beef and milk production in alpine areas. Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of 49 key ancestors, we characterize genomic diversity, genomic inbreeding, and signatures of selection in Swiss OB cattle at nucleotide resolution.  Results We annotated 15,722,811 SNPs and 1,580,878 Indels including 10,738 and 2763 missense deleterious and high impact variants, respectively, that were discovered in 49 OB key ancestors. Six Mendelian trait-associated variants that were previously detected in breeds other than OB, segregated in the sequenced key ancestors including variants causal for recessive xanthinuria and albinism. The average nucleotide diversity (1.6  × 10− 3) was higher in OB than many mainstream European cattle breeds. Accordingly, the average genomic inbreeding derived from runs of homozygosity (ROH) was relatively low (FROH = 0.14) in the 49 OB key ancestor animals. However, genomic inbreeding was higher in OB cattle of more recent generations (FROH = 0.16) due to a higher number of long (> 1 Mb) runs of homozygosity. Using two complementary approaches, composite likelihood ratio test and integrated haplotype score, we identified 95 and 162 genomic regions encompassing 136 and 157 protein-coding genes, respectively, that showed evidence (P < 0.005) of past and ongoing selection. These selection signals were enriched for quantitative trait loci related to beef traits including meat quality, feed efficiency and body weight and pathways related to blood coagulation, nervous and sensory stimulus.  Conclusions We provide a comprehensive overview of sequence variation in Swiss OB cattle genomes. With WGS data, we observe higher genomic diversity and less inbreeding in OB than many European mainstream cattle breeds. Footprints of selection were detected in genomic regions that are possibly relevant for meat quality and adaptation to local environmental conditions. Considering that the population size is low and genomic inbreeding increased in the past generations, the implementation of optimal mating strategies seems warranted to maintain genetic diversity in the Swiss OB cattle population.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000388772",,"1471-2164",,"10.1186/s12864-020-6446-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/388772","en","BioMed Central",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Assessing genomic diversity and signatures of selection in Original Braunvieh cattle using whole-genome sequencing data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-09T08:30:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85077686525",,"000513537200005","BMC Genomics","1","BMC Genomics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While diapause is characterized by a complete developmental arrest in some species, roe deer blastocysts show a very slow, yet continuous growth. To date, it is neither known whether this growth is accompanied by developmental progression nor whether it is uniform in both, the trophectoderm (TE) and the inner cell mass (ICM). We collected roe deer blastocysts during the regular hunting season from September 2018 to January 2019, and quantified the fraction of cells expressing the proliferation marker Ki67 by immunofluorescence and light-sheet microscopy. We found that the cell number increased from around 300 cells in September to over 20'000 cells per blastocyst in December before elongation occured. Concurrently, we observed considerable morphological changes, i.e. cavity formation and transition to a disk-like shape of the inner cell mass. During diapause, less than 10% of all cells displayed positive Ki67 staining. Strikingly, the relative increase in cell number was lower in the ICM compared to the TE, whereas the fraction of Ki67 positive cells appeared to be lower in the TE than in the ICM. Our findings thus confirm that roe deer blastocysts display developmental progression in the course of diapause. We hypothesize that while the overall duration of the cell cycle is longer in the ICM than in the TE, the fractional distribution of cell cycle phases differs, with TE cells having a longer G1 phase than cells of the ICM. © 2020 Third International Symposium on Embryonic Diapause.",,,,,,"10.1530/biosciprocs.10.013","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456848","en","BioScientifica",,,,"Diapause||Embryo||Development||Proliferation||Differentiation","Trophectoderm and embryoblast proliferate at slow pace in the course of embryonic diapause in the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)",,"Conference Paper","Metadata only","Proceedings of III International Symposium on Embryonic Diapause",,"2020-12-17T12:49:08Z",,,,"yes","3rd International Symposium on Embryonic Diapause","June 2-6, 2019","Ascona, Switzerland","Embryonic Diapause in roe deer: a model for deciphering the control of developmental velocity||Embryonic Diapause: pluripotency on hold?","159734||185026","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,,,,"Bioscientifica Proceedings","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Plant trait data thus represent the basis for a vast area of research spanning from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and landscape management, restoration, biogeography and earth system modelling. Since its foundation in 2007, the TRY database of plant traits has grown continuously. It now provides unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy and is the main plant trait database used by the research community worldwide. Increasingly, the TRY database also supports new frontiers of trait‐based plant research, including the identification of data gaps and the subsequent mobilization or measurement of new data. To support this development, in this article we evaluate the extent of the trait data compiled in TRY and analyse emerging patterns of data coverage and representativeness. Best species coverage is achieved for categorical traits—almost complete coverage for ‘plant growth form’. However, most traits relevant for ecology and vegetation modelling are characterized by continuous intraspecific variation and trait–environmental relationships. These traits have to be measured on individual plants in their respective environment. Despite unprecedented data coverage, we observe a humbling lack of completeness and representativeness of these continuous traits in many aspects. We, therefore, conclude that reducing data gaps and biases in the TRY database remains a key challenge and requires a coordinated approach to data mobilization and trait measurements. This can only be achieved in collaboration with other initiatives.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000389543",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.14904","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/389543","en","Blackwell Science",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Data coverage||Data integration||Data representativeness||Functional diversity||Plant traits||TRY plant trait database","TRY plant trait database – enhanced coverage and open access",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-01-13T03:24:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85075196338",,"000504934700001","Glob.

High throughput methods to assess senescence dynamics in large field trials will allow for (i) indirect selection in early breeding generations, when yield cannot yet be accurately determined and (ii) mapping of the genomic regions controlling the trait. The aim of this study was to develop a robust method to assess senescence based on hyperspectral canopy reflectance. Measurements were taken in three years throughout the grain filling phase on >300 winter wheat varieties in the spectral range from 350 to 2500 nm using a spectroradiometer. We compared the potential of spectral indices (SI) and full-spectrum models to infer visually observed senescence dynamics from repeated reflectance measurements. Parameters describing the dynamics of senescence were used to predict GY and GPC and a feature selection algorithm was used to identify the most predictive features. The three-band plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI) approximated the visually observed senescence dynamics best, whereas full-spectrum models suffered from a strong year-specificity. Feature selection identified visual scorings as most predictive for GY, but also PSRI ranked among the most predictive features while adding additional spectral features had little effect. Visually scored delayed senescence was positively correlated with GY ranging from r = 0.173 in 2018 to r = 0.365 in 2016. It appears that visual scoring remains the gold standard to quantify leaf senescence in moderately large trials. However, using appropriate phenotyping platforms, the proposed index-based parameterization of the canopy reflectance dynamics offers the critical advantage of upscaling to very large breeding trials.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000401191",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2019.01749","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/401191","en","Frontiers Media",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","high-throughput phenotyping||canopy reflectance||hyperspectral remote sensing||field-based phenotyping||feature selection","Spectral Vegetation Indices to Track Senescence Dynamics in Diverse Wheat Germplasm",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-02-22T04:25:21Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85079483525",,"000514308600001","Front.

A meta-analysis combines summary statistics from multiple GWAS and increases the power to detect trait-associated variants without requiring access to data at the individual level of the GWAS mapping cohorts. Because linkage disequilibrium between adjacent markers is conserved only over short distances across breeds, a multi-breed meta-analysis can improve mapping precision.  Results To maximise the power to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL), we combined the results of nine within-population GWAS that used imputed sequence variant genotypes of 94,321 cattle from eight breeds, to perform a large-scale meta-analysis for fat and protein percentage in cattle. The meta-analysis detected (p ≤ 10−8) 138 QTL for fat percentage and 176 QTL for protein percentage. This was more than the number of QTL detected in all within-population GWAS together (124 QTL for fat percentage and 104 QTL for protein percentage). Among all the lead variants, 100 QTL for fat percentage and 114 QTL for protein percentage had the same direction of effect in all within-population GWAS. This indicates either persistence of the linkage phase between the causal variant and the lead variant across breeds or that some of the lead variants might indeed be causal or tightly linked with causal variants. The percentage of intergenic variants was substantially lower for significant variants than for non-significant variants, and significant variants had mostly moderate to high minor allele frequencies. Significant variants were also clustered in genes that are known to be relevant for fat and protein percentages in milk.  Conclusions Our study identified a large number of QTL associated with fat and protein percentage in dairy cattle. We demonstrated that large-scale multi-breed meta-analysis reveals more QTL at the nucleotide resolution than within-population GWAS. Significant variants were more often located in genic regions than non-significant variants and a large part of them was located in potentially regulatory regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000425026",,"0999-193X||1297-9686",,"10.1186/s12711-020-00556-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/425026","en","BioMed Central",,"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Meta-analysis for milk fat and protein percentage using imputed sequence variant genotypes in 94,321 cattle from eight cattle breeds",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,"2020-07-07T16:19:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85087727677",,"000549149100001","Genet. sel. evol.","1","Genetics Selection Evolution","52","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
