Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are the most abundant conjugative elements among prokaryotes. However, the contribution of ICEs to horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance has been largely unexplored.  Results Here we report that ICEs belonging to mating-pair formation (MPF) classes G and T are highly prevalent among the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, contributing to the spread of carbapenemase-encoding genes (CEGs). Most CEGs of the MPFG class were encoded within class I integrons, which co-harbour genes conferring resistance to other antibiotics. The majority of the integrons were located within Tn3-like and composite transposons. Conserved attachment site could be predicted for the MPFG class ICEs. MPFT class ICEs carried the CEGs within composite transposons which were not associated with integrons.  Conclusions The data presented here provides a global snapshot of the different CEG-harbouring ICEs and sheds light on the underappreciated contribution of these elements to the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance on P. aeruginosa.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000473515",,"1759-8753","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473475||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473476","10.1186/s13100-018-0141-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473515","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Integrative and conjugative elements||Carbapenamases||Pseudomonas spp.||Anitbiotic resistance","Carbapenemases on the move: it's good to be on ICEs","Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-03-08T16:02:09Z",,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,"54557577","30574213",,,,"Mob DNA",,"Mobile DNA","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study provides an overview on currently-used partitioning metrics with a focus on methods that can quantify evolutionary and non-evolutionary contributions to population and community trait change. I highlight key differences between these metrics found in previous studies. Additionally, I also provide a detailed comparison between the ‘Geber’ method and the reaction norm approach.

Models for their modes of action have been proposed but many issues remain unresolved. Among those is the role of commensal gut bacteria in target insect death: previous studies showed that antibiotics attenuate the toxicity of Bt sprays. We tested whether antibiotics interfere with the effects of GM plant-produced Bt toxins in larvae of two Lepidopteran species, the European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis and the cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis. The larvae were reared on artificial diet with or without antibiotics and, thereafter, fed two varieties of Bt GM maize in comparison to conventional non-Bt maize leaves sprayed with antibiotic solution and/or with a Bt formulation. Antibiotics significantly reduced or delayed the toxicity of Cry toxins, although to a lesser extent than previously reported for Bt-sprays. This supports the hypothesis that Cry toxins induce mortality by themselves in the absence of Bt bacteria and spores, and of commensal gut bacteria. However, larvae that were not treated with antibiotics died faster and at a higher rate which was further compounded by plant variety and species sensitivity. These findings support a hypothesis that toxicemia alone can inflict significant mortality. However, in the absence of antibiotics, the gut bacteria likely enhance the Cry toxin effect by inflicting, additionally, bacterial septicemia. This has important implications in field situations where antibiotic substances are present—e.g., from manure of animals from conventional production systems—and for ecotoxicological testing schemes of Bt toxins and nontarget organisms that are often using artificial diets enriched with high concentrations of antibiotics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000307936",,,,"10.3390/toxins10120489","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/307936","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ecotoxicology||Bacillus thuringiensis||Cry toxins||antibiotics||nontarget organisms||lepidoptera","Impact of Antibiotics on Efficacy of Cry Toxins Produced in Two Different Genetically Modified Bt Maize Varieties in Two Lepidopteran Herbivore Species, Ostrinia nubilalis and Spodoptera littoralis","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-12-02T05:29:47Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85057176102",,"000455310000004",,"12","Toxins","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although plasmids provide bacteria with new adaptive genes, they also produce physiological alterations that often translate into a reduction in bacterial fitness. The fitness costs associated with plasmids represent an important limit to plasmid maintenance in bacterial communities, but their molecular origins remain largely unknown. In this work, we combine phenomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics to study the fitness effects produced by a collection of diverse plasmids in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Using this approach, we scan the physiological changes imposed by plasmids and test the generality of some main mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the cost of HGT, including increased biosynthetic burden, reduced translational efficiency, and impaired chromosomal replication. Our results suggest that the fitness effects of plasmids have a complex origin, since none of these mechanisms could individually provide a general explanation for the cost of plasmid carriage. Interestingly, our results also showed that plasmids alter the expression of a common set of metabolic genes in PAO1, and produce convergent changes in host cell metabolism. These surprising results suggest that there is a common metabolic response to plasmids in P. aeruginosa PAO1.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000469300",,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-018-0224-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/469300","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Integrative analysis of fitness and metabolic effects of plasmids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2021-02-12T15:05:41Z",,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ISME J","12","The ISME Journal","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This environmental DNA (eDNA) is often used to track occurrence patterns of target species. Applications are especially promising in rivers, where eDNA can integrate information about populations upstream. The dispersion of eDNA in rivers is modulated by complex processes of transport and decay through the dendritic river network, and we currently lack a method to extract quantitative information about the location and density of populations contributing to the eDNA signal. Here, we present a general framework to reconstruct the upstream distribution and abundance of a target species across a river network, based on observed eDNA concentrations and hydro-geomorphological features of the network. The model captures well the catchment-wide spatial biomass distribution of two target species: a sessile invertebrate (the bryozoan Fredericella sultana) and its parasite (the myxozoan Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae). Our method is designed to easily integrate general biological and hydrological data and to enable spatially explicit estimates of the distribution of sessile and mobile species in fluvial ecosystems based on eDNA sampling.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000307544",,"0027-8424||1091-6490","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/307544||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316049","10.1073/pnas.1813843115","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316663","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Species distribution model||Ecohydrology||Proliferative kidney disease","Estimating species distribution and abundance in river networks using environmental DNA","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-11-30T05:37:15Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85056520016",,,"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","46","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","115","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Short-term responses to resource limitation include plastic changes in molecular phenotypes including protein expression. Yet little is known about the evolution of the molecular phenotype under longer-term resource limitation. Here, we combine experimental evolution of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under multiple different non-substitutable resource limitation regimes with proteomic measurements to investigate evolutionary adaptation of the molecular phenotype. We demonstrate convergent proteomic evolution of core metabolic functions, including the Calvin-Benson cycle and gluconeogenesis, across different resource limitation environments. We do not observe proteomic changes consistent with optimized uptake of particular limiting resources. Instead, we report that adaptation proceeds in similar directions under different types of non-substitutable resource limitation. This largely convergent evolution of the expression of core metabolic proteins is associated with an improvement in the resource assimilation efficiency of nitrogen and phosphorus into biomass.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000316078",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-018-07106-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316078","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Evolutionary genetics||Experimental evolution||Metabolism","Proteome evolution under non-substitutable resource limitation","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-15T15:42:08Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

There is a well‐developed theoretical framework to describe the evolution of host–parasite interactions under the assumption of direct, two‐species interactions, which can result in arms race dynamics or sustained genotype fluctuations driven by negative frequency dependence (Red Queen dynamics). However, many hosts rely on symbionts for defence against parasites. Whilst the ubiquity of defensive symbionts and their potential importance for disease control are increasingly recognized, there is still a gap in our understanding of how symbionts mediate or possibly take part in host–parasite coevolution. Herein we address this question by synthesizing information already available from theoretical and empirical studies. First, we briefly introduce current hypotheses on how defensive mutualisms evolved from more parasitic relationships and highlight exciting new experimental evidence showing that this can occur very rapidly. We go on to show that defensive symbionts influence virtually all important determinants of coevolutionary dynamics, namely the variation in host resistance available to selection by parasites, the specificity of host resistance, and the trade‐off structure between host resistance and other components of fitness. In light of these findings, we turn to the limited theory and experiments available for such three‐species interactions to assess the role of defensive symbionts in host–parasite coevolution. Specifically, we discuss under which conditions the defensive symbiont may take over from the host the reciprocal adaptation with parasites and undergo its own selection dynamics, thereby altering or relaxing selection on the hosts' own immune defences. Finally, we address potential effects of defensive symbionts on the evolution of parasite virulence. This is an important problem for which there is no single, clear‐cut prediction. The selection on parasite virulence resulting from the presence of defensive symbionts in their hosts will depend on the underlying mechanism of defence. We identify the evolutionary predictions for different functional categories of symbiont‐conferred resistance and we evaluate the empirical literature for supporting evidence. We end this review with outstanding questions and promising avenues for future research to improve our understanding of symbiont‐mediated coevolution between hosts and parasites.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000295716",,"1469-185X||1464-7931||0006-3231","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/295716||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316082","10.1111/brv.12417","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316925","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","coevolution||defensive symbiosis||parasitism||microbial symbionts||mutualism||resistance||transmission modes","The role of defensive symbionts in host–parasite coevolution","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-10-13T10:47:15Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85053073415",,"000446427600002","Biol Rev,","4","Biological Reviews","93","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In addition, the virus has emerged in other species and frequent zoonotic spillover events indicate that there remains a significant risk to human health. It is crucial to understand the dynamics of the disease in the poultry industry to develop a more comprehensive knowledge of the risks of transmission and to establish a better distribution of resources when implementing control. In this paper, we develop a set of mathematical models that simulate the spread of HPAI H5N1 in the poultry industry in Thailand, utilising data from the 2004 epidemic. The model that incorporates the intensity of duck farming when assessing transmision risk provides the best fit to the spatiotemporal characteristics of the observed outbreak, implying that intensive duck farming drives transmission of HPAI in Thailand. We also extend our models using a sequential model fitting approach to explore the ability of the models to be used in “real time” during novel disease outbreaks. We conclude that, whilst predictions of epidemic size are estimated poorly in the early stages of disease outbreaks, the model can infer the preferred control policy that should be deployed to minimise the impact of the disease.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000295721",,"0167-5877",,"10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.09.014","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/295721","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Avian influenza||Disease control||Spatial heterogeneity||Vaccination","Dynamics of the 2004 avian influenza H5N1 outbreak in Thailand: The role of duck farming, sequential model fitting and control","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-10-13T11:07:46Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85053804604",,"000449133800021","Prev.

We studied the emergence of an OXA-48-producing Kluyvera species clone, which expresses the novel CTX-M-213 enzyme, colonizing patients in our hospital. Rectal swabs from patients admitted in four wards (March 2014 to March 2016; R-GNOSIS project) were seeded onto Chromo ID-ESBL) and Chrom-CARB/OXA-48 chromogenic agar plates. Carbapenemases and extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) were characterized (PCR, sequencing, cloning, and site-directed mutagenesis), and antibiotic susceptibility was determined. Clonal relatedness was established (XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [XbaI-PFGE]), and plasmid content was studied (transformation, S1 nuclease digestion-PFGE, SB-hybridization, restriction fragment length polymorphism [RFLP] analysis [DraI and HpaI], and PCR [incompatibility group and repA, traU, and parA genes]). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) (Illumina HiSeq-2500) and further bioinformatics analysis of plasmids (PLACNET and plasmidSPAdes) were performed. Patients' charts were reviewed. Six unrelated patients (median age, 75 years [range, 59 to 81 years]; 4/6 male patients) colonized with OXA-48-producing Kluyvera species isolates (>95% similarity of the PFGE pattern) were identified. Nosocomial acquisition was demonstrated. In two patients, OXA-48-producing Kluyvera species isolates coexisted with OXA-48-producing Raoultella ornithinolytica, K. pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. The blaOXA-48 gene was located on an ∼60-kb IncL plasmid related to IncL/M-pOXA-48a and the novel blaCTX-M-213 gene in a conserved chromosomal region of Kluyvera species isolates. CTX-M-213, different from CTX-M-13 (K56E) but conferring a similar β-lactam resistance profile, was identified. Genomic analysis also revealed a 177-kb IncF plasmid (class I integron harboring sul1 and aadA2) and an 8-kb IncQ plasmid (IS4-blaFOX-8). We describe the first blaOXA-48 plasmid in Kluyvera spp. and the novel chromosomal CTX-M-213 enzyme and highlight further nosocomial dissemination of blaOXA-48 through clonal lineages or plasmids related to IncL/M-pOXA-48a. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology",,,,"0066-4804||1098-6596",,"10.1128/AAC.01238-18","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473477","en","American Society for Microbiology",,,"Carbapenemase-producing Kluyvera spp.||Molecular epidemiology||pOXA-48||New CTX-M variant||Clonal transmission||Carbapenemase-producing Kluyvera ascorbata","First Report of an OXA-48- and CTX-M-213-Producing Kluyvera Species Clone Recovered from Patients Admitted in a University Hospital in Madrid, Spain","Journal Article||Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2021-03-08T16:04:18Z",,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,"54400771",,,,,"Antimicrob Agents Chemother","11","Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy","62","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In an asymmetric chimera state, the trajectory of an element in the synchronized subset is stationary or periodic, while that of an oscillator in the desynchronized subset is chaotic. In an asymmetric cluster state, the periods of the trajectories of elements belonging to different clusters are different. We consider a network of globally coupled chaotic maps as a simple model for the occurrence of such asymmetric states in spatiotemporal systems. We employ the analogy between a single map subject to a constant drive and the effective local dynamics in the globally coupled map system to elucidate the mechanisms for the emergence of asymmetric chimera and cluster states in the latter system. By obtaining the dynamical responses of the driven map, we establish a condition for the equivalence of the dynamics of the driven map and that of the system of globally coupled maps. This condition is applied to predict parameter values and subset partitions for the formation of asymmetric cluster and chimera states in the globally coupled system.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000317432",,"1054-1500||1089-7682",,"10.1063/1.5043398","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/317432","en","American Institute of Physics","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Asymmetric cluster and chimera dynamics in globally coupled systems","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-18T14:32:36Z","2019-11-21",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chaos","11","Chaos","28","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

GLW 3 provides global population densities of cattle, buffaloes, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens and ducks in each land pixel at a spatial resolution of 0.083333 decimal degrees (approximately 10 km at the equator). They are accompanied by detailed metadata on the year, spatial resolution and source of the input census data. Two versions of each species distribution are produced. In the first version, livestock numbers are disaggregated within census polygons according to weights established by statistical models using high resolution spatial covariates (dasymetric weighting). In the second version, animal numbers are distributed homogeneously with equal densities within their census polygons (areal weighting) to provide spatial data layers free of any assumptions linking them to other spatial variables.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302447",,"2052-4463",,"10.1038/sdata.2018.227","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302447","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Agroecology||Biogeography||Environmental impact||Risk factors","Global distribution data for cattle, buffaloes, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, chickens and ducks in 2010","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-11-09T05:50:28Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85055614271",,"000448758900001","Sci Data",,"Scientific Data","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Understanding the combined effects of stressors on process rates mediated by individuals in ecosystems would greatly improve our ability to predict organismal multifunctionality (e.g. multiple consumer‐mediated functions). We conducted a laboratory experiment to test direct and indirect, as well as immediate and delayed effects of a heat wave (pulsed stress) and micropollutants (MPs) (prolonged stress) on individual consumers (the great pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis) and their multifunctionality (i.e. consumption of basal resources, growth, reproduction, nutrient excretion and organic‐matter cycling). We found that stressful conditions increased the process rates of multiple functions mediated by individual consumers. Specifically, the artificial heat wave increased process rates in the majority of the quantified functions (either directly or indirectly), whereas exposure to MPs increased consumption of basal resources which led to increases in the release of nutrients and fine particulate organic matter. Moreover, snails exposed to a heat wave showed decreased reproduction and nutrient excretion after the heat‐wave, indicating the potential for ecologically relevant delayed effects. Our study indicates that the immediate and delayed effects of stressors on individual organisms may directly and indirectly impact multiple ecosystem functions. In particular, delayed effects of environmental stress on individual consumers may cumulatively impede recovery due to decreased functioning following a perturbation. Reconciling these results with studies incorporating responses at higher levels of biological complexity will enhance our ability to forecast how individual responses upscale to ecosystem multifunctionality.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000295688",,"0030-1299||1600-0706","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/295688||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316072","10.1111/oik.05310","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316617","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Ecosystem processes||Environmental stress||Grazer||Heat wave||Micropollutants","Simultaneous exposure to a pulsed and a prolonged anthropogenic stressor can alter consumer multifunctionality","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-10-13T09:50:40Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85054167535",,"000446267600004","Oikos","10","Oikos","127","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Laboratory studies revealed that abiotic and biotic factors together determine how much siderophores bacteria make, and whether siderophores can be exploited by non-producing cheaters or be deployed by producers to inhibit competitors. Here, we explore whether these insights apply to natural communities, by comparing the production of the siderophore pyoverdine among 930 Pseudomonas strains from 48 soil and pond communities. We found that pH, iron content, carbon concentration and community diversity determine pyoverdine production levels, and the extent to which strains are either stimulated or inhibited by heterologous (non-self) pyoverdines. While pyoverdine non-producers occurred in both habitats, their prevalence was higher in soils. Environmental and genetic analyses suggest that non-producers can evolve as cheaters, exploiting heterologous pyoverdine, but also due to pyoverdine disuse in environments with increased iron availability. Overall, we found that environmental factors explained between-strain variation in pyoverdine production much better in soils than in ponds, presumably because high strain mixing in ponds impedes local adaption. Our study sheds light on the complexity of natural bacterial communities, and provides first insights into the multivariate nature of siderophore-based iron acquisition and competition among environmental pseudomonads.",,,,"1462-2912||1462-2920",,"10.1111/1462-2920.14355","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551337","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,,,"Environmental determinants of pyoverdine production, exploitation and competition in natural Pseudomonas communities","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2022-06-08T10:59:47Z",,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85052960718",,"000447549700013","Environ. microbiol.","10","Environmental Microbiology","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, little is known about genome-wide selection in polyploids due to the complexity of duplicated genomes. In polyploids, the patterns of purifying selection and adaptive substitutions may be affected by masking owing to duplicated genes or homeologs as well as effective population size. Here, we resequence 25 accessions of the allotetraploid Arabidopsis kamchatica, which is derived from the diploid species A. halleri and A. lyrata. We observe a reduction in purifying selection compared with the parental species. Interestingly, proportions of adaptive non-synonymous substitutions are significantly positive in contrast to most plant species. A recurrent pattern observed in both frequency and divergence–diversity neutrality tests is that the genome-wide distributions of both subgenomes are similar, but the correlation between homeologous pairs is low. This may increase the opportunity of different evolutionary trajectories such as in the HMA4 gene involved in heavy metal hyperaccumulation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000295502",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-018-06108-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/295502","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Patterns of polymorphism and selection in the subgenomes of the allopolyploid Arabidopsis kamchatica","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-10-12T15:22:39Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85053831295",,"000445560800017","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For instance, chemical cues released by hosts can attract parasite transmission stages. We used the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis and its trematode parasite Echinoparyphium aconiatum to examine the role of host chemical attractiveness, physiological condition, and immune function in determining its susceptibility to infection. We assessed host attractiveness through parasite chemo‐orientation behavior; physiological condition through host body size, food consumption, and respiration rate; and immune function through two immune parameters (phenoloxidase‐like and antibacterial activity of hemolymph) at an individual level. We found that, although snails showed high variation in chemical attractiveness to E. aconiatum cercariae, this did not determine their overall susceptibility to infection. This was because large body size increased attractiveness, but also increased metabolic activity that reduced overall susceptibility. High metabolic rate indicates fast physiological processes, including immune activity. The examined immune traits, however, showed no association with susceptibility to infection. Our results indicate that postcontact mechanisms were more likely to determine snail susceptibility to infection than variation in attractiveness to parasites. These may include localized immune responses in the target tissue of the parasite. The lack of a relationship between food consumption and attractiveness to parasites contradicts earlier findings that show food deprivation reducing snail attractiveness. This suggests that, although variation in resource level over space and time can alter infection dynamics, variation in chemical attractiveness may not contribute to parasite‐induced fitness variation within populations when individuals experience similar environmental conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000294285",,"2045-7758","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/294285||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316062","10.1002/ece3.4386","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316609","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","cercaria||chemical detection||host finding||host–parasite interactions||immune defense||parasite resistance","Relative importance of chemical attractiveness to parasites for susceptibility to trematode infection","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-10-10T01:16:23Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85052700091",,"000445606000023","Ecol Evol","17","Ecology and Evolution","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We observed substantial variation in the distribution of polymorphisms across the pan-genome, including repeat-induced point mutations, diversifying selection and gene gains and losses. We also discovered chromosome-scale inter and intraspecific presence/absence variation of some sequences, suggesting the occurrence of one or more accessory chromosomes or regions that may play a role in host–pathogen interactions. The presence of known pathogenicity effector loci SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3 varied substantially among isolates. Three P. nodorum isolates lacked functional versions for all three loci, whereas three P. avenae isolates carried one or both of the SnTox1 and SnTox3 genes, indicating previously unrecognized potential for discovering additional effectors in the P. nodorum-wheat pathosystem. We utilized the pan-genomic comparative analysis to improve the prediction of pathogenicity effector candidates, recovering the three confirmed effectors among our top-ranked candidates. We propose applying this pan-genomic approach to identify the effector repertoire involved in other host–microbe interactions involving necrotrophic pathogens in the Pezizomycotina.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302229",,"1759-6653",,"10.1093/gbe/evy192","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302229","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Parastagonospora nodorum||Pan-genome||plant pathogen||crop disease||host-microbe interactions","Pan-Parastagonospora Comparative Genome Analysis-Effector Prediction and Genome Evolution","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-11-09T05:02:53Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000446102700023","Genome Biol Evol","9","Genome Biology and Evolution","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Such benefits are thought to emerge partly from scaling effects that increase efficiency as group size increases3,4,5. In social insects and other taxa, the benefits of group living have been proposed to stem from division of labour5,6,7,8, which is characterized by between-individual variability and within-individual consistency (specialization) in task performance. However, at the onset of sociality groups were probably small and composed of similar individuals with potentially redundant—rather than complementary—function1. Self-organization theory suggests that division of labour can emerge even in relatively small, simple groups9,10. However, empirical data on the effects of group size on division of labour and on fitness remain equivocal6. Here we use long-term automated behavioural tracking in clonal ant colonies, combined with mathematical modelling, to show that increases in the size of social groups can generate division of labour among extremely similar workers, in groups as small as six individuals. These early effects on behaviour were associated with large increases in homeostasis—the maintenance of stable conditions in the colony11—and per capita fitness. Our model suggests that increases in homeostasis are primarily driven by increases in group size itself, and to a smaller extent by a higher division of labour. Our results indicate that division of labour, increased homeostasis and higher fitness can emerge naturally in social groups that are small and homogeneous, and that scaling effects associated with increasing group size can thus promote social cohesion at the incipient stages of group living.",,,,"0028-0836||1476-4687",,"10.1038/s41586-018-0422-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/447998","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Fitness benefits and emergent division of labour at the onset of group living","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"2020-10-26T15:53:22Z",,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"7720","Nature","560","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Hyperspectral remote sensing has shown potential for the detection of plant diseases, but its utility for phenotyping large and diverse populations of plants under field conditions requires further evaluation. In this study, we collected canopy hyperspectral data from 335 wheat varieties using a spectroradiometer, and we investigated the use of canopy reflectance for detecting the Septoria tritici blotch (STB) disease and for quantifying the severity of infection. Canopy- and leaf-level infection metrics of STB based on traditional visual assessments and automated analyses of leaf images were used as ground truth data. Results showed (i) that canopy reflectance and the selected spectral indices show promise for quantifying STB infections, and (ii) that the normalized difference water index (NDWI) showed the best performance in detecting STB compared to other spectral indices. Moreover, partial least squares (PLS) regression models allowed for an improvement in the prediction of STB metrics. The PLS discriminant analysis (PLSDA) model calibrated based on the spectral data of four reference varieties was able to discriminate between the diseased and healthy canopies among the 335 varieties with an accuracy of 93% (Kappa = 0.60). Finally, the PLSDA model predictions allowed for the identification of wheat genotypes that are potentially more susceptible to STB, which was confirmed by the STB visual assessment. This study demonstrates the great potential of using canopy hyperspectral remote sensing to improve foliar disease assessment and to facilitate plant breeding for disease resistance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000289616",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2018.01195","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/289616","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Field-based phenotyping||Hyperspectral remote sensing||Partial least squares discriminant analysis||Plant phenotyping||Plant spectroscopy||Resistance breeding||Septoria tritici blotch||Wheat disease","Hyperspectral Canopy Sensing of Wheat Septoria Tritici Blotch Disease","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-09-14T05:35:04Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85054505567",,"000441883600001","Front.

However, as they often are environmentally induced, establishing their genetic basis is challenging. One important, but largely neglected, source of maternal effects are egg coats (i.e., the maternally derived extracellular matrix that surrounds the embryo). In the moor frog, the gelatinous egg coats (i.e., egg jelly) are produced in the mother’s oviduct and consist primarily of highly glycosylated mucin type O-glycans. These O-glycans affect jelly water balance and, subsequently, contribute to adaptive divergence in embryonic acid tolerance. To identify candidate genes for maternal effects, we conducted RNAseq transcriptomics on oviduct samples from seven R. arvalis females, representing the full range of within and among population variation in embryonic acid stress tolerance across our study populations. De novo sequencing of these oviduct transcriptomes detected 124,071 unigenes and functional annotation analyses identified a total of 57,839 unigenes, of which several identified genes likely code for variation in egg jelly coats. These belonged to two main groups: mucin type core protein genes and five different types of glycosylation genes. We further predict 26,711 gene-linked microsatellite (simple sequence repeats) and 231,274 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Our study provides the first set of genomic resources for R. arvalis, an emerging model system for the study of ecology and evolution in natural populations, and gives insight into the genetic architecture of egg coat mediated maternal effects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000285484",,"2167-8359","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/285484||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316074","10.7717/peerj.5452","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316645","en","PeerJ","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Amphibian||Egg coat||Glycosylation||Maternal effect genes||RNA seq||Rana arvalis||Transcriptome||Moor frog||Oviduct||Acidification","De novo oviduct transcriptome of the moor frog Rana arvalis: a quest for maternal effect candidate genes","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-08-30T04:31:16Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000441995700005","PeerJ",,"PeerJ","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, little work has examined how different trichome types influence herbivory by herbivores at different stages of development. We examined whether caterpillar instar and trichome type (glandular or non-glandular) affected the ability of the specialist herbivore caterpillar Manduca sexta to initiate feeding on 11 Solanaceous species exhibiting variation in the density and type of leaf trichomes. Our results suggest that non-glandular trichomes are far more effective than glandular trichomes in deterring the initiation of feeding by first- and second-instar caterpillars. Meanwhile, neither glandular nor non-glandular trichomes significantly affected the ability of third-instar caterpillars to commence feeding. These findings suggest that while non-glandular trichomes deter feeding initiation by early instar caterpillars, the contribution of both trichomes on later instars may depend on effects after feeding initiation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000289903",,"1942-0889",,"10.1080/19420889.2018.1486653","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/289903","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Glandular trichomes||larval instar||Manduca sexta||non-glandular trichomes||Solanaceae","Leaf trichomes affect caterpillar feeding in an instar-specific manner","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-09-17T08:22:14Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85051834314",,,"Commun Integr Biol","3","Communicative & Integrative Biology","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Well-known examples include sexual conflict between males and females and antagonistic coevolution between hosts and parasites. A common feature of such conflicts is that compensating evolutionary change in each of the parties can lead to little overt change in the interaction itself. As a result, evolutionary conflict is expected to persist even if the evolutionary dynamic between the parties reaches an equilibrium. In these cases, it is of interest to know whether certain kinds of interactions are expected to lead to greater or lesser evolutionary conflict at such evolutionary stalemates. Here we present a theoretical analysis showing that when one of the interacting parties can respond to the other through adaptive phenotypic plasticity, evolutionary conflict is reduced. Paradoxically, however, it is the party that does not express adaptive plasticity that experiences less conflict. Conflict for the party displaying adaptive plasticity can increase or decrease, depending on the situation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000268616",,"0003-0147||1537-5323",,"10.1086/698170","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268616","en","University of Chicago Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","evolutionary theory||sexual conflict||host-parasite conflict||arms race||sexual selection||interlocus conflict","The Role of Phenotypic Plasticity in Moderating Evolutionary Conflict","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-06-08T07:17:17Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"30016156","85047666890",,"000438972600012","Amer Natur","2","The American Naturalist","192","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Native forests on oceanic islands are important refugia for endemic species, many of which are rare and highly threatened. Long-term monitoring schemes for those biota and ecosystems are urgently needed: (i) to provide quantitative baselines for detecting changes within island ecosystems, (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation and management actions, and (iii) to identify general ecological patterns and processes using multiple island systems as repeated ‘natural experiments’. In this contribution, we call for a Global Island Monitoring Scheme (GIMS) for monitoring the remaining native island forests, using bryophytes, vascular plants, selected groups of arthropods and vertebrates as model taxa. As a basis for the GIMS, we also present new, optimized monitoring protocols for bryophytes and arthropods that were developed based on former standardized inventory protocols. Effective inventorying and monitoring of native island forests will require: (i) permanent plots covering diverse ecological gradients (e.g. elevation, age of terrain, anthropogenic disturbance); (ii) a multiple-taxa approach that is based on standardized and replicable protocols; (iii) a common set of indicator taxa and community properties that are indicative of native island forests’ welfare, building on, and harmonized with existing sampling and monitoring efforts; (iv) capacity building and training of local researchers, collaboration and continuous dialogue with local stakeholders; and (v) long-term commitment by funding agencies to maintain a global network of native island forest monitoring plots.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000268507",,"1572-9710||0960-3115",,"10.1007/s10531-018-1553-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268507","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Beta-diversity||Ecological gradients||Forest monitoring protocols||Island conservation||Long-term monitoring||Sampling standardization","Global Island Monitoring Scheme (GIMS): a proposal for the long-term coordinated survey and monitoring of native island forest biota","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-06-08T07:04:21Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85046550641",,"000436794700007",,"10","Biodiversity and Conservation","27","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

On the pathogen side, however, the molecular determinants of specificity remain largely unknown.     We used genetic mapping, targeted gene disruption and allele swapping to characterise the recognition of the new avirulence factor Avr3D1. We then combined population genetic and comparative genomic analyses to characterise the evolutionary trajectory of Avr3D1.     Avr3D1 is specifically recognised by wheat cultivars harbouring the Stb7 resistance gene, triggering a strong defence response without preventing pathogen infection and reproduction. Avr3D1 resides in a cluster of putative effector genes located in a genome region populated by independent transposable element insertions. The gene was present in all 132 investigated strains and is highly polymorphic, with 30 different protein variants identified. We demonstrated that specific amino acid substitutions in Avr3D1 led to evasion of recognition.     These results demonstrate that quantitative resistance and gene‐for‐gene interactions are not mutually exclusive. Localising avirulence genes in highly plastic genomic regions probably facilitates accelerated evolution that enables escape from recognition by resistance proteins.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000278759",,"0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.15180","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/278759","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","avirulence factor||diversifying selection||evasion of recognition||gene‐for‐gene interactions||genome plasticity||plant pathogen||quantitative resistance||transposable elements","A fungal avirulence factor encoded in a highly plastic genomic region triggers partial resistance to septoria tritici blotch","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-07-27T07:03:12Z",,,"yes",,,,"Genomics of quantitative traits and chromosome instability in Zymoseptoria tritici","155955","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,"85045873415",,"000438353300018","New Phytol.","3","New Phytologist","219","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Research in this direction is particularly relevant in that heatwaves are expected to increase in intensity, frequency, and duration in the coming decades, with likely consequences on river thermal regimes and ecology. In this study we analyzed the long-term temperature and streamflow series of 19 Swiss rivers with different hydrological regime (regulated, low-land, and snow-fed), and characterized how concurrent changes in air temperature and streamflow concurred to affect their thermal dynamics. We focused on quantifying the thermal response to the three most significant heatwave events that occurred in Central Europe since 1950 (July–August 2003, July 2006, and July 2015). We found that the thermal response of the analyzed rivers contrasted strongly depending on the river hydrological regime, confirming the behavior observed under typical weather conditions. Low-land rivers were extremely sensitive to heatwaves. In sharp contrast, high-altitude snow-fed rivers and regulated rivers receiving cold water from higher altitude hydropower reservoirs or diversions showed a damped thermal response. The results presented in this study suggest that water resource managers should be aware of the multiple consequences of heatwave events on river water temperature and incorporate expected thermal responses in adaptive management policy. In this respect, additional efforts and dedicated studies are required to deepen our knowledge on how extreme heatwave events can affect river ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000286347",,"2073-4441","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/286347||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316069","10.3390/w10081098","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316630","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","heatwaves||river water temperature||thermal response of rivers||extreme climate events||hydrological regime||thermal regime||air temperature||climate change","Exploring and quantifying river thermal response to heatwaves","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-09-01T07:41:15Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85052159552",,"000448462700132",,"8","Water","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

They are largely determined by natural factors, but also increasingly affected by anthropogenic factors. Thus, there is a need for a clear understanding of the human impact on species richness and beta diversity, the underlying mechanisms, and whether human-induced changes can override natural patterns. Here, we dissect the patterns of species richness, community composition and beta diversity in relation to different environmental factors as well as human impact in one framework: aquatic macrophytes in 66 boreal lakes in Eastern Finland. The lakes had been classified as having high, good or moderate status (according to ecological classification of surface waters in Finland) reflecting multifaceted human impact. We used generalized least square models to study the association between different environmental variables (Secchi depth, irregularity of the shoreline, total phosphorus, pH, alkalinity, conductivity) and species richness. We tested the null hypothesis that the observed community composition can be explained by random distribution of species. We used multivariate distance matrix regression to test the effect of each environmental variable on community composition, and distance-based test for homogeneity of multivariate dispersion to test whether lakes classified as high, good or moderate status have different beta diversity. We showed that environmental drivers of species richness and community composition were largely similar, although dependent on the particular life-form group studied. The most important ones were characteristics of water quality (pH, alkalinity, conductivity) and irregularity of the shoreline. Differences in community composition were related to environmental variables independently of species richness. Species richness was higher in lakes with higher levels of human impact. Lakes with different levels of human impact had different community composition. Between-lake beta diversity did not differ in high, good or moderate status groups. However, the variation in environmental variables shaping community composition was larger in lakes with moderate status compared to other lakes. Hence, beta diversity in lakes with moderate status was smaller than what could be expected on the basis of these environmental characteristics. This could be interpreted as homogenization.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000316052",,"1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2018.01001","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316052","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","biodiversity||beta diversity||community composition||eutrophication||human impact||null models species richness||water plants","Environmental Characteristics and Anthropogenic Impact Jointly Modify Aquatic Macrophyte Species Diversity","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-15T15:38:24Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Front.

Morphological transitions are one of the least understood of the many strategies employed by fungal plant pathogens to adapt to constantly changing environments, even though different morphotypes may play important biological roles. We characterized the responses of the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici to a series of environmental stresses in order to understand the effects of changing environments on fungal morphology and adaptation. We found that all tested stresses induced morphological changes, but different responses were found among four different strains. A transcription analysis showed that morphogenesis and virulence factors are co-regulated. We discovered that Z. tritici forms chlamydospores and demonstrated that these structures are better able to survive extreme cold, heat and drought than other cell types. We also show that blastospores (the ""yeast-like"" form of the pathogen typically found only in laboratory conditions) can form from germinated pycnidiospores on the surface of wheat leaves, suggesting that this morphotype can play an important role in the natural history of Z. tritici. Our findings illustrate how changing environmental conditions can affect cellular morphology and lead to the formation of new morphotypes, with each morphotype having a potential impact on both pathogen survival and disease epidemiology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000306855",,,,"10.1101/372078","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/306855","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Coping with stress: morphological changes in response to environmental stimuli in a fungal plant pathogen","Working Paper","Open access",,,"2018-11-28T13:12:17Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous studies monitoring the ecological effects of SBT operations on downstream reaches suggest a positive influence of SBTs on riverbed sediment conditions and macroinvertebrate communities based on traditional morphology-based surveys. Morphology-based macroinvertebrate assessments are costly and time-consuming, and the large number of morphologically cryptic, small-sized and undescribed species usually results in coarse taxonomic identification. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding analysis to assess the influence of SBT operations on macroinvertebrates downstream of SBT outlets by estimating species diversity and pairwise community dissimilarity between upstream and downstream locations in dam-fragmented rivers with operational SBTs in comparison to dam-fragmented (i.e., no SBTs) and free-flowing rivers (i.e., no dam). We found that macroinvertebrate community dissimilarity decreases with increasing operation time and frequency of SBTs. These factors of SBT operation influence changes in riverbed features, e.g. sediment relations, that subsequently effect the recovery of downstream macroinvertebrate communities to their respective upstream communities. Macroinvertebrate abundance using morphologically-identified specimens was positively correlated to read abundance using metabarcoding. This supports and reinforces the use of quantitative estimates for diversity analysis with metabarcoding data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000275830",,"2045-2322","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/275830||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316073","10.1038/s41598-018-28624-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316637","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Next-generation sequencing||Freshwater ecology","Ecological influence of sediment bypass tunnels on macroinvertebrates in dam-fragmented rivers by DNA metabarcoding","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-07-16T06:26:30Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85049634002",,"000437413200041","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It has long been hypothesized that the Glomeromycotina, the mycorrhizal symbionts of the majority of plants, facilitated colonization of land by plants in the Ordovician. This view was recently challenged by the discovery of mycorrhiza-like associations with Mucoromycotina in several early diverging lineages of land plants. Utilizing a large, species-level database of plants’ mycorrhiza-like associations and a Bayesian approach to state transition dynamics we here show that the recruitment of Mucoromycotina is the best supported transition from a non-mycorrhizal state. We further found that transitions between different combinations of either or both of Mucoromycotina and Glomeromycotina occur at high rates, and found similar promiscuity among combinations that include either or both of Glomeromycotina and Ascomycota with a nearly fixed association with Basidiomycota. Our results portray an evolutionary scenario of evolution of mycorrhizal symbiosis with a prominent role for Mucoromycotina in the early stages of land plant diversification.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000279713",,"2045-2322","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/279713||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316053","10.1038/s41598-018-28920-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316602","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Evolutionary dynamics of mycorrhizal symbiosis in land plant diversification","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-08-01T04:26:54Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85050381426",,"000438679100003","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In particular, we focus upon the isolation of myxophages from natural sources and describe the morphology and life cycle parameters, as well as the molecular genetics and genomics of the major groups of myxophages.

Here, we present analyses of the gene encoding a Gγ subunit in P. infestans, Pigpg1. The overall similarity of PiGPG1 with non-oomycete Gγ subunits is low, with only the most conserved amino acids maintained, but similarity with its homologs in other oomycetes is high. Pigpg1 is expressed in all life stages and shows a similar expression profile as the gene encoding the Gβ subunit, Pigpb1. To elucidate its function, transformants were generated in which Pigpg1 is silenced or overexpressed and their phenotypes were analyzed. Pigpg1-silenced lines produce less sporangia, which are malformed. Altogether, the results show that PiGPG1 is crucial for proper sporangia development and zoosporogenesis. PiGPG1 is a functional Gγ, and likely forms a dimer with PiGPB1 that mediates signaling.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000268604",,"1087-1845||1096-0937",,"10.1016/j.fgb.2018.04.012","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268604","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Signaling||GPCR||G-protein subunit||Phytophthora||Oomycetes","The G-protein γ subunit of Phytophthora infestans is involved in sporangial development","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-06-08T07:16:31Z",,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85047265163",,"000436055300008","Fungal genet. biol.",,"Fungal Genetics and Biology","116","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recent analysis of sequencing data from this stage of infection, however, showed high levels of shared mutations between independent viral populations. This suggests that selection might play a role in the early stages of HIV infection. We adapted an existing model for random evolution during acute HIV-infection to include selection. Simulations of this model were used to fit a global mutational fitness effects distribution to previously published sequencing data of the env gene of individuals with acute HIV infection. Measures of sharing between viral populations were used as summary statistics to compare the data to the simulations. We confirm that evolution during acute infection is significantly different from neutral. The distribution of mutational fitness effects is best fit by a distribution with a low, but significant fraction of beneficial mutations and a high fraction of deleterious mutations. While most mutations are neutral or deleterious in this model, about 5% of mutations are beneficial. These beneficial mutations will, on average, result in a small but significant increase in fitness. When assuming no epistasis, this indicates that, at the moment of transmission, HIV is near, but not on the fitness peak for early infection.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000318592",,"2057-1577",,"10.1093/ve/vey029","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/318592","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","HIV||Fitness effects distribution||Primary infection||Computational model||ABS-SMC","Estimating the mutational fitness effects distribution during early HIV infection","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-22T14:22:11Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000456426800011","Virus Evol.","2","Virus Evolution","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These data enable users to calculate temporal trends in biodiversity within and amongst assemblages using a broad range of metrics. BioTIME is being developed as a community-led open-source database of biodiversity time series. Our goal is to accelerate and facilitate quantitative analysis of temporal patterns of biodiversity in the Anthropocene. Main types of variables included The database contains 8,777,413 species abundance records, from assemblages consistently sampled for a minimum of 2 years, which need not necessarily be consecutive. In addition, the database contains metadata relating to sampling methodology and contextual information about each record. Spatial location and grain BioTIME is a global database of 547,161 unique sampling locations spanning the marine, freshwater and terrestrial realms. Grain size varies across datasets from 0.0000000158 km2 (158 cm2) to 100 km2 (1,000,000,000,000 cm2). Time period and grain BioTIME records span from 1874 to 2016. The minimal temporal grain across all datasets in BioTIME is a year. Major taxa and level of measurement BioTIME includes data from 44,440 species across the plant and animal kingdoms, ranging from plants, plankton and terrestrial invertebrates to small and large vertebrates.

The soil carbon temperature sensitivity is traditionally estimated from short-term respiration measurements – either from laboratory incubations that are artificially manipulated or from field measurements that cannot distinguish between plant and microbial respiration. To address these limitations of previous approaches, we developed a new method to estimate soil temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil carbon directly from warming-induced changes in soil carbon stocks measured in 36 field experiments across the world. Variations in warming magnitude and control organic carbon percentage explained much of field-warmed organic carbon percentage (R2  =  0.96), revealing Q10 across sites of 2.2 [1.6, 2.7] 95 % confidence interval (CI). When these field-derived Q10 values were extrapolated over the 21st century using a post hoc correction of 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) Earth system model outputs, the multi-model mean soil carbon stock changes shifted from the previous value of 88 ± 153 Pg carbon (weighted mean ± 1 SD) to 19 ± 155 Pg carbon with a Q10-driven 95 % CI of 248 ± 191 to −95 ± 209 Pg carbon. On average, incorporating the field-derived Q10 values into Earth system model simulations led to reductions in the projected amount of carbon sequestered in the soil over the 21st century. However, the considerable parameter uncertainty led to extremely high variability in soil carbon stock projections within each model; intra-model uncertainty driven by the field-derived Q10 was as great as that between model variation. This study demonstrates that data integration should capture the variation of the system, as well as mean trends.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000272804",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-15-3659-2018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/272804","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Field-warmed soil carbon changes imply high 21st-century modeling uncertainty","Review Article","Open access",,,"2018-06-28T05:30:45Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85048793492",,"000435491200002",,"12","Biogeosciences","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, limited availability and heterogeneous tissue composition of in vivo source material impose challenges on many experimental approaches. Results:  Here we adapt cell-type-specific DamID-seq profiling for use in Drosophila imaginal discs and make FLP/FRT-based induction accessible to GAL driver-mediated targeting of specific cell lineages. In a proof-of-principle approach, we utilize ubiquitous DamID expression to describe dynamic transitions of Polycomb-binding sites during wing imaginal disc development and in a scrib tumorigenesis model. We identify Atf3 and Ets21C as novel Polycomb target genes involved in scrib tumorigenesis and suggest that target gene regulation by Atf3 and AP-1 transcription factors, as well as modulation of insulator function, plays crucial roles in dynamic Polycomb-binding at target sites. We establish these findings by DamID-seq analysis of wing imaginal disc samples derived from 10 larvae. Conclusions:  Our study opens avenues for robust profiling of small cell population in imaginal discs in vivo and provides insights into epigenetic changes underlying transcriptional responses to tumorigenic transformation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000269936",,"1756-8935",,"10.1186/s13072-018-0196-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/269936","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","DamID||Wing imaginal disc||Polycomb||Scrib","DamID profiling of dynamic Polycomb-binding sites in Drosophila imaginal disc development and tumorigenesis","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-06-14T06:47:43Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85048073177",,"000434348000001","Epigenetics Chromatin",,"Epigenetics & Chromatin","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We investigated and summarized the literature on emerging HPAI H5 and H7 viruses with the aim of building a spatio-temporal database of all these recorded conversions and reassortments events. We subsequently mapped the spatio-temporal distribution of known emergence events, as well as the species and production systems that they were associated with, the aim being to establish their main characteristics. From 1959 onwards, we identified a total of 39 independent H7 and H5 LPAI to HPAI conversion events. All but two of these events were reported in commercial poultry production systems, and a majority of these events took place in high-income countries. In contrast, a total of 127 reassortments have been reported from 1983 to 2015, which predominantly took place in countries with poultry production systems transitioning from backyard to intensive production systems. Those systems are characterized by several co-circulating viruses, multiple host species, regular contact points in live bird markets, limited biosecurity within value chains, and frequent vaccination campaigns that impose selection pressures for emergence of novel reassortants. We conclude that novel HPAI emergences by these two mechanisms occur in different ecological niches, with different viral, environmental and host associated factors, which has implications in early detection and management and mitigation of the risk of emergence of novel HPAI viruses.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000271865",,"2297-1769",,"10.3389/fvets.2018.00084","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/271865","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","novel hPai emergences||low pathogenic to highly pathogenic conversion||reassortment||spatial and temporal pattern||phylogeography","Geographical and historical patterns in the emergences of novel highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 and H7 viruses in poultry","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-06-23T06:09:31Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85048612728",,"000451963000001","Front.

Being physical objects that can be re-studied by other researchers, types permanently link taxonomy (an artificial agreement to classify biological diversity) with nomenclature (an artificial agreement to name biological diversity). Two proposals to amend the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), allowing DNA sequences alone (of any region and extent) to serve as types of taxon names for voucherless fungi (mainly putative taxa from environmental DNA sequences), have been submitted to be voted on at the 11th International Mycological Congress (Puerto Rico, July 2018). We consider various genetic processes affecting the distribution of alleles among taxa and find that alleles may not consistently and uniquely represent the species within which they are contained. Should the proposals be accepted, the meaning of nomenclatural types would change in a fundamental way from physical objects as sources of data to the data themselves. Such changes are conducive to irreproducible science, the potential typification on artefactual data, and massive creation of names with low information content, ultimately causing nomenclatural instability and unnecessary work for future researchers that would stall future explorations of fungal diversity. We conclude that the acceptance of DNA sequences alone as types of names of taxa, under the terms used in the current proposals, is unnecessary and would not solve the problem of naming putative taxa known only from DNA sequences in a scientifically defensible way. As an alternative, we highlight the use of formulas for naming putative taxa (candidate taxa) that do not require any modification of the ICN.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000308024",,"2210-6340||2210-6359",,"10.5598/imafungus.2018.09.01.10","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/308024","en","International Mycological Association","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/","IMC11||nomenclature||speciation||taxonomy||typification||voucherless fungi","Considerations and consequences of allowing DNA sequence data as types of fungal taxa","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-12-03T08:03:52Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","IMA Fungus","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the impact of this selection on plant pathogen genomes remains largely unknown. We aimed to identify the proportion of the genome and the specific gene functions under positive selection in populations of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. First, we performed genome scans in four field populations that were sampled from different continents and on distinct wheat cultivars to test which genomic regions are under recent selection. Based on extended haplotype homozygosity and composite likelihood ratio tests, we identified 384 and 81 selective sweeps affecting 4% and 0.5% of the 35 Mb core genome, respectively. We found differences both in the number and the position of selective sweeps across the genome between populations. Using a XtX‐based outlier detection approach, we identified 51 extremely divergent genomic regions between the allopatric populations, suggesting that divergent selection led to locally adapted pathogen populations. We performed an outlier detection analysis between two sympatric populations infecting two different wheat cultivars to identify evidence for host‐driven selection. Selective sweep regions harboured genes that are likely to play a role in successfully establishing host infections. We also identified secondary metabolite gene clusters and an enrichment in genes encoding transporter and protein localization functions. The latter gene functions mediate responses to environmental stress, including interactions with the host. The distinct gene functions under selection indicate that both local host genotypes and abiotic factors contributed to local adaptation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000271872",,"0962-1083||1365-294X",,"10.1111/mec.14711","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/271872","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","adaptation||ecological genetics||fungi||molecular evolution||natural selection and contemporary evolution||population genetics — empirical","Genome-wide evidence for divergent selection between populations of a major agricultural pathogen","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-06-23T06:12:25Z",,,"yes",,,,"Genomics of quantitative traits and chromosome instability in Zymoseptoria tritici","155955","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,"85047475811",,"000434977700007","Mol Ecol","12","Molecular Ecology","27","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They are globally distributed and display a huge amount of phenotypic diversity. They demonstrate high adaptability to diverse environments and to fluctuating conditions within their hosts. However, not much is known about the mechanisms underlying these processes of adaptation. Deciphering the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity may help us to get a deeper insight into the mechanisms that regulate complex adaptive traits. Furthermore, these findings may help in improving strategies for an effective and sustainable management of pathogens.  In my PhD study, I aimed to understand the genetic basis of adaptation to variable environments using Zymoseptoria tritici. Z. tritici causes septoria leaf blotch of wheat and is considered to be the most devastating fungal wheat pathogen in Europe.  In the first chapter of my thesis, I studied the role of melanin in adaptation of Z. tritici. I, demonstrated that melanin is essential for protection against harmful chemical fungicides such as bixafen. Remarkably, I observed high phenotypic variability in melanin accumulation levels in different Zymoseptoria tritici strains, most probably reflecting its role in adaptation to variable environments. Using genetic mapping, I was able to demonstrate that variability in melanization levels between two Swiss strains of Z. tritici was mediated by differential expression of the transcription factor Zmr1 (Zymoseptoria melanin regulation 1). I identified nucleotide mutations in the promoter region and an insertion of transposable elements (TEs) upstream of the promoter region as two mechanisms responsible for this observed differential expression of Zmr1. My findings clearly demonstrated the significance of gene expression regulation, mediated by the insertion of TEs and SNPs, in optimizing the growth and adaptation of the fungus under variable environments. Furthermore, these adaptive changes are responsible for the phenotypic diversity that we observe in Z. tritici strains from all over the world. In the second part of my thesis, I analyzed the expression of several secreted peptidases of Z. tritici at distinct stages during the infection process of wheat plants. Using computational genetic methods, I also analyzed nucleotide data sets of the peptidase genes for evolutionary signatures of genetic adaptation. By combining both approaches, I aimed at obtaining a more detailed picture of the relevance and the role of each enzyme during the infection process. I was able to show that the peptidases belonging to MEROPS families A1 and G1 were significantly up regulated during the asymptomatic phase of infection and displayed signatures of accelerated evolution, suggesting their key role in suppression of plant defenses and host specialization. In the third part of my thesis, I evaluated the role of a cellulase-encoding gene (JGI Prot. ID: 76589) using molecular biology techniques. This cellulase was only expressed during the final necrotrophic phase of Z. tritici infection and the nucleotide sequences of the gene showed signatures of diversifying selection. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis of evasion from host recognition during the first phases of infection and subsequent induction of host-cell death by the secretion of an array of different cellulase isoforms by the fungus. To test this hypothesis, I constitutively expressed the cellulase-encoding gene in Z. tritici during all infection stages by inserting a constitutive promoter (originally from the Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene of Aspergillus nidulans) upstream of the start codon of the cellulase gene. I was able to show that the progress of infection in this mutant was delayed compared to the non-modified Z. tritici isolates. This suggests that the cellulase acts as an elicitor molecule that is detected by the plant and triggers the defense machinery that will hinder the growth of the pathogen. In summary, my PhD work demonstrated the significance of fine-tuning of gene expression regulation of various genes in plant pathogenic fungi to facilitate adaptation to different environmental conditions and host colonization. Remarkably, I was able to show that gene expression fine-tuning resulted in large amounts of phenotypic diversity in adaptive traits.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000272843",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/272843","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","ZYMOSEPTORIA TRITICI, SEPTORIA LEAF BLOTCH (PLANT PATHOLOGY)||GENE EXPRESSION (GENETICS)||ADAPTATION||VIRULENCE, PATHOGENICITY AND PATHOTYPES OF PATHOGENS AND PESTS (PHYTOMEDICINE)||EVOLUTION (BIOLOGIE)||SELECTION (BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION)||TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS","Significance of Gene Expression Regulation for Environmental and Host Adaptation in Plant Pathogenic Fungi","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2018-06-28T06:26:35Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"25001",,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The fidelity of pairing and segregation of homologous chromosomes has a major impact on the proper transmission of genetic information. Aberrant chromosomal transmission can have major phenotypic consequences, yet the mechanisms are poorly understood. Fungi are excellent models to investigate processes of chromosomal transmission, because many species have highly polymorphic genomes that include accessory chromosomes. Inheritance of accessory chromosomes is often unstable and chromosomal losses have little impact on fitness. We analyzed chromosomal inheritance in 477 progeny coming from two crosses of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. For this, we developed a high-throughput screening method based on restriction site-associated DNA sequencing that generated dense coverage of genetic markers along each chromosome. We identified rare instances of chromosomal duplications (disomy) in core chromosomes. Accessory chromosomes showed high overall frequencies of disomy. Chromosomal rearrangements were found exclusively on accessory chromosomes and were more frequent than disomy. Accessory chromosomes present in only one of the parents in an analyzed cross were inherited at significantly higher rates than the expected 1:1 segregation ratio. Both the chromosome and the parental background had significant impacts on the rates of disomy, losses, rearrangements, and distorted inheritance. We found that chromosomes with higher sequence similarity and lower repeat content were inherited more faithfully. The large number of rearranged progeny chromosomes identified in this species will enable detailed analyses of the mechanisms underlying chromosomal rearrangement.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000285923",,"1759-6653",,"10.1093/gbe/evy100","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/285923","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","fungi||meiosis||chromosome rearrangements||progeny sequencing","Meiosis leads to pervasive copy-number variation and distorted inheritance of accessory chromosomes of the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-08-31T06:59:01Z",,,"yes",,,,"Genomics of quantitative traits and chromosome instability in Zymoseptoria tritici","155955","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,"85051970277",,"000442377200006","Genome Biol Evol","6","Genome Biology and Evolution","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The phenotype of this DNA sequence is its ability to bind one or more TFs. We study this GP map using genotype networks, in which nodes represent genotypes with the same phenotype, and edges connect nodes if their genotypes differ by a single small mutation. We describe the structure and arrangement of genotype networks within the space of all possible binding sites for 525 TFs from three eukaryotic species encompassing three kingdoms of life (animal, plant, and fungi). We thus provide a high‐resolution depiction of the architecture of an empirical GP map. Among a number of findings, we show that these genotype networks are “small‐world” and assortative, and that they ubiquitously overlap and interface with one another. We also use polymorphism data from Arabidopsis thaliana to show how genotype network structure influences the evolution of TF‐binding sites in vivo.

Tolerance mechanisms are currently intensively studied with the long-term goal of exploiting them therapeutically. Because tolerance-based treatment imposes less selective pressure on the pathogen it has been hypothesised to be “evolution-proof”. However, the primary public health goal is to reduce the incidence and mortality associated with a disease. From this perspective, tolerance-based treatment bears the risk of increasing the prevalence of the disease, which may lead to increased mortality. We assessed the promise of tolerance-based treatment strategies using mathematical models. Conventional treatment was implemented as an increased recovery rate, while tolerance-based treatment was assumed to reduce the disease-related mortality of infected hosts without affecting recovery. We investigated the endemic phase of two types of infections: acute and chronic. Additionally, we considered the effect of pathogen resistance against conventional treatment. We show that, for low coverage of tolerance-based treatment, chronic infections can cause even more deaths than without treatment. Overall, we found that conventional treatment always outperforms tolerance-based treatment, even when we allow the emergence of pathogen resistance. Our results cast doubt on the potential benefit of tolerance-based over conventional treatment. Any clinical application of tolerance-based treatment of infectious diseases has to consider the associated detrimental epidemiological feedback.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000270231",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006119","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/270231","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Assessing the public health impact of tolerance-based therapies with mathematical models","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-06-15T07:02:16Z",,,"yes",,,,"Infering virus colonization pathways from high-throughput genetic data","149769","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,"85048164901",,"000434012100012","PLOS comput. biol.","5","PLoS Computational Biology","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the 2000s, the epidemiology of ESBL-producing organisms changed as especially ESBL-producing Escherichia coli was increasingly described as an important cause of community-acquired infections, supporting the hypothesis that in more recent years ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae have probably been imported into hospitals rather than vice versa. Transmission of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae is complicated by ESBL genes being encoded on self-transmissible plasmids, which can be exchanged among the same and different bacterial species. The aim of this research project is to quantify hospital-wide transmission of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae on both the level of bacterial species and the mobile genetic elements and to determine if hospital-acquired infections caused by ESBL producers are related to strains and mobile genetic elements predominantly circulating in the community or in the healthcare setting. This distinction is critical in prevention since the former emphasises the urgent need to establish or reinforce antibiotic stewardship programmes, and the latter would call for more rigorous infection control.  Methods and analysis This protocol presents an observational study that will be performed at the University Hospital Basel and in the city of Basel, Switzerland. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae will be collected from any specimens obtained by routine clinical practice or by active screening in both inpatient and outpatient settings, as well as from wastewater samples and foodstuffs, both collected monthly over a 12-month period for analyses by whole genome sequencing. Bacterial chromosomal, plasmid and ESBL-gene sequences will be compared within the cohort to determine genetic relatedness and migration between humans and their environment.  Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the local ethics committee (Ethikkommission Nordwest-und Zentralschweiz) as a quality control project (Project-ID 2017–00100). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed medical journals, communicated to participants, the general public and all relevant stakeholders.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000272521",,"2044-6055",,"10.1136/bmjopen-2018-021823","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/272521","en","BMJ Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Transmission of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and their mobile genetic elements-identification of sources by whole genome sequencing: study protocol for an observational study in Switzerland","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-06-27T03:57:40Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85049976025",,"000433129800100",,"2","BMJ Open","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Quantifying variation at the single cell and colony level improves our ability to understand dynamics in natural communities. Automated high-frequency monitoring of these communities is presently limited by the absence of repeatable, rapid protocols to analyse SFCM datasets, where images of individual particles are not available. Here we demonstrate a repeatable, semi-automated method to (1) rapidly clean SFCM data from a phytoplankton community by removing signals that do not belong to live phytoplankton cells, (2) classify individual cells into trait clusters that correspond to functional groups, and (3) quantify the biovolumes of individual cells, the total biovolume of the whole community and the total biovolumes of the major functional groups. Our method involves the development of training datasets using lab cultures, the use of an unsupervised clustering algorithm to identify trait clusters, and machine learning tools (random forests) to (1) evaluate variable importance, (2) classify data points, and (3) estimate biovolumes of individual cells. We provide example datasets and R code for our analytical approach that can be adapted for analysis of datasets from other flow cytometers or scanning flow cytometers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000316080",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0196225","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316080","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Quantifying cell densities and biovolumes of phytoplankton communities and functional groups using scanning flow cytometry, machine learning and unsupervised clustering","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-15T15:42:28Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"PLoS ONE","5","PLoS ONE","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Genomes of plant pathogens often encode major effect loci for the ability to successfully infect specific host genotypes. Hence, spatial heterogeneity in host genotypes coupled with abiotic factors could lead to locally adapted pathogen populations. However, the genetic basis of local adaptation is poorly understood. Rhynchosporium commune, the pathogen causing barley scald disease, interacts at least partially in a gene-for-gene manner with its host. We analyzed global field populations of 125 R. commune isolates to identify candidate genes for local adaptation. Whole genome sequencing data showed that the pathogen is subdivided into three genetic clusters associated with distinct geographic and climatic regions. Using haplotype-based selection scans applied independently to each genetic cluster, we found strong evidence for selective sweeps throughout the genome. Comparisons of loci under selection among clusters revealed little overlap, suggesting that ecological differences associated with each cluster led to variable selection regimes. The strongest signals of selection were found predominantly in the two clusters composed of isolates from Central Europe and Ethiopia. The strongest selective sweep regions encoded protein functions related to biotic and abiotic stress responses. Selective sweep regions were enriched in genes encoding functions in cellular localization, protein transport activity, and DNA damage responses. In contrast to the prevailing view that a small number of gene-for-gene interactions govern plant pathogen evolution, our analyses suggest that the evolutionary trajectory is largely determined by spatially heterogeneous biotic and abiotic selection pressures.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000284550",,"1759-6653",,"10.1093/gbe/evy087","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/284550","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","population genomics||genome-wide selection scans||plant pathogen||fungi","Genome-wide detection of genes under positive selection in worldwide populations of the barley scald pathogen","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-08-26T06:44:45Z",,,"yes",,,,"Genomics of quantitative traits and chromosome instability in Zymoseptoria tritici","155955","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,"85051732718",,"000442376300011","Genome Biol Evol","5","Genome Biology and Evolution","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Quantifying the relationship between tree diameter and height is a key component of efforts to estimate biomass and carbon stocks in tropical forests. Although substantial site‐to‐site variation in height–diameter allometries has been documented, the time consuming nature of measuring all tree heights in an inventory plot means that most studies do not include height, or else use generic pan‐tropical or regional allometric equations to estimate height.   2. Using a pan‐tropical dataset of 73 plots where at least 150 trees had in‐field ground‐based height measurements, we examined how the number of trees sampled affects the performance of locally derived height–diameter allometries, and evaluated the performance of different methods for sampling trees for height measurement. 3. Using cross‐validation, we found that allometries constructed with just 20 locally measured values could often predict tree height with lower error than regional or climate‐based allometries (mean reduction in prediction error = 0.46 m). The predictive performance of locally derived allometries improved with sample size, but with diminishing returns in performance gains when more than 40 trees were sampled. Estimates of stand‐level biomass produced using local allometries to estimate tree height show no over‐ or under‐estimation bias when compared with biomass estimates using field measured heights. We evaluated five strategies to sample trees for height measurement, and found that sampling strategies that included measuring the heights of the ten largest diameter trees in a plot outperformed (in terms of resulting in local height–diameter models with low height prediction error) entirely random or diameter size‐class stratified approaches. 4.

In this study, we analyzed the trends and drivers of antibiotic consumption from 2000 to 2015 in 76 countries and projected total global antibiotic consumption through 2030. Between 2000 and 2015, antibiotic consumption, expressed in defined daily doses (DDD), increased 65% (21.1–34.8 billion DDDs), and the antibiotic consumption rate increased 39% (11.3–15.7 DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants per day). The increase was driven by low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where rising consumption was correlated with gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC) growth (P = 0.004). In high-income countries (HICs), although overall consumption increased modestly, DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants per day fell 4%, and there was no correlation with GDPPC. Of particular concern was the rapid increase in the use of last-resort compounds, both in HICs and LMICs, such as glycylcyclines, oxazolidinones, carbapenems, and polymyxins. Projections of global antibiotic consumption in 2030, assuming no policy changes, were up to 200% higher than the 42 billion DDDs estimated in 2015. Although antibiotic consumption rates in most LMICs remain lower than in HICs despite higher bacterial disease burden, consumption in LMICs is rapidly converging to rates similar to HICs. Reducing global consumption is critical for reducing the threat of antibiotic resistance, but reduction efforts must balance access limitations in LMICs and take account of local and global resistance patterns.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000260393",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.1717295115","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/260393","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","antimicrobial resistance||low-income countries||defined daily doses||antibiotic stewardship||antibiotics","Global increase and geographic convergence in antibiotic consumption between 2000 and 2015","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-04-25T02:37:16Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000429540300017","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","15","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","115","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Internet blogs have strongly contributed to this consensus gap by fomenting misunderstandings of AGW causes and consequences. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) have become a “poster species” for AGW, making them a target of those denying AGW evidence. Here, focusing on Arctic sea ice and polar bears, we show that blogs that deny or downplay AGW disregard the overwhelming scientific evidence of Arctic sea-ice loss and polar bear vulnerability. By denying the impacts of AGW on polar bears, bloggers aim to cast doubt on other established ecological consequences of AGW, aggravating the consensus gap. To counter misinformation and reduce this gap, scientists should directly engage the public in the media and blogosphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000227007",,,,"10.1093/biosci/bix133","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/227007","en","Oxford University Press (OUP)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","advocacy||communication||contrarian||global warming||skeptic||social media","Internet Blogs, Polar Bears, and Climate-Change Denial by Proxy","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-10T09:24:51Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4","BioScience","68","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We evaluated the ecosystem effects of river widening to improve sediment relations in the Thur River, Switzerland, 12 years after implementation. We tested if restored and non-restored reaches differed in water physico-chemistry, hyporheic function, primary production, and macroinvertebrate density and composition in relation to the flow regime. Our results showed that (i) spatio-temporal variation in sediment respiration and macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness were driven by interactions between restoration and flow; (ii) riverbed conditions including substrate size, organic matter content, and groundwater–surface water exchange changed due to restoration, but (iii) physico-chemistry, hydraulic conditions, and primary production were not altered by restoration. Importantly, our study revealed that abiotic conditions, except channel morphology, changed only marginally, whereas other ecosystem attributes responded markedly to changes in flow-restoration interactions. These results highlight integrating a more holistic ecosystem perspective in the design and monitoring of restoration projects such as river widening in resource management, preferably in relation to flow-sediment regimes and interactions with the biotic components of the ecosystem.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000258195",,"2073-4441","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/258195||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316065","10.3390/w10040439","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316614","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","flow regime||river restoration||sediment regime||sediment respiration||periphyton||macroinvertebrates||ecosystem structure and function||channelization","Evaluation of restoration and flow interactions on river structure and function: Channel widening of the Thur River, Switzerland","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-04-16T04:07:07Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85045124420",,"000434954900093",,"4","Water","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Winning competitors in this scenario have been referred to as ‘cheaters’ in some studies. Such interaction-specific fitness inequalities, as well as social exploitation (in which interaction between genotypes increases absolute fitness), might evolve due to selection for competitiveness at the focal behaviour or might arise non-adaptively due to pleiotropy, hitchhiking or genetic drift. The bacterium Myxococcus xanthus sporulates during cooperative development of multicellular fruiting bodies. Using M. xanthus lineages that underwent experimental evolution in allopatry without selection on sporulation, we demonstrate that interaction-specific fitness inequalities and facultative social exploitation during development readily evolved indirectly among descendant lineages. Fitness inequalities between evolved genotypes were not caused by divergence in developmental speed, as faster-developing strains were not over-represented among competition winners. In competitions between ancestors and several evolved strains, all evolved genotypes produced more spores than the ancestors, including losers of evolved-versus-evolved competitions, indicating that adaptation in non-developmental contexts pleiotropically increased competitiveness for spore production. Overall, our results suggest that fitness inequalities caused by social interaction during cooperative processes may often evolve non-adaptively in natural populations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000256178",,"0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2018.0054","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/256178","en","The Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","evo-devo||facultative cheating||fruiting bodies||multicellular development||non-adaptive evolution","Indirect evolution of social fitness inequalities and facultative social exploitation","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-04-09T04:01:53Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85044779893",,"000428940600017","Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1875","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","285","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recently, a CRISPR/Cas9 system has been developed for Phytophthora sojae, and since then it has been employed in two other Phytophthora spp. Here, we report our progress on efforts to establish the system in Phytophthora infestans. Using the original constructs as developed for P. sojae, we did not obtain any transformants displaying a mutagenized target gene. We made several modifications to the CRISPR/Cas9 system to pinpoint the reason for failure and also explored the delivery of pre-assembled ribonucleoprotein complexes. This report summarizes an extensive experimental effort pursuing the application of a CRISPR/Cas9 system for targeted mutagenesis in P. infestans and concludes with suggestions for future directions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000294846",,,,"10.1101/274829","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/294846","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Attempts to implement CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing in the oomycete Phytophthora infestans","Working Paper","Open access",,,"2018-10-12T06:38:30Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"43019049",,,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Establishment and enforcement of conservation legislation such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) therefore rely on correct species identifications, be it to assess the status of exploited species, to identify individuals and populations to be harvested, or to verify species identity declarations. Species diagnosis is challenging in many timber species due to insufficient reference collections, taxonomic work and expertise, and because identification keys often rely on ephemeral inflorescence, flower and fruit characters, which are often absent on living specimens in the field and cannot be analyzed on logs awaiting inspection. This facilitates international trade in illegally logged and wrongly declared timber and calls for methods enabling accurate species diagnosis of standing trees, logs, sawn wood and finished products.  We blindly sampled Malagasy Dalbergia rosewood and palisander species (Fabaceae, CITES appendix II) in the field to explore whether species can be delimited using an unguided approach and molecular markers. We then contrasted the molecular data with leaf morphological characters and evaluated the delimited units against existing taxonomic descriptions of Malagasy Dalbergia species. Classification analysis revealed that molecular data achieved substantially higher species-level resolution compared to leaf morphology, leading to a much lower misidentification rate. Furthermore, species delimitation results indicated a possible need for taxonomic revision of some species.  In conclusion, analysis of molecular markers is highly useful to perform species delimitation and diagnosis in taxonomically challenging groups. Results can be used to inform taxonomic revisions and to improve morphological identification keys. This paves the way for correct species identification of reference collections, particularly of sterile specimens, and thus provides the scientific foundation for all forensic timber identification techniques.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454177","en",,,,"Dalbergia (botany)||Madagascar (African Islands)||Republic of Madagascar||Cites","Molecular species diagnosis in CITES-listed Dalbergia precious woods - insights and implications for forensic timber identification","Other Conference Item","Metadata only",,,"2020-12-02T10:07:39Z",,,"yes","3rd Annual Meeting in Conservation Genetics","February 26-28, 2018","Vienna, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Domestication processes for clonally propagated perennials differ markedly from those for seed-propagated annual crops, mostly due to long generation times, clonal propagation and recurrent admixture with local forms, leading to a limited number of generations of selection from wild ancestors. However, additional case studies are required to document this process more fully.  Scope The olive is an iconic species in Mediterranean cultural history. Its multiple uses and omnipresence in traditional agrosystems have made this species an economic pillar and cornerstone of Mediterranean agriculture. However, major questions about the domestication history of the olive remain unanswered. New paleobotanical, archeological, historical and molecular data have recently accumulated for olive, making it timely to carry out a critical re-evaluation of the biogeography of wild olives and the history of their cultivation. We review here the chronological history of wild olives and discuss the questions that remain unanswered, or even unasked, about their domestication history in the Mediterranean Basin. We argue that more detailed ecological genomics studies of wild and cultivated olives are crucial to improve our understanding of olive domestication. Multidisciplinary research integrating genomics, metagenomics and community ecology will make it possible to decipher the evolutionary ecology of one of the most iconic domesticated fruit trees worldwide.  Conclusion The olive is a relevant model for improving our knowledge of domestication processes in clonally propagated perennial crops, particularly those of the Mediterranean Basin. Future studies on the ecological and genomic shifts linked to domestication in olive and its associated community will provide insight into the phenotypic and molecular bases of crop adaptation to human uses.",,,,"1095-8290||0305-7364",,"10.1093/aob/mcx145","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/228799","en","Oxford University Press",,,"Adaptation||phylogeography||introgression||Oleaceae||pathogen||microbes","On the origins and domestication of the olive: a review and perspectives","Review Article","Metadata only",,,"2018-01-15T14:19:28Z",,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85046089349",,"000427180100002","Ann Bot","3","Annals of Botany","121","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) is most often examined by controlling species richness and randomising community composition. In natural systems, biodiversity changes are often part of a bigger community assembly dynamic. Therefore, focusing on community assembly and the functioning of ecosystems (CAFE), by integrating both species richness and composition through species gains, losses and changes in abundance, will better reveal how community changes affect ecosystem function. We synthesise the BEF and CAFE perspectives using an ecological application of the Price equation, which partitions the contributions of richness and composition to function. Using empirical examples, we show how the CAFE approach reveals important contributions of composition to function. These examples show how changes in species richness and composition driven by environmental perturbations can work in concert or antagonistically to influence ecosystem function. Considering how communities change in an integrative fashion, rather than focusing on one axis of community structure at a time, will improve our ability to anticipate and predict changes in ecosystem function.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000316047",,"1461-023X||1461-0248",,"10.1111/ele.12895","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316047","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biodiversity||community assembly||composition||dispersal||ecosystem function||metacommunity||Price equation","Integrating community assembly and biodiversity to better understand ecosystem function: the Community Assembly and the Functioning of Ecosystems (CAFE) approach","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-15T15:37:15Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecol. lett.","2","Ecology Letters","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Phenotypic delay in bacteria is widely assumed to be negligible, despite the lack of direct evidence. Here, we revisited the question using recombineering to introduce antibiotic resistance mutations into E. coli at defined time points and then tracking expression of the corresponding mutant phenotype over time. Contrary to previous assumptions, we found a substantial median phenotypic delay of three to four generations. We provided evidence that the primary source of this delay is multifork replication causing cells to be effectively polyploid, whereby wild-type gene copies transiently mask the phenotype of recessive mutant gene copies in the same cell. Using modeling and simulation methods, we explored the consequences of effective polyploidy for mutation rate estimation by fluctuation tests and sequencing-based methods. For recessive mutations, despite the substantial phenotypic delay, the per-copy or per-genome mutation rate is accurately estimated. However, the per-cell rate cannot be estimated by existing methods. Finally, with a mathematical model, we showed that effective polyploidy increases the frequency of costly recessive mutations in the standing genetic variation (SGV), and thus their potential contribution to evolutionary adaptation, while drastically reducing the chance that de novo recessive mutations can rescue populations facing a harsh environmental change such as antibiotic treatment. Overall, we have identified phenotypic delay and effective polyploidy as previously overlooked but essential components in bacterial evolvability, including antibiotic resistance evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000251070",,,,"10.1371/journal.pbio.2004644","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/251070","en","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Effective polyploidy causes phenotypic delay and influences bacterial evolvability","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-03-20T02:27:37Z",,,"yes",,,,"The population biology of drug resistance: Key principles for a more sustainable use of drugs||Evolution and spread of drug resistance: A combined computational and experimental approach","268540||155866||268540||155866","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF||EC||SNF","FP7||Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)||FP7||Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,,,,,"85043693418",,"000426253300019",,"2","PLoS Biology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We put forward a new function‐based classification according to the way information is acquired by the immune systems: Darwinian immunity (currently known from, but not necessarily limited to, vertebrates) relies on the Darwinian process of clonal selection to ‘learn’ by cumulative trial‐and‐error feedback; Lamarckian immunity uses templated targeting (guided adaptation) to internalize heritable information on potential threats; finally, shotgun immunity operates through somatic mechanisms of variable targeting without feedback.  We argue that the origin of Darwinian (but not Lamarckian or shotgun) immunity represents a radical innovation in the evolution of individuality and complexity, and propose to add it to the list of major evolutionary transitions. While transitions to higher‐level units entail the suppression of selection at lower levels, Darwinian immunity re‐opens cell‐level selection within the multicellular organism, under the control of mechanisms that direct, rather than suppress, cell‐level evolution for the benefit of the individual. From a conceptual point of view, the origin of Darwinian immunity can be regarded as the most radical transition in the history of life, in which evolution by natural selection has literally re‐invented itself. Furthermore, the combination of clonal selection and somatic receptor diversity enabled a transition from limited to practically unlimited capacity to store information about the antigenic environment. The origin of Darwinian immunity therefore comprises both a transition in individuality and the emergence of a new information system – the two hallmarks of major evolutionary transitions.  Finally, we present an evolutionary scenario for the origin of Darwinian immunity in vertebrates. We propose a revival of the concept of the ‘Big Bang’ of vertebrate immunity, arguing that its origin involved a ‘difficult’ (i.e. low‐probability) evolutionary transition that might have occurred only once, in a common ancestor of all vertebrates. In contrast to the original concept, we argue that the limiting innovation was not the generation of somatic diversity, but the regulatory circuitry needed for the safe operation of amplifiable immune responses with somatically acquired targeting. Regulatory complexity increased abruptly by genomic duplications at the root of the vertebrate lineage, creating a rare opportunity to establish such circuitry. We discuss the selection forces that might have acted at the origin of the transition, and in the subsequent stepwise evolution leading to the modern immune systems of extant vertebrates.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000234046",,"1469-185X||1464-7931||0006-3231",,"10.1111/brv.12355","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/234046","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","major evolutionary transition||adaptive immunity||Darwinian immunity||Lamarckian immunity||shotgun immunity||evolutionary scenario","An evolutionary perspective on the systems of adaptive immunity","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-25T07:29:12Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000419965700026","Biol Rev,","1","Biological Reviews","93","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Around 10% of ART-naïve patients in Europe are infected with drug-resistant HIV type 1. Hence it is important to understand the dynamics of transmitted drug resistance evolution. Thanks to routinely performed drug resistance tests, HIV sequence data is increasingly available and can be used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship among viral lineages. In this study we employ a phylodynamic approach to quantify the fitness costs of major resistance mutations in the Swiss HIV cohort. The viral phylogeny reflects the transmission tree, which we model using stochastic birth–death-sampling processes with two types: hosts infected by a sensitive or resistant strain. This allows quantification of fitness cost as the ratio between transmission rates of hosts infected by drug resistant strains and transmission rates of hosts infected by drug sensitive strains. The resistance mutations 41L, 67N, 70R, 184V, 210W, 215D, 215S and 219Q (nRTI-related) and 103N, 108I, 138A, 181C, 190A (NNRTI-related) in the reverse trancriptase and the 90M mutation in the protease gene are included in this study. Among the considered resistance mutations, only the 90M mutation in the protease gene was found to have significantly higher fitness than the drug sensitive strains. The following mutations associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were found to be less fit than the sensitive strains: 67N, 70R, 184V, 219Q. The highest posterior density intervals of the transmission ratios for the remaining resistance mutations included in this study all included 1, suggesting that these mutations do not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility within the Swiss HIV cohort. These patterns are consistent with alternative measures of the fitness cost of resistance mutations. Overall, we have developed and validated a novel phylodynamic approach to estimate the transmission fitness cost of drug resistance mutations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000250011",,"1553-7374||1553-7366",,"10.1371/journal.ppat.1006895","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/250011","en","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Quantifying the fitness cost of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations through phylodynamics","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-03-15T03:57:02Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85042693972",,"000426477000038","PLoS Pathog","2","PLoS Pathogens","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02060 - Dep.

Aphids are among the most detrimental agricultural pests worldwide, and parasitoid wasps are frequently employed for their control. The use of asexual parasitoids may improve the effectiveness of biological control because only females kill hosts and because asexual populations have a higher growth rate than sexuals. However, asexuals may have a reduced capacity to track evolutionary change in their host populations. We used a factorial experiment to compare the ability of sexual and asexual populations of the parasitoid Lysiphlebus fabarum to control caged populations of black bean aphids (Aphis fabae) of high and low clonal diversity. The aphids came from a natural population, and one-third of the aphid clones harbored Hamiltonella defensa, a heritable bacterial endosymbiont that increases resistance to parasitoids. We followed aphid and parasitoid population dynamics for 3 months but found no evidence that the reproductive mode of parasitoids affected their effectiveness as biocontrol agents, independent of host clonal diversity. Parasitoids failed to control aphids in most cases, because their introduction resulted in strong selection for clones protected by H. defensa. The increasingly resistant aphid populations escaped control by parasitoids, and we even observed parasitoid extinctions in many cages. The rapid evolution of symbiont-conferred resistance in turn imposed selection on parasitoids. In cages where asexual parasitoids persisted until the end of the experiment, they became dominated by a single genotype able to overcome the protection provided by H. defensa. Thus, there was evidence for parasitoid counteradaptation, but it was generally too slow for parasitoids to regain control over aphid populations. It appears that when pest aphids possess defensive symbionts, the presence of parasitoid genotypes able to overcome symbiont-conferred resistance is more important for biocontrol success than their reproductive mode.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000230859",,"1752-4571||1752-4563",,"10.1111/eva.12532","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/230859","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","aphids||Aphis fabae||biological contro||defensive symbiosis||Hamiltonella defensa||Lysiphlebus fabarum||parasitoid||resistance","Rapid evolution of symbiont-mediated resistance compromises biological control of aphids by parasitoids","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-18T13:53:18Z",,,"yes",,,,"Symbiont-mediated coevolution in an insect host-parasitoid system","146341","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,,,,,,,"000426003200008","Evol.

Assessing the adaptive significance of structural variation is challenging, because most studies rely on inferences based on a single reference genome sequence. Results:  We constructed and analyzed the pangenome of Zymoseptoria tritici, a major pathogen of wheat that evolved host specialization by chromosomal rearrangements and gene deletions. We used single-molecule real-time sequencing and high-density genetic maps to assemble multiple genomes. We annotated the gene space based on transcriptomics data that covered the infection life cycle of each strain. Based on a total of five telomere-to-telomere genomes, we constructed a pangenome for the species and identified a core set of 9149 genes. However, an additional 6600 genes were exclusive to a subset of the isolates. The substantial accessory genome encoded on average fewer expressed genes but a larger fraction of the candidate effector genes that may interact with the host during infection. We expanded our analyses of the pangenome to a worldwide collection of 123 isolates of the same species. We confirmed that accessory genes were indeed more likely to show deletion polymorphisms and loss-of-function mutations compared to core genes. Conclusions:  The pangenome construction of a highly polymorphic eukaryotic pathogen showed that a single reference genome significantly underestimates the gene space of a species. The substantial accessory genome provides a cradle for adaptive evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000231834",,"1741-7007",,"10.1186/s12915-017-0457-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/231834","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Fungal pathogen||Genome assembly||Genome evolution||Pangenome analyses||Pathogen evolution||Zymoseptoria tritici","Pangenome analyses of the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici reveal the structural basis of a highly plastic eukaryotic genome","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-20T03:58:33Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85040363091",,"000422723700001","BMC Biol","1","BMC Biology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In evolutionary ecology, the latter is referred to as “per-parasite pathogenicity”. Using viral load and CD4+ T-cell measures from 2014 HIV-1 subtype B-infected individuals enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, we investigated if virulence—measured as the rate of decline of CD4+ T cells—and per-parasite pathogenicity are heritable from donor to recipient. We estimated heritability by donor–recipient regressions applied to 196 previously identified transmission pairs, and by phylogenetic mixed models applied to a phylogenetic tree inferred from HIV pol sequences. Regressing the CD4+ T-cell declines and per-parasite pathogenicities of the transmission pairs did not yield heritability estimates significantly different from zero. With the phylogenetic mixed model, however, our best estimate for the heritability of the CD4+ T-cell decline is 17% (5–30%), and that of the per-parasite pathogenicity is 17% (4–29%). Further, we confirm that the set-point viral load is heritable, and estimate a heritability of 29% (12–46%). Interestingly, the pattern of evolution of all these traits differs significantly from neutrality, and is most consistent with stabilizing selection for the set-point viral load, and with directional selection for the CD4+ T-cell decline and the per-parasite pathogenicity. Our analysis shows that the viral genotype affects virulence mainly by modulating the per-parasite pathogenicity, while the indirect effect via the set-point viral load is minor.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000229655",,"0737-4038||1537-1719",,"10.1093/molbev/msx246","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/229655","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","evolution of virulence||disease tolerance||per-parasite pathogenicity||heritability||HIV","Dissecting HIV Virulence: Heritability of Setpoint Viral Load, CD4+ T-Cell Decline, and Per-Parasite Pathogenicity","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-16T15:16:56Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85040582447",,"000419548800004","Mol Biol Evol","1","Molecular Biology and Evolution","35","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Fungal pathogens possess a high evolutionary potential that enables rapid evolution to environmental changes. Despite many evidence pointing to local adaptations in fungal pathogens, the genetic basis underpinning the adaptation processes remains poorly understood. The main objective of this PhD thesis is to study the genetic basis of adaptation in Rhynchosporium commune, the causal agent of the devastating barley scald disease. In this study, we resequenced the whole genome of 125 R. commune isolates collected from nine global populations: Iceland, Norway, Finland, Switzerland, Spain, Ethiopia, USA, New Zealand, and Australia. These populations represent a wide range of climatic conditions and agricultural practices with evident of selection acting on quantitative traits of virulence, thermal adaptation, and fungicide sensitivity. The analysis of population structures using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the whole genome grouped these isolates into three main clusters with evidence of gene flow among clusters. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the genetic basis of fungal resistance to the widely used azole class of fungicides. We found significant associations with SNPs located in conserved genes encoding a vacuolar cation channel YVC1, a transcription activator, and a saccharopine dehydrogenase. The YVC1 gene is involved in a conserved pathway critical to azole resistance in human pathogenic fungi. We found evidence for fitness trade-offs in the isolates accumulating resistance mutations suggesting azole resistance evolutions impose costs. We also performed genome-wide selection scans to identify footprints of recent selection that shaped the genetic variation in R. commune populations. Our analyses revealed widespread signals of selective sweeps across the genomes with little overlaps between the genetic clusters, suggesting that ecological differences drive divergent selection among these clusters. The strongest selective sweeps identified in our study encoded protein associated with various functions in response to abiotic and biotic stresses. Finally, we performed a comparative genomic analysis to investigate the evolution of a known R. commune effector, namely necrosis-inducing protein 1 (NIP1) and its association with host adaptation. In addition to the 125 genome sequences of R. commune, this study also included the whole genome assemblies of nine, eight, and four R. secalis, R. agropyri, and R. orthosporum strains, respectively. We found that the NIP1 effector gene shows presenceabsence polymorphism in all the four species. The phylogenetic analysis revealed a clear division of NIP1 into two major clades we named NIP1A and NIP1B. We found recent duplications of NIP1A and NIP1B following the speciation of R. commune with statistical evidence for the association with fungal virulence. Selection analyses suggest that NIP1A experienced a strong positive selection, while NIP1B experienced a relaxed purifying selection in R. commune. This suggests that selection pressures exerted by the host plant led to the rapid diversification of at least one paralog of the NIP1 effector gene. This study demonstrates the importance of nucleotide polymorphisms and structural variations in the evolution and rapid adaptation of NIP1 effector gene. Overall, these studies demonstrate the potential applications of multiple genomics approaches to substantially enhance our understanding of adaptive evolution in plant fungal pathogen.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000284275",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/284275","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","FUNGAL GENETICS (MYCOLOGY)||RHYNCHOSPORIUM (PLANT PATHOLOGY)||POPULATION GENETICS OF FUNGI (MYCOLOGY)||VIRULENCE, PATHOGENICITY AND PATHOTYPES OF PATHOGENS AND PESTS (PHYTOMEDICINE)||GENOMICS (MOLECULAR GENETICS)||PESTICIDE RESISTANCE + PESTICIDE EFFICIENCY (CROP PROTECTION)||EVOLUTION (BIOLOGY)||SELECTION (BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION)","The Genomic Basis of Adaptation in the Barley Fungal Pathogen Rhynchosporium Commune","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2018-08-24T06:34:05Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"25142",,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This has implications for antibiotic treatment: exposure to subinhibitory doses of antibiotics has been reported to increase bacterial mutation rates and thus probably the rate at which resistance mutations appear and lead to treatment failure. More generally, the hypothesis posits that stress increases evolvability (the ability of a population to generate adaptive genetic diversity) and thus accelerates evolution. Measuring mutation rates under stress, however, is problematic, because existing methods assume there is no death. Yet subinhibitory stress levels may induce a substantial death rate. Death events need to be compensated by extra replication to reach a given population size, thus providing more opportunities to acquire mutations. We show that ignoring death leads to a systematic overestimation of mutation rates under stress. We developed a system based on plasmid segregation that allows us to measure death and division rates simultaneously in bacterial populations. Using this system, we found that a substantial death rate occurs at the tested subinhibitory concentrations previously reported to increase mutation rate. Taking this death rate into account lowers and sometimes removes the signal for stress-induced mutagenesis. Moreover, even when antibiotics increase mutation rate, we show that subinhibitory treatments do not increase genetic diversity and evolvability, again because of effects of the antibiotics on population dynamics. We conclude that antibiotic-induced mutagenesis is overestimated because of death and that understanding evolvability under stress requires accounting for the effects of stress on population dynamics as much as on mutation rate. Our goal here is dual: we show that population dynamics and, in particular, the numbers of cell divisions are crucial but neglected parameters in the evolvability of a population, and we provide experimental and computational tools and methods to study evolvability under stress, leading to a reassessment of the magnitude and significance of the stress-induced mutagenesis paradigm.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000268493",,"1544-9173||1545-7885",,"10.1371/journal.pbio.2005056","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/268493","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Death and population dynamics affect mutation rate estimates and evolvability under stress in bacteria","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-06-08T07:02:37Z",,,"yes",,,,"Evolution and spread of drug resistance: A combined computational and experimental approach","155866","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,,,,,"85047830501",,"000433987500004","PLoS biol.","5","PLoS Biology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Our understanding of interactions between abiotic (e.g. antibiotics) and biotic (e.g. parasites) conditions, and how they affect microbial adaptation remains limited. Specifically, the role of viruses that infect bacteria (phages) in the evolution of antibiotic resistance is an area of growing interest. Not only because viral parasites are important in bacterial ecology and evolution, but also because they have the potential to be used therapeutically. In this thesis I develop and test hypotheses relating to bacterial and viral adaptation in ecologically complex systems.  In chapter 1 I give a general introduction to the thesis. In chapter 2, I investigated the role of antibiotic resistance alleles in bacterial responses to parasitic viruses (phages). I show that although some antibiotic resistance alleles can impede the evolution of resistance to phages via growth costs, the overall effect of resistance alleles is relatively weak, as compared to the strong effect of a mutator allele. In chapter 3 I investigated the counteracting effects of antibiotics on bacterial adaptation, specifically, the alteration of mutation supply rates via changes in bacterial population size or bacterial mutation rates. I present evidence that positive mutagenic effects are relatively weak, as compared to the strong negative effects of antibiotics in reducing population size. In chapter 4 I investigated phage host shifting across a range of different bacterial hosts. I used experimental evolution to evolve phage in the presence of novel bacterial host strains. I provide evidence that evolution can result in host shifts, but also in a variety of changes in virulence towards other hosts.  In chapter 5 I outline some of the broad themes that emerge from these research projects and point out some of the potential areas for future work.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000316339",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316339","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Bacterial and viral adaptation in ecologically complex systems","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2019-01-16T13:02:31Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"25022",,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Irrespective of their infection status, migratory animals must overcome vast distances to travel from breeding grounds to non-breeding grounds and back. However, such long-distance migrations are not only energy-demanding, but are also beneficial in many aspects; besides obvious benefits related to seasonal food availability, migrations are suggested to influence transmission dynamics to the advantage of the migrating host. To explore the specific interactions between migratory hosts and blood parasites, I aimed at identifying the importance of host migration in shaping the frequency, intensity and diversity of blood parasitism by investigating infections of avian hosts covering a spectrum of migration strategies. Further, I studied the effects of blood parasites on host migration on various levels from physiology and activity budgets through to their spatiotemporal migration patterns. To shed light on migration as a potential cause of avian blood parasite infections, I compared the prevalence, intensity and diversity of blood parasites in three sympatrically breeding sparrow species with migration strategies ranging from resident to partially and obligate migratory lifestyles. I found prevalence to be highest in the resident house sparrow, Passer domesticus, compared to the partially migratory tree sparrow, P. montanus, and the obligate migratory Spanish sparrow, P. hispaniolensis. While the intensity of infection was similar amongst the three species, the blood parasite diversity was higher in Spanish sparrows compared to tree and house sparrows. However, the additional diversity of the migrant host was not obviously composed of parasites acquired in the non-breeding areas. To examine the effects of blood parasites on host physiology, the resting and maximal metabolic rates of long-distance migratory great reed warblers, Acrocephalus arundinaceus, were measured from the late breeding season until the beginning of the migration period. This was done in individuals experimentally infected with a low-pathogenic Plasmodium parasite, in individuals with natural infections of several parasite genera, and the respective control groups. Both oxygen consumption during nocturnal rest and maximal oxygen consumption during exercise were not associated with parasitism - neither for the experimentally induced, nor for the naturally occurring, infections. In fact, the seasonal changes in metabolic rates, body condition and endurance suggest that also infected birds maintain their full potential to prepare for migration and perform endurance flights. Further, I used multi-sensor loggers and real-time quantitative PCR to relate the migration patterns and activity budgets of great reed warblers to their intensity of blood parasites infection. I found that most of the migration-related measures were not related to infection intensity, but more heavily infected birds showed increasingly delayed autumn migration departures. However, great reed warblers seem to compensate for potential parasite-effects on migration timing during other periods of the annual cycle, as I found maximal resting durations to decrease with increasing infection intensity. Finally, I searched for infection-related delays in spring migration timing by investigating the temporal patterns in blood parasite prevalence of four passerine species captured on a stop-over site. In all four species, the proportion of infected individuals increased from the beginning towards the end of the spring passage period, implying a partial separation of infected and uninfected migrants within the migratory wave.  We conclude that host migration is important to be considered when examining the factors that shape the prevalence and diversity of blood parasite assemblages in avian hosts. However, the non-lethal avian malaria and related haemosporidian infections we studied generally seemed to have minor effects on their hosts. The increasing mobility of humans and goods as well as the ongoing climatic changes will allow vectors and parasites to spread to new regions. Since migratory hosts are carriers of a diverse parasite fauna, parasites and vectors of migratory hosts, need to be further investigated to get a deeper understanding of how their interactions influence these dispersal tendencies. Finally, I argue that monitoring of the health status of both resident and migratory hosts are necessary to both detect hitherto unknown parasites and trends in the occurrence of known parasites early enough to intervene, e.g. by targeting protection towards vulnerable host populations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000309394",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/309394","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Disease ecology||Bird migration||Host-parasite interactions","Avian Malaria on the Move ‒ the Potential Causes & Cascading Consequences of Blood Parasite Infections in Migratory Birds","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::590 - Zoological sciences","2018-12-07T13:33:06Z","2019-09-09",,"yes",,,,,,,,,"25642",,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Accordingly, local genotypes will show higher fitness in their local habitats than genotypes from a foreign habitat introduced at this site (“local vs. foreign” sensu Kawecki & Ebert 2004). Understanding, how individuals are adapted to their environment is especially interesting and valuable in the context of climate change, which is thought to increase the frequency of disturbances that individuals have to cope with. Therefore, evolutionary biologist have a particular interest in genes involved in local adaptation to understand which biological functions are important in which environments and to comprehend how species will react to future climate change. The capacity of species to cope with changes will rely on sufficient genetic variation upon which selection can act.  Different methods exist to detect signals of adaptation. Landscape genomics (for example environmental association analysis) has the potential to find genes under adaptation by associating genomic variation with environmental data, hence linking signatures of selection with their potentially underlying environmental drivers. In this study, the alpine rock cress, Arabis alpina, was used to investigate signals of adaptation in heterogeneous alpine environments. The high-quality reference genome available and previous studies in ecological genetics make this species suitable as model system to study which parts of the genome show signals of adaptation and investigate key functions involved. 	When studying local adaptation, it is important to take into account the neutral genetic structure of the studied populations as it may mimic signals of local adaptation. These patterns come from neutral processes like gene flow, genetic drift and mutation, but not from non-neutral processes like selection. The phylogeographic structure of alpine species, predominantly shaped by these neutral demographic processes, can be complex, as the recurrent glaciations during the Pleistocene confined species to refugial areas from where they repeatedly recolonized their current range. Thus, in the first chapter of this thesis, I aimed to investigate the population structure of A. alpina across the Alps (372 individuals from 127 populations) and at the regional scale (364 individuals from 22 populations) in the western Swiss Alps—the study region of the subsequent landscape genomic investigations. Based on nuclear microsatellite data, I found that the pattern of genetic clusters across the Alps was coherent with that of previous phylogeographic analyses using anonymous molecular markers. In the western Swiss Alps, I discovered that the populations from this region showed several genetic clusters associated to different putative refugia, as presumably observed in other species. Moreover, the four study regions sampled for the environmental association analysis appeared to descend from the same original population, indicating a largely common genetic background. Our results not only substantiated the congruence of large-scale genetic structure using alternative types of molecular markers, but also set a helpful basis for further studies on ecological genomics in A. alpina. 	Studying local adaptation at small scale requires highly resolved and accurate genomic data. Therefore, I re-sequenced the whole genomes of 304 individuals from four nearby populations sampled in the western Swiss Alps. The second chapter describes the genomic diversity of the four sampled populations based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and transposable elements (TEs). The latter corresponds to a major fraction of plant genomes, but has hitherto been largely ignored regarding their role in adaptive responses to the environment. After stringent bioinformatic filtering, 291,396 SNPs and 20,548 polymorphic TEs were identified. Few SNPs were shared among the populations, unlike the TEs that were shared among populations to a large degree. Through the genomic context of both types of sequence variants, I described their potential impact on functional genes. Almost 5% of the SNPs were non-synonymous and 43% of the TEs were present within or next to 7,475 genes of A. alpina. These genes were enriched in functional categories related to reproduction and responses to biotic and abiotic stress. Overall, in addition to SNPs, TEs are likely to shape adaptive genetic variation in A. alpina as they might affect genes by their close vicinity. 	Finally, in the third chapter, I studied the extent of local adaptation in A. alpina. In order to capture signals of local adaptation at small scale, I ran association analyses of environmental factors, derived from digital elevation models based on high-resolution Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data, with the genomic variants previously described (SNPs and TEs). Latent factor mixed models indicated that both types of variants showed significant signals of local adaptation within gene flow distance, after controlling for neutral genetic population structure. The significantly associated high-impact SNPs were mainly involved in metabolic and cellular processes, and few were involved in reproduction. TE families responding to heat stress were highlighted, but their impact is difficult to assess given the lack of functional information. The observed signals of local adaptation in response to alpine environments seem to be mainly driven by humidity and solar radiation. The impact of the reproductive strategy (predominant selfing) and the demographic history of A. alpina on the observed signals of adaptation were finally discussed. 	In conclusion, this thesis presents the phylogeographic diversity of A. alpina over the Alps and in a region presumably at the junction of several glacial refugia, the western Swiss Alps. The re-sequencing of the whole genome of 304 individuals of four populations sampled from this region showed that TEs and not only SNPs evidenced genomic variation, some of which are apparently involved in adaptation to the local environment. These results open new perspectives on genome architecture and the role of variants in driving evolution within natural populations, highlighting the complexity of the genomics of adaptation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000320260",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/320260","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Arabis alpina||Whole genome sequencing||Transposable element||Landscape genomics||Genome wide diversity","Genomic Variation of Arabis Alpina (Brassicaceae) in Heterogeneous Alpine Environments","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences","2019-01-28T11:16:47Z","2020-01-28",,"yes",,,,,,,,,"25246",,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Secreted peptidases have been extensively studied for their role as effectors. In this study, we combined transcriptomics, comparative genomics and evolutionary analyses to investigate all 39 secreted peptidases in the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici and its close relatives Z. pseudotritici and Z. ardabiliae. Results RNA-seq data revealed that a majority of the secreted peptidases displayed differential transcription during the course of Z. tritici infection, indicative of specialization for different stages in the life cycle. Evolutionary analyses detected widespread evidence of adaptive evolution acting on at least 28 of the peptidases. A few peptidases displayed lineage-specific rates of molecular evolution, suggesting altered selection pressure in Z. tritici following host specialization on domesticated wheat. The peptidases belonging to MEROPS families A1 and G1 emerged as a particularly interesting group that may play key roles in host-pathogen co-evolution, host adaptation and pathogenicity. Sister genes in the A1 and G1 families showed accelerated substitution rates after gene duplications. Conclusions These results suggest widespread evolution of secreted peptidases leading to novel gene functions, consistent with predicted models of “escape from adaptive conflict” and “neo-functionalization”. Our analyses identified candidate genes worthy of functional analyses that may encode effector functions, for example by suppressing plant defenses during the biotrophic phase of infection.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000238552",,"1471-2148",,"10.1186/s12862-018-1123-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/238552","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Peptidases||Transcriptomics||Adaptive evolution||Neo-functionalization (NEO-F)||Escape from adaptive conflict (EAC)","Widespread signatures of selection for secreted peptidases in a fungal plant pathogen","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-02-04T03:58:27Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85041070074",,"000423752000001","BMC evol. biol.","1","BMC Evolutionary Biology","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We show that the proportion of siderophore‐producing taxa increases along a natural heavy metal gradient. A causal link between metal contamination and siderophore production was subsequently demonstrated in a microcosm experiment in compost, in which we observed changes in community composition towards taxa that produce relatively more siderophores following copper contamination. We confirmed the selective benefit of siderophores by showing that taxa producing large amounts of siderophore suffered less growth inhibition in toxic copper.

Here we explore how two strains of a plant virus – Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus, BYDV – influence the foraging performance and fecundity of two aphid species: Rhopalosiphum maidis and R. padi. We found that pre-inhabitation by R. padi on plants facilitates the subsequent foraging of conspecifics and R. maidis. Without the virus, the occurrence of facilitation is asymmetric because it depends on the order of species arrival. However, with virus we found facilitation irrespective of the order of species arrival. Furthermore, the virus also boosted the fecundity of both aphids. Analyses of nutrient content of virus-free and virus-infected plants show significant increases of essential amino acids, sterols, and carbohydrates. Such nutrient increases appear to underlie the facilitative interactions and fecundity of aphids on virus-infected plants. Our experiments demonstrate that the virus dramatically increases the food consumption and fecundity of aphids through intra and interspecific trophic facilitation, resulting in processes that could affect community organization.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000282080",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-018-30023-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/282080","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A plant virus (BYDV) promotes trophic facilitation in aphids on wheat","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-08-13T08:05:49Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85051091622",,"000440670200072","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It shows that the genera are often imprecisely or arbitrarily delimited from each other. The situation is exemplified by the genus Cionothrix for which the presence of intercalary cells is reported for the first time. The members of Pucciniosiraceae descended most likely from heteroecious species of the Puccinia-Uromyces complex (PUc) but the relationships are still largely unknown. Molecular analyses have not helped so far to remedy this situation because a reasonably complete phylogeny of the PUc to which the members of the Pucciniosiraceae could be linked is unavailable. It is attempted, therefore, to relate members of Pucciniosiraceae with possible heteroecious progenitors by analysing host relationships, especially by the application of ‘Tranzschel’s rule’. The power and restrictions of this approach are discussed mainly by examples from the genus Endophyllum. It is concluded that the analysis of host relationships is an effective method to identify possible heteroecious relatives of endocyclic rust fungi. Molecular studies that include such wisely selected candidate species may produce more reliable phylogenies even if only a restricted number of species are analysed.",,,"978-3-7001-8219-1||978-3-7001-8310-5",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/308021","en","Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften",,,"Mycology||rust fungi||taxonomy","The Pucciniosiraceae: Taxonomy of a polyphyletic family of the rust fungi (Uredinales)","Conference Paper","Metadata only","Biodiversity and Ecology of Fungi, Lichens, and Mosses",,"2018-12-03T07:52:44Z",,,"yes","Biodiversity and ecology of fungi, lichens, and mosses : Kerner von Marilaun workshop 2015 in memory of Josef Poelt","June 3, 2015","Graz, Austria",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For bacteria, antibiotics and viral parasites (phages) are two of the most common selection pressures and are both relevant for treatment of bacterial infections: increasing antibiotic resistance is generating significant interest in using phages in addition or as an alternative to antibiotics. However, we lack knowledge of how exposure to antibiotics affects bacterial responses to phages. Specifically, it is unclear how the negative effects of antibiotics on bacterial population growth combine with any possible mutagenic effects or physiological responses to influence adaptation to other stressors such as phages, and how this net effect varies with antibiotic concentration. Here, we experimentally addressed the effect of pre‐exposure to a wide range of antibiotic concentrations on bacterial responses to phages. Across 10 antibiotics, we found a strong association between their effects on bacterial population size and subsequent population growth in the presence of phages (which in these conditions indicates phage‐resistance evolution). We detected some evidence of mutagenesis among populations treated with fluoroquinolones and β‐lactams at sublethal doses, but these effects were small and not consistent across phage treatments. These results show that, although stressors such as antibiotics can boost adaptation to other stressors at low concentrations, these effects are weak compared to the effect of reduced population growth at inhibitory concentrations, which in our experiments strongly reduced the likelihood of subsequent phage‐resistance evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000283698",,"1010-061X||1420-9101",,"10.1111/jeb.13220","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/283698","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","antibiotic dosage||bacterial adaptation||bacteriophages||mutagenesis","Effects of prior exposure to antibiotics on bacterial adaptation to phages","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-08-21T14:37:42Z",,,"yes",,,,"Ecology of Antibiotic Resistance: Effect of Environment on Bacterial Adaptation to Antibiotics||The role of bacteria-virus interactions in antimicrobial resistance","148255||165803","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Ambizione||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,,,"000424255500009","J. evol. biol.","2","Journal of Evolutionary Biology","31","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we present a classification of the world’s tropical forests based on their phylogenetic similarity. We identify five principal floristic regions and their floristic relationships: (i) Indo-Pacific, (ii) Subtropical, (iii) African, (iv) American, and (v) Dry forests. Our results do not support the traditional neo- versus paleotropical forest division but instead separate the combined American and African forests from their Indo-Pacific counterparts. We also find indications for the existence of a global dry forest region, with representatives in America, Africa, Madagascar, and India. Additionally, a northern-hemisphere Subtropical forest region was identified with representatives in Asia and America, providing support for a link between Asian and American northern-hemisphere forests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000247422",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.1714977115","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/247422","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","biogeographic legacies||forest classification||forest functional similarity||phylogenetic community distance||tropical forests","Phylogenetic classification of the world's tropical forests","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-03-08T03:03:51Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85042624090",,"000425495000062","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","8","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","115","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Variation in gene expression contributes to phenotypic diversity within fungal species and affects adaptation. However, very few cases of adaptive regulatory changes have been reported in fungi and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Fungal pathogen genomes are highly plastic and harbor numerous insertions of transposable elements, which can potentially contribute to gene expression regulation. In this work, we elucidated how transposable elements contribute to variation in melanin accumulation, a quantitative trait in fungi that affects survival under stressful conditions.  Results We demonstrated that differential transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding the transcription factor Zmr1, which controls expression of the genes in the melanin biosynthetic gene cluster, is responsible for variation in melanin accumulation in the fungal plant pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We show that differences in melanin levels between two strains of Z. tritici are due to two levels of transcriptional regulation: (1) variation in the promoter sequence of Zmr1 and (2) an insertion of transposable elements upstream of the Zmr1 promoter. Remarkably, independent insertions of transposable elements upstream of Zmr1 occurred in 9% of Z. tritici strains from around the world and negatively regulated Zmr1 expression, contributing to variation in melanin accumulation.  Conclusions Our studies identified two levels of transcriptional control that regulate the synthesis of melanin. We propose that these regulatory mechanisms evolved to balance the fitness costs associated with melanin production against its positive contribution to survival in stressful environments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000278722",,"1741-7007",,"10.1186/s12915-018-0543-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/278722","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Epiallele||Gene expression variation||Quantitative trait||Melanization||Fungal plant pathogen||Transposable element||Wheat","Transposable element insertions shape gene regulation and melanin production in a fungal pathogen of wheat","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-07-27T06:56:18Z",,,"yes",,,,"Genomics of quantitative traits and chromosome instability in Zymoseptoria tritici","155955","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,"85050098219",,"000438789500001","BMC Biol","1","BMC Biology","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Cellular and molecular mechanisms promoting this smell loss are not understood. Here, we show that Drosophila melanogaster also loses olfaction before vision with age. Within the olfactory circuit, cholinergic projection neurons show a reduced odor response accompanied by a defect in axonal integrity and reduction in synaptic marker proteins. Using behavioral functional screening, we pinpoint that expression of the mitochondrial reactive oxygen scavenger SOD2 in cholinergic projection neurons is necessary and sufficient to prevent smell degeneration in aging flies. Together, our data suggest that oxidative stress induced axonal degeneration in a single class of neurons drives the functional decline of an entire neural network and the behavior it controls. Given the important role of the cholinergic system in neurodegeneration, the fly olfactory system could be a useful model for the identification of drug targets.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000231329",,"2050-084X",,"10.7554/eLife.32018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/231329","en","eLife Sciences Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Inhibition of oxidative stress in cholinergic projection neurons fully rescues aging associated olfactory circuit degeneration in Drosophila","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-01-19T11:21:01Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"eLife","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using Arabidopsis halleri, a model species for metal homeostasis and adaptation to extreme environments, we identifid genes, gene variants, and pathways that are associated with soil properties and may thus contribute to adaptation to high concentrations of trace metal elements. We analysed whole-genome Pool-seq data from two metallicolous (from metalliferous soils) and two non-metallicolous populations (in total 119 individuals) and associated allele frequencies of the identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with soil variables measured on site. Additionally, we accounted for polygenic adaptation by searching for gene pathways showing enrichment of signatures of selection. Out of >2.5 million SNPs, we identified 57 SNPs in 19 genes that were significantly associated with soil variables and are members of three enriched pathways. At least three of these candidate genes and pathways are involved in transmembrane transport and/or associated with responses to various stresses such as oxidative stress. We conclude that both allocation and detoxification processes play a crucial role in A. halleri for coping with these unfavourable conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000302223",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-018-33938-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/302223","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Transmembrane transport and stress response genes play an important role in adaptation of Arabidopsis halleri to metalliferous soils","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2018-11-09T05:01:53Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85055824142",,"000448813200006","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","8","::ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The ruling marked the next round of the dispute around agricultural genetic engineering in Europe. Many of the pros and cons presented in this dispute are familiar from the debate around the first generation of genetic engineering techniques. The current wave of enthusiasm for the new genetic engineering methods, with its claim to make good on the failed promises of the previous wave, seems to point more to an admission of failure of the last generation of genetic engineering than to a true change of paradigm. Regulation is being portrayed as a ban on research and use, which is factually incorrect, and the judges of the European Court of Justice are being defamed as espousing “pseudoscience”. Furthermore, this highly polarised position dominates the media reporting of the new techniques and the court’s ruling. Advocates of the new genetic engineering techniques appear to believe that their benefits are so clear that furnishing reliable scientific evidence is unnecessary. Meanwhile, critics who believe that the institution of science is in a serious crisis are on the increase not just due to the cases of obvious documented scientific misconduct by companies and scientists, but also due to the approach of dividing the world into those categorically for or against genetic engineering. In this construct of irreconcilable opposites, differentiations fall by the wayside. This article is a response to this one-sided and biased reporting, which often has the appearance of spin and lacks journalistic ethics that require journalists to report on different positions in a balanced and factual manner instead of taking positions and becoming undeclared advocates themselves.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000313644",,"2190-4715||2190-4707",,"10.1186/s12302-018-0182-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/313644","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","New techniques of genetic engineering||Precautionary principle||European Court of Justice||Bias||Media","European Court of Justice ruling regarding new genetic engineering methods scientifically justified: a commentary on the biased reporting about the recent ruling","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-04T03:50:51Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000454123600001","Environ Sci Eur",,"Environmental Sciences Europe","30","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Phylogenetic methods reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among organisms, whereas phylodynamic approaches reveal the underlying diversification processes that lead to the observed relationships. These two fields have many practical applications in disciplines as diverse as epidemiology, developmental biology, palaeontology, ecology, and linguistics. The combination of increasingly large genetic data sets and increases in computing power is facilitating the development of more sophisticated phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods. Big data sets allow us to answer complex questions. However, since the required analyses are highly specific to the particular data set and question, a black-box method is not sufficient anymore. Instead, biologists are required to be actively involved with modeling decisions during data analysis. The modular design of the Bayesian phylogenetic software package BEAST 2 enables, and in fact enforces, this involvement. At the same time, the modular design enables computational biology groups to develop new methods at a rapid rate. A thorough understanding of the models and algorithms used by inference software is a critical prerequisite for successful hypothesis formulation and assessment. In particular, there is a need for more readily available resources aimed at helping interested scientists equip themselves with the skills to confidently use cutting-edge phylogenetic analysis software. These resources will also benefit researchers who do not have access to similar courses or training at their home institutions. Here, we introduce the “Taming the Beast” (https://taming-the-beast.github.io/) resource, which was developed as part of a workshop series bearing the same name, to facilitate the usage of the Bayesian phylogenetic software package BEAST 2.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000167849",,"1063-5157||1076-836X",,"10.1093/sysbio/syx060","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/167849","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Bayesian inference||MCMC||Phylodynamics||Phylogenetics","Taming the BEAST - A Community Teaching Material Resource for BEAST 2","Other Journal Item","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences","2017-07-04T08:51:42Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85040108507",,"000419588000012","Syst Biol","1","Systematic Biology","67","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02060 - Dep.

Composition of microbial communities can be regulated in part by root exudates, but the specifics of these interactions in seagrass rhizospheres are still largely unknown. As light availability controls primary productivity, reduced light may impact root exudation and consequently the composition of the root microbiome. Hence, we analyzed the influence of light availability on root exudation and community structure of the root microbiome of three co-occurring seagrass species, Halophila ovalis, Halodule uninervis and Cymodocea serrulata. Plants were grown under four light treatments in mesocosms for two weeks; control (100 % surface irradiance (SI), medium (40 % SI), low (20 % SI) and fluctuating light (10 days 20 % and 4 days 100%). 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing revealed that microbial diversity, composition and predicted function were strongly influenced by the presence of seagrass roots, such that root microbiomes were unique to each seagrass species. Reduced light availability altered seagrass root exudation, as characterized using fluorescence spectroscopy, and altered the composition of seagrass root microbiomes with a reduction in abundance of potentially beneficial microorganisms. Overall, this study highlights the potential for above-ground light reduction to invoke a cascade of changes from alterations in root exudation to a reduction in putative beneficial microorganisms and, ultimately, confirms the importance of the seagrass root environment – a critical, but often overlooked space.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000316064",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2017.02667","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/316064","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","root microbiome||seagrass||exudation||light||dredging||16S rDNA||PARAFAC-EEM","Low Light Availability Alters Root Exudation and Reduces Putative Beneficial Microorganisms in Seagrass Roots","Journal Article","Open access",,,"2019-01-15T15:40:08Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
