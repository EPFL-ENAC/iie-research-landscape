These changes are associated with a number of interesting philosophical questions. This chapter provides an introduction to these questions. It starts by first clarifying terminological issues concerning “big data” and related terms and by giving an overview of big data elements that can be found in climate research. Second, it discusses data in climate research with a focus on new developments regarding the increase in the volume and complexity of climate data and on how the uncertainty of climate datasets may be assessed. Finally, the chapter addresses the topic of machine learning in climate research and specifically the use of machine learning for the data-driven modeling of climate phenomena. The focus of this discussion is on the representational accuracy of data-driven models and how it might be assessed and what this implies for their use for predictions and for understanding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000612397","978-3-030-16960-2",,,"10.1007/978-3-030-16960-2_9-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/612397","en","Springer",,,"Big data||Machine learning||Climate data||Climate models||Data-driven models||Uncertainty||Predictions||Scientific understanding||Climate change||Philosophy","Climate Research and Big Data","Book Chapter","Embargoed","Handbook of the Philosophy of Climate Change","DDC - DDC::1 - Philosophy & psychology::100 - Philosophy",,"2023-05-16T10:46:17Z","2025-04-14","yes","Combining theory with Big Data?

We contribute to transition research by proposing a process model for analyzing policy sequences by focusing on the interplay between policy instruments and institutional barriers. We conceptualize two ideal-type policy sequencing patterns - strategic and reactive - which we illustrate with empirical examples from early transition dynamics in the urban water sector of San Francisco (United States) and Sant Cugat del Vallès (Spain).

Bridging established methods in both infrastructure and risk modelling communities, we develop an open-source modelling framework which integrates a network-based interdependent infrastructure system model into the globally consistent and spatially explicit natural hazard risk assessment platform CLIMADA. The model captures infrastructure damages, triggers failure cascades and estimates resulting basic service disruptions for the dependent population. It flexibly operates on large areas with publicly available hazard, exposure and vulnerability information, for any set of infrastructure networks, hazards and geographies of interest. In a validated case study for 2018’s Hurricane Michael across three US states, the model reproduced important failure dynamics among six infrastructure networks, and provided a novel spatial map where people were likely to experience disruptions in access to healthcare, loss of power and other vital services. Our generalized approach allows for a view on infrastructure risks and their social impacts also in areas where detailed information and risk assessments are traditionally scarce, informing humanitarian activities through hotspot analyses and policy frameworks alike.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000606155",,"0951-8320",,"10.1016/j.ress.2023.109194","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/606155","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Risk assessment||Natural hazards||Critical infrastructures||Failure cascades||Basic service disruptions||System-of-systems","A generalized natural hazard risk modelling framework for infrastructure failure cascades","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-04-02T06:53:58Z",,"yes","Building a low-carbon, climate resilient future: climate action in support of the Paris Agreement||REmote Climate Effects and their Impact on European sustainability, Policy and Trade","821010||820712","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC","H2020||H2020",,"85150768059","000954873700001","Reliab. eng. syst. saf.",,"Reliability Engineering & System Safety","234","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This would reduce the pressure on agricultural land caused by spreading settlement area and related offsetting requirements. This raises the following question: to what extent have offset regulation and clearance compensation rules become more flexible to allow for compensation projects in the forest due to increased land-use conflicts? To address this question, we draw on the institutional change literature, which proposes that different modes of institutional change towards a flexibilization of offset regulation can be expected in different institutional contexts. Empirically, we focus on the sub-national contexts of two European countries: Bavaria in Germany and the Berne in Switzerland. Although in both cases the forest comprises one-third of their land cover, the cases exhibit quite different forest policies and biodiversity offset regulations. Making the forest area available for habitat compensation projects generally depends on the need (e.g. due to implementation deficits) and the political will to loosen the mitigation hierarchy in both realms. The analysis demonstrates that the preconditions of such institutional change (veto-power of opponents and discretion in implementation) favoured more radical reforms in German biodiversity offset regulation but allowed only tentative adaptions in Swiss forest clearance regulation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000603756",,"1389-9341",,"10.1016/j.forpol.2023.102934","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/603756","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biodiversity offseting||Compensatory afforestation||Forest clearances||Institutional change||Policy integration","Allowing for compensating lost habitats in the forest: Comparing institutional change in Germany and Switzerland","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-03-17T14:09:23Z",,"yes","Analyzing TRade-offs between sustainable Ecanomy and Environmental objectiues (ATREE)","172388","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 73: Gesuch",,"85149480571","000958934200001",,,"Forest Policy and Economics","150","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Many transition strategies include a central role for the forest and its ecosystem services in the pursuit of their sustainability goals. While this nurtures hopes that the economic significance of the forest sector will recover, a sustainability transition is likely to intensify further utilizations of forests. This certainly implies synergies in the targeted provision of various forest ecosystem services (FES), but it also bears the danger of increasing trade-offs and conflicts. Often caused by demand from other sectors, such trade-offs usually occur in the forest, i.e. between FES. Moreover, sustainable economy claims can also imply the clearance of forest area and thus are trade-offs with the forest. The collection of papers in this special issue elaborates on such trade-offs induced by sustainability ambitions and their implications for conflicts at the level of policy formulation and implementation. The cases reveal how land-use conflicts with the forest have become a tangible issue for sustainability transitions. Policy goal conflicts arising due to trade-offs between FES – being intensified by increased sustainability demands – are often tackled by suppressing FES not compatible with a prevailing timber-production oriented forestry tradition or delegated to the forest management level, where economic and power structures favor extractive forestry practices. The special issue thus highlights the various ways in which the forest can be impacted by sustainable economy transitions and encourages more attention as well as a more differentiated view of the role of the forest in these transitions.",,,,"1389-9341",,"10.1016/j.forpol.2023.102936","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/605912","en","Elsevier",,,"Forest ecosystem services||Trade-offs||Goal conficts||Implementation conflicts||Land-use conflicts||Sustainability transition","Sustainable economy trade-offs and conflicts in and with the forest (Research Trend)","Other Journal Item","Metadata only",,,,"2023-03-31T07:43:34Z",,"yes","Analyzing TRade-offs between sustainable Ecanomy and Environmental objectiues (ATREE)","172388","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 73: Gesuch",,,"000951493000001",,,"Forest Policy and Economics","150","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Building on an autoethnographic analysis of two projects in transformation and transdisciplinarity, we identify pathways to strengthen collaboration between these approaches: 1. moving from transdisciplinarity “for” transformation to transdisciplinarity “as” transformation and 2. identifying concrete spaces for conceptual and methodological cross-fertilization between these approaches.

However, in the natural hazard literature, the social vulnerability of and impacts on people are poorly reported or comprehensively understood. This is among one of the first studies, quantifying inequalities in natural hazard exposure depending on social vulnerability for several countries of the Global South, three hazard types, and two social vulnerability approximation datasets. We used the CLImate AD-Aptation (CLIMADA) platform to calculate whether socially vulnerable communities are more exposed to tropical cyclones, river floods, or wildfires than less socially vulnerable communities within a country. Therefore, we established the Inequality Coefficient, analogous to the well-known Gini Coefficient. We found that for the majority of the 93 countries from the Global South, socially vulnerable communities are more exposed to wildfire and less exposed to river floods compared with less socially vulnerable communities. For tropical cyclones, we observed no tendency across all countries. In general, and for all three hazard types, the extent of inequalities varies greatly across countries. In the case studies of Vietnam and Cambodia, we observed that mainly the socially less vulnerable communities live near rivers in cities and are more exposed to river floods. In contrast, wildfires primarily affect socially vulnerable communities living in rural areas. Another important finding is that the magnitude of inequalities strongly depends on the data used to approximate social vulnerability. This emphasizes the need to improve the quality, resolution, coverage, and validation of data to approximate social vulnerability. Despite the high uncertainty of the magnitude of inequalities, we could quantify and compare the inequalities of several countries. Thus, we highlighted countries and areas within countries where inequality in natural hazard exposure depending on social vulnerability is high. The method used could be applied to examine inequalities on a global level, inequalities between countries, or inequalities on a local level within cities. This is an important basis for monitoring sustainable development goals and for disaster risk reduction. In addition, the Inequality Coefficient can be used to compare how inequalities will change in the future with the increasing frequency and magnitude of extreme events due to climate change. This contributes to a fact-based climate justice discussion and enables statements about who carries the natural hazard risk.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000612368",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/612368","en","ETH Zurich",,,"Natural hazards||Inequalities||Exposure||Social vulnerability||Global south||Communities||Tropical cyclone||River flood||Wildfire","Inequality in Natural Hazard Exposure and Social Vulnerability in the Global South","Master Thesis","Embargoed",,,,"2023-05-16T09:11:59Z","2024-05-15","yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

There is a strong focus on mitigating energy-related emissions, as the energy sector is the largest greenhouse gas emitter globally. One central mitigation pathway lies in the transition towards a sustainable energy system fuelled by low-carbon renewable energy sources. A comprehensive and fundamental transformation of the energy sector is needed to integrate large shares of renewable energy and accommodate their intermittent, distributed production characteristics. Lower costs and ease of access to renewables have encouraged new players to emerge within the energy system. Community-led initiatives, such as energy communities, have gained traction as crucial elements in facilitating the energy transition by encouraging active citizen participation in energy-related matters. Energy communities are primarily involved in the energy supply side, collectively producing energy from renewable energy resources to self-consume on-site, and aim to deliver various environmental, social, and economic benefits to their participants. So far, the literature has given little attention to the ways in which the environmental impact of energy communities can be grasped, even though these are central aspects of the participation motivations and pursued goals. Thus, this study explores the approaches applied in the scientific literature to assess the environmental impacts of energy communities by conducting a systematic literature review. In addition, semi-structured interviews with representatives of five Pan-European energy communities were conducted to compare results between the literature review and the real-world cases. This study finds that the literature focuses on assessing the environmental impacts in terms of GHG or CO2 emission reductions of energy communities, prevalently employing solar PV to supply electrical energy to residential users. The findings of the interviews show that the energy communities’ environmental performance is deemed central; however, explicit assessments are either made externally or omitted altogether. The results of this study suggest that the literature’s focus does not fully coincide with the realities of real-world energy communities. Thus, future research is needed to examine real-world energy communities, taking into account case-specific contexts, to help the development of energy communities in practice.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000606120",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/606120","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Environmental Assessment of Energy Communities","Master Thesis","Open access",,,,"2023-03-31T15:43:52Z",,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Can rural agricultural development programs effectively transform these livelihoods and places of seasonal migration?  Following a mixed-methods approach, including a survey of 1,860 randomly sampled households in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka in India, we assess the potential of the Wadi program, which supports integrated farming systems, to boost the farmers’ agricultural productivity and to change their deeply entrenched but burdensome coping strategy of seasonal migration. When comparing participants of the program with non-participants, we find a significant reduction in the intensity and frequency of seasonal migration, as well as spillover effects – that is, not only the participants but also whole villages profit from an enhanced local economy. We further analyze the general challenges and migration pattern of seasonal migrants, including the factors that play a role in the decision to seasonally migrate. We find that it is crucial to change the reasons underlying seasonal migration in order to enable the development from distress to selective migration. This study’s results imply the benefits to be gained from scaling up the Wadi concept and provide evidence of its positive impacts as a contribution to the science–policy dialogue about development programs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000590334",,"2468-0532||2452-2929",,"10.1016/j.wdp.2022.100483","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/590334","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Seasonal migration||Chronic poverty||Rural development||Mixed farming||Smallholder||Land use change||Sustainable intensification","From distress migration to selective migration: Transformative effects of agricultural development on seasonal migration","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-05T05:17:29Z",,"yes",,,,,,,"85145100136","000914978600001",,,"World Development Perspectives","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Shifting passenger transport to more sustainable modes of transportation contributes to addressing this challenge. Multimodal transportation hubs (MMTHs) coordinate and integrate different modes of transportation by improving transfers between them. In addition, MMTHs offer a high quality of stay with a wide range of services, as well as a compact, mixed-use urban development with a high density of uses around them. The transformation of railway stations and their environments into MMTHs is addressed in discussions of transit-oriented development (TOD) and the concept of “node and place.” However, there is a lack of a systemic approach that structures the problem involving the different worldviews of the actors. In addition, the necessary changes and measures are largely unknown. Based on the soft systems methodology (SSM), we conducted 20 SSM interviews and two SSM workshops (n = 10 each). Our results show that the problem can be structured into the three layers of “national long-term integrated optimization of the passenger transport sector and spatial development,” “local short-to medium-term planning and implementation,” and a “regional, bidirectional transfer by policy-making and planning.” The transfer layer between the national, long-term and local, short-term worldviews is key and must be strengthened. Furthermore, we present systemically desirable and culturally feasible measures for each layer to improve the current situation of the transformation—a national MMTH program, creating an overarching vision, a caretaker for local implementation to coordinate the interests of actors, and collaborative development of regional master plans and an explorative approach to ensure bidirectional exchanges between the national and local layers. Although the structuring of the problem and the measures were developed from a Swiss viewpoint, we expect that the results will also be useful for other decentralized states.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000589602",,"0967-070X",,"10.1016/j.tranpol.2022.12.020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/589602","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Multimodal transportation hubs (MMTHs)||Integration of transportation modes||Problem structuring||Soft systems methodology (SSM)||Sustainable transport||Switzerland","A systemic approach to the transformation of swiss railway stations: Mind the gap between the local, short-term and national, long-term worldviews","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-02T20:35:54Z",,"yes",,,,,,,"85145269187","000914081000001","Transp. policy (Oxf.)",,"Transport Policy","132","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The core focus is to evaluate the public policy in light of the groundwork that sustains the designed and proposed actions. Design/methodology/approach The authors applied a qualitative approach to build a set of dimensions and conducted content-analysis of selected documents. The analysis encompasses all current STI public policy documents in Costa Rica, including the planning instruments of the Central Government and the National Policy on STI. Findings The main findings show that STI policy in Costa Rica is based on different innovation models, but the projects and instruments themselves show the predominance of the reductionist model. Innovation receives a residual role. In turn, interdisciplinarity is based on the concept of convergence, which limits disciplinary collaboration to the natural, physical and engineering sciences, minimising contributions from other fields of knowledge to an instrumental role in innovation processes. Practical implications The authors conclude that the interlinkage between open innovation models, the participation of diverse societal actors and the inclusion of an interdisciplinary perspective leads to inclusive and more democratic public policy, allowing more sectors and organisations to benefit from innovation processes. This would imply a greater reach and impact of the policy, conditions that translate into innovation achievements and a better return on public investment.

When accounting for the risk of heatrelated mortality, factors of social vulnerability can not be ignored. Urban areas are of particular interest since they are often regarded as the hottest and most socially divers regions. Multiple studies have found relationships between heat exposure, heat-related mortality and various social factors. This thesis investigates these relationships in Switzerland. The urban areas of the country are not only the wealthiest regions, but also the most exposed to heat. The three biggest urban areas of Zurich, Basel, and Geneva show a negative relationship between the occurrence of heatwaves and a high-resolution socioeconomic index. This concludes that there is heat-related social inequality in the urban areas of Switzerland. The wealthiest cantons also show the highest value of heat-related mortality fraction over the 90 hottest days of the year, with up to 3.5% of all mortality from 1991-2020 associated directly or indirectly to heat in the cantons of Zurich and Basel-Land. In the future, isolating the climate effect, these values are increasing up to threefold under the RCP 4.5 warming scenario. The thesis contributes to the topic of climate justice in Switzerland and helps to identify areas and variables to assist policy makers in defining adaption measures to climate change in the urban areas of the country.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000609801",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/609801","en","ETH Zurich",,,,"Heat-related Inequality and Mortality in Switzerland","Master Thesis","Embargoed",,,,"2023-04-27T11:09:10Z","2024-04-26","yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Existing pools, however, might not fully exploit their financial resilience potential because they were not designed to maximize risk diversification and because they pool risk only regionally. Here we introduce a method that forms pools by maximizing risk diversification and apply it to assess the benefits of global pooling compared to regional pooling. We find that global pooling always provides a higher risk diversification, it better distributes countries’ risk shares in the pool’s risk and it increases the number of countries profiting from risk pooling. Optimal global pooling could provide a diversification increase to existing pools of up to 65 %.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000600807",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-023-36539-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/600807","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Increasing countries’ financial resilience through global catastrophe risk pooling","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-02-28T05:26:39Z",,"yes","REmote Climate Effects and their Impact on European sustainability, Policy and Trade","820712","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,"85148327542",,"Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We demonstrate this approach for one dimension of recovery—housing reconstruction—analyzing data collected five years after the 2015 Nepal earthquake to identify a range of ongoing social and environmental vulnerabilities related to non-recovery in Nepal. If such information were available in 2015, it would have exposed regional differences in recovery potential due to these vulnerabilities.

However, there is considerable diversity in transdisciplinary research projects in terms of their design, research process, and surrounding institutions, making it difficult to unravel what type of transdisciplinary research project works well to reach which effects. This article uses a systematic literature review and expert interviews to study how different input, process, and institutional factors influence the effects of transdisciplinary research projects.

However, scientific and policy discourse often overlooks the social processes that influence the equity and effectiveness of restoration interventions. In the present article, we outline how social processes that are critical to restoration equity and effectiveness can be better incorporated in restoration science and policy. Drawing from existing case studies, we show how projects that align with local people's preferences and are implemented through inclusive governance are more likely to lead to improved social, ecological, and environmental outcomes. To underscore the importance of social considerations in restoration, we overlay existing global restoration priority maps, population, and the Human Development Index (HDI) to show that approximately 1.4 billion people, disproportionately belonging to groups with low HDI, live in areas identified by previous studies as being of high restoration priority. We conclude with five action points for science and policy to promote equity-centered restoration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000592671",,"0006-3568||1525-3244",,"10.1093/biosci/biac099","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/592671","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","land use management||Social justice||climate change mitigation||restoration longevity||restoration policy","How Social Considerations Improve the Equity and Effectiveness of Ecosystem Restoration","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-16T12:36:54Z",,"yes","Identifying the conditions under which forst-focused supply chain policies lead to improved conservation and livelihoods: a pan-tropical analysis||Evaluating investment opportunities for scaling-up forest and landscape restoration","949932||ETH-36 19-1","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100003006","EC||ETHZ","H2020||ETH Grants",,,"000920231000001","Bioscience (Print)","2","Bioscience","73","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Focused on the western tropical Atlantic near Barbados, EUREC(4)A deployed a number of innovative observational strategies, including a large network of water isotopic measurements collectively known as EUREC(4)A-iso, to study the tropical shallow convective environment. The goal of the isotopic measurements was to elucidate processes that regulate the hydroclimate state - for example, by identifying moisture sources, quantifying mixing between atmospheric layers, characterizing the microphysics that influence the formation and persistence of clouds and precipitation, and providing an extra constraint in the evaluation of numerical simulations. During the field experiment, researchers deployed seven water vapor isotopic analyzers on two aircraft, on three ships, and at the Barbados Cloud Observatory (BCO). Precipitation was collected for isotopic analysis at the BCO and from aboard four ships. In addition, three ships collected seawater for isotopic analysis. All told, the in situ data span the period 5 January-22 February 2020 and cover the approximate area 6 to 16 degrees N and 50 to 60 degrees W, with water vapor isotope ratios measured from a few meters above sea level to the mid-free troposphere and seawater samples spanning the ocean surface to several kilometers depth.This paper describes the full EUREC(4)A isotopic in situ data collection - providing extensive information about sampling strategies and data uncertainties - and also guides readers to complementary remotely sensed water vapor isotope ratios. All field data have been made publicly available even if they are affected by known biases, as is the case for high-altitude aircraft measurements, one of the two BCO ground-based water vapor time series, and select rain and seawater samples from the ships. Publication of these data reflects a desire to promote dialogue around improving water isotope measurement strategies for the future. The remaining, high-quality data create unprecedented opportunities to close water isotopic budgets and evaluate water fluxes and their influence on cloudiness in the trade-wind environment. The full list of dataset DOIs and notes on data quality flags are provided in Table 3 of Sect. 5 (""Data availability"").","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000602739",,"1866-3516||1866-3508",,"10.5194/essd-15-465-2023","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/602739","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Isotopic measurements in water vapor, precipitation, and seawater during EUREC(4)A","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-03-11T14:03:46Z",,"yes","Large-scale circulation drivers and stable water isotope characteristics of low-level clouds over the tropical North Atlantic","188731","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"000923955700001","Earth syst. sci. data","1","Earth System Science Data","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It has long been argued that these distortions were a key explanation for differences in supply and productivity across countries, but the empirical evidence is limited. We revisit this issue using data on policy distortions across 63 countries for the period 1961–2011. We estimate the effects of differential changes in agricultural distortions across countries on supply and productivity. We highlight concerns in our analysis and previous work about endogeneity that biases the estimated effect downward—countries that lose comparative advantage are likely to increase support for agriculture. We address these concerns by including country and region-time fixed effects, along with a rich set of controls. Overall, we find evidence that enhanced incentives through policy changes can increase the rate of production growth, with about half of the increase due to productivity increases. This result is strongest in Sub-Saharan Africa where anti-agricultural policies on exports were reduced and in Europe where pro-agricultural policies on imports were reduced, driven largely by external pressure. Endogeneity appears to be strongest in Asia where countries have followed the typical pattern of raising support for agriculture during industrialization due to a rising farm-urban income gap.",,,,"0169-5150||1574-0862",,"10.1111/agec.12741","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/592662","en","Wiley-Blackwell",,,"agricultural policy||distorted incentives||production||productivity","The effects of agricultural policy on supply and productivity: Evidence from differential changes in distortions","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2023-01-16T12:32:34Z",,"yes",,,,,,,"85137998162","000854049000001","Agric. econ.","1","Agricultural Economics","54","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

RDM relies on the idea of scenario neutrality, namely that decision robustness is not affected by how scenarios are generated if these are uniformly distributed and span a sufficiently large range of future states of the world. Several authors have shown that scenario neutrality may not hold, but they did so by adopting either new or computationally expensive modeling. We introduce the Belief-Informed Robust Decision Making (BIRDM) framework to assess how robustness might change under an arbitrary large number of non-uniform distributions at virtually no additional costs with respect to RDM. We apply BIRDM to a flood management problem and find that alternative distributions change the robustness and ranking of measures. BIRDM allows identifying what distributions lead to these changes and under what set of distributions a measure has a specific robustness and rank.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000586209",,"1364-8152||1873-6726",,"10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.105560","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/586209","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Robust decision making||Uncertain probabilistic information||Flood risk management planning","Belief-Informed Robust Decision Making (BIRDM): Assessing changes in decision robustness due to changing distributions of deep uncertainties","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-12-11T18:09:01Z",,"yes",,,,,,,"85141949792","000895283800006","Environ.

This article aims to tackle this literature gap through qualitative case studies of two station districts in Switzerland. The findings suggest that municipalities and public transport providers use power resources to assume institutional roles outside their traditional planning domains, partly as a tactical response to initiatives that they contest. For planning practice, the article proposes that process organizers grasp actors’ power potentials early and, if mobilized, integrate them in favor of broadly supported station district development.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000586104",,"2165-0020",,"10.1080/21650020.2022.2151504","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/586104","en","Routledge","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Planning practice||Power relations||Power resources||Transit-oriented development||Transit station districts","A qualitative exploration of actors’ power resources and relations in Swiss transit station district planning","Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::300 - Social sciences||DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment||DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::380 - Commerce, communications, transport",,"2022-12-11T12:55:27Z",,"yes",,,,,,"124463402",,,,"1","Urban, Planning and Transport Research","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We provide methodological guidance for researchers on how to design interventions in RWLs that both affect change on the ground and contribute to scientific knowledge. This includes addressing issues important to local communities and generating transformation knowledge about how sustainable urban development can be actualised. We use the case of a project-based master’s course within an RWL in the city of Zurich in Switzerland to demonstrate how the use of design thinking supported the development of needs-based interventions, curbing emissions from food consumption while aiming to generate scientifically relevant output.

We show how embedding physical climate storylines into a causal network framework allows user value judgments to be incorporated into the storyline in the form of probabilistic Bayesian priors, and can support decision making through inspection of the causal network outputs. We exemplify this through a specific storyline, namely a storyline on the impacts of tropical cyclones on the European Union Solidarity Fund. We outline how the constructed causal network can incorporate value judgments, particularly the prospects on climate change and its impact on cyclone intensity increase, and on economic growth. We also explore how the causal network responds to policy options chosen by the user. The resulting output from the network leads to individualized policy recommendations, allowing the causal network to be used as a possible interface for policy exploration in stakeholder engagements.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000605024",,"2212-0963",,"10.1016/j.crm.2023.100496","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/605024","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Representing storylines with causal networks to support decision making: Framework and example","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-03-27T03:16:55Z",,"yes","REmote Climate Effects and their Impact on European sustainability, Policy and Trade","820712","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,"85150428561","000959752100001",,,"Climate Risk Management","40","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The potential environmental benefits of CCU are typically assessed using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. Although LCA is a standardized method, modelling CO2 as a carbon feedstock instead of an emission introduces an ambiguous “multifunctionality issue”. Inconsistent multifunctionality practices have been applied to deal with this methodological complexity in LCAs of CCU technologies. Using one method instead of another can lead to highly positive or negative carbon footprints for the same carbon source and CO2 capture process.  A comprehensive guideline to clarify the best practices to conduct LCAs of CCU technologies was published in 2020 (and updated in March 2022) in a collaborative process involving over 40 experts. In this guideline and linked scientific articles from experts involved in its development, a so-called “substitution method” is recommended to avoid suboptimal choices of CO2 sources, improve comparability and harmonize decision-making. This article critically reviews the methodological formulation of the recommended method and suggests corrections to possible inaccuracies in a future update of the guideline. Furthermore, various illustrative examples of common CO2 feedstocks were used to illustrate the meaning of adopting such a method in practice. Economic-based benchmarking of the environmental impacts of CO2 feedstocks calculated with such a method was also broadly illustrated.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000586329",,"0048-9697||1879-1026","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/586329||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/573487","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158694","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/608549","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CCU||LCA||Allocation||Substitution||Carbon capture","Reflecting on the environmental impact of the captured carbon feedstock","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-09-30T03:25:17Z",,"yes",,,,,,,"85138139643","000862758300012","Sci.

This analysis shows that female party members' preferences regarding the purpose of a committee, networking and the election rule in party organisations differ from male party members' which is likely a reason why women face challenges to rise in parties. This article investigates for the first time these gender based differences in preferences simultaneously by conducting a survey experiment with youth party members. Respondents (n > 1200) were asked if they would run for a seat in a decision-making committee of their youth party. In order to analyse which youth party members opt for which opportunities, the purpose of these committees, the networking opportunities they provide, and the election rule for these committees vary at random. The results show that female members hesitate to join committees that would grant them power, and that they are less likely to opt for upward networking opportunities than their male party colleagues. This effect is particularly strong in hierarchically organised youth parties of centre-right parties. Findings on preferred election rules mostly hold for women from left-wing parties. In contrast to men, this group prefers party quotas. Analysing differences by gender and political orientation, this article shows a clear gender preference gap exists both within and across youth parties.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000566176",,"0140-2382||1743-9655",,"10.1080/01402382.2022.2097442","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566176","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Youth parties||gender||quota||networking||career","Power-seeking, networking and competition: why women do not rise in parties","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-08-25T02:53:17Z",,"yes",,,,,,,,"000841146300001","West Eur.

What I see, I remember. What I do, I understand.” (Xunzi, ∼300 BCE). Modelling complex interactions involving climatic features, socio-economic vulnerability or responses, and long impact transmissions is associated with substantial uncertainty. Physical climate storylines are proposed as an approach to explore complex impact transmission pathways and possible alternative unfoldings of event cascades under future climate conditions. These storylines are particularly useful for climate risk assessment for complex domains, including event cascades crossing multiple disciplinary or geographical borders. For an effective role in climate risks assessments, development guidelines are needed to consistently develop and interpret the storyline event analyses. This paper elaborates on the suitability of physical climate storyline approaches involving climate event induced shocks propagating into societal impacts. It proposes a set of common elements to construct the event storylines. In addition, criteria for their application for climate risk assessment are given, referring to the need for storylines to be physically plausible, relevant for the specific context, and risk-informative. Apart from an illustrative gallery of storyline examples found in literature, three examples of varying scope and complexity are presented in detail, all involving the potential impact on European socio-economic sectors induced by remote climate change features occurring far outside the geographical domain of the European mainland. The storyline examples illustrate the application of the proposed storyline components and evaluate the suitability of the criteria defined in this paper. It thereby contributes to a rigorous design and application of event-based climate storyline approaches.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000609692",,"2212-0963",,"10.1016/j.crm.2023.100500","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/609692","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Physical climate storylines||Climate risk assessment||Risk transmission||Multi-disciplinary research||Societal climate impacts","Climate impact storylines for assessing socio-economic responses to remote events","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-04-27T04:31:40Z",,"yes","REmote Climate Effects and their Impact on European sustainability, Policy and Trade","820712","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,"85152927099",,,,"Climate Risk Management","40","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
