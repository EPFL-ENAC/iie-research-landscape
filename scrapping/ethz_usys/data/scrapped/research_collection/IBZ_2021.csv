Central to BG function are striatal cells expressing D1 (D1R) and D2 (D2R) dopamine receptors. D1R and D2R cells are considered functional antagonists that facilitate voluntary movements and inhibit competing motor patterns, respectively. However, whether they maintain a uniform function across the striatum and what influence they exert outside the BG is unclear. Here, we address these questions by combining optogenetic activation of D1R and D2R cells in the mouse ventrolateral caudoputamen with fMRI. Striatal D1R/D2R stimulation evokes distinct activity within the BG-thalamocortical network and differentially engages cerebellar and prefrontal regions. Computational modeling of effective connectivity confirms that changes in D1R/D2R output drive functional relationships between these regions. Our results suggest a complex functional organization of striatal D1R/D2R cells and hint toward an interconnected fronto-BG-cerebellar network modulated by striatal D1R and D2R cells.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522596","2666-3864||2211-1247",,"10.1016/j.celrep.2021.110161","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522596","en","Cell Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","D1R/D2R||opto-fMRI||optogenetics||fMRI||brain networks||basal ganglia||movement disorders||direct/indirect pathway||caudate putamen","Optogenetic activation of striatal D1R and D2R cells differentially engages downstream connected areas beyond the basal ganglia",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-03T03:50:05Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Pharmacogenetic fMRI in brain circuits underlying social motivation and repetitive behavior||Dissecting stress-induced molecular changes in circuits underlying anxiety","173984||172889","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Ambizione||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85121738690",,"000738770100002","Cell Rep","13","Cell Reports","37","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Through a combination of gene expression analyses in prospectively isolated non-hematopoietic BM cell populations and various mouse models, we found that BM CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells are a major source of systemic and local BM interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels during emergency hematopoiesis after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.

We find that the temperature sensitivity of total and heterotrophic soil respiration increased with latitude. In addition, for total and autotrophic respiration, the temperature sensitivity responded more strongly to nitrogen enrichment with increasing latitude. Temperature and precipitation during the Last Glacial Maximum were better predictors of how the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration responds to nitrogen enrichment than contemporary climate variables. The tentative legacy effects of paleoclimate variables regulate the response through shaping soil organic carbon and nitrogen content.

In this study, we translocated Mollisols with a gradient of organic matter (OM) contents (2%–9%) from in situ cold region to five warmer climatic regions to simulate climate change. Soil C in C-rich soils (OM >5%) was more vulnerable to translocation warming than that in C-poor soils (OM ≤ 5%), with a major loss of functional groups like O-alkyl, O-aryl C and carboxyl C. Variations of microbial β diversity with latitude, temperature and precipitation indicated that C-rich soils contained more resistant bacterial communities and more sensitive fungal communities than C-poor soils, which led to strong C metabolism and high utilization ability of the community in C-rich soils in response to translocation warming. Our results suggest that the higher sensitivity of soils with high organic matter content to climate change is related to the stability and metabolic capacity of major bacterial decomposers, which is important for predicting soil-climate feedback.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000520652","2399-3642",,"10.1038/s42003-021-02907-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/520652","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"High stability and metabolic capacity of bacterial community promote the rapid reduction of easily decomposing carbon in soil",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-15T03:37:09Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85120977742",,"000728192200001","Commun Biol","1","Communications Biology","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Through conjugation, plasmids can be rapidly disseminated. Previous work identified gut luminal donor/recipient blooms and tissue-lodged plasmid-bearing persister cells of the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.Tm) that survive antibiotic therapy in host tissues, as factors promoting plasmid dissemination among Enterobacteriaceae. However, the buildup of tissue reservoirs and their contribution to plasmid spread await experimental demonstration. Here, we asked if re-seeding-plasmid acquisition-invasion cycles by S.Tm could serve to diversify tissue-lodged plasmid reservoirs, and thereby promote plasmid spread. Starting with intraperitoneal mouse infections, we demonstrate that S.Tm cells re-seeding the gut lumen initiate clonal expansion. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) plasmid-encoded gut luminal antibiotic degradation by donors can foster recipient survival under beta-lactam antibiotic treatment, enhancing transconjugant formation upon re-seeding. S.Tm transconjugants can subsequently re-enter host tissues introducing the new plasmid into the tissue-lodged reservoir. Population dynamics analyses pinpoint recipient migration into the gut lumen as rate-limiting for plasmid transfer dynamics in our model. Priority effects may be a limiting factor for reservoir formation in host tissues. Overall, our proof-of-principle data indicates that luminal antibiotic degradation and shuttling between the gut lumen and tissue-resident reservoirs can promote the accumulation and spread of plasmids within a host over time.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522041","2050-084X",,"10.7554/eLife.69744","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522041","en","eLife Sciences Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Pathogen invasion-dependent tissue reservoirs and plasmid-encoded antibiotic degradation boost plasmid spread in the gut",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-23T03:42:35Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Towards quantification of the contribution of plasmids to the spread of antibiotic resistance||Deciphering the initial steps that lead to Salmonella Typhimurium diarrhea||Mechanisms controlling the Salmonella Typhimurium gut infection","167121||173338||192567","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Exzellenzbeitrag in Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||NFP 70: Gesuch",,,,"85122340002",,"000730807900001",,,"eLife","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the shallow Lucerne Bay, historical chronicles reported an oscillation of the water with an initial amplitude of ∼1–2 m and a period of 10 min, which continued for several days after the event with decreasing amplitude. Here, we investigate the lake-tsunami process chain from subaqueous mass movement-generated tsunami to wave propagation and ultimately to sediment resuspension, transport, and deposition in the shallow-water environment. The effects of the historical tsunami on Lucerne Bay are reconstructed using sediment-core analysis and numerical simulation of wave propagation. A 60-cm-thick event deposit was recovered along a sediment-core transect in the shallow waters and radiocarbon dated to 1306–1442 cal CE. The event deposit has a sharp basal contact with carbonate shell fragments followed upwards a normally graded succession of siliciclastic sand to silt with a high proportion of horizontally bedded wooden particles. The numerically simulated tsunami waves are characterized by a water-surface displacement of up to 1.5 m and generate bed shear-stresses that are likely capable of remobilizing large amounts of sediments in the Lucerne Bay area. Our study successfully links the sedimentology of event deposits with physical principles of sediment mobilization derived from numerical wave-forward modeling, providing a tool to improve the identification and interpretation of potential tsunami deposits.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522600","1525-2027",,"10.1029/2021GC009753","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522600","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","tsunami deposits||lake tsunami||numerical wave propagation||bed shear-stress||radiocarbon dating||sedimentology","Shallow-Water Tsunami Deposits: Evidence From Sediment Cores and Numerical Wave Propagation of the 1601 CE Lake Lucerne Event",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-03T03:50:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Lake Tsunamis: Causes, Controls, and Hazard","171017","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Interdisziplinäres Projekt",,,,"85121757425",,"000735891600001","Geochem.

Here, we evaluated its application by comparison with other SST records obtained by commonly used proxies, that is, the Mg/Ca ratio of the planktonic foraminifera species Globigerinoides ruber and the alkenone paleothermometer UK´37. We focused on the last glacial–interglacial transition of four different sedimentary archives from the western and northern Arabian Sea, which are currently under the influence of monsoon-induced upwelling and the associated development of an oxygen minimum zone. The (Formula presented.) and Mg/CaG.ruber SST records revealed an increase of 0.6–3.4°C from the Last Glacial Maximum to the late Holocene with somewhat higher amplitude in the northern part of the Arabian Sea than compared to the western part. In contrast, the LDI SSTs did not reveal major changes during the last glacial–interglacial transition which was followed by a decreasing trend during the Holocene. The LGM versus the Holocene LDI SSTs ranged between −0.2 and −2.7°C. Particularly at one record, offshore Oman, the SST decrease during the Holocene was high in amplitude, suggesting a potential cold bias, possibly related to changes in upwelling intensity. This indicates that care has to be taken when applying the LDI for annual mean SST reconstruction in upwelling regions.",,,"2572-4525||2572-4517",,"10.1029/2021PA004255","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522601","en","American Geophysical Union",,,,"Applicability of the Long Chain Diol Index (LDI) as a Sea Surface Temperature Proxy in the Arabian Sea",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-01-03T03:50:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85121743307",,"000735924600004",,"12","Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology","36","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Nomenclatural problems have beset these taxa: the name Dalbergia mollis was established by Bosser and Rabevohitra as a replacement for the later homonym Dalbergia stenocarpa R.

We re-establish Dalbergia chermezonii, provide the new name, Dalbergia bemarivensis Phillipson & N. Wilding, as a replacement for Dalbergia stenocarpa R.

Based on initial data from the UK and later data from other countries, this variant was estimated to have a transmission fitness advantage of around 40–80 % (Volz et al., 2021; Leung et al., 2021; Davies et al., 2021). Aim: This study aims to estimate the transmission fitness advantage and the effective reproductive number of B.1.1.7 through time based on data from Switzerland. Methods: We generated whole genome sequences from 11.8 % of all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Switzerland between 14 December 2020 and 11 March 2021. Based on these data, we determine the daily frequency of the B.1.1.7 variant and quantify the variant's transmission fitness advantage on a national and a regional scale. Results: We estimate B.1.1.7 had a transmission fitness advantage of 43–52 % compared to the other variants circulating in Switzerland during the study period. Further, we estimate B.1.1.7 had a reproductive number above 1 from 01 January 2021 until the end of the study period, compared to below 1 for the other variants. Specifically, we estimate the reproductive number for B.1.1.7 was 1.24 [1.07–1.41] from 01 January until 17 January 2021 and 1.18 [1.06–1.30] from 18 January until 01 March 2021 based on the whole genome sequencing data. From 10 March to 16 March 2021, once B.1.1.7 was dominant, we estimate the reproductive number was 1.14 [1.00–1.26] based on all confirmed cases. For reference, Switzerland applied more non-pharmaceutical interventions to combat SARS-CoV-2 on 18 January 2021 and lifted some measures again on 01 March 2021. Conclusion: The observed increase in B.1.1.7 frequency in Switzerland during the study period is as expected based on observations in the UK. In absolute numbers, B.1.1.7 increased exponentially with an estimated doubling time of around 2–3.5 weeks. To monitor the ongoing spread of B.1.1.7, our plots are available online.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505046","1878-0067||1755-4365",,"10.1016/j.epidem.2021.100480","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505046","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Pandemic||SARS-CoV-2||COVID-19||B.1.1.7||Transmission advantage","Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-10T03:31:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Real-time monitoring of COVID-19 transmission through phylodynamics||Large-scale testing and tracking of SARS-CoV-2 infection and evolution by deep sequencing","196267||196348","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Special Call on Coronaviruses||Special Call on Coronaviruses",,,,"85114190269",,"000703684000009",,,"Epidemics","37","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While the fluid residence times in numerous basaltic and gabbroic systems have been determined, those of the less studied ultramafic systems are currently unknown. Fluids that interact with mantle rocks have fundamentally different chemistries and therefore have unique influences on seawater chemistry. In this first investigation of radium isotopes in a serpentinite-hosted system, vent fluids were discovered to contain 10–100 times greater activities of 223Ra (half-life = 11.4 days) than observed in high-temperature basalt-hosted systems. The 223Ra activities of 10–109 dpm L−1 produce 223Ra/226Ra activity ratios ranging from 9 to 109. These extremely high 223Ra activities, which are accompanied by low activities of 226Ra, place significant constraints on fluid residence times and the adsorption coefficient of radium between fluid and rock. Our data constrain the nondimensional retardation factor (R) to very low values between 1 and 4, reflecting the extent to which Ra is transported more slowly than fluids due to adsorption and other processes. These results suggest that the residence time of fluids in contact with serpentinite is less than 2 y and perhaps as low as 0.5 y. They are surprisingly similar to those of basalt-hosted systems. Thus, fluids in hydrothermal systems share similar hydrogeological characteristics despite differences in rock types, underlying porosity, and heat sources, enabling larger-scale models of hydrothermal biogeochemistry to be developed across systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522605","0148-0227||2169-9275",,"10.1029/2021JC017886","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522605","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Lost City Hydrothermal system||radium isotopes||fluid residence time||adsorption coefficient","Activities of 223Ra and 226Ra in Fluids From the Lost City Hydrothermal Field Require Short Fluid Residence Times",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-03T03:50:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Hydration and carbonation of mantle peridotite: Drilling the Atlantis Massif (MAR 30°N) and the Samail ophiolite (Oman)","163187","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85121687528",,"000735870300031","J. geophys. res.

Recent studies suggest that seismic signals can reveal debris-flow properties. However, the accuracy and applicability of theoretical models linking bulk flow properties to the seismic signature of a debris flow remain elusive. By extending a previously proposed model of random single-particle impact forces to multi-particle force chains acting on the channel bed, we describe the generation of high frequency seismic signals, and thereby estimate the bulk flow dynamics of six debris-flow events at Illgraben, Switzerland. The theoretically predicted basal force fluctuations agree with in-situ measurements at a basal force plate and seismic signals recorded adjacent to the channel. According to our model, both random single-particle impacts and random impacts caused by multi-particle force chains control basal force fluctuations. The relative contributions of single particles and of multi-particle force chains may vary significantly for different events and different positions within events. The relative contribution of multi-particle force chains is expected to be larger in the flow front, where particle concentrations are higher.

While the advancement of green up and flowering are well-documented, it remains unclear whether all phenophases, particularly those later in the season, will shift in unison or respond divergently to warming. Here, we present the largest synthesis to our knowledge of experimental warming effects on tundra plant phenology from the International Tundra Experiment. We examine the effect of warming on a suite of season-wide plant phenophases. Results challenge the expectation that all phenophases will advance in unison to warming. Instead, we find that experimental warming caused: (1) larger phenological shifts in reproductive versus vegetative phenophases and (2) advanced reproductive phenophases and green up but delayed leaf senescence which translated to a lengthening of the growing season by approximately 3%. Patterns were consistent across sites, plant species and over time. The advancement of reproductive seasons and lengthening of growing seasons may have significant consequences for trophic interactions and ecosystem function across the tundra.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000490447","2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-021-23841-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/490447","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Experimental warming differentially affects vegetative and reproductive phenology of tundra plants",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-19T03:05:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85107816540",,"000663755500001","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

All else being equal, climate change is expected to increase the activity of insect herbivores as their metabolic rates rise with temperature. However, montane species may have more complex responses than those in agricultural or lowland ecosystems, since many factors that shape plant-insect interactions, including temperature, shift with elevation. From 2016 to 2018 we conducted field observations of grasshopper herbivory on subalpine lupines in Mt. Rainier National Park and combined these with multiple leaf trait analyses and a set of manipulative feeding trials to explore how insect herbivory varies along a climatic gradient, and whether differences in plant or insect herbivore phenotypes that are influenced by a population's climatic history can explain these patterns. We found a significant increase in herbivory with elevation that was related to both abiotic drivers, particularly snowmelt timing, and population traits, particularly leaf nutrition and grasshopper feeding rates. Our results suggest that some high-elevation plants may already be experiencing ecologically meaningful levels of insect herbivory that could intensify with climate warming. They also highlight the complexity of predicting how species interactions will change with warming in alpine and subalpine ecosystems, where environmental plasticity or local adaptation driven by elevational differences in climate may lend tremendous complexity to ecological dynamics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529231","2666-9005",,"10.1016/j.ecochg.2021.100030","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529231","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Species interactions||Elevational gradients||Insect herbivory||Montane meadows||Species traits","When ‘Higher’ means ‘Hungrier’: Climate and population trait differences drive increased insect herbivory with elevation in a perennial subalpine wildflower",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-27T13:30:00Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85134772325",,,,,"Climate Change Ecology","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Dispersal-limitation potentially compounds impacts of these factors on plant diversity, especially in isolated vegetation patches. Changes in climate can impact the phenology of native species in distinct ways from non-natives, potentially resulting in cascading impacts on native communities. Few empirical studies have examined the combined effects of climate change and dispersal limitation on community diversity or phenology. Using a five-year dispersal-restriction experiment in an invaded semi-arid annual plant system in Western Australia, we investigated the interactive effects of dispersal-restriction and inter-annual rainfall variation on community composition, species dominance and seed production timing. We found inter-annual rainfall variation to be the principal driver of community dynamics. Drought years had long-term, stable effects on community composition, with evidence of shifts from native toward non-native dominance. Surprisingly, community composition remained largely unchanged under dispersal restriction. A subtle dispersal rescue effect was evident for a dominant native annual forb and a dominant annual non-native grass but only in average rainfall years. The timing of seed production was primarily driven by annual rainfall with native and non-native grasses having opposite responses. There was no evidence that inter-annual variation in seeding timing affected community diversity over time. Our study demonstrates that dispersal is not a major factor in driving community diversity in this invaded, semi-arid system. Results do suggest, however, that increases in drought frequency likely benefit non-native species over natives in the long term.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529230","2666-9005",,"10.1016/j.ecochg.2021.100024","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529230","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Climate change||Dispersal rescue||Annual plants||Non-native species||Diversity||Phenology","Annual rainfall variation and dispersal limitation combine to alter invaded plant community diversity, dominance hierarchies and seeding phenology",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-27T13:26:38Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85134475385",,,,,"Climate Change Ecology","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For example, if fewer recreational visits are aligned with seasonal events of interest, visitor satisfaction could be affected. To explore this possibility at Mount Rainier National Park, we combined data from a community science program (MeadoWatch  MW) with hiking trip reports posted to a hiking organization (Washington Trails Association  WTA). We first explored how peak flowering, WTA trip reports, and visitation varied across years that differed in snow disappearance, a climatic factor that correlates with flowering phenology. We found that wildflower blooms tracked snow disappearance more closely than did trip reports and park visitation, implying a decreasing proportion of future visitors will experience peak wildflower blooms. We next extracted sentiment related to specific trail-experiences (e.g., wildflowers, views) and overall hike satisfaction from WTA trip reports. While wildflowers were a positive component in overall hiker satisfaction, other non-seasonal trail experiences also had positive effects. In all, a shifting wildflower season that is less accessible to visitors could alter perceptions of natural areas like Mount Rainier National Park. Countering negative social-ecological impacts could be achieved by highlighting non-seasonal aspects of the visitor experience, or alternatively, communicating the altered timing of the peak wildflower season while also increasing accessibility during this time. Such actions likely require partnerships between managers of natural areas, interpretive staff, and scientists that study seasonal phenomena of recreational interest.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000525781","2666-9005",,"10.1016/j.ecochg.2021.100008","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/525781","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Climate change||Phenology||Recreation||Social-ecological mismatch||Wildflowers","Climate change impacts on natural icons: Do phenological shifts threaten the relationship between peak wildflowers and visitor satisfaction?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-14T15:27:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85127671985",,,,,"Climate Change Ecology","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we isolated and characterized resistant mutants of Escherichia coli using five antibiotics, before measuring collateral effects on resistance to other paired antibiotics. During both isolation and phenotyping, we varied conditions in ways relevant in nature (pH, temperature, and bile). This revealed that local abiotic conditions modified expression of resistance against both the antibiotic used during isolation and other antibiotics. Consequently, local conditions influenced collateral sensitivity in two ways: By favoring different sets of mutants (with different collateral sensitivities) and by modifying expression of collateral effects for individual mutants. These results place collateral sensitivity in the context of environmental variation, with important implications for translation to real-world applications.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526704","2379-5077",,"10.1128/mSystems.01055-21","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526704","en","American Society for Microbiology","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Antibiotic resistance||Collateral sensitivity","Collateral Sensitivity Interactions between Antibiotics Depend on Local Abiotic Conditions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-19T04:27:10Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"The role of bacteria-virus interactions in antimicrobial resistance","165803||165803","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85122626375",,"000790197100009",,"6","mSystems","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We show that these two sidebands can be established through resonance with the 3d and 2p states of hydrogen atoms at 202 nm, respectively. Using this scheme, we can extract the angularly dependent time delay of electrons liberated from the 3d state with respect to those released from the 2p state by comparing the phase differences between two sidebands. Using the attosecond beating scheme of asymmetrical photon transition, we obtain the intrinsic time delay between the 3d and 2p excited electronic states in the few-photon ionization regime of H atoms, which is ∼103 as.

The first method allows for model calibration on long-term earthquake catalogs with temporal variation of the completeness magnitude, mc. This calibration technique is beneficial for long-term probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA), which is often based on a mixture of instrumental and historical catalogs. The second method generalizes the concept of mc, considering rate- and magnitude-dependent detection probability, and allows for self-consistent estimation of ETAS parameters and high-frequency detection incompleteness. With this approach, we aim to address the potential biases in parameter calibration due to short-term aftershock incompleteness, embracing incompleteness instead of avoiding it. Using synthetic tests, we show that both methods can accurately invert the parameters of simulated catalogs. We then use them to estimate ETAS parameters for California using the earthquake catalog since 1932. To explore how model calibration, inclusion of small events, and accounting for short-term incompleteness affect earthquakes' predictability, we systematically compare variants of ETAS models based on the second approach in pseudo-prospective forecasting experiments for California. Our proposed model significantly outperforms the ETAS null model, with decreasing information gain for increasing target magnitude threshold. We find that the ability to include small earthquakes for simulation of future scenarios is the primary driver of the improvement and that accounting for incompleteness is necessary. Our results have significant implications for our understanding of earthquake interaction mechanisms and the future of seismicity forecasting.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522602","2169-9313||0148-0227||2169-9356",,"10.1029/2021JB022379","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522602","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","data incompleteness||model inversion||ETAS||earthquake forecasting","Embracing Data Incompleteness for Better Earthquake Forecasting",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-03T03:50:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Real-time Earthquake Risk Reduction for Europe","821115","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85121742231",,"000751383000075","J. geophys. res.

The oldest carbonates (∼31 to >50 kyr) are localized calcite, dolomite, and aragonite veins, formed between 26°C and 43°C and related to focused fluid flow. Subsequent pervasive small amounts of dispersed carbonate precipitated in the last 1,000 years. Macroscopic brecciation and veining of the peridotite indicate that carbonation is influenced by tectonic features allowing infiltration of fluids over extended periods and at different structural levels such as along fracture planes and micro-fractures and grain boundaries, causing large-scale hydration of the ophiolite. The formation of dispersed carbonate is related to percolating fluids with δ18O lower than modern ground and meteoric water. Our study shows that radiocarbon investigations are an essential tool to interpret the carbonation history and that stable oxygen and carbon isotopes alone can result in ambiguous interpretations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522604","2169-9313||0148-0227||2169-9356",,"10.1029/2021JB022712","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522604","en","American Geophysical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Carbon Geochemistry of the Active Serpentinization Site at the Wadi Tayin Massif: Insights From the ICDP Oman Drilling Project: Phase II",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-03T03:50:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Hydration and carbonation of mantle peridotite: Drilling the Atlantis Massif (MAR 30°N) and the Samail ophiolite (Oman)","163187","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85121720934",,"000751383000058","J. geophys. res.

Using data from 133 rain forest plots at nine sites for which site differences are known, we aimed to filter out these patterns in forest structural attributes to unveil a hidden pattern. Using a null model framework, we generated the anticipated pattern inherited from individual allometric patterns. We then evaluated deviations between the data (observations) and predictions of the null model. Ordination of the deviations revealed site differences that were not evident in the ordination of observations. These sites differences could be related to different histories of large-scale forest disturbance.

In some aggregative systems, development culminates in the construction of spore-packed fruiting bodies and often unfolds within genetically and behaviourally diverse conspecific cellular environments. Here, we use the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus to test whether the character of the cellular environment during aggregative development shapes its morphological evolution. We manipulated the cellular composition of Myxococcus development in an experiment in which evolving populations initiated from a single ancestor repeatedly co-developed with one of several non-evolving partners-a cooperator, three cheaters and three antagonists. Fruiting body morphology was found to diversify not only as a function of partner genotype but more broadly as a function of partner social character, with antagonistic partners selecting for greater fruiting body formation than cheaters or the cooperator. Yet even small degrees of genetic divergence between distinct cheater partners sufficed to drive treatment-level morphological divergence. Co-developmental partners also determined the magnitude and dynamics of stochastic morphological diversification and subsequent convergence. In summary, we find that even just a few genetic differences affecting developmental and social features can greatly impact morphological evolution of multicellular bodies and experimentally demonstrate that microbial warfare can promote cooperation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519128","0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2021.1522","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519128","en","The Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","evo-devo||social evolution||aggregative multicellularity||morphological evolution||microbial development","Social selection within aggregative multicellular development drives morphological evolution",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-07T09:26:44Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85122169776",,"000721714900001","Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1963","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","288","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, manual annotation of millions of images proposes a serious challenge to taxonomists. Deep learning classifiers have been successfully applied in various fields and provided encouraging results when used to categorize marine plankton images. Here, we present a set of deep learning models developed for the identification of lake plankton, and study several strategies to obtain optimal performances, which lead to operational prescriptions for users. To this aim, we annotated into 35 classes over 17900 images of zooplankton and large phytoplankton colonies, detected in Lake Greifensee (Switzerland) with the Dual Scripps Plankton Camera. Our best models were based on transfer learning and ensembling, which classified plankton images with 98% accuracy and 93% F1 score. When tested on freely available plankton datasets produced by other automated imaging tools (ZooScan, Imaging FlowCytobot, and ISIIS), our models performed better than previously used models. Our annotated data, code and classification models are freely available online.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526075","1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2021.746297","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526075","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","plankton camera||deep learning||lake plankton||Plankton classification||zooplankton images||transfer learning||Greifensee||ensemble learning||machine learning||fresh water||lake plankton images","Deep Learning Classification of Lake Zooplankton",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-17T08:02:26Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite increasing efforts addressing issues of representation and colonialism in natural history collections, herbaria have received comparatively less attention. While it has been noted that the majority of plant specimens are housed in the global North, the extent of this disparity has not been rigorously quantified to date. Here, by analyzing over 85 million specimen records and surveying herbaria across the globe, we assess the colonial legacy of botanical collections and how we may move towards a more inclusive future. We demonstrate that colonial exploitation has contributed to an inverse relationship between where plant biodiversity exists in nature and where it is housed in herbaria. Such disparities persist in herbaria across physical and digital realms despite overt colonialism having ended over half a century ago, suggesting ongoing digitization and decolonization efforts have yet to alleviate colonial-era discrepancies. We emphasize the need for acknowledging the inconvenient history of herbarium collections and the implementation of a more equitable, global paradigm for their collection, curation, and use.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000581473",,,"10.1101/2021.10.27.466174","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/581473","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"The colonial legacy of herbaria",,"Working Paper","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences",,"2022-11-17T15:49:54Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recently, it was proposed that selection for resource conservation, specifically for nitrogen and carbon content, has also shaped the structure of the standard genetic code, such that the missense mutations the code allows tend to cause small increases in the number of nitrogen and carbon atoms in amino acids. Moreover, it was proposed that this optimization is not confounded by known optimizations of the standard genetic code, such as for polar requirement or hydropathy. We challenge these claims. We show the proposed optimization for nitrogen conservation is highly sensitive to choice of null model and the proposed optimization for carbon conservation is confounded by the known conservative nature of the standard genetic code with respect to the molecular volume of amino acids. There is therefore little evidence the standard genetic code is optimized for resource conservation. We discuss our findings in the context of null models of the standard genetic code.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516169","0737-4038||1537-1719",,"10.1093/molbev/msab236","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516169","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Translation||Standard genetic code||Evolutionary design principles","Little Evidence the Standard Genetic Code Is Optimized for Resource Conservation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-19T13:55:01Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Regulatory logic and the evolution of promoter complexity","170604","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,"85119612192",,"000715560700035","Mol Biol Evol","11","Molecular Biology and Evolution","38","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

On the one hand, the ecological limits hypothesis posits that diversity is primarily limited by environmental resources. On the other hand, the diversity-begets-diversity hypothesis posits that such limits can be easily lifted when new ecological niches are created by biotic interactions. To find out which hypothesis better explains the assembly of microbial communities, we used metabolic modelling. We represent each microbial species by a metabolic network that harbours thousands of biochemical reactions. Together, these reactions determine which carbon and energy sources a species can use, and which metabolic by-products—potential nutrients for other species—it can excrete in a given environment. We assemble communities by modelling thousands of species invasions in a chemostat-like environment. We find that early during the assembly process, diversity begets diversity. By-product excretion transforms a simple environment into one that can sustain dozens of species. During later assembly stages, the creation of new niches slows down, existing niches become filled, successful invasions become rare, and species diversity plateaus.

But what kind of selection regimes are important? A look at the parameters that determine fitness of the two parties suggests that social hosts differ from solitary ones primarily in the structure of transmission pathways. Because transmission is, both, the physical encounter of a new host and infecting it, several different elements determine parasite transmission success. These include spatial distance, genetic distance, or the temporal and ecological niche overlaps. Combing these elements into a ‘generalized transmission distance’ that determines parasite fitness aids in the identification of the critical steps. For example, short-distance transmission to genetically similar hosts within the social group is the most frequent process under sociality. Therefore, spatio-genetical distances are the main driver of parasite fitness. Vice versa, the generalized distance identifies the critical host defences. In this case, host defences should be primarily selected to defend against the within-group spread of an infection, especially among closely related group members.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000512849","0340-5443||1432-0762",,"10.1007/s00265-021-03092-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/512849","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sociality||Transmission||Genetics||Generalized distance||Parasite ftness||Social immunity","Sociality and parasite transmission",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-30T02:49:11Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85117683874",,"000710205500001","Behav.

The rate at which snags fall therefore influences forest carbon dynamics and biodiversity. Fall rates correlate strongly with mean annual temperature, presumably because warmer climates facilitate faster wood decomposition and hence degradation of the structural stability of standing wood. These faster decomposition rates coincide with turnover from fungal-dominated wood decomposer communities in cooler forests to codomination by fungi and termites in warmer regions. A key question for projecting forest dynamics is therefore whether temperature effects on wood decomposition arise primarily because warmer conditions facilitate faster decomposer metabolism, or are also influenced indirectly by belowground community turnover (e.g., termites exert additional influence beyond fungal-plus-bacterial mediated decomposition). To test between these possibilities, we simulate standing dead trees with untreated wooden posts and follow them in the field across 5 yr at 12 sites, before measuring buried, soil–air interface and aerial post sections to quantify wood decomposition and organism activities. High termite activities at the warmer sites are associated with rates of postfall that are three times higher than at the cooler sites. Termites primarily consume buried wood, with decomposition rates greatest where termite activities are highest. However, where higher microbial and termite activities co-occur, they appear to compensate for one another first, and then to slow decomposition rates at their highest activities, suggestive of interference competition. If the range of microbial and termite codomination of wood decomposer communities expands under climate warming, our data suggest that expansion will accelerate snag fall with consequent effects on forest carbon cycling and biodiversity in forests previously dominated by microbial decomposers. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America.",,,"0012-9658||1939-9170",,"10.1002/ecy.3484","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/511972","en","Wiley",,,"basidiomycetes||coarse woody debris||downed dead wood||Reticulitermes flavipes||saproxylic insects||soil food webs||soil invertebrates||subterranean termites||wood-rot fungi","Belowground community turnover accelerates the decomposition of standing dead wood",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-10-27T03:03:39Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85117165255",,"000708273200001","Ecol.","11","Ecology","102","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To accurately identify adaptive loci, it is thus critical to account for demographic history. Theory suggests that signatures of selection can be inferred using the coalescent, following the premise that genealogies of selected loci deviate from neutral expectations. Here, we build on this theory to develop an analytical framework to identify loci under selection via explicit demographic models (LSD). Under this framework, signatures of selection are inferred through deviations in demographic parameters, rather than through summary statistics directly, and demographic history is accounted for explicitly. Leveraging the property of demographic models to incorporate directionality, we show that LSD can provide information on the environment in which selection acts on a population. This can prove useful in elucidating the selective processes underlying local adaptation, by characterizing genetic trade-offs and extending the concepts of antagonistic pleiotropy and conditional neutrality from ecological theory to practical application in genomic data. We implement LSD via approximate Bayesian computation and demonstrate, via simulations, that LSD (a) has high power to identify selected loci across a large range of demographic-selection regimes, (b) outperforms commonly applied genome-scan methods under complex demographies and (c) accurately infers the directionality of selection for identified candidates. Using the same simulations, we further characterize the behaviour of isolation-with-migration models conducive to the study of local adaptation under regimes of selection. Finally, we demonstrate an application of LSD by detecting loci and characterizing genetic trade-offs underlying flower colour in Antirrhinum majus.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494861","1755-098X||1471-8278||1755-0998||1471-8286",,"10.1111/1755-0998.13415","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494861","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","approximate Bayesian computation||demography||genetic trade-offs||genome scan||local adaptation||selection","Identifying loci under selection via explicit demographic models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T10:27:34Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Genomics of adaptation in the context of a rapid plant radiation||Ecological Genomics of Plant Adaptation","160123||182675","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85107221448",,"000657214900001","Mol.

Yet societal decisions on preventive actions depend on the expected impacts of the weather event. In order to better inform such preventive actions, meteorological services are currently working towards including expected impacts into their warnings. We develop an open-source impact forecasting system for building damage due to winter windstorms in Switzerland. It combines a numerical ensemble weather prediction model with exposure and vulnerability data. This system forecasts expected building damage in Swiss Francs with a 2-day lead time on a 500-m grid or aggregated to administrative regions. We compare the forecasted building damage with insurance claims in the canton of Zurich. The uncertainty of the impact forecasts is large. For the majority of days with severe winter windstorm damage, the mean forecasted damage was in the right order of magnitude, with one missed event and one false alarm. For thunderstorms and foehn storms, the rate of missed events and false alarms is much higher, most likely related to the limited meteorological forecast skill. Such impact forecasts can inform decision makers on preventive actions, such as allocating emergency response and other assets. Additionally, impact forecasts could also help communicating the severity of the upcoming event to the general public as well as indirectly help meteorological forecasters with taking warning decisions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522593","1350-4827||1469-8080",,"10.1002/met.2035","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522593","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Building damage||impact forecast||Impact modelling||impact-based warning||numerical weather prediction","Towards operational impact forecasting of building damage from winter windstorms in Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-03T03:49:38Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85121877338",,"000735210400010","Meteorol. appl.","6","Meteorological Applications","28","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The Epichloe-grass symbiosis is of great interest to agricultural research for the fungal bioprotective properties conferred to host grasses but also serves as an ideal system to study the evolution of fungal plant-pathogens in natural environments. Here, we assembled and annotated gapless chromosome-level genomes of two pathogenic Epichloe sibling species. Both genomes have a bipartite genome organization, with blocks of highly syntenic gene-rich regions separated by blocks of AT-rich DNA. The AT-rich regions show an extensive signature of RIP (repeat-induced point mutation) and the expansion of this compartment accounts for the large difference in genome size between the two species. This study reveals how the rapid evolution of repeat structure can drive divergence between closely related taxa and highlights the evolutionary role of dynamic compartments in fungal genomes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516183","0888-7543||1089-8646",,"10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.11.009","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516183","en","Academic Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Genome compartmentalization||Two-speed genomes||Repeat-induced point mutation||Fungal plant pathogens||Transposable elements||Epichloë endophytes","Chromosome-level genomes provide insights into genome evolution, organization and size in Epichloe fungi",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-19T16:27:00Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Molecular host adaptation of Epichloë endophytes","169269","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85119360236",,"000721112200009",,"6","Genomics","113","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no common garden study has yet investigated the relationship between microbial community composition and invasion resistance in microcosms whose compositional differences reflect natural, rather than laboratory-designed, variation. We conducted experimental invasions of two bacterial strains (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida) into laboratory microcosms inoculated with 680 different mixtures of bacteria derived from naturally occurring microbial communities collected in the field. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterise microcosm starting composition, and high-throughput assays of community phenotypes including productivity and invader survival, we determined that productivity is a key predictor of invasion resistance in natural microbial communities, substantially mediating the effect of composition on invasion resistance. The results suggest that similar general principles govern invasion in artificial and natural communities, and that factors affecting resident community productivity should be a focal point for future microbial invasion experiments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516195","2050-084X",,"10.7554/eLife.71811","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516195","en","eLife Sciences Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Relationships between community composition, productivity and invasion resistance in semi-natural bacterial microcosms",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-20T03:49:22Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000709350400001",,,"eLife","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although the structure of these microbial communities is becoming well-characterized, various aspects of their environmental origin and selection by plants remain uncertain, such as the relative proportion of soilborne bacteria in phyllosphere communities. Here, to address this issue and to provide experimental support for bacteria being filtered by flowers, we conducted common-garden experiments outside and under gnotobiotic conditions. We grew Arabidopsis thaliana in a soil substitute and added two microbial communities from natural soils. We estimated that at least 25% of the phyllosphere bacteria collected from the plants grown in the open environment were also detected in the controlled conditions, in which bacteria could reach leaves and flowers only from the soil. These taxa represented more than 40% of the communities based on amplicon sequencing. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering approaches supported the convergence of all floral microbiota, and 24 of the 28 bacteria responsible for this pattern belonged to the Burkholderiaceae family, which includes known plant pathogens and plant growth-promoting members. We anticipate that our study will foster future investigations regarding the routes used by soil microbes to reach leaves and flowers, the ubiquity of the environmental filtering of Burkholderiaceae across plant species and environments, and the potential functional effects of the accumulation of these bacteria in the reproductive organs of flowering plants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000511374","0027-8424||1091-6490","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/511374||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519247","10.1073/pnas.2100150118","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529967","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","phyllosphere||bacterial communities||soil||flower","Capacity of soil bacteria to reach the phyllosphere and convergence of floral communities despite soil microbiota variation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-24T04:34:42Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85116982996",,"000707946400005","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","41","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","118","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet bacteria frequently carry so-called non-transmissible plasmids, raising questions about how these plasmids spread. Interestingly, the size of many mobilisable and non-transmissible plasmids coincides with the average size of phages (~40 kb) or that of a family of pathogenicity islands, the phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICIs, ~11 kb). Here, we show that phages and PICIs from Staphylococcus aureus can mediate intra- and inter-species plasmid transfer via generalised transduction, potentially contributing to non-transmissible plasmid spread in nature. Further, staphylococcal PICIs enhance plasmid packaging efficiency, and phages and PICIs exert selective pressures on plasmids via the physical capacity of their capsids, explaining the bimodal size distribution observed for non-conjugative plasmids. Our results highlight that transducing agents (phages, PICIs) have important roles in bacterial plasmid evolution and, potentially, in antimicrobial resistance transmission.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000510204","2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-021-26101-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510204","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Staphylococcal phages and pathogenicity islands drive plasmid evolution",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-17T02:59:53Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85116476409",,"000706238600020","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This body of work has stimulated the development of several conceptual frameworks and analytical methods, as well as the production of trait databases covering a growing number of taxa and organizational levels (from individuals to guilds). However, this breeding ground of novel concepts and tools currently lacks a general and coherent framework, under which functional traits can help ecologists organize their research aims, and serve as the common currency to unify several scientific disciplines. Specifically, we see a need to bridge the gaps between community ecology, ecosystem ecology, and evolutionary biology, in order to address the most pressing environmental issues of our time. To achieve this integration goal, we define a trait-integration continuum, which reconciles alternative trait definitions and approaches in ecology. This continuum outlines a coherent progression of biological scales, along which traits interact and hierarchically integrate from genetic information, to whole organism fitness-related traits, to trait syndromes and functional groups. Our conceptual scheme proposes that lower-level trait integration is closer to the inference of ecoevolutionary mechanisms determining population and community properties, whereas higher-level trait integration is most suited to the prediction of ecosystem processes. Within these two extremes, trait integration varies on a continuous scale, which relates directly to the inductive-deductive loop that should characterize the scientific method. With our proposed framework, we aim to facilitate scientists in contextualising their research based on the trait-integration levels that matter most to their specific goals. Explicitly acknowledging the existence of a trait-integration continuum is a promising way for framing the appropriate questions, thus obtaining reliable answers and results that are comparable across studies and disciplines.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526074","0012-9658||1939-9170",,"10.1002/ecy.3472","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526074","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","biological scales||community assembly mechanisms||ecosystem processes||functional traitinteractions||inference||interdisciplinarity||performance||prediction","Reconciling trait based perspectives along a trait-integration continuum",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-17T08:02:18Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecol.","10","Ecology","102","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Aphid endosymbionts can influence the quality of their hosts as ant mutualists, via effects on honeydew composition, and might also affect CHC profiles, suggesting that ants could potentially use CHC cues to discriminate among aphid lines harbouring different endosymbionts. We explored how several strains of Hamiltonella defensa and Regiella insecticola influence the CHC profiles of host aphids (Aphis fabae) and the ability of aphid-tending ants (Lasius niger) to distinguish the profiles of aphids hosting different endosymbionts. We found significant compositional differences between the CHCs of aphids with different infections. Some endosymbionts changed the proportions of odd-chain linear alkanes, while others changed primarily methyl-branched compounds, which may be particularly important for communication. Behavioural assays, in which we trained ants to associate CHC profiles of endosymbiont infected or uninfected aphids with food rewards, revealed that ants readily learned to distinguish differences in aphid CHC profiles associated with variation in endosymbiont strains. While previous work has documented endosymbiont effects on aphid interactions with antagonists, the current findings support the hypothesis that endosymbionts also alter traits that influence communicative interactions with ant mutualists.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000509326","2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-021-98098-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/509326","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Chemical ecology||Ecology","Aphids harbouring different endosymbionts exhibit differences in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles that can be recognized by ant mutualists",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-12T20:32:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85116372188",,"000702752900042","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

National and international legislation increasingly mandates a monitoring of genetic diversity. Examples are the United Nation's Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi target 13 and the current post-2020 negotiations to specify a new target for maintaining genetic diversity. To date, only a few pilot projects have been launched that systematically monitor genetic diversity over time in natural populations of a broad variety of wild species. The Swiss Federal Office for the Environment mandated a feasibility study in 2019 for implementing a national monitoring of genetic diversity in natural populations. To obtain information on whether stakeholders are interested in such a systematic monitoring, what they would expect from such a monitoring and where they see respective caveats, we conducted an online survey, which 138 (42% of those surveyed) Swiss stakeholders answered. We find that Swiss stakeholders are generally aware of the lacking evidence regarding the status of genetic diversity in wild populations and species. Accordingly, most stakeholders are interested in a monitoring of genetic diversity and see opportunities for the application of its results in their work. Nevertheless, stakeholders also expressed concerns regarding financial resources and that the results of a genetic diversity monitoring program would not benefit conservation practice. Our findings highlight the importance of stakeholder engagement and demonstrate the value of a detailed stakeholder analysis prior to developing and implementing a genetic diversity monitoring program. A powerful tool for examining the constellation and interactions of the different stakeholders are social network analyses (SNAs). Finally, it is particularly important to communicate transparently about the possibilities and limitations of a genetic diversity monitoring program as well as to closely involve stakeholders from the beginning to increase the acceptance of genetic diversity monitoring and facilitate its implementation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494859","1572-9737||1566-0621",,"10.1007/s10592-021-01379-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494859","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Conservation genetics||Genetic diversity||International obligations||Monitoring||Stakeholder analysis","Developing a monitoring program of genetic diversity: what do stakeholders say?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T10:27:34Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85106675674",,"000655540600001","Conserv Genet","5","Conservation Genetics","22","::ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Most ecological research has focused on negative species interactions, especially competition, predation and parasitism. Yet the relevance of positive interactions - mutualisms and commensalisms - have been brought to the fore in recent years by an increasing number of empirical studies exploring their impact on range limits. Based on a review of 73 studies from a Web of Science search, we found strong evidence that positive interactions can influence the extent of species' geographic or ecological ranges through a diversity of mechanisms. More specifically, we found that while obligate interactions, and especially obligate mutualisms, tend to constrain the ranges of one or both partners, facultative positive interactions tend to widen ranges. Nonetheless, there was more variation in effects of facultative interactions on range limits, pointing to important context-dependencies. Therefore, we propose that conceptual development in this field will come from studying ecological interactions in the context of networks of many species across environmental gradients, since pairwise interactions alone might overlook the indirect and environmentally-contingent effects that species have on each other in communities of many interacting species. Finally, our study also revealed key data gaps that limit our current understanding of the pervasiveness of effects that positive interactions have on species' ranges, highlighting potential avenues for future theoretical and experimental work.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494749","0030-1299||1600-0706",,"10.1111/oik.08146","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494749","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","commensalism||facilitation||interaction networks||mutualism||niche limits||positive species interactions||range limits||symbiosis","Positive species interactions shape species' range limits",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T10:18:15Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Novel`interactions and species’ responses to climate change","678841","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85107805427",,"000660001200001","Oikos","10","Oikos","130","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, efforts to use these genomes to track trends in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) have been limited thus far. We used 22,102 genomes from public databases to track AMR trends in nontyphoidal Salmonella in food animals in the United States. In 2018, genomes deposited in public databases carried genes conferring resistance, on average, to 2.08 antimicrobial classes in poultry, 1.74 in bovines, and 1.28 in swine. This represents a decline in AMR of over 70% compared to the levels in 2000 in bovines and swine, and an increase of 13% for poultry. Trends in resistance inferred from genomic data showed good agreement with U.S. phenotypic surveillance data (weighted mean absolute difference ± standard deviation, 5.86% 6 8.11%). In 2018, resistance to 3rd-generation cephalosporins in bovines, swine, and poultry decreased to 9.97% on average, whereas in quinolones and 4th-generation cephalosporins, resistance increased to 12.53% and 3.87%, respectively. This was concomitant with a decrease of blaCMY-2 but an increase in blaCTX-M-65 and gyrA D87Y (encoding a change of D to Y at position 87). Core genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) phylogenies show that resistance to these antimicrobial classes was predominantly associated with Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis and, to a lesser extent, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and its monophasic variant I 4,[5],12:i:2, whereas quinolone resistance was also associated with S. enterica serovar Dublin. Between 2000 and 2018, trends in serovar prevalence showed a composition shift where S. Typhimurium decreased while S. Infantis increased. Our findings illustrate the growing potential of using genomes in public databases to track AMR in regions where sequencing capacities are currently expanding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516419","2165-0497",,"10.1128/Spectrum.00495-21","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516419","en","American Society for Microbiology","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nontyphoidal Salmonella||antimicrobial resistance||food animals||genomic epidemiology||public data||Salmonella||surveillance","Multidrug resistance dynamics in salmonella in food animals in the united states: An analysis of genomes from public databases",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-23T04:04:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Piloting on-site interventions for reducing antimicrobial use in livestock farming in emerging economies||Towards quantification of the contribution of plasmids to the spread of antibiotic resistance","180179||167121","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","ERA-NET + EJP||NFP 70: Gesuch",,,,"85119215351",,"000728629300060","Microbiol Spectr","2","Microbiology Spectrum","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To restore the ecological integrity of regulated rivers, artificial floods are increasingly being employed in large-scale flow restoration efforts. Despite considerable recognition regarding the ecological and geomorphological effects of artificial floods on benthic habitats, understanding the implications for the hyporheic zone is essentially absent. This void in our management knowledge base is considerable given that one of the most widely associated consequences of flow regulation is excessive deposition of fine sediment (sedimentation; particles <2 mm) that often disconnects the hyporheic zone from surface waters. In this study, we examined the effects of an artificial flood on the hyporheic zone of the River Spöl in Switzerland. Fine sediment content of shallow benthic substrates (ca. 10 cm) was significantly reduced following the flood. The flushing of fine sediment was also apparent in hyporheic substrates (depths of 0.25 and 0.50 m), resulting in a reconnection of previously clogged interstitial pathways. The opening of interstitial pore space enhanced physicochemical conditions in the hyporheic zone, such as improved dissolved oxygen concentrations, and supported greater taxa richness. Alterations in the composition of shallower hyporheic assemblages (0.25 m) were evident following the flood. These results indicated that benthic pore space became more connected to surface waters following the flood, thereby enhancing accessibility for interstitial organisms. Our results suggest that artificial floods can be an effective management tool to restore spatial heterogeneity in sediment composition and pore space and improve vertical connectivity for macroinvertebrates. We anticipate that artificial floods would be required on a regular basis given the re-accumulation of fine sediment 10 months later in our study system. We encourage river managers and scientists to consider flow disturbance and restoration in a holistic manner that encompasses the multiple spatial dimensions of connectivity, including the hyporheic ecotone.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526077","2688-8319",,"10.1002/2688-8319.12103","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526077","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","connectivity||environmental flow||experimental flood||flood disturbance||flow pulse||hyporheos||sedimentation||subsurface","Artificial flood reduces fine sediment clogging enhancing hyporheic zone physicochemistry and accessibility for macroinvertebrates",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-17T08:02:40Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000798749800002","Ecol Solut Evid.","4","Ecological Solutions and Evidence","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We previously showed that Escherichia coli commonly evolved minority mucoid phenotypes in response to predation by the bacterial predator Myxococcus xanthus by one time point of a coevolution experiment now named MyxoEE-6. Here we examine mucoid frequencies across several MyxoEE-6 timepoints to discriminate between the hypotheses that mucoids were increasing to fixation, stabilizing around equilibrium frequencies, or heading to loss toward the end of MyxoEE-6. In four focal coevolved prey populations, mucoids rose rapidly early in the experiment and then fluctuated within detectable minority frequency ranges through the end of MyxoEE-6, generating frequency dynamics suggestive of negative frequency-dependent selection. However, a competition experiment between mucoid and non-mucoid clones found a predation-specific advantage of the mucoid clone that was insensitive to frequency over the examined range, leaving the mechanism that maintains minority mucoidy unresolved. The advantage of mucoidy under predation was found to be associated with reduced population size after growth (productivity) in the absence of predators, suggesting a tradeoff between productivity and resistance to predation that we hypothesize may reverse mucoid vs non-mucoid fitness ranks within each MyxoEE-6 cycle. We also found that mucoidy was associated with diverse colony phenotypes and diverse candidate mutations primarily localized in the exopolysaccharide operon yjbEFGH. Collectively, our results show that selection from predatory bacteria can generate apparently stable sympatric phenotypic polymorphisms within coevolving prey populations and also allopatric diversity across populations by selecting for diverse mutations and colony phenotypes associated with mucoidy. More broadly, our results suggest that myxobacterial predation increases long-term diversity within natural microbial communities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000509893","2076-2607",,"10.3390/microorganisms9102079","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/509893","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","pretator-prey coevolution||antagonism","Predatory Bacteria Select for Sustained Prey Diversity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-15T03:08:34Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85116237527",,"000712649000001",,"10","Microorganisms","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The cognitive ecology of plant-pollinator interactions explores not only the complex nature of pollinator foraging behavior and decision making, but also how cognition shapes pollination and plant fitness. Floral visitors sometimes depart from what we think of as typical pollinator behavior and instead exploit floral resources by robbing nectar (bypassing the floral opening and instead consuming nectar through holes or perforations made in floral tissue). The impacts of nectar robbing on plant fitness are well-studied; however, there is considerably less understanding, from the animal’s perspective, about the cognitive processes underlying nectar robbing. Examining nectar robbing from the standpoint of animal cognition is important for understanding the evolution of this behavior and its ecological and evolutionary consequences. In this review, we draw on central concepts of foraging ecology and animal cognition to consider nectar robbing behavior either when individuals use robbing as their only foraging strategy or when they switch between robbing and legitimate foraging. We discuss sensory and cognitive biases, learning, and the role of a variable environment in making decisions about robbing vs. foraging legitimately. We also discuss ways in which an understanding of the cognitive processes involved in nectar robbing can address questions about how plant-robber interactions affect patterns of natural selection and floral evolution. We conclude by highlighting future research directions on the sensory and cognitive ecology of nectar robbing.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000514108","2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2021.698137","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/514108","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","cognition||foraging||nectar robbing||pollination||plant reproduction||sensory ecolog","The Sensory and Cognitive Ecology of Nectar Robbing",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-07T05:02:08Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85118314701",,"000714816300001","Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We performed RNA-sequencing to characterise and compare transcriptomic changes involved in herbivory-induced defences and flower development, in tomato leaves and flowers, respectively. We found that both the herbivory-induced responses and flower development involved alterations in jasmonic acid signalling, suppression of primary metabolism and reprogramming of secondary metabolism. We identified 411 genes that were involved in both processes, a number significantly higher than expected by chance. Genetic manipulation of key regulators of induced defences also led to the expression changes in the same genes in both leaves and flowers. Targeted metabolomic analysis showed that among closely related tomato species, jasmonic acid and alpha-tomatine are correlated in flower buds and herbivory-induced leaves.

The spread of TEs can have deleterious effects including the destabilization of genome integrity and expansions. However, the precise triggers of genome expansions remain poorly understood because genome size evolution is typically investigated only among deeply divergent lineages. Here, we use a large population genomics dataset of 284 individuals from populations across the globe of Zymoseptoria tritici, a major fungal wheat pathogen. We built a robust map of genome-wide TE insertions and deletions to track a total of 2456 polymorphic loci within the species. We show that purifying selection substantially depressed TE frequencies in most populations, but some rare TEs have recently risen in frequency and likely confer benefits. We found that specific TE families have undergone a substantial genome-wide expansion from the pathogen's center of origin to more recently founded populations. The most dramatic increase in TE insertions occurred between a pair of North American populations collected in the same field at an interval of 25 years. We find that both genome-wide counts of TE insertions and genome size have increased with colonization bottlenecks. Hence, the demographic history likely played a major role in shaping genome evolution within the species. We show that both the activation of specific TEs and relaxed purifying selection underpin this incipient expansion of the genome. Our study establishes a model to recapitulate TE-driven genome evolution over deeper evolutionary timescales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000509333","2050-084X",,"10.7554/eLife.69249","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/509333","en","eLife Sciences Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A population-level invasion by transposable elements triggers genome expansion in a fungal pathogen",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-12T20:32:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85116370436",,"000697184100001",,,"eLife","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we present the DSPC and its associated image processing while evaluating its capabilities in i) detecting and characterizing plankton species of different size and taxonomic categories and ii) measuring their abundance in both laboratory and field applications. In the laboratory, body size and abundance estimates by the DSPC significantly and robustly scaled with measurements derived by microscopy. In the field, a DSPC installed permanently at 3 m depth in Lake Greifensee (Switzerland) delivered images of plankton individuals, colonies, and heterospecific aggregates at hourly timescales without disrupting natural arrangements of interacting organisms, their microenvironment or their behavior. The DSPC was able to track the dynamics of taxa, mostly at the genus level, in the size range between ∼10 μm to ∼ 1 cm, covering many components of the planktonic food web (including parasites and potentially toxic cyanobacteria). Comparing data from the field-deployed DSPC to traditional sampling and microscopy revealed a general overall agreement in estimates of plankton diversity and abundances. The most significant disagreements between traditional methods and the DSPC resided in the measurements of zooplankton community properties. Our data suggest that the DSPC is better equipped to study the dynamics and demography of heterogeneously distributed organisms such as zooplankton, because high temporal resolution and continuous sampling offer more information and less variability in taxa detection and quantification than traditional sampling. Time series collected by the DSPC depicted ecological succession patterns, algal bloom dynamics and diel fluctuations with a temporal frequency and morphological resolution that was never observed by traditional methods. Access to high frequency, reproducible and real-time data of a large spectrum of the planktonic ecosystem expands our understanding of both applied and fundamental plankton ecology. We conclude the DSPC is robust for both research and water quality monitoring and suitable for stable long-term deployments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526078","0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2021.117524","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526078","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Phytoplankton||Zooplankton||Size||Microscopy||Classification||Diversity","Underwater dual-magnification imaging for automated lake plankton monitoring",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-17T08:02:48Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Water Res.",,"Water Research","203","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Empirical evidence supporting the fundamental relevance of features such as phenotypic bias is mounting as well, while the synthesis of conceptual and experimental progress leads to questioning current assumptions on the nature of evolutionary dynamics—cancer progression models or synthetic biology approaches being notable examples. This work delves with a critical and constructive attitude into our current knowledge of how genotypes map onto molecular phenotypes and organismal functions, and discusses theoretical and empirical avenues to broaden and improve this comprehension.

Most insecticidal Pseudomonas described so far were isolated from roots or soil. It is unknown whether these bacteria naturally occur in arthropods and how they interact with them. Therefore, we isolated P. protegens and P. chlororaphis from various healthy insects and myriapods, roots and soil collected in an agricultural field and a neighbouring grassland. The isolates were compared for insect killing, pathogen suppression and host colonization abilities. Our results indicate that neither the origin of isolation nor the phylogenetic position mirror the degree of insecticidal activity. Pseudomonas protegens strains appeared homogeneous regarding phylogeny, biocontrol and insecticidal capabilities, whereas P. chlororaphis strains were phylogenetically and phenotypically more heterogenous. A phenotypic and genomic analysis of five closely related P. chlororaphis isolates displaying varying levels of insecticidal activity revealed variations in genes encoding insecticidal factors that may account for the reduced insecticidal activity of certain isolates. Our findings point towards an adaption to insects within closely related pseudomonads and contribute to understand the ecology of insecticidal Pseudomonas.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493664","1462-2912||1462-2920",,"10.1111/1462-2920.15623","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493664","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Phylogenetically closely related pseudomonads isolated from arthropods exhibit differential insect-killing abilities and genetic variations in insecticidal factors",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-09T02:38:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Towards building microbial consortia for pest control: exploring adaptation to insect hosts and intraspecific diversity of pathogenicity and competition traits in insecticidal pseudomonads||Molecular determinats contributing to insect and plant associated lifestyles of beneficial pseudomonads","184666||159520","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85108956388",,"000668155200001","Environ. microbiol.","9","Environmental Microbiology","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We investigated the competitive suppression of a resistant strain of Escherichia coli inoculated into human-associated communities in the presence and absence of the broad and narrow spectrum antibiotics rifampicin and polymyxin B, respectively. We found strong evidence of community-level suppression of the resistant strain in the absence of antibiotics and, despite large changes in community composition and abundance following rifampicin exposure, suppression of the invading resistant strain was maintained in both antibiotic treatments. Instead, the strength of competitive suppression was more strongly associated with the source community (stool sample from individual human donor). This suggests microbiome composition strongly influences the competitive suppression of antibiotic-resistant strains, but at least some antibiotic-associated disruption can be tolerated before competitive release is observed. A deeper understanding of this association will aid the development of ecologically-aware strategies for managing antibiotic resistance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000485483","1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-021-00929-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/485483","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Human-associated microbiota suppress invading bacteria even under disruption by antibiotics",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-20T14:14:43Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Bacteria-phage-antibiotic interactions in variable environments: a community ecology perspective||The role of bacteria-virus interactions in antimicrobial resistance","750779||165803||750779||165803","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF||EC||SNF","H2020||H2020||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85102598927",,"000628143100007","ISME J","9","The ISME Journal","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Regularized regression represents a far more efficient neighborhood modeling method, but it is unclear whether such an ecologically unrealistic model can provide accurate insights on tree growth. Rapid computation is becoming increasingly important as ecological datasets grow in size, and may be essential when using neighborhood models to predict tree growth beyond sample plots or into the future. We built a novel regularized regression model of tree growth and investigated whether it reached the same conclusions as a commonly used neighborhood model, regarding hypotheses of how tree growth is influenced by the species identity of neighboring trees. We also evaluated the ability of both models to interpolate the growth of trees not included in the model fitting dataset. Our regularized regression model replicated most of the classical model’s inferences in a fraction of the time without using high-performance computing resources. We found that both methods could interpolate out-of-sample tree growth, but the method making the most accurate predictions varied among focal species. Regularized regression is particularly efficient for comparing hypotheses because it automates the process of model selection and can handle correlated explanatory variables. This feature means that regularized regression could also be used to select among potential explanatory variables (e.g., climate variables) and thereby streamline the development of a classical neighborhood model. Both regularized regression and classical methods can interpolate out-of-sample tree growth, but future research must determine whether predictions can be extrapolated to trees experiencing novel conditions. Overall, we conclude that regularized regression methods can complement classical methods in the investigation of tree growth drivers and represent a valuable tool for advancing this field toward prediction.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507987","1999-4907",,"10.3390/f12091283","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507987","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","forest plot||inference||interpolation||model selection||neighborhood model||regularization||test set validation||tree growth","Regularized Regression: A New Tool for Investigating and Predicting Tree Growth",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-02T02:42:44Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85115657340",,"000699801100001",,"9","Forests","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Pathogen life-history trade-offs are suggested to maintain genetic diversity and create evolutionary constraints that prevent selection from driving multiple life-history traits towards maximization. Less is known about trade-offs in agroecosystems and how they can be engineered to impede pathogen evolution and delay the breakdown of host resistance. Additionally, the diversity of resistance genes in host genetic materials from gene banks is largely unknown for various diseases. In this PhD thesis, we screened a century-old historic collection of wheat landraces (n=188) from the Swiss Gene Bank for resistance to Septoria tritici blotch (STB) disease caused by the fungus Zymoseptoria tritici. A known major gene (Stb6) on wheat chromosome 3A was found to be associated with resistance to pathogen damage and reproduction in the Z. tritici isolate 1E4. Most of the landraces carrying a single resistant allele suggested the early selection of wheat plants showing field resistance to STB and germplasm exchanges for Swiss wheat breeding in the early 1990s. Next, we investigated how the relationship between virulence and reproduction, and the degree of host specialization influence pathogen evolution at the phenotypic level. We obtained largescale phenotypic data from a greenhouse assay on pathogenicity traits from a combination of 12 genetically distinct wheat hosts and 145 Z. tritici isolates. The isolates were sampled from Australia, Israel, Switzerland, and the USA. A positive correlation between virulence and reproduction indicated the possibility of increased transmission that may accelerate pathogen evolution given monocropping based agriculture. However, we found that isolates with high host specificity were on average less virulent, whereas isolates with a broader host range for virulence were generally less fecund. These costs might decelerate the evolution of super pathogen strains and maintain genetic diversity in life-history traits. Pathogens must encounter climatic variation, survive outside the host during off-seasons and resist application of agrochemicals. Yet, how pathogens adapt to abiotic environments and maintain pathogenicity on different hosts remains poorly understood. The third chapter established a correlational landscape between pathogen traits measured on and off the host. The strong positive genetic correlations driven by numerous pleiotropic loci between virulence and reproduction might indicate convergent evolution that facilitates rapid host adaptation. Importantly, genetic tradeoffs between host and survival traits may play an important role in determining the pathogen’s evolutionary potential. Isolates with high fungicide resistance showed a genetic constraint in their ability to cause damage to certain hosts. By leveraging information on genetic trade-offs, innovative disease management strategies can be designed to exploit evolutionary weaknesses of pathogens. The extensive heritable variation in life-history traits under different environments in Z. tritici is likely to be governed by numerous genes. The fourth chapter aimed at systematically uncovering these genes by performing large-scale genome-wide association mapping (GWAS) based on genetic datasets created from 19 Z. tritici genomes and a K-mer approach. The comprehensive GWAS analysis discovered numerous genes that might play an essential role in niche adaptation in Z. tritici. We showed that increasing the number of reference genomes resulted in an increased number of genes detected by GWAS. Moreover, the K-mer GWAS proved to be a powerful approach in discovering several novel and previously identified genes (e.g., Avr3D1 or CYP51). We highlighted the need to move beyond the realm of single reference to more innovative GWAS approaches to unravel the gene repertoire underpinning trait variation. Overall, this PhD thesis demonstrates the importance of investigating life-history trade-offs at the population and genetic level to better understand pathogen evolutionary trajectories and implement novel GWAS methods to pinpoint genetic determinants driving microbial niche adaptation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516881",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516881","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","plant-pathogen interaction||Adaptation||Evolution||GWAS||life-history trade-offs||Host Resistance||Host specialization||Pangenome","Principles of Niche Adaptation in a Major Fungal Pathogen of Wheat",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::630 - Agriculture",,"2021-11-25T13:06:08Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27887",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

One constraint to obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the most general plant responses, however, has been the difficulty of studying all plant functional shifts simultaneously due to analytical limitations. Now this is possible with the advent of metabolomics. Using 151 records from the WEB of SCIENCE database, we have analyzed the development and application of metabolomic profiles to ecological studies in the last two decades. We have used meta-analysis and pathway enrichment analyses to assess the whole set of constitutive and inducible defenses. Constitutive defenses against herbivores were mainly based on a significant high level of the metabolism of several amino acids with parallel increases in the concentrations of flavones (phenolics) and saponins (glycosides). Inducible defenses, though, were mainly based on the increases in concentration of methyl-ketone, pantothenate, and Coenzyme A. Butyrate metabolism and the mitochondrial electron-transport chain were upregulated, in agreement with previous reports that herbivory-activated plant chemical defenses were mainly based on jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and ethylene-associated pathways. The metabolic responses/acclimations to pathogenic fungi were mainly linked with increases in aspartate and pyruvate metabolism, the transfer of acetyl groups within mitochondria, and the upregulation of branched-chain amino acids degradation pathways. These responses/acclimations were accompanied by higher concentrations of the most important groups of secondary metabolites such as phenolics (anthocyanins, flavonoids), quinones, alkaloids, terpenoids, and polyamines and other compounds related to antistress mechanisms such as proline. The leaves of mycorrhized plants accumulated nucleotide sugars, sphingolipids, and methylhistidine. These responses were associated with maintaining the integrity of plant cell membranes under fungal hypha penetration. The responses were accompanied by increases in the concentrations of phenolics, blumenols, and alkaloids and decreases in the concentrations of polyamines, consistent with the mycorrhizal inhibition of polyamines. This summary provides a clear synthesis of the most successful plant strategies selected after millions of years of evolution and will be a very promising tool for the management of crops and ecosystems and for selecting the main lines in breeding studies for future research.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000508268","2150-8925",,"10.1002/ecs2.3736","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/508268","en","Ecological Society of America","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","biotic relationships||ecometabolomics","Ecometabolomics of plant–herbivore and plant–fungi interactions: a synthesis study",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-05T06:39:51Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85115857171",,,,"9","Ecosphere","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that elicitors of plant defenses interact with pathogen infection to influence crop resistance against vector and nonvector herbivores. To do so, we employed a trophic system comprising of cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon), the phytoplasma that causes false blossom disease, and two herbivores-the blunt-nosed leafhopper (Limotettix vaccinii), the vector of false blossom disease, and the nonvector gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). We tested four commercial elicitors, including three that activate mainly SA-related plant defenses (Actigard, LifeGard, and Regalia) and one activator of JA-related defenses (Blush). A greenhouse experiment in which phytoplasma-infected and uninfected plants received repeated exposure to elicitors revealed that both phytoplasma infection and elicitor treatment individually improved L. vaccinii and L. dispar mass compared to uninfected, untreated controls; however, SA-based elicitor treatments reduced L. vaccinii mass on infected plants. Regalia also improved L. vaccinii survival. Phytoplasma infection reduced plant size and mass, increased levels of nitrogen (N) and SA, and lowered carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios compared to uninfected plants, irrespective of elicitor treatment. Although none of our elicitor treatments influenced transcript levels of a phytoplasma-specific marker gene, all of them increased N and reduced C/N levels; the three SA activators also reduced JA levels. Taken together, our findings reveal positive effects of both phytoplasma infection and elicitor treatment on the performance of L. vaccinii and L. dispar in cranberries, likely via enhancement of plant nutrition and changes in phytohormone profiles, specifically increases in SA levels and corresponding decreases in levels of JA. Thus, we found no evidence that the tested elicitors of plant defenses increase resistance to insect herbivores or reduce disease incidence in cranberries.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000502092","1664-462X",,"10.3389/fpls.2021.700242","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502092","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","false blossom disease||blunt-nosed leafhoppers||gypsy moth||carbon/nitrogen ratios||phytohormones||plant-phytoplasma-herbivore interactions","Application of Plant Defense Elicitors Fails to Enhance Herbivore Resistance or Mitigate Phytoplasma Infection in Cranberries",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-25T02:41:40Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85113462590",,"000684955500006","Front.

In this review, we cover recent genomic and life cycle transcriptomic studies in several heteroecious rust species, which provide insights into the genetic tool kits associated with host adaptation and virulence, opening new avenues for unraveling their unique evolution.",,,"1545-2107||0066-4286",,"10.1146/annurev-phyto-020620-121149","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504423","en","Annual Reviews",,,"Uredinales||Life cycle||Heteroecism||Transcriptomics||Pathogenesis||Effectors","Host Adaptation and Virulence in Heteroecious Rust Fungi",,"Review Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-09-07T04:06:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85113823347",,"000691741600017","Ann.

However, the majority of climate data used in climate-growth correlation analyses are not directly recorded on the sample sites, but obtained from nearby weather stations. We used a sample site in Saihanba region as a case study to address how correlation bias may occur if nearby climate products have no high correlation with the climate in the sample site. Temperatures in the sample site and from other data resources were highly correlated, suggesting that small potential bias in growth-temperature correlations when using temperatures from nearby climate stations. However, precipitation had large spatial variability, resulting in low correlation between precipitation of the sample site and precipitation from other resources. Large biases in growth-precipitation analysis would be expected when using precipitation from nearby stations, suggesting that precipitation records should be carefully chosen. To aid in this selection, we used a cluster analysis and multiple data-products across China to identify regions where station climate do and do not reflect accurately site conditions, and classified temperature and precipitation zones where climate has high correlation among grid cells of the same climate zone based on similarity of the macroclimate using a ~ 2.5 km resolution gridded climate dataset. Using climate stations located in the same cluster as the sample sites would help to prevent or reduce correlation biases in growth-climate analyses.

The omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) have a high potential to affect consumer fitness, through their widespread effects on reproduction, growth and survival. However, few studies consider the evolution of fatty acid metabolism within an ecological context. In this review, we first document the extensive diversity in both primary producer and consumer fatty acid distributions amongst major ecosystems, between habitats and amongst species within habitats. We highlight some of the key nutritional contrasts that can shape behavioural and/or metabolic adaptation in consumers, discussing how consumers can evolve in response to the spatial, seasonal and community-level variation of resource quality. We propose a hierarchical trait-based approach for studying the evolution of consumers’ metabolic networks and review the evolutionary genetic mechanisms underpinning consumer adaptation to EPA and DHA distributions. In doing so, we consider how the metabolic traits of consumers are hierarchically structured, from cell membrane function to maternal investment, and have strongly environment-dependent expression. Finally, we conclude with an outlook on how studying the metabolic adaptation of consumers within the context of nutritional landscapes can open up new opportunities for understanding evolutionary diversification.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526081","1461-023X||1461-0248",,"10.1111/ele.13771","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526081","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Adaptation||Behavior||Diversitication||Genetics||Metabolic networks||Nutritional landscapes||Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids||Traits","The evolutionary ecology of fatty-acid variation: Implications for consumer adaptation and diversification",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-17T08:03:10Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecol. lett.","8","Ecology Letters","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We previously showed that genomic imprinting, the parent-of-origin dependent expression of alleles, is perturbed in the hybrid endosperm, with many of the normally paternally expressed genes losing their imprinted status. Here, we report transcriptome-based analyses of gene and small RNA (sRNA) expression levels. We identified 2,295 genes and 387 sRNA clusters as differentially expressed when comparing reciprocal hybrid seed to seeds and endosperms from the two within-species crosses. Our analyses uncovered a pattern of overdominance in endosperm gene expression in both hybrid cross directions, in marked contrast to the patterns of sRNA expression in whole seeds. Intriguingly, patterns of increased gene expression resemble the previously reported increased maternal expression proportions in hybrid endosperms. We identified physical clusters of sRNAs; differentially expressed sRNAs exhibit reduced transcript abundance in hybrid seeds of both cross directions. Moreover, sRNAs map to genes coding for key proteins involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, suggesting a regulatory feedback mechanism. We describe examples of genes that appear to be targets of sRNA-mediated gene silencing; in these cases, reduced sRNA abundance is concomitant with increased gene expression in hybrid seeds. Our analyses also show that S. peruvianum dominance impacts gene and sRNA expression in hybrid seeds. Overall, our study indicates roles for sRNA-mediated epigenetic regulation in HSF between closely related wild tomato species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504179","1759-6653",,"10.1093/gbe/evab107","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504179","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","postzygotic isolation||small RNAs||seed development||epigenetic||transcriptomics||Solanum","Endosperm and Seed Transcriptomes Reveal Possible Roles for Small RNA Pathways in Wild Tomato Hybrid Seed Failure",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-06T02:45:45Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85114386207",,"000690274300001","Genome Biol Evol","8","Genome Biology and Evolution","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This collaboration axis spans from thin and highly branched roots that employ a ‘do-it-yourself’ strategy to thick and sparsely branched roots that ‘outsource’ nutrient uptake to symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Here, we explore the functionality of this collaboration axis by quantifying how interactions with AMF change the impact of root traits on plant performance. To this end, we developed a novel functional–structural plant (FSP) modelling approach that simulates plants competing for light and nutrients in the presence or absence of AMF. Our simulation results support the notion that in the absence of AMF, plants rely on thin, highly branched roots for their nutrient uptake. The presence of AMF, however, promotes thick, unbranched roots as an alternative strategy for uptake of immobile phosphorus, but not for mobile nitrogen. This provides further support for a root trait framework that accommodates for the interactive effect of roots and AMF. Our modelling study offers unique opportunities to incorporate soil microbial interactions into root functionality as it integrates consequences of belowground trait expression.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493906","0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.17435","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493906","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)||architectural whole-plant modelling||functional–structural plant modelling||outsourcing||resource competition||root economics space||root traits","Mycorrhizal associations change root functionality: a 3D modelling study on competitive interactions between plants for light and nutrients",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-11T02:45:06Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85107002563",,"000656096500001","New Phytol.","3","New Phytologist","231","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The problem is exacerbated by antibiotic-resistant strains that delay or impede effective treatment. To ensure successful therapy and to manage antibiotic resistance, treatment protocols that draw on several different antibiotics might be used. This includes the administration of drug cocktails to individual patients (combination therapy) but also the random assignment of drugs to different patients (mixing) and a regular switch in the default drug used in the hospital from drug A to drug B and back (cycling). For more than 20 years, mathematical models have been used to assess the prospects of antibiotic combination therapy, mixing and cycling. But while tendencies in their ranking across studies have emerged, the picture remains surprisingly inconclusive and incomplete. In this article, we review existing modelling studies and demonstrate by means of examples how methodological factors complicate the emergence of a consistent picture.

Current estimates are dominated by overrepresentation of small trees in regression models. We combined global fecundity data, including a substantial representation of large trees. We compared size-fecundity relationships against traditional allometric scaling with diameter and two models based on crown architecture. All allometric models fail to describe the declining rate of increase in fecundity with diameter found for 80% of 597 species in our analysis.

To avoid deleterious effects of TE activity, some fungi have evolved highly sophisticated genomic defences to reduce TE proliferation across the genome. Repeat- induced point mutation (RIP) is a fungal- specific TE defence mechanism efficiently targeting duplicated sequences. The rapid accumulation of RIPs is expected to deactivate TEs over the course of a few generations. The evolutionary dynamics of TEs at the population level in a species with highly repressive genome defences is poorly understood. Here, we analyse 366 whole- genome sequences of Parastagonospora nodorum, a fungal pathogen of wheat with efficient RIP. A global population genomics analysis revealed high levels of genetic diversity and signs of frequent sexual recombination. Contrary to expectations for a species with RIP, we identified recent TE activity in multiple populations. The TE composition and copy numbers showed little divergence among global populations regardless of the demographic history. Miniature inverted- repeat transposable elements (MITEs) and terminal repeat retrotransposons in miniature (TRIMs) were largely underlying recent intra- species TE expansions. We inferred RIP footprints in individual TE families and found that recently active, high- copy TEs have possibly evaded genomic defences. We find no evidence that recent positive selection acted on TE- mediated mutations rather that purifying selection maintained new TE insertions at low insertion frequencies in populations. Our findings highlight the complex evolutionary equilibria established by the joint action of TE activity, selection and genomic repression.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505648","2057-5858",,"10.1099/mgen.0.000540","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505648","en","Microbiology Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","adaptation||genetic diversity||Pathogen||repeat-induced point mutations||selfish elements||transposable elements","Population genomics of transposable element activation in the highly repressive genome of an agricultural pathogen",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-16T02:30:39Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000692552600006","Microb Genom","8","Microbial Genomics","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we tested whether cooperation and cheating on cooperation can spur patterns of local adaptation in soil and pond communities of Pseudomonas bacteria, collected across a geographical scale of 0.5 to 50 m. We focussed on the production of pyoverdines, a group of secreted iron-scavenging siderophores that often differ among pseudomonads in their chemical structure and the receptor required for their uptake. A combination of supernatant-feeding and competition assays between isolates from four distance categories revealed tremendous variation in the extent to which pyoverdine non- and low-producers can benefit from pyoverdines secreted by producers. However, this variation was not explained by geographical distance, but primarily depended on the phylogenetic relatedness between interacting isolates. A notable exception occurred in local pond communities, where the effect of phylogenetic relatedness was eroded in supernatant assays, probably due to the horizontal transfer of receptor genes. While the latter result could be a signature of local adaptation, our results overall indicate that common ancestry and not geographical distance is the main predictor of siderophore-mediated social interactions among pseudomonads.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000551323","1010-061X||1420-9101",,"10.1111/jeb.13883","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551323","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","genetic isolation-by-distance||microbe–microbe interactions||Pseudomonas||public goods||siderophores","Local adaptation, geographical distance and phylogenetic relatedness: Assessing the drivers of siderophore‐mediated social interactions in natural bacterial communities",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-06-08T10:39:58Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,"85108263880",,"000664188200001","J. evol. biol.","8","Journal of Evolutionary Biology","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we create a database of root-mass fractions (RMFs), an index of plant below- versus aboveground biomass distributions, and generate quantitative, spatially explicit global maps of RMFs in trees, shrubs and grasses. Our analyses reveal large gradients in RMFs both across and within vegetation types that can be attributed to resource availability. High RMFs occur in cold and dry ecosystems, while low RMFs dominate in warm and wet regions. Across all vegetation types, the directional effect of temperature on RMFs depends on water availability, suggesting feedbacks between heat, water and nutrient supply. By integrating our RMF maps with existing aboveground plant biomass information, we estimate that in forests, shrublands and grasslands, respectively, 22%, 47% and 67% of plant biomass exists belowground, with a total global belowground fraction of 24% (20–28%), that is, 113 (90–135) Gt carbon.

As cities continue to densify, however, urban green spaces are becoming smaller and more isolated. Many hope that wildflowers, and with them also faunistic biodiversity, can be maintained through networks of small informal green spaces. Currently, there are little data available for city planners to answer the questions of how patch size and ecological connectivity affect the population persistence of wildflowers in small vegetation patches. To address these concerns, we surveyed all vegetation patches greater than 1 m2 in public spaces across seven 1 km2 quadrats distributed across the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Our survey focused on a list of 166 herbaceous vascular plant species. We analyzed vegetation patch topologies (frequency distributions of size and connectivity) and related it to alpha and beta species diversity. Dispersal traits of investigated species were used to interpret connectivity patterns. Over 75 % of patches were <20 m2 in size, however, these small patches made up only 3.4 % of total vegetation area. Species richness was significantly positively correlated with patch area. Nevertheless, taken together, small patches had similar species richness and higher beta diversity than larger patches. These small patches contribute far more than expected to overall wildflower species richness in the city – “punching above their weight”. This held true even for less common species. However, our research indicates that connecting these patches to one another and to larger green spaces is essential to unlocking their potential as habitats and potentially allowing for the natural colonization and reinforcement of existing populations. As cities densify, we must acknowledge that small vegetation patches such as tree discs or road margins are essential for the survival of wildflower populations and associated fauna, especially in highly urbanized areas.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000482071","1618-8667",,"10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127165","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/482071","en","Elsevier BV","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Ecological connectivity||Green city design||Nature conservation||Species-area relationship||Urban densification||Urban biodiversity||Urban open space planning||Wildflower","Promoting wildflower biodiversity in dense and green cities: the important role of small vegetation patches",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-03T07:27:10Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85104977688",,"000663729200002",,,"Urban Forestry & Urban Greening",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

One component of the Earth system where large uncertainties remain are Arctic and boreal freshwater lakes. With only short periods of open water due to annual ice cover, lake productivity in these regions is extremely sensitive to warming induced changes in ice cover. At the same time, productivity dynamics in these lakes vary enormously, even over short distances, making it difficult to understand these potential changes. A major impediment to an improved understanding of lake dynamics has been sparsely distributed field measurements, in large part due to the complexity and expense of conducting scientific research in remote northern latitudes. This project overcomes that hurdle by using a new set of ‘eyes in the sky’, the Planet Labs CubeSat fleet, to observe 35 lakes across 3 different arctic-boreal ecoregions in western North America. We extract time series of lake reflectance to identify ice-out and green-up across three years (2017–2019). We find that lakes with later ice-out have significantly faster green-ups. Our results also show ice-out varies latitudinally by 38 days from south to north, but only varies across years by ~9 days. In contrast, green-up varied between years by 22 days in addition to showing significant spatial variability. We compare PlanetScope to Sentinel-2 data and independently validate our ice-out estimates, finding an ice-out mean absolute difference (MAD) ~9 days. This study demonstrates the potential of using CubeSat imagery to monitor the timing and magnitude of ice-off and green-up at high spatiotemporal resolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000495425","2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs13132533","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495425","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Arctic||Boreal||Lake||Phenology||PlanetScope||Sentinel-2","Arctic-boreal lake phenology shows a relationship between earlier lake ice-out and later green-up",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-16T03:22:43Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85109359482",,"000671138700001","Remote Sens.","13","Remote Sensing","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite the ecological importance of microbial communities, few studies of predatory microbes examine such behavioral res-ponses and the multiplicity of trophic interactions. Here, we sought to assemble a three-level microbial food chain and to test for behavioral interactions between the predatory nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the predatory social bacterium Myxococcus xanthus when cultured together with two basal prey bacteria that both predators can eat—Escherichia coli and Flavobacterium johnsoniae. We found that >90% of C. elegans worms failed to interact with M. xanthus even when it was the only potential prey species available, whereas most worms were attracted to pure patches of E. coli and F. johnsoniae. In addition, M. xanthus altered nematode predatory behavior on basal prey, repelling C. elegans from two-species patches that would be attractive without M. xanthus, an effect similar to that of C. elegans pathogens. The nematode also influenced the behavior of the bacterial predator: M. xanthus increased its predatory swarming rate in response to C. elegans in a manner dependent both on basal-prey identity and on worm density. Our results suggest that M. xanthus is an unattractive prey for some soil nematodes and is actively avoided when other prey are available. Most broadly, we found that nematode and bacterial predators mutually influence one another’s predatory behavior, with likely consequences for coevolution within complex microbial food webs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000491581","2076-2607",,"10.3390/microorganisms9071362","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491581","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Microbial food web||Trophic interactions||Predator–prey interactions||Mesopredator||Social bacteria||Nematodes||Experimental community||Behavior","Behavioral Interactions between Bacterivorous Nematodes and Predatory Bacteria in a Synthetic Community",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-28T04:06:08Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85108310140",,"000676767300001",,"7","Microorganisms","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Earlier leaf-out and later autumn leaf senescence under climate warming have been linked to increases in plant productivity and ecosystem carbon uptake. Yet, despite the potential implications of shifting phenology for plant carbon uptake, the degree to which phenological changes affect overall plant growth and the partitioning between above- and below-ground biomass remains unclear. 2. Here we use a 3-year experiment to quantify changes in root and shoot growth of three woody plant species (two common European tree species, Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur, and one shrub Lonicera xylosteum) under spring and autumn warming. 3. In both tree species, the magnitude—and in Quercus even the direction—of the effects of growing-season length on growth depends on whether the warming happened in spring or in autumn. Each day earlier leaf-out in response to warming resulted in total biomass increases of 0.8%–2.5%, whereas delayed senescence led to reductions of 0.2%–2.1%. Advances in leaf-out also led to increased root-to-shoot biomass ratios because root growth was proportionally more stimulated than shoot growth. In the shrub species, earlier leaf-out had no effect, while delayed senescence led to increases in root, but not shoot, biomass. 4. Synthesis. The strong asymmetry between growth responses to spring versus autumn phenology demonstrates that growing-season length per se is a weak indicator of individual-level tree productivity. The results further imply that phenological shifts are reshaping the functional balance between above- and below-ground growth, which is critical for quantifying forest carbon dynamics under climate change.",,,"0022-0477",,"10.1111/1365-2745.13682","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494917","en","Wiley",,,"carbon cycle||climate change||leaf-out||phenology||plant growth||senescence||warming experiment","How changes in spring and autumn phenology translate into growth-experimental evidence of asymmetric effects",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-07-15T10:31:14Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85106437011",,"000654042000001","J.

However, resistance to these different classes of plant antagonists is mediated by different molecular mechanisms, and the extent to which induced systemic resistance by Pseudomonas can simultaneously protect plants against both pathogens and herbivores remains unclear. We screened 12 root-colonizing Pseudomonas strains to assess their ability to induce resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana against a foliar pathogen (Pseudomonas syringae DC3000) and a chewing herbivore (Spodoptera littoralis). None of our 12 strains increased plant resistance against herbivory; however, four strains enhanced pathogen resistance, and one of these (Pseudomonas strain P97-38) also made plants more susceptible to herbivory. Phytohormone analyses revealed stronger salicylic acid induction in plants colonized by P97-38 (versus controls) following subsequent pathogen infection but weaker induction of jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated defenses following herbivory. We found no effects of P97-38 inoculation on herbivore-relevant nutrients such as sugars and protein, suggesting that the observed enhancement of susceptibility to S. littoralis is due to effects on plant defense chemistry rather than nutrition. These findings suggest that Pseudomonas strains that enhance plant resistance to pathogens may have neutral or negative effects on resistance to herbivores and provide insight into potential mechanisms associated with effects on different classes of plant antagonists. Improved understanding of these effects has potentially important implications for the use of rhizobacteria inoculation in agriculture.",,,"0099-2240||1098-5336",,"10.1128/AEM.02831-20","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491549","en","American Society for Microbiology",,,"Arabidopsis thaliana||Pseudomonas||Pseudomonas syringae||Spodoptera littoralis||biological control||glucosinolates||Induced systemic resistance||Phytohormones","Effects of Root-Colonizing Fluorescent Pseudomonas Strains on Arabidopsis Resistance to a Pathogen and an Herbivore",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-06-27T03:33:23Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85108303766",,"000693246600018","Appl.

Oculimacula is restricted to two species, O. acuformis and O. yallundae, with O. aestiva placed in Cyphellophora, and O. anguioides accommodated in a new genus, Helgardiomyces. Rhynchosporium s. str. is restricted to species with 1-septate conidia and hooked apical beaks, while Rhynchobrunnera is introduced for species with 1-3-septate, straight conidia, lacking any apical beak. Rhynchosporium graminicola is proposed to replace the name R. commune applied to the barley scald pathogen based on nomenclatural priority. Spermospora is shown to be paraphyletic, representing Spermospora (type: S. subulata), with three new species, S. arrhenatheri, S. loliiphila and S. zeae, and Neospermospora gen. nov.

The lack of genetic diversity in modern elite wheat cultivars largely hinders the improvement of STB resistance. Wheat landraces are reservoirs of untapped genetic diversity, which can be exploited to find novel STB resistance genes or alleles. Here, we characterized 188 Swiss wheat landraces for resistance to STB using four Swiss Z. tritici isolates. We used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants associated with the amount of lesion and pycnidia production by the fungus. The majority of the landraces were highly resistant for both traits to the isolate 1E4, indicating a gene-for-gene relationship, while higher phenotypic variability was observed against other isolates. GWAS detected a significant SNP on chromosome 3A that was associated with both traits in the isolate 1E4. The resistance response against 1E4 was likely controlled by the Stb6 gene. Sanger sequencing revealed that the majority of these ~ 100-year-old landraces carry the Stb6 resistance allele. This indicates the importance of this gene in Switzerland during the early 1900s for disease control in the field. Our study demonstrates the importance of characterizing historic landrace collections for STB resistance to provide valuable information on resistance variability and contributing alleles. This will help breeders in the future to make decisions on integrating such germplasms in STB resistance breeding.",,,"0014-2336||1573-5060",,"10.1007/s10681-021-02843-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/485058","en","Springer",,,"Wheat||Landrace||Disease resistance||Septoria tritici blotch||Zymoseptoria tritici||Germplasm collection","Genome-wide association study for septoria tritici blotch resistance reveals the occurrence and distribution of Stb6 in a historic Swiss landrace collection",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-05-20T02:57:34Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85105659357",,"000698666100002","Euphytica (Wagening.)","6","Euphytica","217","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Endosperm misdevelopment has now been shown to underlie HSF in many inter-specific, homoploid crosses. The consistent asymmetries in seed size and developmental trajectories likely reflect parental divergence in key, dosage-sensitive processes. Transcriptomic and epigenomic studies reveal genome-wide, polarized expression perturbations and shifts in parental expression proportions, consistent with small-RNA imbalances between parental roles. Among-species differences in levels of parental conflict over resource allocation enjoy strong support in explaining why differences in effective ploidy may evolve.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000472845","1369-5266||1879-0356",,"10.1016/j.pbi.2021.102015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472845","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"A revival of effective ploidy: the asymmetry of parental roles in endosperm-based hybridization barriers",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-04T04:24:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85101331362",,"000663832800012","Curr.

However, recent studies have revealed that the evolutionary impact of plasmids goes above and beyond their being mere gene delivery platforms. Plasmids are usually kept at multiple copies per cell, producing islands of polyploidy in the bacterial genome. As a consequence, the evolution of plasmid-encoded genes is governed by a set of rules different from those affecting chromosomal genes, and these rules are shaped by unusual concepts in bacterial genetics, such as genetic dominance, heteroplasmy or segregational drift. In this Review, we discuss recent advances that underscore the importance of plasmids in bacterial ecology and evolution beyond horizontal gene transfer. We focus on new evidence that suggests that plasmids might accelerate bacterial evolution, mainly by promoting the evolution of plasmid-encoded genes, but also by enhancing the adaptation of their host chromosome. Finally, we integrate the most relevant theoretical and empirical studies providing a global understanding of the forces that govern plasmid-mediated evolution in bacteria. © Springer Nature Limited 2021",,,"1740-1526||1740-1534",,"10.1038/s41579-020-00497-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473470","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Beyond horizontal gene transfer: the role of plasmids in bacterial evolution",,"Review Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-03-08T15:57:59Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,"87121446",,,,,"Nat Rev Microbiol","6","Nature Reviews Microbiology","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Projected population growth (λ) derived from integral projection models was reduced by 0.07/°C of warming on average, whereas novel species additionally decreased λ by 0.15 across warming levels. Effects of novel species on predicted extinction time were greatest at warming < 2 °C for two species. Projected population declines under both warming and with novel species were primarily driven by increased mortality.

In this Perspective, we argue that, despite the mechanistic uncertainty underlying these losses, there is confidence that a strong, positive land carbon–climate feedback can be expected. Two major lines of evidence support net global SOC losses with warming via increases in soil microbial metabolic activity: the increase in soil respiration with temperature and the accumulation of SOC in low mean annual temperature regions. Warming-induced SOC losses are likely to be of a magnitude relevant for emission negotiations and necessitate more aggressive emission reduction targets to limit climate change to 1.5 °C by 2100. We suggest that microbial community–temperature interactions, and how they are influenced by substrate availability, are promising research areas to improve the accuracy and precision of the magnitude estimates of projected SOC losses.",,,"2662-138X",,"10.1038/s43017-021-00178-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492879","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Evidence for large microbial-mediated losses of soil carbon under anthropogenic warming",,"Other Journal Item","Metadata only",,,,"2021-07-04T03:08:23Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85108405222",,"000663041100001","Nat Rev Earth Environ",,"Nature Reviews Earth & Environment","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We investigate these pressures through mathematical modeling in the context of antibiotic resistance, which is often found on plasmids. Our central finding is that gene location is under positive frequency-dependent selection: the higher the frequency of one form of resistance compared to the other, the higher its relative fitness. This can keep moderately beneficial genes on plasmids, despite occasional plasmid loss. For these genes, positive frequency dependence leads to a priority effect: whichever form is acquired first—through either mutation or horizontal gene transfer—has time to increase in frequency and thus becomes difficult to displace. Higher rates of horizontal transfer of plasmid-borne than chromosomal genes therefore predict moderately beneficial genes will be found on plasmids. Gene flow between plasmid and chromosome allows chromosomal forms to arise, but positive frequency-dependent selection prevents these from establishing. Further modeling shows that this effect is particularly pronounced when genes are shared across a large number of species, suggesting that antibiotic resistance genes are often found on plasmids because they are moderately beneficial across many species. We also revisit previous theoretical work—relating to the role of local adaptation in explaining gene location and to plasmid persistence—in light of our findings.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000489529","2056-3744",,"10.1002/evl3.226","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/489529","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Evolutionary genomics||microbes||models||theory","Evolutionary mechanisms that determine which bacterial genes are carried on plasmids",,"Other Journal Item","Open access",,,,"2021-06-15T02:30:38Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Infectious disease dynamics: spread along contact networks and experimental evolution of antibiotic resistance||Towards quantification of the contribution of plasmids to the spread of antibiotic resistance","176401||167121","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Exzellenzbeitrag in Lebenswissenschaften||NFP 70: Gesuch",,,,"85105918852",,"000651629800001",,"3","Evolution Letters","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we leverage multiple large-scale soil microbiome surveys to develop predictive models of bacterial and fungal community composition in soil, then test these models against independent soil microbial community surveys from across the continental United States. We find remarkable scale dependence in community predictability. The predictability of bacterial and fungal communities increases with the spatial scale of observation, and fungal predictability increases with taxonomic scale. These patterns suggest that there is an increasing importance of deterministic versus stochastic processes with scale, consistent with findings in plant and animal communities, suggesting a general scaling relationship across biology. Biogeochemical functional groups and high-level taxonomic groups of microorganisms were equally predictable, indicating that traits and taxonomy are both powerful lenses for understanding soil communities.

A widely documented response to such environmental modifications is for plant species to change their elevational ranges. Range shifts are often idiosyncratic and difficult to generalize, partly due to variation in sampling methods. There is thus a need for a standardized monitoring strategy that can be applied across mountain regions to assess distribution changes and community turnover of native and non-native plant species over space and time. Here, we present a conceptually intuitive and standardized protocol developed by the Mountain Invasion Research Network (MIREN) to systematically quantify global patterns of native and non-native species distributions along elevation gradients and shifts arising from interactive effects of climate change and human disturbance. Usually repeated every five years, surveys consist of 20 sample sites located at equal elevation increments along three replicate roads per sampling region. At each site, three plots extend from the side of a mountain road into surrounding natural vegetation. The protocol has been successfully used in 18 regions worldwide from 2007 to present. Analyses of one point in time already generated some salient results, and revealed region-specific elevational patterns of native plant species richness, but a globally consistent elevational decline in non-native species richness. Non-native plants were also more abundant directly adjacent to road edges, suggesting that disturbed roadsides serve as a vector for invasions into mountains. From the upcoming analyses of time series even more exciting results especially about range shifts can be expected. Implementing the protocol in more mountain regions globally would help to generate a more complete picture of how global change alters species distributions. This would inform conservation policy in mountain ecosystems, where some conservation policies remain poorly implemented.",,,,,"10.22541/au.162219027.79625324/v1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/513571","en","Authorea",,,,"Think globally, measure locally: The MIREN standardized protocol for monitoring species distributions along elevation gradients",,"Working Paper","Metadata only",,,,"2021-11-04T10:31:34Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Authorea",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To gain insight into the evolutionary history of the S. acaulis species complex, we examined genetic variation in 1,421 individuals from 148 populations across nearly the entire distribution range using a dense SNP dataset derived from ddRADseq. We used complementary approaches including genome size estimation, common garden phenotyping, sex system investigations and edaphic adaption analysis to develop a deeper understanding of the species complex. To infer non-recombining sex chromosome regions and provide some more details on the different sex-system observed within the species complex (gynodioecious, trioecious and dioecious), we de novo assembled the 1.5 Gb genome of dioecious S. exscapa using PacBio sequencing and optical mapping. Our results provide novel insights into the evolution of the Silene acaulis species complex. It consists of at least six evolutionary lineages that exhibit differences in genetic composition, morphology, sex system, and edaphic preferences.

However, how different kinds of GHGs respond to various warming magnitudes remains largely unclear, especially in the cold regions that are more sensitive to climate warming. Here, we concurrently measured carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes and their total balance in an alpine meadow in response to three levels of warming (ambient, +1.5 °C, +3.0 °C). We found warming-induced increases in CH4 uptake, decreases in N2O emissions and increases in CO2 emissions at the annual basis. Expressed as CO2-equivalents with a global warming potential of 100 years (GWP100), the enhancement of CH4 uptake and reduction of N2O emissions offset only 9% of the warming-induced increase in CO2 emissions for 1.5 °C warming, and only 7% for 3.0 °C warming. CO2 emissions were strongly stimulated, leading to a significantly positive feedback to climate system, for 3.0 °C warming but less for 1.5 °C warming. The warming with 3.0 °C altered the total GHG balance mainly by stimulating CO2 emissions in the non-growing season due to warmer soil temperatures, longer unfrozen period, and increased soil water content. The findings provide an empirical evidence that warming beyond global 2 °C target can trigger a positive GHG-climate feedback and highlight the contribution from non-growing season to this positive feedback loop in cold ecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier",,,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144559","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465837","en","Elsevier",,,"CO2 emission||Cold ecosystem||Greenhouse gas balance","Increased CO2 emissions surpass reductions of non-CO2 emissions more under higher experimental warming in an alpine meadow",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-27T06:30:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85099522583",,"000626618100043","Sci.

The relative contribution of each process to the overall dissemination of carbapenem resistance in hospitals remains poorly understood. Here, we used mechanistic models combining epidemiological data from more than 9,000 patients with whole genome sequence information from 250 enterobacteria clones to characterize the dissemination routes of a pOXA-48-like carbapenemase-encoding plasmid in a hospital setting over a 2-yr period. Our results revealed frequent between-patient transmission of high-risk pOXA-48-carrying clones, mostly of Klebsiella pneumoniae and sporadically Escherichia coli. The results also identified pOXA-48 dissemination hotspots within the hospital, such as specific wards and individual rooms within wards. Using high-resolution plasmid sequence analysis, we uncovered the pervasive within-patient transfer of pOXA-48, suggesting that horizontal plasmid transfer occurs in the gut of virtually every colonized patient.

Antagonistic pleiotropy or differential resource allocation among life-history traits can constrain pathogen adaptation. However, we lack understanding of how the genetic architecture of individual traits can generate trade-offs. Here, we report a large-scale study based on 145 global strains of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici from four continents. We measured 50 life-history traits, including virulence and reproduction on 12 different wheat hosts and growth responses to several abiotic stressors. To elucidate the genetic basis of adaptation, we used genome-wide association mapping coupled with genetic correlation analyses. We show that most traits are governed by polygenic architectures and are highly heritable suggesting that adaptation proceeds mainly through allele frequency shifts at many loci. We identified negative genetic correlations among traits related to host colonization and survival in stressful environments. Such genetic constraints indicate that pleiotropic effects could limit the pathogen's ability to cause host damage. In contrast, adaptation to abiotic stress factors was likely facilitated by synergistic pleiotropy. Our study illustrates how comprehensive mapping of life-history trait architectures across diverse environments allows to predict evolutionary trajectories of pathogens confronted with environmental perturbations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000467406","1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-020-00859-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/467406","en","London","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Fungi||Molecular evolution||Plant sciences||Population genetics","Mapping the adaptive landscape of a major agricultural pathogen reveals evolutionary constraints across heterogeneous environments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-03T03:40:53Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85100119449",,"000608003100009","ISME J","5","The ISME Journal","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Anthropogenic disturbance is also key in facilitating invasion success through changes in biotic and abiotic conditions, but the combined effect of these two factors in natural environments is understudied.  To better understand this interaction, we investigated how disturbance and its interaction with mycorrhizas could impact range dynamics of nonnative plant species in the mountains of Norway. Therefore, we studied the root colonisation and community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in disturbed vs undisturbed plots along mountain roads.  We found that roadside disturbance strongly increases fungal diversity and richness while also promoting AM fungal root colonisation in an otherwise ecto‐mycorrhiza and ericoid‐mycorrhiza dominated environment. Surprisingly, AM fungi associating with nonnative plant species were present across the whole elevation gradient, even above the highest elevational limit of nonnative plants, indicating that mycorrhizal fungi are not currently limiting the upward movement of nonnative plants.  We conclude that roadside disturbance has a positive effect on AM fungal colonisation and richness, possibly supporting the spread of nonnative plants, but that there is no absolute limitation of belowground mutualists, even at high elevation.",,,"0028-646X||1469-8137",,"10.1111/nph.16954","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450902","en","Wiley",,,"Anthropogenic disturbance||Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi||Elevation gradient||Plant invasion||Range shifts||Roads||Soil microbiota||Sub-Arctic","The role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in nonnative plant invasion along mountain roads",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-11-12T03:40:45Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Novel`interactions and species’ responses to climate change||Ecological consequences of novel plant-soil interactions under changing climate","678841||176044","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF","H2020||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85094660771",,"000583529600001","New Phytol.","3","New Phytologist","230","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it is unclear whether medical application of honey results in the evolution of bacterial honey resistance and whether this has collateral effects on other bacterial traits such as antibiotic resistance. Here, we used single-step screening assays and serial transfer at increasing concentrations to isolate honey-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli. We only detected bacteria with consistently increased resistance to the honey they evolved in for two of the four tested honey products, and the observed increases were small (maximum twofold increase in IC90). Genomic sequencing and experiments with single-gene knockouts showed a key mechanism by which bacteria increased their honey resistance was by mutating genes involved in detoxifying methylglyoxal, which contributes to the antibacterial activity of Leptospermum honeys. Crucially, we found no evidence that honey adaptation conferred cross-resistance or collateral sensitivity against nine antibiotics from six different classes. These results reveal constraints on bacterial adaptation to different types of honey, improving our ability to predict downstream consequences of wider honey application in medicine.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000485480","1752-4571||1752-4563",,"10.1111/eva.13200","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/485480","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Anti-bacterial agents||Bacteria||Communicable diseases||Escherichia coli||Honey||Leptospermum||Microbial drug resistance","Evolution of honey resistance in experimental populations of bacteria depends on the type of honey and has no major side effects for antibiotic susceptibility",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-20T14:11:56Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"The role of bacteria-virus interactions in antimicrobial resistance","165803","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85102239927",,"000626930500001","Evol.

Diversification of host–parasite interactions is frequently studied in the context of intrinsically selective coevolution, but the potential for host–parasite interaction phenotypes to diversify latently during parasite-blind host evolution is rarely considered. Here, we use a social bacterium experimentally adapted to several environments in the absence of phage to analyse allopatric diversification of host quality—the degree to which a host population supports a viral epidemic. Phage-blind evolution reduced host quality overall, with some bacteria becoming completely resistant to growth suppression by phage. Selective-environment differences generated only mild divergence in host quality. However, selective environments nonetheless played a major role in shaping evolution by determining the degree of stochastic diversification among replicate populations within treatments. Ancestral motility genotype was also found to strongly shape patterns of latent host-quality evolution and diversification. These outcomes show that (i) adaptive landscapes can differ in how they constrain stochastic diversification of a latent phenotype and (ii) major effects of selection on biological diversification can be missed by focusing on trait means. Collectively, our findings suggest that latent-phenotype evolution should inform host–parasite evolution theory and that diversification should be conceived broadly to include latent phenotypes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488361","0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2021.0456","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488361","en","Royal Society of London","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","adaptive landscape||bacteriophages||byproduct evolution||cryptic genetic variation||pleiotropy||phenotypic plasticity","Hidden paths to endless forms most wonderful: parasite-blind diversification of host quality",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-05T02:27:02Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85105101943",,"000645596700004","Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1949","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","288","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Inoculation of the gut microbiota with immobilized or planktonic Lactiplantibacillus plantarum NZ3400, a derivative of the probiotic model strain WCFS1, led to successful colonization.

Combined addition of the reference strain NZ3400 and each of those mutants to the gut microbiota resulted in increased abundance of the corresponding mutant in PolyFermS microbiota after 10 days, showing the beneficial nature of these mutations.

Studies of population genetic structure and reproductive mode are necessary to make predictions of the evolutionary potential of the pathogen. Sources of resistance to PTM have been found in Iranian landraces, which may have the potential to improve plant breeding efforts. However, little is known about the population genetic structure of this fungus in Iran. In this study, we analysed the frequency of the mating type genes to assess the potential for sexual mating of PTM collected from four provinces—Khuzestan, Hamadan, Golestan, and East Azerbaijan—and we investigated the population genetic structure using seven simple sequence repeat markers. High genotype diversity, linkage equilibrium, and equal ratios of mating types frequencies in the PTM populations at Khuzestan and Hamadan support the occurrence of sexual reproduction in these populations, while in Golestan and East Azerbaijan populations, significant gametic disequilibrium and relatively low genotype diversity suggest a higher incidence of clonality or different demographic histories. Unequal mating type frequencies in Golestan confirm a predominance of asexual reproduction. Finally, we found significant evidence for strong population structure with most of the genetic variation represented within regional populations (89%). Overall, our study provides evidence for high genetic variation in Iranian PTM populations, which may be the basis for rapid adaptive evolution in this pathosystem.

Anticipated warming is expected to change the hydrology of these systems due to increased meltwater and reduction of ice cover, with implications for environmental conditions and physical connectivity between habitats. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we evaluated microbial mat and planktonic communities within a connected freshwater system in the McMurdo Wright Valley, Antarctica, to determine the roles of connectivity and habitat conditions in controlling microbial assemblage composition. We examined communities from glacial Lake Brownworth, the perennially ice-covered Lake Vanda and the Onyx River, which connects the two. In Lake Vanda, we found distinct microbial assemblages occupying sub-habitats at different lake depths, while the communities from Lake Brownworth and Onyx River were structurally similar. Despite the higher physical connectivity and dispersal opportunities between bacterial communities in the shallow parts of the system, environmental abiotic conditions dominated over dispersal in driving community structure. Functional metabolic pathway predictions suggested differences in the functional gene potential between the microbial mat communities located in shallower and deeper water depths. The findings suggest that increasing temperatures and meltwater due to future climate change will affect bacterial diversity and functioning in Antarctic freshwater ecosystems.",,,"0168-6496||1574-6941",,"10.1093/femsec/fiab044","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478758","en","Oxford University Press",,,"biofilm||bacterioplankton||freshwater||6S rRNA gene||McMurdo Dry Valleys||Antarctica","Importance of environmental factors over habitat connectivity in shaping bacterial communities in microbial mats and bacterioplankton in an Antarctic freshwater system",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-04-15T02:58:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85103801389",,"000644508800021","FEMS microbiol. ecol.","4","FEMS Microbiology Ecology","97","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Mixed infections can have significant, though often unpredictable, consequences for overall virulence, pathogen transmission and evolution. However, effects of mixed infection on disease development in plants often remain unclear and the critical factors that determine the outcome of mixed infections remain unknown. The fungus Zymoseptoria tritici forms genetically diverse infections in wheat fields. Here, for a range of pathogen traits, we experimentally decompose the infection process to determine how the outcomes and consequences of mixed infections are mechanistically realized. Different strains of Z. tritici grow in close proximity and compete in the wheat apoplast, resulting in reductions in growth of individual strains and in pathogen reproduction. We observed different outcomes of competition at different stages of the infection. Overall, more virulent strains had higher competitive ability during host colonization, and less virulent strains had higher transmission potential. We showed that within-host competition can have a major effect on infection dynamics and pathogen population structure in a pathogen and host genotype-specific manner. Consequently, mixed infections likely have a major effect on the development of septoria tritici blotch epidemics and the evolution of virulence in Z. tritici.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000481845","1462-2912||1462-2920",,"10.1111/1462-2920.15417","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/481845","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Mixed infections alter transmission potential in a fungal plant pathogen",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-01T05:19:47Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85100976311",,"000619215900001","Environ. microbiol.","4","Environmental Microbiology","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The wide range of TE content observed in fungal genomes reflects diverse efficacy of host-genome defense mechanisms that can counter-balance TE expansion and spread. Closely related species can harbor drastically different TE repertoires. The evolution of fungal effectors, which are crucial determinants of pathogenicity, has been linked to the activity of TEs in pathogen genomes. Here, we describe how TEs have shaped genome evolution of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici and four closely related species. We compared de novo TE annotations and repeat-induced point mutation signatures in 26 genomes from the Zymoseptoria species-complex. Then, we assessed the relative insertion ages of TEs using a comparative genomics approach. Finally, we explored the impact of TE insertions on genome architecture and plasticity. The 26 genomes of Zymoseptoria species reflect different TE dynamics with a majority of recent insertions. TEs associate with accessory genome compartments, with chromosomal rearrangements, with gene presence/absence variation, and with effectors in all Zymoseptoria species. We find that the extent of RIP-like signatures varies among Z. tritici genomes compared to genomes of the sister species. The detection of a reduction of RIP-like signatures and TE recent insertions in Z. tritici reflects ongoing but still moderate TE mobility.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494922","2160-1836",,"10.1093/g3journal/jkab068","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494922","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","transposable elements||effectors||genome architecture||Zymoseptoria tritici||repeat-induced point mutations||genome plasticity","Dynamics of transposable elements in recently diverged fungal pathogens: lineage-specific transposable element content and efficiency of genome defenses",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T10:31:14Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000651852100032","G3","4","G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In principle, variation in R:FR can also convey ecologically relevant information about host proximity or architecture. Here, we demonstrate that the parasitic vine Cuscuta epilinum Weihe (Convolvulaceae) can distinguish fine-scale differences in R:FR associated with differences in the proximity and shape of potential host plants. We conducted dual-choice experiments by placing parasite seedlings between targets, including low R:FR fields manipulated via LED lighting and pairs of model plants exhibiting realistic R and FR reflectance but differing in proximity or shape. Seedlings consistently distinguished between low-R:FR fields of differing intensity. Furthermore, they exhibited preferences for nearer plant models versus identical models placed 4 cm further away and between same-sized models exhibiting shape differences. Our results indicate that parasites can discriminate minute differences in R:FR signatures corresponding to host factors (proximity and shape) that impact seedling survival. This keen sensory ability underpins the parasite's sophisticated foraging behaviour and highlights the broader importance of light cues in plant ecology.",,,"0140-7791||1365-3040",,"10.1111/pce.13967","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458707","en","Wiley",,,"Cuscuta||parasite host location||plant architecture||plant senses||R:FR","A plant parasite uses light cues to detect differences in host-plant proximity and architecture",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-12-30T03:42:01Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85097557761",,"000599096000001","Plant cell environ.","4","Plant, Cell & Environment","44","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Human visitors are associated with the unintended dispersal of weeds, seeds and pathogens across ecological communities. With the increasing popularity of nature‐based tourism, access to protected areas has increased, in turn increasing the risks of unintended dispersal of exotic species to these areas. 2. Here, we assess the potential contribution of both international and domestic visitors travelling within New Zealand to the spread of exotic species. To get an overview of the visitors’ travelling patterns across the country, we constructed visitation networks at two spatial scales—a regional scale (which is a coarse scale) and a local territorial scale (which is a finer scale). 3. We then used a Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Model to identify characteristic groups of visitors and places based on the similarities of the visitors’ travelling patterns across the country. Overall, we found that there are 10 characteristic groups of visitors travelling to 12 characteristic groups of places at the regional scale and 6 characteristic groups of visitors travelling to 6 characteristic groups of places at the territorial scale. 4. The resulting characteristic travelling patterns of the visitors across New Zealand further allowed us to estimate the different visitor groups’ likelihood to travel to protected areas. Overall, we found that some visitor groups are much more likely than others to travel to protected areas of high protection status, at both spatial scales. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for human behaviour—that is, understanding how visitors travel to places—when assessing human‐mediated dispersal. More specifically, we illustrate how to assess the relative contribution of a potential vector dispersing exotic species based on their travelling patterns—especially in cases where the target exotic species are not yet identified or when there is limited information regarding the dispersal routes of exotic species and their potential vectors. As a result, our work offers a holistic perspective on human‐mediated dispersal of exotic species. Moreover, it provides a potential baseline against which both field biologists and practitioners can identify areas that would benefit from further investigation to better understand invasion processes in their focal systems.",,,"0021-8901||1365-2664",,"10.1111/1365-2664.13829","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478126","en","British Ecological Society",,,"biological invasion||ecological management||human behaviour||invasion risk||Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Model||risk assessment||travelling pattern||visitation networks","Assessing unintended human‐mediated dispersal using visitation networks",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-04-11T02:57:02Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85101955398",,"000625816800001","J.

We compared E. solidaginis males and females, focusing on sexually dimorphic structures that are known to be involved in pheromone production in other tephritid species. Morphological and chemical analyses indicated that the rectum and pleural epidermis are involved in male E. solidaginis pheromone production, storage, or emission. We detected large quantities of pheromone in the enlarged rectum, suggesting that it stores pheromone for subsequent release through the anus. However, pheromone might also discharge through the pleural cuticle with the involvement of unusual pleural attachments of the tergosternal muscles, which, when contracted in males, realign specialized cuticular surface elements and expose less-sclerotized areas of cuticle. In males, pheromone components were also detected in epidermal cells of the pleuron. These cells were 60–100 times larger in mature males than in females and, to our knowledge, are the largest animal epithelial cells ever recorded. Furthermore, because these large cells in males are multinucleated, we presume that they develop through somatic polyploidization by endomitosis. Consequently, the pheromone-associated multinuclear pleural epidermal cells of Eurosta solidaginis may provide an interesting new system for understanding polyploidization. © 2021 Elsevier",,,"0022-1910||1879-1611",,"10.1016/j.jinsphys.2021.104210","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473496","en","Elsevier",,,"1-Nonanol||Bulbulate cuticle||Conophthorin||Gland||Pheromone emission||Rectum","Giant polyploid epidermal cells and male pheromone production in the tephritid fruit fly Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae)",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-03-09T06:04:02Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85101714338",,"000641044400010","J Insect Physiol",,"Journal of Insect Physiology","130","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this Perspective, we draw on emerging ecological theory to illustrate how changes in resource niche overlap can be equally important as changes in competitive ability for understanding costs of resistance and the persistence of resistant pathogens in microbial communities. We then show how different temporal patterns of resource and antibiotic supply, alongside trade-offs in competitive ability at high and low resource concentrations, can have diametrically opposing consequences for the coexistence and exclusion of resistant and susceptible strains.

We develop a population dynamic model that predicts that priming delays the clearance of infections and fuels the evolution of resistance. The effects we describe should apply to many AMPs and other drugs that target the cell surface. The optimal strategy to tackle tolerant or persistent cells requires high concentrations of AMPs and fast and long-lasting expression.

In the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, susceptibility of the resident microbial community to invasion by pathogens has important implications for host health. However, at the community level, it is unclear whether susceptibility to invasion depends mostly on resident community composition (which microbes are present), or also on local abiotic conditions (such as nutrient status). Here, we used a gut microcosm system to disentangle some of the drivers of susceptibility to invasion in microbial communities sampled from humans. We found resident microbial communities inhibited an invading Escherichia coli strain, compared to community-free control treatments, sometimes excluding the invader completely (colonization resistance). These effects were stronger at later time points, when we also detected altered community composition and nutrient availability. By separating these two components (microbial community and abiotic environment), we found taxonomic composition played a crucial role in suppressing invasion, but this depended critically on local abiotic conditions (adapted communities were more suppressive in nutrient-depleted conditions). This helps predict when resident communities will be most susceptible to invasion, with implications for optimizing treatments based on microbiota management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000485484","0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2020.3106","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/485484","en","The Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Gut microbiome||Colonization resistance||Competition||Community interactions","Microbial community composition interacts with local abiotic conditions to drive colonization resistance in human gut microbiome samples",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-20T14:15:35Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"The role of bacteria-virus interactions in antimicrobial resistance","165803","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85103433704",,"000632988100019","Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1947","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","288","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We use this framework to study resistance evolution and spread implementing epidemiological population dynamics for treatment, transmission, and patient admission and discharge, as may be observed in hospitals. We perform massively parallel experimental evolution over up to 40 d and complement this with a computational model to infer the underlying population-dynamical parameters.

To unravel the chestnut blight invasion of southeastern Europe, we sequenced 230 genomes of predominantly European strains. Genotypes outside of the invasion zone showed high levels of diversity with evidence for frequent and ongoing recombination. The invasive lineage emerged from the highly diverse European genotype pool rather than a secondary introduction from Asia or North America. The expansion across southeastern Europe was mostly clonal and is dominated by a single mating type, suggesting a fitness advantage of asexual reproduction.

Here we analyze viral genome sequences using a phylodynamic model with geographic structure to estimate the origin and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe prior to border closures. Based on SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reconstruct a partial transmission tree of the early pandemic and coinfer the geographic location of ancestral lineages as well as the number of migration events into and between European regions. We find that the predominant lineage spreading in Europe during this time has a most recent common ancestor in Italy and was probably seeded by a transmission event in either Hubei, China or Germany. We do not find evidence for preferential migration paths from Hubei into different European regions or from each European region to the others. Sustained local transmission is first evident in Italy and then shortly thereafter in the other European regions considered. Before the first border closures in Europe, we estimate that the rate of occurrence of new cases from within-country transmission was within the bounds of the estimated rate of new cases from migration. In summary, our analysis offers a view on the early state of the epidemic in Europe and on migration patterns of the virus before border closures. This information will enable further study of the necessity and timeliness of border closures. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000473483","0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2012008118","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473483","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","SARS-CoV-2||transmission||disease import||phylogeography","The origin and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-08T16:50:39Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Real-time monitoring of COVID-19 transmission through phylodynamics","196267","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Special Call on Coronaviruses",,,,"85101475513",,,"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","9","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","118","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Why dioecious taxa are so rare is still an open question. Early work reported lower species richness in dioecious compared with nondioecious sister clades, raising the hypothesis that dioecy may be an evolutionary dead-end. This hypothesis has been recently challenged by macroevolutionary analyses that detected no or even positive effect of dioecy on diversification. However, the possible genetic consequences of dioecy at the population level, which could drive the long-term fate of dioecious lineages, have not been tested so far. Here, we used a population genomics approach in the Silene genus to look for possible effects of dioecy, especially for potential evidence of evolutionary handicaps of dioecy underlying the dead-end hypothesis. We collected individual-based RNA-seq data from several populations in 13 closely related species with different sexual systems: seven dioecious, three hermaphroditic, and three gynodioecious species. We show that dioecy is associated with increased genetic diversity, as well as higher selection efficacy both against deleterious mutations and for beneficial mutations. The results hold after controlling for phylogenetic inertia, differences in species census population sizes and geographic ranges. We conclude that dioecious Silene species neither show signs of increased mutational load nor genetic evidence for extinction risk. We discuss these observations in the light of the possible demographic differences between dioecious and self-compatible hermaphroditic species and how this could be related to alternatives to the dead-end hypothesis to explain the rarity of dioecy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000476678","0737-4038||1537-1719",,"10.1093/molbev/msaa229","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/476678","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","sexual systems||selection efficacy||Allee effect||population genetics||RNA-seq||angiosperms","Dioecy Is Associated with High Genetic Diversity and Adaptation Rates in the Plant Genus Silene",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-28T21:54:01Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85100100202",,"000651826600006","Mol Biol Evol","3","Molecular Biology and Evolution","38","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Acrolein reacts with dietary carcinogenic heterocyclic amines (HCA), reducing HCA mutagenicity, but is itself also an antimicrobial agent and toxicant. Gut microbial GDH activity has been suggested as an endogenous acrolein source; however, there is limited information on the potential of the intestinal microbiota to have GDH activity, and what impact it can have on the intestinal ecosystem and host health. We hypothesized that GDH activity of gut microbiota is determined by the abundance and distribution of GDH‐active taxa and can be enhanced by supplementation of the GDH active Anaerobutyricum hallii, and tested this hypothesis combining quantitative profiling of gdh, model batch fermentations, microbiota manipulation, and kinetic modelling of acrolein formation. Our results suggest that GDH activity is a common trait of intestinal microbiota shared by a few taxa, which was dependent on overall gdh abundance. Anaerobutyricum hallii was identified as a key taxon in GDH metabolism, and its supplementation increased the rate of GDH activity and acrolein release, which enhanced the transformation of HCA and reduced fermentation activity. The findings of this first systematic study on acrolein release by intestinal microbiota indicate that dietary and microbial modulation might impact GDH activity, which may influence host health. © 2021 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,"1462-2912||1462-2920",,"10.1111/1462-2920.15431","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/471535","en","Wiley",,,"Acrolein||Propionate||Glycerol/diol dehydratase||Reuterin||Anaerobutyricum hallii||Glycerol metabolism","Impact of manipulation of glycerol/diol dehydratase activity on intestinal microbiota ecology and metabolism",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-02-24T17:12:31Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85102415370",,"000628889900001","Environ. microbiol.","3","Environmental Microbiology","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02070 - Dep.

We provide evidence for how Brazil nut genetic resources are negatively affected by forest degradation and discuss the consequences of this for reproductive success. To avoid negative effects of genetic erosion and inbreeding, we discuss the need to cease large‐scale forest conversion and to promote landscape connectivity. This could support gene flow, maintain genetic diversity across individuals reproducing in clustered patterns and contribute to securing the long‐termed reproductive viability and resilience of this high socio‐economically and ecologically valuable species.  Summary -     Ecosystem degradation in the Amazon drives this biodiverse rainforest toward an ecological tipping point. Sustainable management and restoration of degraded rainforest therein are central to counteract this crisis. One hyperdominant, keystone species of high ecological and socio‐economic value, the Brazil nut tree, offers additional benefits as a major carbon sink and a nutritional source of the most prominent globally traded non‐timber forest product.  -     Despite Brazil nut trees being protected by conservation regulation, forest degradation threatens sufficient gene‐flow among Brazil nut tree populations. This has impacts on the reproductive success, genetic diversity, and consequently on the resilience of this species to environmental change.  -     We used 13 microsatellite loci to explore the consequences of forest degradation on the reduction in genetic diversity of Brazil nut populations. We examined the clustering of genetically related individuals as fine‐scale genetic structure (FSGS) and the variation in genetic diversity and inbreeding across adult trees and seedlings along a categorized forest‐degradation gradient ranging from conserved to degraded areas. In addition, we applied direct and indirect approaches to estimate contemporary pollen‐mediated gene flow.  -     We found significant levels of FSGS, comparable to other similar tropical tree species. Brazil nut seedlings had consistently lower genetic diversity and higher inbreeding than adults, significantly associated with the degree of forest degradation of their origin. We observed limited pollen dispersal, differential patterns in pollen heterogeneity, and disproportionate paternal‐assignment rates from few individuals shaping the effective population size in our dataset. We discuss how this evidence for reproduction vulnerability may affect the genetic resources and undermine the resilience of this ecological and socio‐economic system in Peru.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450986","2572-2611",,"10.1002/ppp3.10166","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450986","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Brazil nut||fine-scale genetic structure||genetic diversity||habitat degradation||inbreeding||non-timber forest product||pollen gene flow||sustainable forest management","Genetic threats to the Forest Giants of the Amazon: Habitat degradation effects on the socio‐economically important Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-12T10:45:38Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85106180149",,"000683464100010",,"2","Plants, People, Planet","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the relative contributions of factors that underlie the spread of plasmids and their roles in conjugation in vivo are unclear. To address this, we investigated the spread of clinical Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producing plasmids in the absence of antibiotics in vitro and in the mouse intestine. We hypothesised that plasmid properties would be the primary determinants of plasmid spread and that bacterial strain identity would also contribute. We found clinical Escherichia coli strains natively associated with ESBL-plasmids conjugated to three distinct E. coli strains and one Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain. Final transconjugant frequencies varied across plasmid, donor, and recipient combinations, with qualitative consistency when comparing transfer in vitro and in vivo in mice. In both environments, transconjugant frequencies for these natural strains and plasmids covaried with the presence/absence of transfer genes on ESBL-plasmids and were affected by plasmid incompatibility. By moving ESBL-plasmids out of their native hosts, we showed that donor and recipient strains also modulated transconjugant frequencies. This suggests that plasmid spread in the complex gut environment of animals and humans can be predicted based on in vitro testing and genetic data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000451923","1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-020-00819-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/451923","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Antibiotics||Microbial ecology||Phylogenomics","Plasmid- and strain-specific factors drive variation in ESBL-plasmid spread in vitro and in vivo",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-19T03:49:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Towards quantification of the contribution of plasmids to the spread of antibiotic resistance","167121||167121","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","NFP 70: Gesuch",,,,"85094965605",,"000585771000001","ISME J","3","The ISME Journal","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02030 - Dep.

Strains of the plant pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici appeared to lack cytosine DNA methylation (5mC) because gene amplification followed by Repeat-Induced Point mutation (RIP) resulted in the inactivation of the dim2 DNA methyltransferase gene. 5mC is, however, present in closely related sister species. We demonstrate that inactivation of dim2 occurred recently as some Z. tritici isolates carry a functional dim2 gene. Moreover, we show that dim2 inactivation occurred by a different path than previously hypothesized. We mapped the genome-wide distribution of 5mC in strains with or without functional dim2 alleles. Presence of functional dim2 correlates with high levels of 5mC in transposable elements (TEs), suggesting a role in genome defense. We identified low levels of 5mC in strains carrying non-functional dim2 alleles, suggesting that 5mC is maintained over time, presumably by an active Dnmt5 DNA methyltransferase. Integration of a functional dim2 allele in strains with mutated dim2 restored normal 5mC levels, demonstrating de novo cytosine methylation activity of Dim2. To assess the importance of 5mC for genome evolution, we performed an evolution experiment, comparing genomes of strains with high levels of 5mC to genomes of strains lacking functional dim2. We found that presence of a functional dim2 allele alters nucleotide composition by promoting C to T transitions (C→T) specifically at CpA (CA) sites during mitosis, likely contributing to TE inactivation. Our results show that 5mC density at TEs is a polymorphic trait in Z. tritici populations that can impact genome evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000591921","1553-7390||1553-7404",,"10.1371/journal.pgen.1009448","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591921","en","PLOS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","DNA methylation||Genomics||Methylation||Fungal genomics||Mutation||Point mutation||Fungal evolution||Genetic loci","Recent loss of the Dim2 DNA methyltransferase decreases mutation rate in repeats and changes evolutionary trajectory in a fungal pathogen",,"Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2023-01-12T09:54:07Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,"97819830",,,,,"PLoS Genet","3","PLoS Genetics","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The latter two taxa are self-compatible but are thought to self-fertilize at different rates, given their distinct manifestations of the morphological “selfing syndrome.” Based on experimental crossings and transcriptome sequencing of a total of 39 different genotypes from as many accessions representing each species’ geographic range, we provide compelling evidence for deep genealogical divisions within S. arcanum; only the self-incompatible lineage known as “var. marañón” has close genealogical ties to the two self-compatible species. Moreover, there is evidence under multiple inference schemes for different geographic subsets of S. arcanum var. marañón being closest to S. chmielewskii and S. neorickii, respectively.

For consumers, nutritional variation of juvenile diets is probably associated with plasticity in developmental rates, but little is known about how diet quality can affect phenotypic trajectories in ways that might influence survival to maturity and lifetime reproductive output. Here, we tested how the diet quality of a freshwater detritivorous isopod (Asellus aquaticus), in terms of elemental ratios of diet (i.e. carbon : nitrogen : phosphorus; C : N : P), can affect (i) developmental rates of body size and pigmentation and (ii) variation in juvenile survival. We reared 1047 individuals, in a full-sib split-family design (29 families), on either a high- (low C : P, C : N) or low-quality (high C : P, C : N) diet, and quantified developmental trajectories of body size and pigmentation for every individual over 12 weeks. Our diet contrast caused strong divergence in the developmental rates of pigmentation but not growth, culminating in a distribution of adult pigmentation spanning the broad range of phenotypes observed both within and among natural populations. Under low-quality diet, we found highest survival at intermediate growth and pigmentation rates. By contrast, survival under high-quality diet survival increased continuously with pigmentation rate, with longest lifespans at intermediate growth rates and high pigmentation rates. Building on previous work which suggests that visual predation mediates the evolution of cryptic pigmentation in A. aquaticus, our study shows how diet quality and composition can generate substantial phenotypic variation by affecting rates of growth and pigmentation during development in the absence of predation.",,,"0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2020.3136","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526076","en","The Royal Society",,,"Development||Stoichiometry||Fitness||Life history||Phenotypic plasticity||Diet quality","Dietary-based developmental plasticity affects juvenile survival in an aquatic detritivore",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-01-17T08:02:33Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1945","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","288","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Trends in species abundances predicted from meta-analyses and species distribution models will be misleading if they depend on the conditions of individuals. Here we find from a synthesis of tree species in North America that climate-condition interactions dominate responses through two pathways, i) effects of growth that depend on climate, and ii) effects of climate that depend on tree size. Because tree fecundity first increases and then declines with size, climate change that stimulates growth promotes a shift of small trees to more fecund sizes, but the opposite can be true for large sizes. Change the depresses growth also affects fecundity. We find a biogeographic divide, with these interactions reducing fecundity in the West and increasing it in the East. Continental-scale responses of these forests are thus driven largely by indirect effects, recommending management for climate change that considers multiple demographic rates.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529225","2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-020-20836-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529225","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Continent-wide tree fecundity driven by indirect climate effects",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-27T13:19:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85101394022",,"000623781900016","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

If climate continues to change as anticipated, increasing drought may affect the composition and structure of many subtropical forests. Understanding the environmental conditions that determine drought sensitivity across subtropical ecosystems and trees species will help accurately predict their response to climate change and inform the best mitigation and protection strategies. To identify the broad-scale drivers of drought sensitivity, we collected a large network of ring-width chronologies along a broad climate gradient that spans from east to west of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau (YGP), in southwestern China. Our network includes growth data from 10 trees species in 28 old growth subtropical coniferous sites. We used tree ring analyses, Redundancy Analysis (RDA), and linear mixed effects models to assess how drought responses varied geographically, climatically, and taxonomically. We found that aridity exerted the strongest limitation in our study area, implying that subtropical forest responses to drought may be more complex than commonly assumed. Moreover, we found that drought intensity during dry season, proxied by aridity index, is a stronger driver of drought sensitivity than stand characteristics and microenvironment. Further increases in drought frequency and dry season drought intensity in the region associated with climate change may pose a larger-than-expected threat to the growth, and ultimately persistence, of many subtropical coniferous forests.",,,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118841","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/525785","en","Elsevier",,,"Climate gradient||Dry season||Drought||Subtropical coniferous forests||Southwest China||Tree rings","Increasing climate sensitivity of subtropical conifers along an aridity gradient",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-01-14T15:31:26Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For.

Because multiple taxa have evolved such mutualisms, it must be assumed that, under certain ecological circumstances, natural selection has favoured them over those relying upon endogenous antifungal compound production. Further, such associations have been shown to persist versus specific pathogenic fungal antagonists for more than 50 million years, suggesting that compounds employed have retained efficacy in spite of the pathogens' capacity to develop resistance.

Three modules, each incorporating both positive and negative associations, were overrepresented, thus acting as ""network motifs."" Furthermore, the overrepresentation of these network motifs is positively linked to species diversity globally.

We therefore analyzed the distribution of cyanobacteria in 19 lakes belonging to three lake complexes and tested whether their seasonal dynamics are in line with the predictions of the PEG model. Furthermore, we investigated to which extent cyanobacteria diversity and abundance were related to lake hydrogeomorphological characteristics such as surface, water level, connectivity, water retention, flood risk, and transparency. Although lakes had different seasonal cyanobacterial assemblages, the biovolume and genus richness had a geographical pattern, decreasing from south-east (lakes forming the fluvial delta) towards north-west (lakes forming the maritime delta). Cyanobacteria biovolume reflected largely the PEG model peaking in summer (the fluvial delta) and autumn (the maritime delta). Genus richness followed the same pattern. Cyanobacteria distribution was predicted by various abiotic (e.g., risk of flooding, connectivity) and biotic factors (e.g., submersed macrophytes, phytoplankton diversity, peat deposits).

An earlier analysis of 179 isolates of Pyricularia oryzae Triticum lineage (PoTl) sampled from wheat fields across six populations in central-southern Brazil during 2012 discovered a high level of resistance to strobilurin fungicides. Here we analysed azole resistance in the same strains based on EC50 measurements for tebuconazole and epoxiconazole. All six Brazilian populations of PoTl exhibited high resistance to both azoles, with in vitro EC50 values that were at least 35 to 50 times higher than the recommended field doses. We sequenced the CYP51A and CYP51B genes to determine if they were likely to play a role in the observed azole resistance. Although we found five distinct haplotypes in PoTl carrying four nonsynonymous substitutions in CYP51A, none of these substitutions were correlated with elevated EC50. CYP51B was sequenced for nine PoTl isolates, three each representing low, medium, and high tebuconazole EC50. Both PoTl CYP51A and CYP51B could complement yeast CYP51 function. All PoTl CYP51A-expressing yeast transformants were less sensitive to triazoles than the PoTl CYP51B ones. Transformants expressing PoTl CYP51A haplotype H1 carrying the R158K substitution were not more resistant than those expressing PoTl CYP51A haplotype H5, which is synonymous to haplotype H6, found in triazole-sensitive P. oryzae Oryza isolates from rice blast. Therefore, the reduced triazole sensitivity of wheat blast isolates compared to rice blast isolates appears to be associated with a non-target-site related resistance mechanism acquired after higher exposure to triazoles.",,,"0032-0862||1365-3059",,"10.1111/ppa.13288","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450901","en","Wiley",,,"CYP51A||CYP51B||epoxiconazole||Pyricularia oryzae Oryza lineage||Pyricularia oryzae Triticum lineage||tebuconazole","Widespread distribution of resistance to triazole fungicides in Brazilian populations of the wheat blast pathogen",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-11-12T03:40:32Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85094167484",,"000583518000001","Plant pathol.","2","Plant Pathology","70","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Tolerance to oxidative stress is likely to make a significant contribution to the viability and pathogenicity of plant pathogens, but the complex network of oxidative stress responses hinders identification of the genes contributing to this trait. Here, we employed a forward genetic approach to investigate the genetic architecture of oxidative stress tolerance in the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of growth and melanization under axenic conditions in two cross-populations to identify genomic regions associated with tolerance to oxidative stress. We found that QTLs associated with growth under oxidative stress as well as inherent growth can affect oxidative stress tolerance, and we identified two uncharacterized genes in a major QTL associated with this trait. Our data suggest that melanization does not affect tolerance to oxidative stress, which differs from what was found for animal pathogens.

In microbes, an important mechanism of HGT is prophage acquisition (phage genomes integrated into bacterial chromosomes). Prophages can influence bacterial fitness via the transfer of beneficial genes (including antibiotic‐resistance genes, ARGs), protection from superinfecting phages, or switching to a lytic lifecycle that releases free phages infectious to competitors. We expect these effects to depend on environmental conditions because of, for example, environment‐dependent induction of the lytic lifecycle. However, it remains unclear how costs/benefits of prophages vary across environments. Here, studying prophages with/without ARGs in Escherichia coli, we disentangled the effects of prophages alone and adaptive genes they carry. In competition with prophage‐free strains, benefits from prophages and ARGs peaked in different environments. Prophages were most beneficial when induction of the lytic lifecycle was common, whereas ARGs were more beneficial upon antibiotic exposure and with reduced prophage induction. Acquisition of prophage‐encoded ARGs by competing strains was most common when prophage induction, and therefore free phages, were common. Thus, selection on prophages and adaptive genes they carry varies independently across environments, which is important for predicting the spread of mobile/integrating genetic elements and their role in evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000462593","0014-3820||1558-5646",,"10.1111/evo.14153","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462593","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Antibiotic resistance||Fitness||Lysogen||Mobile genetic elements||Prophage||Temperate phage","Fitness benefits to bacteria of carrying prophages and prophage‐encoded antibiotic‐resistance genes peak in different environments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-14T13:36:40Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85099041826",,"000605154200001","Evolution","2","Evolution","75","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, we lack a good understanding of the processes maintaining genetic variation and constraints on pathogen life‐history evolution. Here, we analysed interactions between 12 wheat host genotypes and 145 strains of Zymoseptoria tritici from five global populations to investigate the evolution and maintenance of variation in pathogen virulence and reproduction. We found a strong positive correlation between virulence (amount of leaf necrosis) and reproduction (pycnidia density within lesions), with substantial variation in both traits maintained within populations. On average, highly virulent isolates exhibited higher reproduction, which might increase transmission potential in agricultural fields planted to homogeneous hosts at a high density. We further showed that pathogen strains with a narrow host range (i.e. specialists) for reproduction were on average less virulent, and those with a broader host range (i.e. generalists) were on average less fecund on a given specific host. These costs associated with adaptation to different host genotypes might constrain the emergence of generalists by disrupting the directional evolution of virulence and fecundity. We conclude that selection favouring pathogen strains that are virulent across diverse hosts, coupled with selection that maximizes fecundity on specific hosts, may explain the maintenance of these pathogenicity traits within and among populations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000444935","1752-4571||1752-4563",,"10.1111/eva.13117","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444935","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Host specialization||Reproduction||Trade-off||Virulence||Wheat||Zymoseptoria tritici","Maintenance of variation in virulence and reproduction in populations of an agricultural plant pathogen",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-07T14:16:34Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091384723",,"000572156200001","Evol.

However, observing generation times-the time interval between the infection of an infector and an infectee in a transmission pair-requires data on infection times, which are generally unknown. The timing of symptom onset is more easily observed; generation times are therefore often estimated based on serial intervals-the time interval between symptom onset of an infector and an infectee. This estimation follows one of two approaches: (i) approximating the generation time distribution by the serial interval distribution or (ii) deriving the generation time distribution from the serial interval and incubation period-the time interval between infection and symptom onset in a single individual-distributions. These two approaches make different-and not always explicitly stated-assumptions about the relationship between infectiousness and symptoms, resulting in different generation time distributions with the same mean but unequal variances. Here, we clarify the assumptions that each approach makes and show that neither set of assumptions is plausible for most pathogens. However, the variances of the generation time distribution derived under each assumption can reasonably be considered as upper (approximation with serial interval) and lower (derivation from serial interval) bounds. Thus, we suggest a pragmatic solution is to use both approaches and treat these as edge cases in downstream analysis. We discuss the impact of the variance of the generation time distribution on the controllability of an epidemic through strategies based on contact tracing, and we show that underestimating this variance is likely to overestimate controllability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000465015","1742-5689||1742-5662",,"10.1098/rsif.2020.0756","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465015","en","The Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"On the relationship between serial interval, infectiousness profile and generation time",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-23T08:50:43Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Infectious disease dynamics: spread along contact networks and experimental evolution of antibiotic resistance","176401","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Exzellenzbeitrag in Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85099417155",,"000608009500001","J.

As invading organisms often encounter new habitats during colonization, they will experience novel selection pressures. Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus complex) have recently colonized large parts of Switzerland and are invasive in Lake Constance. Introduced to several watersheds roughly 150 years ago, they spread across the Swiss Plateau (400-800 m a.s.l.), bringing three divergent hitherto allopatric lineages into secondary contact. As stickleback have colonized a variety of different habitat types during this recent range expansion, the Swiss system is a useful model for studying contemporary evolution with and without secondary contact. For example, in the Lake Constance region there has been rapid phenotypic and genetic divergence between a lake population and some stream populations. There is considerable phenotypic variation within the lake population, with individuals foraging in and occupying littoral, offshore pelagic, and profundal waters, the latter of which is a very unusual habitat for stickleback. Furthermore, adults from the lake population can reach up to three times the size of adults from the surrounding stream populations, and are large by comparison to populations globally. Here, we review the historical origins of the threespine stickleback in Switzerland, and the ecomorphological variation and genomic basis of its invasion in Lake Constance. We also outline the potential ecological impacts of this invasion, and highlight the interest for contemporary evolution studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526087","2296-701X",,"10.3389/fevo.2020.611672","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526087","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","adaptive radiation||contemporary evolution||lake constance||invasive species||stickleback","Threespine Stickleback in Lake Constance: The Ecology and Genomic Substrate of a Recent Invasion",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-17T08:06:33Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite decades of research in chemical ecology, we still lack an understanding of the organization of plant chemical diversity across species and ecosystems. To address this challenge, we hypothesized that molecular diversity is not only related to species diversity, but also constrained by trophic, climatic, and topographical factors. We screened the metabolome of 416 vascular plant species encompassing the entire alpine elevation range and four alpine bioclimatic regions in order to characterize their phytochemical diversity. We show that by coupling phylogenetic information, topographic, edaphic, and climatic variables, we predict phytochemical diversity, and its inherent composition, of plant communities throughout landscape. Spatial mapping of phytochemical diversity further revealed that plant assemblages found in low to midelevation habitats, with more alkaline soils, possessed greater phytochemical diversity, whereas alpine habitats possessed higher phytochemical endemism. Altogether, we present a general tool that can be used for predicting hotspots of phytochemical diversity in the landscape, independently of plant species taxonomic identity. Such an approach offers promising perspectives in both drug discovery programs and conservation efforts worldwide.

However, we lack field assessments of how severe droughts could threaten the viability of many of these plantations, often located at xeric sites and lacking adaptive management measures such as thinning. In this work, we related radial-growth variability to recent defoliation, to evaluate the resilience and vulnerability of Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) plantations from xeric sites in south-eastern Spain to three recent droughts (1995, 2005, and 2012). Tree diameter and growth resistance after the most severe drought, which occurred in 1995, were positively related to growth. In addition, the current defoliation level, a proxy for tree vigor, was related to growth, decreasing as tree-to-tree competition increased. These findings indicate that increasing drought will reduce growth and increase the needle loss and mortality rate across many dense pine plantations in the Mediterranean Basin, suggesting that they are more prone to die. Thus, limited resilience of plantations may explain their higher defoliation and indicate that future severe droughts could lead to widespread dieback and high mortality at marginal sites. Therefore, if effective management is not implemented, warmer and drier conditions will likely threaten the viability of many of these drought-prone plantations and their ability to deliver key ecosystem services.",,,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118537","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/525790","en","Elsevier",,,"Climate change||Drought||Defoliation||Competition intensity||Radial growth||Pinus pinaster","High resilience, but low viability, of pine plantations in the face of a shift towards a drier climate",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2022-01-14T15:33:39Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For.

The lifestyle of these eukaryotic microbes drives rapid and ongoing adaptation by antagonistic selection leaving detectable patterns on relevant genes in the pathogens genomes. Furthermore, some fungal pathogens exhibit particular patterns of genome organization that are thought to further promote rapid evolutionary change. This thesis presents the comparative and population genomic analyses of two pathogenic sibling species of the genus Epichloe specialized on different host grasses: Epichloe typhina infecting Dactylis glomerata and Epichloe clarkii infecting Holcus lanatus. Using chromosome-level genome assemblies and an unprecedented sampling of seven sympatric population pairs, I investigated the genomic mechanisms, selected genes and dynamic processes underlying adaptive evolution of plant pathogenic fungi in natural ecosystems.  In the first chapter, the completed assemblies and annotations of reference genomes of the two fungal species are presented and the mechanisms that may have differentially shaped the genomes in their evolutionary past are discussed. I show that both genomes display a remarkable bipartite organization, so called two-speed genomes. A gene-rich core genome highly conserved between species was interspersed with blocks of repeat- rich sequence exhibiting an extensive signature of repeat-induced point mutation. This fungal specific defense against the proliferation of transposable elements in the genome generated divergent regions with a high AT-nucleotide content in the Epichloe genomes. While the core genomes were of similar size and gene content, these AT-rich regions made up half of the whole genome in E. clarkii but only a third in E. typhina, resulting in a large difference in genome size between the two species. The results from this chapter demonstrate how the rapid evolution of repeat structure can drive divergence between closely related taxa and highlight the evolutionary role of dynamic compartments in fungal genomes.   The second chapter investigates the genetic structure and diversity of Epichloe populations. I sampled seven population pairs of the two sibling species E. typhina and E. clarkii occurring sympatrically in natural grassland ecosystems across Western Europe. Whole-genome sequencing of 480 haploid fungal isolates was performed and two genome-wide SNP datasets generated, one for each of the study species. Clustering analyses clearly showed that in both species geographically separated populations also formed genetically distinct groups which could result from local adaptation generating and maintaining genetic structure. The amount of gene-flow, however, differed between species with higher levels of genetic differentiation between populations and a stronger effect of isolation by distance in E. clarkii compared to E. typhina. This pattern may be a result of different dispersal abilities of the two pathogens linked to their spore morphology and is likely also influenced by the genetic structure of host populations. Furthermore, the overall higher genetic diversity within E. typhina populations compared to E. clarkii suggests highly different effective population sizes. The results from this chapter provide insights into the evolutionary processes and genomic features contributing to population divergence of plant pathogens in natural systems and the strong geographic structure observed in this system is an ideal prerequisite to investigate the genetic basis of adaptation which is the focus of the third chapter.  Here the population genomic datasets were used to detect genome-wide signatures of selective sweeps in Epichloe genomes and identify genes putatively involved in host adaptation. Two different selection scan methods were applied to detect signatures of selective sweeps and uncover loci under recent selection at the population level: haplotype-based scans and SFS-based scans. I examined the possibility that the dynamic genome compartments (AT-rich regions) contribute to adaptive evolution in Epichloe by testing for an association between these regions and genes under positive selection. Selective sweeps were widespread across the genomes of both species, however, selective sweeps were more abundant in E. typhina. This difference may be explained by the larger effective population size of E. typhina compared to E. clarkii and a therefore a stronger relative effect of selection versus genetic drift. Sweep regions often overlapped with AT- rich regions suggesting a significant role of these regions in adaptive evolution of Epichloe. Many different loci were under selection in different populations suggesting that heterogenous selection pressures generate locally adapted populations, but some selected loci were shared across multiple populations suggesting shared selection regimes and a possible role of these loci in adaptation to the host at the species-level. Genes located in shared sweeps and putatively involved in host-adaptation encoded known effector functions such as small-secreted proteins and cell-wall-degrading enzymes. While the analyses focused on observing evolutionary patterns within populations, the haplotype-structure at candidate loci could also be compared among populations and the observed patterns suggested that different loci are governed by different evolutionary dynamics. This last main chapter delivers insights into the impact and targets of selection in natural populations of fungal plant pathogens and investigates the link between genome organization and adaptation.  Finally, in a short supplementary chapter the phylogenetic and taxonomic ambiguity of the E. typhina species complex is addressed, in which E. typhina and E. clarkii reside. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on genome-wide SNP datasets of 144 isolates collected from 14 different host grass species across Europe prior to and throughout this project and additional genomic data from public data bases. The new phylogeny presented here resolves seven genetically differentiated clades representing closely related cryptic species within in the previously obscure E. typhina complex and thus provides a basis for future taxonomic reconsiderations.  The results of this thesis provide insights into the population biology and adaptive evolution of an intriguing and unique biological system, the Epichloe fungi. A solid foundation is laid in the form of both genomic resources and the empirical analysis of natural populations to establish a new fungal model system for evolutionary research and to stimulate future scientific investigations focusing on, but not limited to, the adaptation of fungal plant pathogens, genome evolution in eukaryotes and coevolutionary dynamics between pathogens and hosts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000521608",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/521608","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Population genomics||Comparative genomics||Genome assembly||Fungal plant pathogens||Fungal adaptation","Into the wild - Adaptation genomics of Epichloe grass pathogens in natural ecosystems",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-12-20T17:53:28Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Molecular host adaptation of Epichloë endophytes","169269","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften","27662",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, little is known on how planted larch trees cope with increasing drought. We used a tree-ring network of 818 trees from 31 plantations spanning most of the distribution of Larix principis-rupprechtii to investigate how extreme drought influences larch radial growth in northern China. We found that summer drought, rather than temperature or precipitation, had the strongest relationship with radial growth throughout the region. Drought increased in frequency in recent decades, leaving a strong imprint on the radial growth of larch, particularly in dry sites. Across its distribution, radial growth in larch trees that experienced extreme droughts more frequently displayed lower resistance to drought, but higher recovery after it, suggesting these populations were better adapted to extreme droughts. Radial growth decreased with increasing drought, with particularly severe declines below a threshold Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) value of 3 to 3.5. Extreme droughts (PDSI < 4.5) caused a reduction of 62% of radial growth and chronic drought events caused around 20% reduction in total radial growth compared with mean growth on the driest sites. Given that current climate projections for northern China indicate a strong increase in the frequency and severity of extreme drought, trees in large portions of the largest afforestation project in the world, particularly those in the drier edge, are likely to experience severe growth reductions in the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000525787","1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/abd214","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/525787","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","apid warming||planted forests||larch||radial growth||drought||climate","High risk of growth cessation of planted larch under extreme drought",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-14T15:32:47Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Environ.

For decades, targeted resistance breeding was used to create crop cultivars that resist pathogens and environmental stress while retaining yields. The often decade-long process of crossing, selection, and field trials to create a new cultivar is challenged by the rapid rise of pathogens overcoming resistance. Similarly, antimicrobial compounds can rapidly lose efficacy due to resistance evolution. Here, we review three major areas where computational, imaging and experimental approaches are revolutionizing the management of pathogen damage on crops. Recognizing and scoring plant diseases have dramatically improved through high-throughput imaging techniques applicable both under well-controlled greenhouse conditions and directly in the field. However, computer vision of complex disease phenotypes will require significant improvements. In parallel, experimental setups similar to high-throughput drug discovery screens make it possible to screen thousands of pathogen strains for variation in resistance and other relevant phenotypic traits. Confocal microscopy and fluorescence can capture rich phenotypic information across pathogen genotypes. Through genome-wide association mapping approaches, phenotypic data helps to unravel the genetic architecture of stress- and virulence-related traits accelerating resistance breeding. Finally, joint, large-scale screenings of trait variation in crops and pathogens can yield fundamental insights into how pathogens face trade-offs in the adaptation to resistant crop varieties. We discuss how future implementations of such innovative approaches in breeding and pathogen screening can lead to more durable disease control.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000460881","2001-0370",,"10.1016/j.csbj.2020.12.018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460881","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Agriculture||Plant pathogens||High-throughput phenotyping||Image analysis||Genome-wide association mapping||Sustainability","Tackling microbial threats in agriculture with integrative imaging and computational approaches",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-10T03:41:02Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85098737053",,"000684869700008",,,"Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Glacial retreat, accompanied by shifts in riparian vegetation and glacier meltwater inputs, alters the energy supply and trophic structure of alpine stream food webs. Our goal in this study was to enhance understanding of dietary niches of macroinvertebrates inhabiting different alpine streams with contrasting glacial and non‐glacial (groundwater, precipitation, snowmelt) water inputs in conjunction with seasonal and habitat‐specific variation in basal resource availability.  2.    We measured a range of stream physico‐chemical attributes as well as carbon and nitrogen isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) of macroinvertebrates and primary food sources at seven sites across seasons within a Swiss glaciated catchment (Val Roseg) undergoing rapid glacial retreat (1–2 km between 1997 and 2014). Sampling sites corresponded to streams used in a previous (1997/1998) study within the same alpine catchment.  3.    Physico‐chemical attributes showed wide variation in environmental conditions across streams and seasons. Significant correlation among physico‐chemical proxies of glacier meltwater (phosphate‐P, total inorganic carbon, conductivity, turbidity) and macroinvertebrate δ13C, δ15N, and size‐corrected standard ellipse area (a proxy for feeding niche width) values showed that the extent of glacial water input shapes the energy base among alpine streams. Feeding niche differences among common alpine stream insect taxa (Chironomidae, Baetidae, Heptageniidae) were not significant, indicating that these organisms probably are plastic in feeding behaviour, opportunistically relying on food resources available in a particular stream and season.  4.    Seasonal trends in macroinvertebrate δ13C largely followed patterns in periphyton δ13C values, indicating that autochthonous resources were the main consumer energy source within the stream network, as shown previously. The overall range in macroinvertebrate δ13C (−33.5 to −18.4‰) and δ15N (−6.9 to 6.7‰) values also corresponded to values measured in the previous study, suggesting that macroinvertebrates altered diets in line with changes in environmental conditions and food resources during a period of rapid glacial retreat. Our results suggest that environmental changes brought on by rapid glacial retreat have not yet caused a profound change in the trophic structure within these fluvial networks.",,,"0046-5070||1365-2427",,"10.1111/fwb.13621","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462689","en","Wiley",,,"Baetis alpinus||Diamesinae||Glacial streams||Rhithrogena spp.||stream food webs","Does rapid glacial recession affect feeding habits of alpine stream insects?",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-14T15:40:26Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85092101335",,"000575305100001","Freshw. biol.","1","Freshwater Biology","66","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Population genetic models are an important tool in mitigating that threat. However, most such models consider resistance emergence via a single mutational step. Here, we assembled experimental evidence that drug resistance evolution follows two patterns: (i) a single mutation, which provides a large resistance benefit, or (ii) multiple mutations, each conferring a small benefit, which combine to yield high-level resistance. Using stochastic modeling, we then investigated the consequences of these two patterns for treatment failure and population diversity under various treatments. We find that resistance evolution is substantially limited if more than two mutations are required and that the extent of this limitation depends on the combination of drug type and pharmacokinetic profile. Further, if multiple mutations are necessary, adaptive treatment, which only suppresses the bacterial population, delays treatment failure due to resistance for a longer time than aggressive treatment, which aims at eradication.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000490797","2050-084X",,"10.7554/eLife.64116","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/490797","en","eLife Sciences Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Multi-step vs. single-step resistance evolution under different drugs, pharmacokinetics, and treatment regimens",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-23T03:10:14Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85108021256",,"000661273900001",,,"eLife","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These interactions can shape adaptive processes at the level of populations and ultimately influence phenotypic and genetic variation in nature. Adaptive processes can be characterized by multiple selective forces acting on multidimensional phenotypes, which can lead to trade-offs in trait evolution. The integrative phenotype, characterized by all traits of an individual, can be split into genetic (G), environmental (E) and G x E interaction components. Hence, adaptation to environmental stressors can be driven simultaneously by genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity and a combination of both. Physiological traits, such as glucocorticoids, are often linked to many other traits of the composite phenotype. Their expression is influenced by abiotic as well as biotic environmental stressors and they can facilitate adaptive responses of organisms through plasticity or genetic variation. However, the exact role of physiological processes in adaptation of natural populations to stress is poorly understood. In this thesis, I aimed to understand the role of the integrative phenotype, and specifically of corticosterone, as a mediator of adaptation to environmental stress using individual level studies. I investigated the integrative phenotype of Rana arvalis tadpoles in five populations (two acid [AOP], one intermediate [IOP] and one neutral pH origin [NOP] population) along an acidification gradient in Sweden. These populations were previously found to show adaptive divergence and dynamic plastic responses to acid and predator stress in tadpole life history and morphological traits. I used a series of common garden laboratory experiments, where individuals from different populations were reared in different combinations of two pH (acid or neutral) and two predator stressor (predator cue or no cue) treatments. In chapter I, I reared individuals from three populations (AOP, IOP, NOP) under chronically acid or neutral pH conditions to study the links between corticosterone and mid-larval stage traits (life history and morphology). I found divergence between populations in corticosterone levels, with AOP tadpoles having lower and NOP tadpoles relatively higher corticosterone, with IOP being intermediate. Higher corticosterone levels were correlated to faster developmental time and shorter tails and bodies, hinting to a mediator effect of corticosterone. In chapter II, I investigated short-term behavioural and hormonal responses to acute acid and predator stress using one AOP and one NOP from the extreme ends of the acidification gradient. In this experiment, tadpoles from both populations reduced their activity in acidic pH, but under predator stress NOP tadpoles decreased their activity, whereas AOP tadpoles increased their activity. Moreover, AOP tadpoles increased their corticosterone levels under stress, whereas NOP tadpoles did not. In chapter III and IV, I studied tadpoles from two AOP and two NOP and reared them under a combination of chronic acid and/or predator stress. In chapter III, I studied the linkage between metabolic activity (oxygen consumption) and life history traits of tadpoles. AOP tadpoles had lower oxygen consumption and slower development overall and tadpoles reduced their oxygen consumption when exposed to predator cues. In chapter IV, I studied the integrative phenotype of tadpoles and its linkage to corticosterone (including corticosterone manipulation) and metamorphic fitness traits. The common garden experiment revealed that AOP tadpoles were larger and needed longer to reach metamorphosis, had deeper tail muscles and shorter tails, and exhibited mostly lower corticosterone levels. Acid stress led to higher corticosterone levels, and tadpoles with smaller and shallower bodies, deeper tail muscles, and slower development to metamorphosis. Tadpoles exposed to predator stress had deeper tail muscles and shorter tails, were bigger at metamorphosis, needed longer until reaching metamorphosis, and responded to freshly added predator cues by reduced behavioural activity. Moreover, AOP tadpoles reared under predator stress reduced their general behavioural activity, whereas NOP tadpoles did not. The causal role of corticosterone was supported by a corticosterone manipulation experiment: experimental increase in corticosterone levels increased tail muscle depth and body depth and resulted in smaller size of tadpoles. Taken together, I conclude that a combination of G (population), E (acid and predator stress), and GxE (population specific responses to acid and predator stress) effects are at play in the responses of R. arvalis to environmental acidification. Importantly, my research indicates that corticosterone is a potential mediator of the observed differences in morphology, life history and metabolic activity between populations. Together with previous work, my studies indicate that adaptive divergence of R. arvalis along the acidification gradient is most likely driven by selection via both predator and acidity stress on the integrative phenotype. My thesis sheds light on the composite phenotype of an amphibian and the value of individual level studies in unravelling eco-evolutionary processes in organismal stress responses.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000499670",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499670","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"The integrative phenotype of moor frogs (Rana arvalis) - Evolutionary physiology and adaptation to multidimensional selection",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences",,"2021-08-05T08:22:53Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27405",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Maize (Zea mays) is a wind-pollinated outcrossing plant with no known biological barriers to transgene flow from genetically modified (GM) to non-GM plants, i.e., hybrid varieties, open pollinated varieties (OPVs) and landraces.  	This research is complicated when the wild relative of maize (“teosinte”) and GM maize plants are also sympatric populations. However, only few studies exist that have investigated if and how transgenes are expressed in the various genetic backgrounds, following gene flow, and how this may affect the quantitative production of the transgene product, here Bt proteins, and their bioactivity against insect pests. In addition, it is possible that biotic stress factors such as herbivory further modulate these complex relationships. The outcomes of this research are of importance for the prediction of pest resistance evolution, smallholder seed diversity and preservation and risk assessments of GM organisms. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the entire triple-relationship of transgene expression, the resulting protein production (Cry1Ab toxin) and its bioactivity in pest insects, following transgene flow from GM hybrid maize into non-GM maize, i.e. near-isogenic non-GM maize hybrids (ISO), open pollinated maize varieties (OPVs) and wild/weedy relatives to maize.  The thesis is divided into three chapters, which had the following specific aims: 1) to investigate the triple-relationship following transgene flow from GM hybrid maize into non-GM, near-isogenic maize hybrid (ISO) and OPVs under non-stress conditions. In addition, the Mendelian inheritance segregation pattern of the cry1Ab transgene expression was examined; 2) to examine how herbivore feeding damage by two maize insect pests, Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera littoralis, may affect this triple-relationship; and 3) to test if hybridization between the GM maize and wild/weedy teosinte plants from Spain is possible, and to study the above described triple-relationship in Cry1Ab positive crosses between GM maize and Spanish wild/weedy teosinte.  Basically, in chapter 1 and 2, the plant materials and setup of the experiments were identical and conducted in the same climate chamber at ETH Zürich. The difference is that in chapter 1 the experiments were carried out under non-stress growing conditions and in chapter 2 the tested crosses were exposed to biotic stress exerted through feeding damage exerted by two different herbivorous pests of maize, Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera littoralis. Two groups of F1, F2 crosses and backcrosses with GM, ISO and OPV maize varieties from Brazil and South Africa were used. In both chapters, we measured the cry1Ab transgene expression as quantification of mRNA, the Cry1Ab protein concentration using quantitative ELISA tests and the pest survival in feeding bioassays. Bioassays were carried out with larvae of two lepidopteran maize pest species, Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera littoralis. Additionally, the segregation pattern of cry1Ab transgene was examined (in chapter 1 only). In chapter 3, we generated in climate chamber, under controlled conditions, crosses between GM maize and wild/weedy teosinte plants in both ways. This novel wild/weed teosinte plants were recently found in Spanish maize fields. Here, we also measured the cry1Ab transgene expression, Cry1Ab protein concentration (ELISA test) and pest survival (bioassays). Bioassays were carried out with larvae of the lepidopteran maize target pest, Ostrinia nubilalis.  Overall, similar results were found in all three chapters. The cry1Ab transgene outcrossed effectively into all different genetic backgrounds, and even into a wild/weedy teosinte plants (from Spain). In all resulting Cry1Ab positive crosses, the transgene was stably expressed when compared to the respective GM parental maize. Regardless whether the crossing partners were generated in a commercial maize breeding program or OPVs selected and maintained by small-scale farmers, or even related to wild/weed teosinte from Spain.  The resultant Cry1Ab toxin was produced in all crosses generated, in a bioactive form, inducing high mortality rates in the tested insect pest species. Transgene introgression led to consistent, though highly variable, concentrations of Cry1Ab toxins that were similar to those observed in the respective GM parental maize. In most of these GM crosses with non-GM maize, the segregation patterns of the cry1Ab transgene followed Mendelian rules, but not in all.  Based on chapter 2, when the Brazilian and South African crosses were exposed to herbivore stress, the testing results of these triple-relationships were diverse and unpredictable. While in the South African crosses, the herbivore damage inflicted by S. littoralis did not affect the entire triple-relationship, the herbivore damage by H. armigera led to higher production of Cry1Ab protein in the Brazilian crosses. Under herbivore stress conditions, the variability in concentration levels of the Cry1Ab protein in the Brazilian crosses was significantly higher than under non-stress conditions, and this led subsequently to a higher variability of the mortality rates among the H. armigera larvae. This relationship was not observed with the South African crosses. Overall, another important result found in all three chapters was that no correlations were observed between the transgene transcription levels and the resultant Cry1Ab protein concentrations, nor between the Cry1Ab protein concentrations and insect mortality rates. Surprisingly, also no correlations were found in the GM parental maize plants. This suggests that while transcription of the cry1Ab transgene reliably determines the presence of Cry1Ab protein, mRNA levels (i.e. the transgene expression) do not reflect, by themselves, the final Cry1Ab protein concentrations found in the plant leaves. Therefore, we conclude that other metabolic plant processes are influencing this process, that can possibly be induced or modulated by herbivore stress (if present). Finally, this research documented that the Cry1Ab toxins produced in GM teosinte hybrids were bioactive and induced mortality rates equal to or above 95% in neonate O. nubilalis after a period of only 4 days, reflecting mortality rates of O. nubilalis similar to those on GM maize plants. Therefore, based on this result, we suggest the potential increase the weediness of the Spanish wild/weedy teosinte plants by acquired defense against the target pest specie, here Cry1Ab toxin. These outcomes are important for environmental risk assessments and various aspects of ecological safety where GM maize plants and wild/weedy teosinte form sympatric populations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000490630",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/490630","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Bt maize||transgene flow||mRNA||Helicoverpa armigera||Spodoptera littoralis||landrace||open-pollinated varieties||insect resistant management||herbivore feeding||emergent weed||hybridization||cry1Ab||Ostrinia nubilalis||Spain","Effects of gene flow of GM maize into non-GM maize and wild relatives",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-06-21T14:33:26Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27109",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In a screen for modulators of cell polarity, we identified CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1, a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. We subsequently revealed antagonistic impacts of ethylene and glucose signaling on the self-renewing capacity of stomatal lineage stem cells. Quantitative analysis of cell polarity and fate dynamics showed that developmental information may be encoded in both the spatial and temporal asymmetries of polarity proteins. These results provide a framework for a mechanistic understanding of how nutritional status and environmental factors tune stem-cell behavior in the stomatal lineage, ultimately enabling flexibility in leaf size and cell-type composition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000495081","2050-084X",,"10.7554/eLife.63335","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495081","en","eLife Sciences Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Tuning self-renewal in the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage by hormone and nutrient regulation of asymmetric cell division",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T10:44:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000636048600001",,,"eLife","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

About 70 species of Cynoglossinae are present in the Iranian plateau, 47 of which are endemic to the plateau. Herein, nuclear internal transcribed spacer sequences as well as cpDNA rpl32-trnL and trnH-psbA sequences were used to investigate the molecular phylogeny, historical biogeography, and ancestral character states of Cynoglossinae. Molecular dating and ancestral range reconstruction analyses indicated that the subtribe Cynoglossinae has initiated its diversification from the eastern part of the western I-T during the mid-Miocene, concomitantly with the uplift of the Pamir and Hindu Kush mountains. Moreover, from the Pliocene onwards, the Afghan-India collision and extensive deformation of the Arabia-Eurasia convergence likely promoted allopatric speciation in Cynoglossinae via mostly vicariance events. Evolution of annuals with small nutlets from perennials with large nutlets was accompanied by mesic to desert habitat shifts. Herein, to explain distribution of Cynoglossinae in the western I-T, the congruence between cladogenetic, geological, and palaeoclimatic events was investigated.",,,"1916-2790||1480-3305",,"10.1139/cjb-2020-0224","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505023","en","Canadian Science Publishing",,,"ancestral range reconstruction||Arabia–Eurasia collision||Cynoglossinae||Iranian plateau||molecular dating||nutlet","Diversification of Cynoglossinae genera (Cynoglosseae-Boraginaceae) in the western Irano-Turanian bioregion",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-09-10T03:18:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000692003000002","Botany (Ott., Print)","9","Botany","99","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Taking Northwest Syria as a case study, we simulated an outbreak in high-density informal Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps using a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model. Expanding on previous studies, taking social conditions and population health/structure into account, we modelled several interventions feasible in these settings: moderate self-distancing, self-isolation of symptomatic cases and protection of the most vulnerable in 'safety zones'. We considered complementary measures to these interventions that can be implemented autonomously by these communities, such as buffer zones, health checks and carers for isolated individuals, quantifying their impact on the micro-dynamics of disease transmission. All interventions significantly reduce outbreak probability and some of them reduce mortality when an outbreak does occur. Self-distancing reduces mortality by up to 35% if contacts are reduced by 50%. A reduction in mortality by up to 18% can be achieved by providing one self-isolation tent per eight people. Protecting the most vulnerable in a safety zone reduces the outbreak probability in the vulnerable population and has synergistic effects with the other interventions. Our model predicts that a combination of all simulated interventions may reduce mortality by more than 90% and delay an outbreak's peak by almost 2 months. Our results highlight the potential for non-medical interventions to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.

Here, we report the first analysis of CS associated with the acquisition of complete ABR plasmids, including the clinically important carbapenem-resistance conjugative plasmid pOXA-48. In addition, we describe the conservation of CS in clinical E. coli isolates and its application to selectively kill plasmid-carrying bacteria.

Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and use predefined cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives and use this as a proxy for past infection. With the imperfect assays that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of the cumulative incidence and is usually corrected to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use an inference method—referred to as mixture-model approach—for the estimation of the cumulative incidence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that the mixture model outperforms the methods based on cutoffs, leading to less bias and error in estimates of the cumulative incidence. We illustrate how the mixture model can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test’s ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the cumulative incidence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of classes of infections with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures. This is a very promising application of the mixture-model approach that could identify the elusive fraction of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. An R-package implementing the inference methods used in this paper is provided. Our study advocates using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals. This approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods at exactly the low cumulative incidence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000475839","1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/JOURNAL.PCBI.1008728","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/475839","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Estimating the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 with imperfect serological tests: Exploiting cutoff-free approaches",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-23T03:58:15Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85102654153",,"000624547300007","PLOS comput. biol.","2","PLoS Computational Biology","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recent work has begun to explore the effects of inbreeding on ecological interactions among plants and other organisms, including insect herbivores and pathogens. However, the effects of inbreeding on floral traits, floral scents, and pollinator visitation are less well studied.  METHODS Using inbred and outbred maternal families of horsenettle (Solanum carolinense, Solanaceae), we examined the effects of inbreeding on traits associated with pollinator attraction and floral rewards. Specifically, we measured corolla size, counted pollen grains per flower, and analyzed floral volatile emissions via gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. We also examined pollinator visitation to experimental arrays of flowering inbred and outbred plants under field conditions.  RESULTS Compared to those of outbred plants, flowers of inbred plants exhibited reduced corolla size and pollen production, as well as significantly reduced emission of the two most abundant volatile compounds in the floral blend. Furthermore, bumblebees—the main pollinators of horsenettle—discriminated against inbred flowers in the field: bees were more likely to make initial visits to flowers on outbred plants, visited outbred flowers more often overall, and spent more time on outbred flowers.  CONCLUSIONS These results show that inbreeding can (1) alter floral traits that are known to mediate pollinator attraction; (2) reduce the production of floral rewards (pollen is the sole reward in horsenettle); and (3) adversely affect pollinator visitation under field conditions.",,,"1914-2016:||0002-9122",,"10.1002/ajb2.1594","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465817","en","Wiley",,,"Mating system||Solanaceae||Bombus||floral scent||floral traits||corolla size","Inbreeding in Solanum carolinense alters floral attractants and rewards and adversely affects pollinator visitation",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-27T06:18:22Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85099349205",,"000607735700001","Am.

The Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) is arguably the most prominent NFTP from the Neo-tropics, as a globallytraded product from a hyperdominant carbon-rich tree and cornerstone species for rainforest conservation with potential for restoration. Hence, this species has the capacity to contribute to resilient stewardship of forest landscapes, while generating income and improving the livelihood of a vast number of people and local communities throughout the Amazon basin, as well as playing a role in climate change mitigation.  • Although it is a protected species, the habitat where Brazil nuts occur is being degraded due to logging of other tree species and land conversion from forest to unsustainable agricultural systems. In this thesis I adopt an interdisciplinary approach across ecosystem management and applied molecular ecology and genomics to 1) Explore the reproductive vulnerability of natural Brazil nut populations in a categorized forest-degradation gradient in the highly biodiverse region of Madre de Dios; 2) Increase our understanding of the role of forest genetic resources as a foundation for resilient oroduction and a vital source of material for forest enrichment and Brazil-nut based restoration; and 3) Provide evidence-based recommendations for management practices that have demonstrated positive effects on the sustainability of Brazil nut populations and its value for restoration. • For genetic analyses, I used a combination of traditional microsatellite SSR loci and developed ddRAD-generated SNPs novel to the species. I place the overall results in the context of patterns of fine-scale genetic structure (FSFS), comparisons genetic-diversity and pollen geneflow patterns, signs of inbreeding through genetic erosion, heterozygosity-fitness correlations related to survival, growth and fruit productivity, monitoring of the success of planting initiatives, and exploration of cost-efficient management practices from collaborative research components. • These findings are detailed and discussed in three main chapters, followed by an additional genome-size technical note and information from co-authored studies related to similar topics within sustainable forest management. Together, they aim to contribute to our holistic understanding of approaches required for resilient management of this vulnerable and socioecologically valuable Amazon rainforest species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000480320",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/480320","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 Generic","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/","Sustainable forest management||genetic diversity||Conservation genetics||Forest genetic resources||Restoration potential||Forest enrichment||Gene flow||Brazil nut||non-timber forest products (NTFP)||Amazon rainforest||Habitat degradation||Tree planting||Socio-ecological systems||Sustainability","Brazil nuts in the Peruvian Amazon: Linking genetic diversity and sustainable forest management of a socio-ecological system",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences",,"2021-04-23T12:40:42Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"27298",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

There is increasing evidence microbial interactions between and within species are significant drivers of resistance. On one hand, cross-protection by resistant genotypes can shelter susceptible microbes from the adverse effects of antibiotics, reducing the advantage of resistance. On the other hand, antibiotic-mediated killing of susceptible genotypes can alleviate competition and allow resistant strains to thrive (competitive release). Here, by observing interactions both within and between species in microbial communities sampled from humans, we investigate the potential role for cross-protection and competitive release in driving the spread of ampicillin resistance in the ubiquitous gut commensal and opportunistic pathogen Escherichia coli. Methodology: Using anaerobic gut microcosms comprising E.coli embedded within gut microbiota sampled from humans, we tested for cross-protection and competitive release both within and between species in response to the clinically important beta-lactam antibiotic ampicillin. Results: While cross-protection gave an advantage to antibiotic-susceptible E.coli in standard laboratory conditions (well-mixed LB medium), competitive release instead drove the spread of antibioticresistant E.coli in gut microcosms (ampicillin boosted growth of resistant bacteria in the presence of susceptible strains). Conclusions and implications: Competition between resistant strains and other members of the gut microbiota can restrict the spread of ampicillin resistance. If antibiotic therapy alleviates competition with resident microbes by killing susceptible strains, as here, microbiota-based interventions that restore competition could be a key for slowing the spread of resistance. Lay Summary: Slowing the spread of global antibiotic resistance is an urgent task. In this paper, we ask how interactions between microbial species drive the spread of resistance. We show that antibiotic killing of susceptible microbes can free up resources for resistant microbes and allow them to thrive. Therefore, we should consider microbes in light of their social interactions to understand the spread of resistance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526797",,,"10.1093/emph/eoab020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526797","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","evolution||ecology||microbiology||antibiotic resistance||competitive release||microbiome","Species interactions drive the spread of ampicillin resistance in human-associated gut microbiota",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-19T09:08:09Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"The role of bacteria-virus interactions in antimicrobial resistance","165803","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,,,"000745782100001",,"1","Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This notion aims to complement the traditional classification in operational taxonomic units (OTUs), widely used in microbial ecology, to provide a more intrinsic taxonomical classification which avoids the use of pre-determined thresholds. However, to introduce this concept, the author frames his proposal in a wider theoretical framework based on a conceptualization of selection that we argue is a tautology. This blurs the subsequent formulation of an assembly principle for microbial communities, favouring that some contradictory examples introduced to support the framework appear aligned in their conclusions. And more importantly, under this framework and its derived methodology, it is not possible to infer PCGs from data in a consistent way. We reanalyse the proposal to identify its logical and methodological flaws and, through the analysis of synthetic scenarios, we propose a number of methodological refinements to contribute towards the determination of PCGs in a consistent way. We hope our analysis will promote the exploration of PCGs as a potentially valuable tool, helping to bridge the gap between environmental conditions and community composition in microbial ecology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492317","2049-2618",,"10.1186/s40168-021-01023-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492317","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Phylogenetic Core Groups: a promising concept in search of a consistent methodological framework",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-30T12:25:44Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000635194500002",,"1","Microbiome","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Introgression of the insect resistance transgene cry1Ab from genetically modified (GM) maize into populations of this weedy Spanish teosinte could endow it with additional defense mechanisms. The aims of this study were: (1) to test if hybridization between GM maize and weedy plants from Spain is possible; (2) to understand the relationship between transgene transcription activity, concentrations of the expected transgene product (Cry1Ab protein) and the bioactivity of the latter on target insect pests following transgene flow from GM maize into Spanish teosinte plants.  Results We demonstrated that hybridization between GM maize and the weedy Spanish teosinte is possible, with no observable barrier to the formation of crop/weed hybrids when teosinte served as pollen donor. When GM maize plants were used as pollen donors, significant crossing incompatibility was observed: hybrid plants produced only few “normal” seeds. Nevertheless, viable F1 seeds from GM pollen crossed onto teosinte were indeed obtained. The cry1Ab transgene was stably expressed as mRNA in all crossings and backgrounds. Similarly, toxicity on neonate Ostrinia nubilalis, presumably due to Cry1Ab protein, was consistently expressed in teosinte hybrids, with mortality rates 95% or higher after only 4 days exposure, similar to rates on parental GM maize plants. Nevertheless, no strong correlations were observed between transgene transcription levels and Cry1Ab concentrations, nor between Cry1Ab concentrations and insect mortality rates across all of the different genetic backgrounds.  Conclusions Our results establish fundamental parameters for environmental risk assessments in the European context: first, we show that crop/weed hybridization in fields where maize and teosinte exist sympatrically can lead to potentially catastrophic transfer of resistance traits into an already noxious weed; second, our results question the viability of using gene dosage to model and predict ecological performance in either the intended crop plant or the undesired teosinte weed. Significant questions remain that should be addressed in order to provide a scientific, sound approach to the management of this novel weed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488694","2190-4715||2190-4707",,"10.1186/s12302-021-00506-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488694","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","GM maize||Wild relatives||Emergent weed||Hybridization||Transgene flow||mRNA||cry1Ab||Ostrinia nubilalis||Spain","Transgene behavior in genetically modified teosinte hybrid plants: transcriptome expression, insecticidal protein production and bioactivity against a target insect pest",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-08T02:39:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85107023850",,"000656474100001","Environ Sci Eur","1","Environmental Sciences Europe","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous studies have typically quantified only leaf area loss, or have been conducted during outbreak years. These set-ups often ignore the physiological changes taking place in the remaining plant tissue after insect attack, or may not represent typical, non-outbreak herbivore densities. Here, we estimate the amount of carbon lost to insect herbivory in a temperate deciduous woodland both through leaf area loss and, notably, through changes in leaf gas exchange in non-consumed leaves under non-outbreak densities of insects. We calculate how net primary productivity changes with decreasing and increasing levels of herbivory, and estimate what proportion of the carbon involved in the leaf area loss is transferred further in the food web. We estimate that the net primary productivity of an oak stand under ambient levels of herbivory is 54 - 69% lower than that of a completely intact stand. The effect of herbivory quantified only as leaf area loss (0.1 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) is considerably smaller than when the effects of herbivory on leaf physiology are included (8.5 Mg C ha−1 yr−1). We propose that the effect of herbivory on primary productivity is non-linear and mainly determined by changes in leaf gas exchange. We call for replicated studies in other systems to validate the relationship between insect herbivory and ecosystem productivity described here.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000503984",,,"10.1101/2021.01.28.428605","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/503984","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","insect herbivory||carbon cycle||net primary productivity||gross primary productivity||respiration||Quercus robur||Operophtera brumata||Wytham Woods","Does insect herbivory suppress ecosystem productivity?

However, current ecological models are ill-equipped for this job: they rely on statistical methods and current observations rather than the mechanisms that determine how functional traits interact with the environment to determine plant fitness, meaning that they are unable to predict ecological responses to novel conditions. Here, I advocate the use of a 3D mechanistic modelling approach called functional–structural plant (FSP) modelling in combination with evolutionary modelling to explore climate change responses in natural plant communities. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how trait–environment interactions drive natural selection in novel environments requires consideration of individual plants with multidimensional phenotypes in dynamic environments that include abiotic gradients and biotic interactions, and their combined effect on the different vital rates that determine plant fitness. Evolutionary FSP modelling explicitly simulates the trait–environment interactions that drive eco-evolutionary dynamics from individual to community scales and allows for efficient navigation of the large, complex and dynamic fitness landscapes that emerge from considering multidimensional plants in multidimensional environments. Using evolutionary FSP modelling as a tool to study climate change responses of plant communities can further our understanding of the mechanistic basis of these responses, and in particular, the role of local adaptation, phenotypic plasticity and gene flow.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528773","2517-5025",,"10.1093/insilicoplants/diab029","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528773","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||ecology & evolution||functional traits||functional-structural plant modelling||local adaptation||phenotypic plasticity","Using evolutionary functional–structural plant modelling to understand the effect of climate change on plant communities",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-26T11:09:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,"Mechanistic modelling of changing interactions in plant communities facing climate change","19-2 FEL-72","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Fellows",,,,,,"000745293200012",,"2","in silico Plants","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As environments change - and populations migrate, change in size or adapt in response - these evolutionary forces leave distinct signatures in the patterns of neutral and adaptive genetic variation in populations. We can infer much about the history of populations and species, and of evolutionary processes, from unravelling these patterns. However, this can be challenging to accomplish when the population or species’ demographic history is complex, as under such scenarios, neutral processes (i.e. drift and migration) can generate similar and hence confounding patterns to adaptive processes. In this thesis, I evaluate how we can disentangle such patterns to identify genetic loci under selection (Chapter I) and evaluate how neutral and adaptive processes can interact under complex demography and fluctuating environments to give rise to the patterns of genetic variation we observe in natural populations today (Chapter II and Chapter III).  In Chapter I, we derive a methodological framework to infer loci under selection given arbitrarily complex demographies. In our newly developed method which we name ‘LSD’ (identifying Loci under Selection under explicit Demographic models), we employ coalescent modelling under an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework to estimate demographic parameters in a sliding window across the genome and identify windows that are significantly divergent from the neutral, or genome-wide, expectations - under the premise that selection generates deviations in demographic parameters (i.e. drift and migration) away from genome-wide expectations. We show, via simulations and a case study, that our approach has several advantages. First, as the method is based on user-defined, explicit demographic models, demographic history is accounted for explicitly. This allows it to outperform current genome-scan methods under complex demographies. Second, the method can simultaneously incorporate information from many different, complementary summary statistics. Third, under multi-population systems, the method can accurately infer in which specific population selection acts, and thus characterise genetic trade-offs directly from genetic data. Finally, the method is highly customisable and can potentially be applied to detect various forms of selection including positive, divergent and balancing selection, in addition to adaptive introgression.  In Chapter II, we focus our attention on the genetic legacy of past climate fluctuations. Our current and most recent geological time period, the Quaternary, has been characterised by cycles of global climatic and environmental change that have shifted sea levels and led to extensive expansion and recession of glacial ice sheets. In mountain systems, but also elsewhere, this has driven species to undergo alternating bouts of expansion and contraction, as species tracked their increasing or shrinking habitats, respectively. While there is numerous evidence that species both migrated and adapted in response to these climate fluctuations, the majority of studies that have assessed the legacy of past climate evaluated these responses (i.e. range shifts and expansions, or adaptation) in isolation. Hence, it remains unclear how range shift and expansion dynamics interact with adaptive processes in natural populations, especially under heterogenous landscapes. Here, we re-sequence and analyse ca. 1300 individuals of the plant Dianthus sylvestris, sampled across the species’ natural distribution range in the European mountain ranges, to evaluate this. By identifying the species’ glacial refugias and reconstructing post-glacial expansion dynamics based on distribution modelling, past climate models and the species’ patterns of neutral and environment-associated genetic variation, we highlight a tightly-linked co-response of migration and adaptation under climate-induced range expansions; and demonstrate that adaptive processes naturally emerge from climate-induced range expansions across heterogenous landscapes such as the Alps. We show that this is due to shifts in the spatial sorting of adaptive alleles through time, as the species expanded out of geographically restricted glacial refugia and into the broader range of habitats available in the present-day interglacial. These legacies of past climate fluctuations on genetic variation highlight the importance of past evolutionary and phylogeographic reconstructions in understanding and evaluating the patterns of adaptive variation we see in species today.  Reconstructions of past patterns of adaptive variation together with their sequence of recruitment through time provide valuable insights into the environmental and evolutionary processes that shape adaptive variation, and further, provide the evolutionary and phylogeographic contexts necessary to probe the origins and genetic basis of adaptation. In Chapter III, we leverage off our phylogeographic reconstructions in Chapter II and the methodological framework developed in Chapter I to elucidate the genetic basis of elevational adaptation in Dianthus sylvestris and a closely related species, Dianthus carthusianorum, in the historical context of the clade’s rapid radiation ca. 1-2 million years ago (Mya). We show a strong genetic basis underlying observed phenotypic differences between populations of different elevations, characterised by large-effect haplotypes underlying flowering time and potentially frost tolerance. Between species, we find instances of gene-level adaptive convergence between the two species - alluding to introgression and porous genomes across lineages of the radiation, or a rich substrate of ancient genetic variation - but also distinct architectures elsewhere e.g. underlying flowering time. Notably, we infer key adaptive variants to have originated through the recombination of ancestral, divergent haplotypes pre-dating the formation of the species; before being recruited and maintained across lineages of the radiation. Our results reveal that the genomic potential generated through the recombination of adaptive variation across the radiation’s lineages facilitated expansion of species ranges during past climate warming, and may foster evolutionary rescue of contemporary high-elevation populations under future climate change.  The elucidation of adaptive and evolutionary processes in this thesis emphasise the key roles past climatic processes had on species, both in dictating their current distributions and in shaping neutral and adaptive genetic variation. Given that the potential of species to adapt to different environmental conditions is conferred by their extant pool of genetic variation, this highlights species’ reliance on the genetic legacies of the past to respond to future environmental changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000541913",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/541913","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Population genetics||Ecological genetics||Evolutionary biology","Unravelling the neutral and adaptive genetic legacies of the past",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences",,"2022-04-11T11:44:13Z","2023-04-11",,,,"yes",,,,"Ecological Genomics of Plant Adaptation||Genomics of adaptation in the context of a rapid plant radiation","182675||160123","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften","27881",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Tall goldenrod plants Solidago altissima appear to eavesdrop on the communication of a specialist gall‐inducing fly Eurosta solidaginis by detecting the volatile emissions of male flies and priming anti‐herbivore defences. However, the effects of defence priming on fly fitness have not previously been demonstrated, despite some evidence that female flies avoid ovipositing on primed plants in the field. 2.    To explore how priming affects female preferences and galling success, we manipulated exposure to the priming cue in multiple genotypes of S. altissima and assessed rates of oviposition and gall development. 3.    Priming reduced gall formation overall; however, its effect varied across plant genotypes, as well as by the age of the male flies used for priming, possibly reflecting dosage effects (older flies produce lower emissions). Priming by younger males significantly reduced galling success, while priming by older males slightly improved it. Remarkably, female flies accurately assessed host‐plant quality by avoiding plants primed by young males while preferring those primed by older males.  4.   Synthesis. Our results suggest that defence priming in S. altissima in response to the volatile emissions of E. solidaginis males does affect fly fitness; however, the effect of priming varied by plant genotype, suggesting that there may be variation in defensive strategies against the fly. Female flies have, in response to this defence, evolved a sophisticated ability to evaluate the quality of primed plants.
