The estimates from these methods have been used to constrain seasonal, interannual and decadal variability in sea–air CO2 fluxes and the drivers of these changes (Landschützer et al., 2015, 2016; Gregor et al., 2018). However, it is also becoming clear that these methods are converging towards a common bias and root mean square error (RMSE) boundary: “the wall”, which suggests that pCO2 estimates are now limited by both data gaps and scale-sensitive observations. Here, we analyse this problem by introducing a new gap-filling method, an ensemble average of six machine-learning models (CSIR-ML6 version 2019a, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research – Machine Learning ensemble with Six members), where each model is constructed with a two-step clustering-regression approach. The ensemble average is then statistically compared to well-established methods. The ensemble average, CSIR-ML6, has an RMSE of 17.16 µatm and bias of 0.89 µatm when compared to a test dataset kept separate from training procedures. However, when validating our estimates with independent datasets, we find that our method improves only incrementally on other gap-filling methods. We investigate the differences between the methods to understand the extent of the limitations of gap-filling estimates of pCO2. We show that disagreement between methods in the South Atlantic, southeastern Pacific and parts of the Southern Ocean is too large to interpret the interannual variability with confidence. We conclude that improvements in surface ocean pCO2 estimates will likely be incremental with the optimisation of gap-filling methods by (1) the inclusion of additional clustering and regression variables (e.g. eddy kinetic energy), (2) increasing the sampling resolution and (3) successfully incorporating pCO2 estimates from alternate platforms (e.g. floats, gliders) into existing machine-learning approaches.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000387134",,"1991-9603||1991-959X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387134||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/389142","10.5194/gmd-12-5113-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/389172","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A comparative assessment of the uncertainties of global surface ocean CO2 estimates using a machine-learning ensemble (CSIR-ML6 version 2019a) - have we hit the wall?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-25T03:17:10Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85076558978",,"000502280600001","Geosci. model dev.","12","Geoscientific Model Development","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This has led to a proliferation of data and the concomitant development of tools to process the data. These tools are focused primarily on converting the data from its raw form to more accessible formats and often rely on proprietary programing languages. This has left a gap in the processing of glider data for academics, who often need to perform secondary quality control (QC), calibrate, correct, interpolate and visualize data. Here, we present GliderTools, an open-source Python package that addresses these needs of the glider user community. The tool is designed to change the focus from the processing to the data. GliderTools does not aim to replace existing software that converts raw data and performs automatic first-order QC. In this paper, we present a set of tools, that includes secondary cleaning and calibration, calibration procedures for bottle samples, fluorescence quenching correction, photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) corrections and data interpolation in the vertical and horizontal dimensions. Many of these processes have been described in several other studies, but do not exist in a collated package designed for underwater glider data. Importantly, we provide potential users with guidelines on how these tools are used so that they can be easily and rapidly accessible to a wide range of users that span the student to the experienced researcher. We recognize that this package may not be all-encompassing for every user and we thus welcome community contributions and promote GliderTools as a community-driven project for scientists.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000387368",,"2296-7745",,"10.3389/fmars.2019.00738","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387368","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","python||software||glider||fluorescence||backscatter||gridding||interpolation","GliderTools: A Python Toolbox for Processing Underwater Glider Data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-01T18:43:29Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85076967131",,"000502960600001",,,"Frontiers in Marine Science","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Combined quantitative and mechanistic understanding of Tl sorption onto Mn oxides, however, is limited. We investigated the uptake of dissolved Tl(I) by environmentally relevant phyllo- and tectomanganates and used X-ray absorption spectroscopy to determine the oxidation state and local coordination of sorbed Tl. We show that extremely strong sorption of Tl onto vacancy-containing layered δ-MnO2 at low dissolved Tl(I) concentrations (log Kd ≥ 7.4 for ≤10–8 M Tl(I); Kd in (L/kg)) is due to oxidative uptake of Tl and that less specific nonoxidative Tl uptake only becomes dominant at very high Tl(I) concentrations (>10–6 M). Partial reduction of δ-MnO2 induces phase changes that result in inhibited oxidative Tl uptake and lower Tl sorption affinity (log Kd 6.2–6.4 at 10–8 M Tl(I)) and capacity. Triclinic birnessite, which features no vacancy sites, and todorokite, a 3 × 3 tectomanganate, bind Tl with lower sorption affinity than δ-MnO2, mainly as hydrated Tl+ in interlayers (triclinic birnessite; log Kd 5.5 at 10–8 M Tl(I)) or tunnels (todorokite). In cryptomelane, a 2 × 2 tectomanganate, dehydrated Tl+ replaces structural K+. The new quantitative and mechanistic insights from this study contribute to an improved understanding of the uptake of Tl by key Mn oxides and its relevance in natural and engineered systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000383584",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.9b04454","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/383584","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Thallium Sorption onto Manganese Oxides",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-07T03:19:07Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000498279400021","Environ.

Socio-economic factors have a tremendous influence on whether a farmer or a nation can adapt to these climate stressors. This study aims to examine the extent to which these factors affect maize vulnerability to drought in SSA. To differentiate sensitive regions from resilient ones, we defined a crop drought vulnerability index (CDVI) calculated by comparing recorded yield with expected yield simulated by the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model during 1990–2012. We then assessed the relationship between CDVI and potential socio-economic variables using regression techniques and identified the influencing variables. The results show that the level of fertilizer use is a highly influential factor on vulnerability. Additionally, countries with higher food production index and better infrastructure are more resilient to drought. The role of the government effectiveness variable was less apparent across the SSA countries due to being generally stationary. Improving adaptations to drought through investing in infrastructure, improving fertilizer distribution, and fostering economic development would contribute to drought resilience.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000378795",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su11216135","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/378795","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Crop model||EPIC||regression techniques||drought adaptation","A quantitative analysis of socio-economic determinants influencing crop drought vulnerability in Sub-Saharan Africa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-11-19T15:33:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85074826536",,"000501205200262",,"21","Sustainability","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A deeper understanding of the physical and chemical func-tioning of tropical reservoirs is essential to mitigate dam-related impacts. However, the development of predictive tools is hampered by a lack of consistent data on physical mixing and biogeochemistry of tropical reservoirs. In this study, we focus on Lake Kariba (Southern Africa), the largest artificial lake in the world by volume. Kariba Dam forms a transboundary reservoir between Zambia and Zimbabwe, and therefore its management represents a socio-politically sensitive issue because the Kariba Dam operation completely changed the downstream hydrological regime. Although Lake Kariba represents a unique and scientifi-cally interesting case study, there is no consistent dataset documenting its physical and chemical behaviour over time. This limits the scope for quantitative studies of this reservoir and its downstream impacts. To address this research gap, we aggregated a consistent database of in situ measurements of temperature and oxygen depth profiles for the entire 60 years of Lake Kariba’s lifetime and performed a detailed statistical analysis of the thermal and oxygen regime of the artificial lake to classify the different behaviours of the lake’s sub-basins. We demonstrate that the seasonal stratification strongly depends on the depth of the water column and on the distance from the lake inflow. Satellite data confirm these spa-tiotemporal variations in surface temperature, and reveal a consistent longitudinal warming trend of the lake surface water temperature of about 1.5˚C from the inflow to the dam. Finally, our results suggest that the stratification dynamics of the lacustrine sub-basins have the potential to alter the downstream Zambezi water quality. Future research should focus on assessing such alterations and developing strategies to mitigate them.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000389372",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0224679","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/389372","en","Public Library of Science (PLoS)","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Sixty years since the creation of Lake Kariba: Thermal and oxygen dynamics in the riverine and lacustrine sub-basins",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-10T14:33:15Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,,"000532680100037","PLoS ONE","11","PLoS ONE","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we propose a mechanism that exploits particle surface roughness to induce metastable wetting and obtain mechanically-responsive Pickering emulsions. We postulate that the phase inversion is driven by an in situ switch of the particle wettability from metastable positions at the interface following the input of controlled mechanical energy. Oil-in-water emulsions can be prepared at low energy using mildly hydrophobic rough colloids, which are dispersed in water and weakly pinned at the interface, and switched to water-in-oil emulsions by a second emulsification at higher energy, which triggers the relaxation of the particle contact angle. The same principle is demonstrated for the complementary emulsions using mildly hydrophilic colloids initially dispersed in oil. Our experiments and simulations support that the delicate interplay between particle surface design during synthesis and the energy of the emulsification process can encode a kinetic pathway for the phase inversion. Both organic and inorganic nanoparticles can be used, allowing for the future implementation of our strategy in a broad range of smart industrial formulations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000371467",,"1744-683X||1744-6848",,"10.1039/c9sm01352k","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/371467","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Mechanical phase inversion of Pickering emulsions via metastable wetting of rough colloids",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-18T09:44:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Two-dimensional self-assembled materials at liquid interfaces: basics, shear and patches||Complex colloids assembled using capillary interactions: a new route towards active materials","144646||172913||144646||172913||144646||172913","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren: Fortsetzungsgesuche",,"85073125434",,"000496486700015",,"39","Soft Matter","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02020 - Dep.

These photosynthetic organisms comprise more than 4300 marine species, but their biogeographic patterns and the resulting species diversity are poorly known, mostly owing to severe data limitations. Here, we compile, synthesize, and harmonize marine phytoplankton occurrence records from the two largest biological occurrence archives (Ocean Biogeographic Information System; OBIS, and Global Biodiversity Information Facility; GBIF) and three recent data collections. The resulting PhytoBase data set contains over 1.36 million phytoplankton occurrence records (1.28 million at the level of species) for a total of 1711 species, spanning the principal groups of the Bacillariophyceae, Dinoflagellata, and Haptophyta as well as several other groups. This data compilation increases the amount of marine phytoplankton records available through the single largest contributing archive (OBIS) by 65 %. Data span all ocean basins, latitudes and most seasons. Analyzing the oceanic inventory of sampled phytoplankton species richness at the broadest spatial scales possible, using a resampling procedure, we find that richness tends to saturate in the pantropics at ~ 93 % of all species in our database, at ~64% in temperate waters, and at ~ 35 % in the cold Northern Hemisphere, while the Southern Hemisphere remains underexplored. We provide metadata on the cruise, research institution, depth and date of collection for each record, and we include cell-counts for 195 339 records. We strongly recommend consideration of global spatiotemporal biases in sampling intensity and varying taxonomic sampling scopes between research cruises or institutions when analyzing the occurrence database. Including such information into statistical analysis tools, such as species distribution models may serve to project the diversity, niches, and distribution of species in the contemporary and future ocean, opening the door for a quantification of macroecological phytoplankton patterns.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000392415",,"1866-3591",,"10.5194/essd-2019-159","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/392415","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"PHYTOBASE: A global synthesis of open ocean phytoplankton occurrences",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,,"2020-01-21T08:21:35Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Earth syst. sci. data, Pap. open discuss.",,"Earth System Science Data Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We study these effects based on sedimentary records from the last 180 years in five Swiss lakes that differ in trophic state. We compare changes in TOC content and modeled TOC accumulation rates through time to historical data on algae blooms, water column anoxia, wastewater treatment, artificial lake ventilation, and water column phosphorus (P) concentrations. We furthermore investigate the effects of eutrophication on rates of microbial TOC mineralization and vertical distributions of microbial respiration reactions in sediments. Our results indicate that the history of eutrophication is well recorded in the sedimentary record. Overall, eutrophic lakes have higher TOC burial and accumulation rates, and subsurface peaks in TOC coincide with past periods of elevated P concentrations in lake water. Sediments of eutrophic lakes, moreover, have higher rates of total respiration and higher contributions of methanogenesis to total respiration. However, we found strong overlaps in the distributions of respiration reactions involving different electron acceptors in all lakes regardless of lake trophic state. Moreover, even though water column P concentrations have been reduced by ∼ 50 %–90 % since the period of peak eutrophication in the 1970s, TOC burial and accumulation rates have only decreased significantly, by ∼ 20 % and 25 %, in two of the five lakes. Hereby there is no clear relationship between the magnitude of the P concentration decrease and the change in TOC burial and accumulation rate. Instead, data from one eutrophic lake suggest that artificial ventilation, which has been used to prevent water column anoxia in this lake for 35 years, may help sustain high rates of TOC burial and accumulation in sediments despite water column P concentrations being strongly reduced. Our study provides novel insights into the influence of human activities in lakes and lake watersheds on lake sediments as carbon sinks and habitats for diverse microbial respiration processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000370204",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-16-3725-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/370204","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Effects of eutrophication on sedimentary organic carbon cycling in five temperate lakes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-12T09:27:17Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Role of Bioturbation in Controlling Microbial Community Composition and Biogeochemical Cycles in Marine and Lacustrine Sediments","163371","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85073057241",,"000488766100003",,"19","Biogeosciences","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The surface evaporation capacitor approach was used to estimate rainfall partitioning to surface evaporation and leakage into deeper layers. The surface evaporation capacitor estimates a soil‐specific surface evaporation depth and critical storage capacitance that defines rainfall events that exceed local capacitance and result in leakage into deeper layers protected from surface evaporation. A decade‐long record of hydrologic observations in deep and barren lysimeters near Las Vegas revealed the dominance of a few large rainfall events in generating leakage and increasing interannual soil water storage. The surface evaporation capacitor was used to estimate mean annual surface evaporation and leakage protected from surface evaporation in all arid regions globally. About 13% of arid region rainfall contributes to soil water storage (in the absence of vegetation), similar to 11% found in the lysimeter study.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000372745",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2019GL083932","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/372745","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","evaporation||redistribution||aridity||water balance","Surface Evaporation in Arid Regions: Insights From Lysimeter Decadal Record and Global Application of a Surface Evaporation Capacitor (SEC) Model",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-25T04:56:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85071329373",,"000490966700039","Geophys.

We employ multivariate general additive modeling of recent global soil bacterial datasets to elucidate dependencies of bacterial richness on key soil and climatic attributes. Although results support the well-known association between bacterial richness and soil pH, a hierarchy of novel covariates offers surprising new insights. Defining climatic soil water content explains both, the extent and connectivity of aqueous micro-habitats for bacterial diversity and soil pH, thus providing a better causal attribution. Results show that globally rare and abundant soil bacterial phylotypes exhibit different levels of dependency on environmental attributes. Surprisingly, the strong sensitivity of rare bacteria to certain environmental conditions improves their predictability relative to more abundant phylotypes that are often indifferent to variations in environmental drivers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000359440",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-019-48571-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/359440","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A hierarchy of environmental covariates control the global biogeography of soil bacterial richness",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-20T09:44:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The Hidden Frontier: Quantitative Exploration of Physical and Ecological Origins of Microbial Diversity in Soil","320499","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,"85070882125",,"000481747100029","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, secondary organic aerosols (SOA) generated from aromatic precursors were found to sensitize singlet oxygen (1O2), an arguably underappreciated atmospheric ROS. Specifically, we quantified 1O2, OH radical, and H2O2 quantum yields within photoirradiated solutions of laboratory-generated SOA from toluene, biphenyl, naphthalene, and 1,8-dimethylnaphthalene. At 5 mgC L–1 of SOA extracts, the average steady-state concentrations of 1O2 and of OH radicals in irradiated solutions were 3 ± 1 × 10–14 M and 3.6 ± 0.9 × 10–17 M, respectively. Furthermore, ROS quantum yields of irradiated ambient PM10 extracts were comparable to those from laboratory-generated SOA, suggesting a similarity in ROS production from both types of samples. Finally, by using our measured ROS concentrations, we predict that certain organic compounds found in aerosols, such as amino acids, organo-nitrogen compounds, and phenolic compounds have shortened lifetimes by more than a factor of 2 when 1O2 is considered as an additional sink. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of SOA as a source of 1O2 and its potential as a competitive ROS species in photooxidation processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000360365",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.9b01609","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/360365","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Reactive Oxygen Species Production from Secondary Organic Aerosols: The Importance of Singlet Oxygen",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-25T02:14:49Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Environmental photochemistry of amino acid-based biomolecules||Organic aerosols’ impact on aerosol-cloud interactions in mixed-phase clouds","159809||179703","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT||Ambizione",,"85070700501",,"000480370600010","Environ.

The challenging conditions in the Southern Ocean have led to sparse spatial and temporal coverage of observations. This has led to a “knowledge gap” that increases uncertainty in atmosphere and ocean dynamics and boundary-layer thermodynamic processes, impeding improvements in weather and climate models. Improvements will require both process-based research to understand the mechanisms governing air-sea exchange and a significant expansion of the observing system. This will improve flux parameterizations and reduce uncertainty associated with bulk formulae and satellite observations. Improved estimates spanning the full Southern Ocean will need to take advantage of ships, surface moorings, and the growing capabilities of autonomous platforms with robust and miniaturized sensors. A key challenge is to identify observing system sampling requirements. This requires models, Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs), and assessments of the specific spatial-temporal accuracy and resolution required for priority science and assessment of observational uncertainties of the mean state and direct flux measurements. Year-round, high-quality, quasi-continuous in situ flux measurements and observations of extreme events are needed to validate, improve and characterize uncertainties in blended reanalysis products and satellite data as well as to improve parameterizations. Building a robust observing system will require community consensus on observational methodologies, observational priorities, and effective strategies for data management and discovery.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000357867",,"2296-7745",,"10.3389/fmars.2019.00421","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/357867","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Air-sea/Air-sea-ice fluxes||Southern Ocean||Ocean-atmosphere interaction||Climate||Ocean-ice interaction","Constraining Southern Ocean Air-Sea-Ice Fluxes Through Enhanced Observations",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-12T09:03:57Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000477973100001",,,"Frontiers in Marine Science","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, many serpentinitic systems are also physiologically challenging environments due to highly alkaline conditions (pH > 10) and elevated temperatures (>80°C). To elucidate the possibility of microbial life in deep serpentinitic crustal environments, International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 366 drilled into the Yinazao, Fantangisña, and Asùt Tesoru serpentinite mud volcanoes on the Mariana Forearc. These mud volcanoes differ in temperature (80, 150, 250°C, respectively) of the underlying subducting slab, and in the porewater pH (11.0, 11.2, 12.5, respectively) of the serpentinite mud. Increases in formate and acetate concentrations across the three mud volcanoes, which are positively correlated with temperature in the subducting slab and coincide with strong increases in H2 concentrations, indicate a serpentinization-related origin. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that formate is produced by equilibrium reactions with dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) + H2, and that equilibration continues during fluid ascent at temperatures below 80°C. By contrast, the mechanism(s) of acetate production are not clear. Besides formate, acetate, and H2 data, we present concentrations of other SCOAs, methane, carbon monoxide, and sulfate, δ13C-data on bulk carbon pools, and microbial cell counts. Even though calculations indicate a wide range of microbial catabolic reactions to be thermodynamically favorable, concentration profiles of potential energy substrates, and very low cell numbers suggest that microbial life is scarce or absent. We discuss the potential roles of temperature, pH, pressure, and dispersal in limiting the occurrence of microbial life in deep serpentinitic environments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000355178",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2019.01729","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/355178","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Limits of life||Deep biosphere||Serpentinization||Abiotic synthesis||Formate||Acetate||Methane||International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP)","Origin of short-chain organic acids in serpentinite mud volcanoes of the Mariana Convergent Margin",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-07-25T10:03:32Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000477778800001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To better understand the quenching behavior of HDA, we measured HDA quenching rate constants for various humic substance isolates and whole waters with singlet oxygen (1O2) phosphorescence and determined the triplet energy of HDA. Low-temperature phosphorescence measurements determined the triplet energy of HDA to be 217 kJ mol–1, whereas a complementary method based on triplet quenching kinetics found a triplet energy of 184 ± 7 kJ mol–1. Time-resolved 1O2 phosphorescence measurements yielded different HDA quenching rate constants depending on the fitting method. Using an approach that considered the reactivity of the entire triplet pool produced values of (∼1–10) × 108 M–1 s–1, while an approach that considered only the reactivity of the high-energy triplets output higher rate constants ((∼7–30) × 108 M–1 s–1). In addition, the model based on high-energy triplet reactivity found that ∼30–60% of 3CDOM* is not quenched by HDA.

Using our recently developed approach based on observing the radical cation of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) formed through oxidation of TMPD by 3CDOM*, we studied 3CDOM* quenching kinetics with HDA monitored via transient absorption spectroscopy. A competition kinetics-based approach utilizing formation yields of TMPD•+ was developed, validated with model sensitizers, and used to determine bimolecular rate constants between 3CDOM* oxidants and HDA for diverse DOM isolates and natural waters samples, yielding values in the range of (2.4–7.7) × 108 M–1 s–1. The unquenchable fraction of TMPD-oxidizing triplets showed that, on average, 41% of 3CDOM* oxidants cannot be quenched by HDA. Conversely, cycloheptatriene quenched nearly all TMPD•+-forming triplets in CDOM, suggesting that most 3CDOM* oxidants possess energies greater than 150 kJ mol–1. Comparing results with our companion study, we found slight, but noticeable differences in the 3CDOM* quenching rate constants by HDA and unquenchable triplet fractions determined by oxidation of TMPD and energy transfer to O2 (1O2 formation) methods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000356719",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.9b01789","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/356719","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Sorbic Acid as a Triplet Probe: Reactivity of Oxidizing Triplets in Dissolved Organic Matter by Direct Observation of Aromatic Amine Oxidation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-06T02:57:03Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Electron transfer properties of photoexcited natural organic matter","156198","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85069948198",,"000476685500018","Environ.

Studies have examined how bacterial cell density, donor-recipient ratio and nutrient availability affect plasmid transfer rates in homogeneous cultures. The insights are useful, however, they often neglect the ubiquitous physical heterogeneity of natural microbial habitats such as soil environments. Our hypothesis is that unsaturated and dynamic water conditions prevailing in most soils lead to fragmentation of the aquatic bacterial habitat, which could enhance plasmid spread through local (microscale) higher cell densities with reduced competition. However, the biophysical processes at play eschew quantitative observations at the cell level owing to soil complexity and opacity. We report and new microfluidic chip comprised of connected microhabitats that permit external control of aqueous fragmentation and observations at the single-cell level. These elements were used to quantify conjugation events in the microchip at various scales as function of fragmentation dynamics. We used the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida as donor and recipient of a conjugative plasmid carrying a tetracycline resistance gene, while a tagging system with autofluorescent proteins allowed us to distinguish donors and transconjugants with epifluorescence microscopy. We successfully generated various patterns of aqueous fragmentation in the microchips, hence resulting in disconnected aqueous habitats for the bacteria. Plasmid transfer rate in individual microhabitats was linked to local cell densities as well as aqueous and gas phase distribution. This study highlights the importance of microhydrological processes that affect the ecology and evolution of bacteria in natural soil habitats.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000362634",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/362634","en",,"In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Fragmented aqueous habitats affect bacterial plasmid transfer in porous environments",,"Conference Poster","Open access",,,,"2019-09-05T09:04:30Z",,,,,"yes","EMBO | EMBL Symposium on ‘New Approaches and Concepts in Microbiology’ (EMBO|EMBL 2019)","July 10-13, 2019","Heidelberg, Germany",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Bacterial persister cells represent a subpopulation of cells that can survive intensive antibiotic treatment without being resistant. Several approaches have emerged to define and measure persistence, and it is now time to agree on the basic definition of persistence and its relation to the other mechanisms by which bacteria survive exposure to bactericidal antibiotic treatments, such as antibiotic resistance, heteroresistance or tolerance. In this Consensus Statement, we provide definitions of persistence phenomena, distinguish between triggered and spontaneous persistence and provide a guide to measuring persistence. Antibiotic persistence is not only an interesting example of non-genetic single-cell heterogeneity, it may also have a role in the failure of antibiotic treatments. Therefore, it is our hope that the guidelines outlined in this article will pave the way for better characterization of antibiotic persistence and for understanding its relevance to clinical outcomes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000350576",,"1740-1526||1740-1534",,"10.1038/s41579-019-0196-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/350576","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Definitions and guidelines for research on antibiotic persistence",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2019-07-01T02:20:37Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064482369",,"000471747200008","Nat Rev Microbiol","7","Nature Reviews Microbiology","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02030 - Dep.

Soil microbial activity is often concentrated in sparsely distributed hotspots that contribute disproportionally to macroscopic biogeochemical nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas emissions. The mechanistic representation of such dynamic hotspots requires new modeling approaches capable of representing the interplay between dynamic local conditions and the versatile microbial metabolic adaptations. We have developed IndiMeSH (Individual-based Metabolic network model for Soil Habitats) as a spatially explicit model for the physical and chemical microenvironments of soil, combined with an individual-based representation of bacterial motility and growth using adaptive metabolic networks. The model uses angular pore networks and a physically based description of the aqueous phase as a backbone for nutrient diffusion and bacterial dispersal combined with dynamic flux balance analysis to calculate growth rates depending on local nutrient conditions. To maximize computational efficiency, reduced scale metabolic networks are used for the simulation scenarios and evaluated strategically to the genome scale model. IndiMeSH was compared to a well-established population-based spatiotemporal metabolic network model (COMETS) and to experimental data of bacterial spatial organization in pore networks mimicking soil aggregates. IndiMeSH was then used to strategically study dynamic response of a bacterial community to abrupt environmental perturbations and the influence of habitat geometry and hydration conditions. Results illustrate that IndiMeSH is capable of representing trophic interactions among bacterial species, predicting the spatial organization and segregation of bacterial populations due to oxygen and carbon gradients, and provides insights into dynamic community responses as a consequence of environmental changes. The modular design of IndiMeSH and its implementation are adaptable, allowing it to represent a wide variety of experimental and in silico microbial systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000353079",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007127","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/353079","en","PLOS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Modeling metabolic networks of individual bacterial agents in heterogeneous and dynamic soil habitats (IndiMeSH)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-07-13T02:29:10Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85068444960",,"000474703000050","PLOS comput. biol.","6","PLoS Computational Biology","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In recent years, novel observational data sets with a fine taxonomic resolution have become available that allow for the objective classification of observation-driven plankton functional types based on biogeographic, ecological or functional criteria, and the evaluation of marine ecosystem models against these data. We show that novel statistical clustering methods used in combination with extensive observational data sets are successful in determining a minimal number of functional groups based on ecological niche or functional trait characteristics for multiple phyto- and zooplankton groups, and also in the identification of each cluster’s key environmental drivers and ecological niche characteristics. The number of species clusters differs between groups, with mesozooplankton and calcifying phytoplankton requiring a finer taxonomic resolution than the silicifying diatoms. We further show that ocean biomes with similar marine ecosystem structure and biogeochemical function can be determined based on a limited subset of the full marine plankton diversity, thus suggesting that the simplification of biological complexity in models can be successful at reproducing large scale ecological and biogeochemical structure. We argue that future models should include a minimal number of plankton functional types defined based on objective data analysis, with novel imaging and metagenomic data sets containing a wealth of information to be exploited for the development of the next generation of Earth System and climate models.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/392420","en","IMBeR",,,,"An observation-based, objective classification of plankton functional types for use in climate and Earth System models",,"Other Conference Item","Metadata only",,,,"2020-01-21T08:29:08Z",,,,,"yes","2019 IMBeR Future Oceans Open Science Conference","June 17-21, 2019","Brest, France",,,,,,,,,,,"https://whova.com/embedded/session/futur1_201906/648912/",,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, elucidating the mechanism of reactions involving both 1O2 and 3CDOM* can be complicated by the deeply interconnected nature of these two reactive species. In this work, we synthesized a series of model compounds inspired by the chemical structure of fenfuram, a fungicide used in the 1980s, and used them to investigate structure−reactivity relationships in photodegradation reactions involving 1O2 and 3CDOM*. A combination of steady-state and time-resolved approaches was employed to successfully predict the extent of 1O2-induced degradation. Conversely, the prediction of triplet-induced reactivity was complicated by the presence of repair mechanisms whose extent and relative importance were difficult to predict. The results of our work indicate that bimolecular rate constants measured via time-resolved techniques alone are not sufficient to accurately predict environmental half-lives, as intrinsic differences in the reaction mechanism can amplify the importance of secondary degradation pathways.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000361955",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.9b02895","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/361955","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Furan Carboxamides as Model Compounds to Study the Competition between Two Modes of Indirect Photochemistry",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-09-03T02:28:12Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Electron transfer properties of photoexcited natural organic matter","156198","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85071364979",,"000482521600027","Environ.

In particular, polyester textiles washed in the home have shown to release microplastic fibers but challenges with microplastic fiber analysis, including time and difficulty of sample preparation and measurement, has limited mechanistic studies on fiber fate and transport studies. In this study, we provide a method to synthesize fibers with an embedded inorganic (In) fingerprint which can be used as a tracer for ease of analysis and show the utility of this approach to assess the affinity for heteroaggregation between microplastic fibers and other particles in a heterogeneous suspension, as well as approximate the fate of microplastic fibers in batch studies using activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Total In content in the fibers was measured to be 0.2 % by weight, which was low enough to not change fiber dynamics for fate and transport studies (e.g. density, etc.) but provided sensitive detection limits by ICP-MS. Fiber length was 510 μm ± 410 μm and 30 μm in diameter. The incorporated metal remained stable inside the polymer when suspended in water and in activated sludge, with < 0.1 % In leaching over two months. In batch experiments, the majority of fibers were associated with the sludge ( > 99.9 %), with a mass balance of > 95 % recovery achieved on average across batches. Fiber removal linearly increased with contact times of up to 10 min, suggesting interactions between plastics and organic matter is a metric that should be considered closely in this and other environmental contexts for fate and transport.",,,,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2019.02.044","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/469885","en","Elsevier",,,"Plastic||Fiber||Wastewater||Sludge||Analysis","Mechanistic understanding of microplastic fiber fate and sampling strategies: Synthesis and utility of metal doped polyester fibers",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-02-17T08:49:27Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,"The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems","168105","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,,"Water Res.",,"Water Research","155","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These changes are thought to be particularly influential for calcifying phytoplankton, namely, coccolithophores. Coccolithophores are widespread and account for a substantial portion of open ocean calcification; changes in their abundance, distribution, or level of calcification could have far‐reaching ecological and biogeochemical impacts. Here, we isolate the effects of increasing CO2 on coccolithophores using an explicit coccolithophore phytoplankton functional type parameterization in the Community Earth System Model. Coccolithophore growth and calcification are sensitive to changing aqueous CO2. While holding circulation constant, we demonstrate that increasing CO2 concentrations cause coccolithophores in most areas to decrease calcium carbonate production relative to growth. However, several oceanic regions show large increases in calcification, such the North Atlantic, Western Pacific, and parts of the Southern Ocean, due to an alleviation of carbon limitation for coccolithophore growth. Global annual calcification is 6% higher under present‐day CO2 levels relative to preindustrial CO2 (1.5 compared to 1.4 Pg C/year). However, under 900 μatm CO2, global annual calcification is 11% lower than under preindustrial CO2 levels (1.2 Pg C/year). Large portions of the ocean show greatly decreased coccolithophore calcification relative to growth, resulting in significant regional carbon export and air‐sea CO2 exchange feedbacks. Our study implies that coccolithophores become more abundant but less calcified as CO2 increases with a tipping point in global calcification (changing from increasing to decreasing calcification relative to preindustrial) at approximately ∼600 μatm CO2.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000356710",,"1942-2466",,"10.1029/2018MS001483","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/356710","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","ocean acidification||marine calcification||coccolithophores||phytoplankton||climate change","Coccolithophore Growth and Calcification in an Acidified Ocean: Insights From Community Earth System Model Simulations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-08-06T02:55:02Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"SOGate: Phytoplankton ecosystem control of the Southern Ocean biogeochemical gate","153452","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,"85066115775",,"000477717700014",,"5","Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although temperature is considered a key driver of general marine biodiversity, its specific role in phytoplankton diversity has remained unclear. We determined monthly phytoplankton species richness by using niche modeling and >540,000 global phytoplankton observations to predict biogeographic patterns of 536 phytoplankton species. Consistent with metabolic theory, phytoplankton richness in the tropics is about three times that in higher latitudes, with temperature being the most important driver. However, below 19°C, richness is lower than expected, with ~8°– 14°C waters (~35° to 60° latitude) showing the greatest divergence from theoretical predictions. Regions of reduced richness are characterized by maximal species turnover and environmental variability, suggesting that the latter reduces species richness directly, or through enhancing competitive exclusion. The nonmonotonic relationship between phytoplankton richness and temperature suggests unanticipated complexity in responses of marine biodiversity to ocean warming.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000344965",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.aau6253","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/344965","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Global pattern of phytoplankton diversity driven by temperature and environmental variability",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-06-01T02:30:15Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85065869076",,"000470125000017","Sci Adv","5","Science Advances","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The rate of change of Canth is estimated using a new method that combines the extended multiple linear regression method with improvements to address the challenges of analyzing multiple occupations of sections spaced irregularly in time. The Canth accumulation rate over the top 1,500 m of the Pacific increased from 8.8 (±1.1, 1σ) Pg of carbon per decade between 1995 and 2005 to 11.7 (±1.1) PgC per decade between 2005 and 2015. For the entire Pacific, about half of this decadal increase in the accumulation rate is attributable to the increase in atmospheric CO2, while in the South Pacific subtropical gyre this fraction is closer to one fifth. This suggests a substantial enhancement of the accumulation of Canth in the South Pacific by circulation variability and implies that a meaningful portion of the reinvigoration of the global CO2 sink that occurred between ~2000 and ~2010 could be driven by enhanced ocean Canth uptake and advection into this gyre. Our assessment suggests that the accuracy of Canth accumulation rate reconstructions along survey lines is limited by the accuracy of the full suite of hydrographic data and that a continuation of repeated surveys is a critical component of future carbon cycle monitoring.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000348409",,"0886-6236||1944-9224",,"10.1029/2018GB006154","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/348409","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Pacific Anthropogenic Carbon Between 1991 and 2017",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-06-19T02:14:02Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000470318300005","Glob. biogeochem. cycles","5","Global Biogeochemical Cycles","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Some of these technologies have been available for years while others have only recently emerged. Use of these technologies is critical to improve understanding of the processes that control abundances, distributions and composition of plankton, provide data necessary to constrain and improve ecosystem and biogeochemical models, and forecast changes in marine ecosystems in light of climate change. In this paper we begin by providing the motivation for plankton observations, quantification and diversity qualification on a global scale. We then expand on the state-of-the-art, detailing a variety of relevant and (mostly) mature technologies and measurements, including bulk measurements of plankton, pigment composition, uses of genomic, optical and acoustical methods as well as analysis using particle counters, flow cytometers and quantitative imaging devices. We follow by highlighting the requirements necessary for a plankton observing system, the approach to achieve it and associated challenges. We conclude with ranked action-item recommendations for the next 10 years to move toward our vision of a holistic ocean-wide plankton observing system. Particularly, we suggest to begin with a demonstration project on a GO-SHIP line and/or a long-term observation site and expand from there, ensuring that issues associated with methods, observation tools, data analysis, quality assessment and curation are addressed early in the implementation. Global coordination is key for the success of this vision and will bring new insights on processes associated with nutrient regeneration, ocean production, fisheries and carbon sequestration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000343600",,"2296-7745",,"10.3119/fmars.2019.00196","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/343600","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","plankton||imaging||OceanObs||autonomous platforms||global observing||EOVs||ECVs","Globally Consistent Quantitative Observations of Planktonic Ecosystems",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2019-05-23T04:24:29Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000467010900001",,,"Frontiers in Marine Science","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet our understanding of their efficacy is often limited because it is measured for a few biological components, typically top predators or species of commercial interest. To achieve conservation targets, marine protected areas can benefit from ecosystem-based approaches. Within such an approach, documenting the variation of plankton indicators and their covariation with climate is crucial as plankton represent the base of the food webs. With this perspective, we sought to document the variations in the emerging properties of the plankton to better understand the dynamics of the pelagic fishes, mammals and seabirds that inhabit the region. For the first time, we analyze the temporal variations of the entire plankton community of one of the widest European protected areas, the Parc Naturel Marin de la Mer d’Iroise. We used data from several sampling transects carried out in the Iroise Sea from 2011 to 2015 to explore the seasonal and inter-annual variations of phytoplankton and mesozooplankton abundance, composition and size, as well as their covariation with abiotic variables, through multiple multivariate analyses. Overall, our observations are coherent with the plankton dynamics that have been observed in other regions of the North-East Atlantic. We found that both phytoplankton and zooplankton show consistent seasonal patterns in taxonomic composition and size structure but also display inter-annual variations. The spring bloom was associated with a higher contribution of large chain-forming diatoms compared to nanoflagellates, the latter dominating in fall and summer. Dinoflagellates show marked inter-annual variations in their relative contribution. The community composition of phytoplankton has a large impact on the mesozooplankton together with the distance to the coast. The size structure of the mesozooplankton community, examined through the ratio of small to large copepods, also displays marked seasonal patterns. We found that larger copepods (members of the Calanidae) are more abundant in spring than in summer and fall. We propose several hypotheses to explain the observed temporal patterns and we underline their importance for understanding the dynamics of other components of the food-web (such as sardines). Our study is a first step toward the inclusion of the planktonic compartment into the planning of the resources and diversity conservation within the Marine Protected Area.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000341187",,"2296-7745","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/389118||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/341187","10.3389/fmars.2019.00214","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/341187||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/389192","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Plankton||Marine Protected Area||size structure||Seasonality||Copepod","The Seasonal and Inter-Annual Fluctuations of Plankton Abundance and Community Structure in a North Atlantic Marine Protected Area",,"Journal Article","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences",,"2019-05-08T10:54:30Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064661606",,"000465455700002",,,"Frontiers in Marine Science","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Understanding these processes requires analytical approaches that allow for characterizing the reactivity of iron oxides toward reduction under controlled thermodynamic boundary conditions. Here, we used mediated electrochemical reduction (MER) to follow changes in iron oxide reduction extents and rates during abiotic ferrous iron-induced transformation of six-line ferrihydrite. Transformation experiments (10 mM ferrihydrite-FeIII) were conducted over a range of solution conditions (pHtrans = 6.50 to 7.50 at 5 mM Fe2+ and for pHtrans = 7.00 also at 1 mM Fe2+) that resulted in the transformation of ferrihydrite into thermodynamically more stable goethite or magnetite. The changes in iron oxide mineralogy during the transformations were quantified using X-ray diffraction analysis. MER measurements on iron oxide suspension aliquots collected during the transformations were performed over a range of pHMER at constant applied reduction potential. The extents and rates of iron oxide reduction in MER decreased with decreasing reaction driving force resulting from both increasing pHMER and increasing transformation of ferrihydrite into thermodynamically more stable iron oxides. We show that the decreases in iron oxide reduction extents and rates during ferrihydrite transformations can be linked to the concurrent changes in iron oxide mineralogy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000338554",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.8b07190","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338554","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Electrochemical Analysis of Changes in Iron Oxide Reducibility during Abiotic Ferrihydrite Transformation into Goethite and Magnetite",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-04-18T01:02:56Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85063092665",,"000463679600024","Environ.

In the present study, we improve the accuracy of FCM for enumerating microorganisms inhabiting diverse lake and marine sediment types based on extensive tests with FCM settings, extraction buffer chemical compositions, cell separation methods, and staining procedures. Tests on the FCM settings, (e.g., acquisition time, rates of events) and salinity of extraction solutions show minor impacts on FCM enumerations and yields of cell extraction, respectively. Existing methods involving hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment to release sediment-attached cells into solution prove effective on both marine and freshwater samples. Yet, different staining techniques (direct staining of cell extracts, staining of membrane-filtered cell extracts) produce clear differences in cell number estimates. We demonstrate that, while labor-intensive membrane-staining generates high cell staining efficiency and accurate cell counts that are consistent across FCM and epifluorescence microscopy-based (EFM) quantification methods, accurate cell counts determined by more time- and labor-efficient direct staining require consideration of dye concentration, sample dilution, and lithology. Yet, good agreement between the two staining methods can be achieved through sample-specific adjustments of dye concentrations and sample dilutions during direct staining. We thus present a complete protocol for FCM-based cell quantification, that includes all steps from the initial sample fixation to the final enumeration, with recommendations for buffer compositions, direct and membrane-based staining procedures, and the final FCM assay. This protocol is versatile, accurate, and reliable, as is evident from good agreement with cell quantifications by EFM and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of 16S rRNA genes across a wide range of sedimentary sample types.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000338396",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2019.00720","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338396","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","microbial populations||lacustrine||marine||cell counts||staining technique||flow cytometry||epifluorescence microscopy","Improving the Accuracy of Flow Cytometric Quantification of Microbial Populations in Sediments: Importance of Cell Staining Procedures",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-04-17T00:53:32Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000463827400001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The ecological risk assessment of these emerging pesticides necessitates an understanding of the fate of dsRNA molecules in receiving environments, among which agricultural soils are most important. We herein present an experimental approach using phosphorus-32 (32P)-radiolabeled dsRNA that allows studying key fate processes of dsRNA in soils with unprecedented sensitivity. This approach resolves previous analytical challenges in quantifying unlabeled dsRNA and its degradation products in soils. We demonstrate that 32P-dsRNA and its degradation products are quantifiable at concentrations as low as a few nanograms of dsRNA per gram of soil by both Cerenkov counting (to quantify total 32P-activity) and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by phosphorimaging (to detect intact 32P-dsRNA and its 32P-containing degradation products). We show that dsRNA molecules added to soil suspensions undergo adsorption to soil particle surfaces, degradation in solution, and potential uptake by soil microorganisms. The results of this work on dsRNA adsorption and degradation advance a process-based understanding of the fate of dsRNA in soils and will inform ecological risk assessments of emerging dsRNA pesticides.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000334575",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.8b05576","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/334575","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Environmental Fate of RNA Interference Pesticides: Adsorption and Degradation of Double-Stranded RNA Molecules in Agricultural Soils",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-03-29T04:21:05Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Environmental fate of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) from RNA interference crop protection technology in agricultural systems: A systematic assessment of dsRNA hydrolysis, adsorption, and photolysis","707432","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,"85062484171",,"000462098000011","Environ.

The SMARTS irradiance spectra were validated against measurements from several high-resolution spectroradiometers, and the updated irradiance reference spectra use current measurements for atmospheric species that can affect the irradiance that reaches the Earth's surface. These updated irradiance spectra are provided in 1 nm increments from 280 to 800 nm for 0° to 70° latitude at 10° increments in both the northern and southern hemisphere. Lastly, the influence of the input parameters on the modeled irradiance spectra was investigated. This work will allow users to calculate more accurate photodegradation half-lives using the updated irradiance reference spectra, and it also provides insight for users to calculate their own location- and time-specific irradiance spectra using SMARTS.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000334978",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/c8em00478a","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/334978","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Updated and validated solar irradiance reference spectra for estimating environmental photodegradation rates",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-03-31T02:22:24Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85063331388",,"000461883400002","Environ Sci Process Impacts","3","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Together with the continental counterparts of MTFFZs, these structures also pose a risk to human societies as they can generate high magnitude earthquakes and trigger tsunamis. Historical examples are the Sumatra-Wharton Basin Earthquake in 2012 (M8.6) and the Atlantic Gloria Fault Earthquake in 1941 (M8.4). Earthquakes at MTFFZs furthermore open and sustain pathways for fluid flow triggering reactions with the host rocks that may permanently change the rheological properties of the oceanic lithosphere. In fact, they may act as conduits mediating vertical fluid flow and leading to elemental exchanges between Earth’s mantle and overlying sediments. Chemicals transported upward in MTFFZs include energy substrates, such as H2 and volatile hydrocarbons, which then sustain chemosynthetic, microbial ecosystems at and below the seafloor. Moreover, up- or downwelling of fluids within the complex system of fractures and seismogenic faults along MTFFZs could modify earthquake cycles and/or serve as “detectors” for changes in the stress state during interseismic phases. Despite their likely global importance, the large areas where transform faults and fracture zones occur are still underexplored, as are the coupling mechanisms between seismic activity, fluid flow, and life. This manuscript provides an interdisciplinary review and synthesis of scientific progress at or related to MTFFZs and specifies approaches and strategies to deepen the understanding of processes that trigger, maintain, and control fluid flow at MTFFZs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000338825",,"2296-6463",,"10.3389/feart.2019.00039","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338825","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","transform faults||fractures zones||coupling of seismicity and fluid flow||microbial life||heat flow||fluid geochemistry||seafloor observation systems||seismic precursors","Marine transform faults and fracture zones: A joint perspective integrating seismicity, fluid flow and life",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2019-04-20T04:13:50Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064213557",,"000467231500001","Front.

From previous studies, they seem susceptible to oxidation by singlet oxygen (1O2); therefore, we designed and synthesized model oxazole- and thiazole-peptides and measured their 1O2 bimolecular reaction rate constants, showing slow photooxidation under environmental conditions. We reasoned their stability through the electron-withdrawing effect of the carboxamide substituent. Reaction products were elucidated and support a reaction mechanism involving cycloaddition followed by a series of rearrangements. The first 1O2 bimolecular reaction rate constant for a RiPP, the thiazole-containing peptide Aerucyclamide A, was measured and found in good agreement with the model peptide’s rate constant, highlighting the potential of using model peptides to study the transformations of other environmentally relevant NRPs and RiPPs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000333312",,"0022-3263||1520-6904",,"10.1021/acs.joc.8b02684","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/333312","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Singlet Oxygen Photooxidation of Peptidic Oxazoles and Thiazoles",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-03-23T02:15:53Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Environmental photochemistry of amino acids, peptides and proteins","138008","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,"000460491600006","J.

However, recent evidence suggests that sulfur cycling can predominate even under ferruginous conditions. In this study, we investigated the potential for bacterial iron and sulfur metabolisms in the iron-rich (1.2 mM dissolved Fe2+), sulfate-poor (< 20 μM) Lake Pavin which is expected to host large populations of iron-reducing and iron-oxidizing microorganisms influencing the mineralogy of iron precipitates in its permanently anoxic bottom waters and sediments. 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries from at and below the oxycline revealed that highly diverse populations of sulfur/sulfate-reducing (SRB) and sulfur/sulfide-oxidizing bacteria represented up to 10% and 5% of the total recovered sequences in situ, respectively, which together was roughly equivalent to the fraction of putative iron cycling bacteria. In enrichment cultures amended with key iron phases identified in situ (ferric iron phosphate, ferrihydrite) or with soluble iron (Fe2+), SRB were the most competitive microorganisms, both in the presence and absence of added sulfate. The large fraction of Sulfurospirillum, which are known to reduce thiosulfate and sulfur but not sulfate, present in all cultures was likely supported by Fe(III)-driven sulfide oxidation. These results support the hypothesis that an active cryptic sulfur cycle interacts with iron cycling in the lake. Analyses of mineral phases showed that ferric phosphate in cultures dominated by SRB was transformed to vivianite with concomitant precipitation of iron sulfides. As colloidal FeS and vivianite have been reported in the monimolimnion, we suggest that SRB along with iron-reducing bacteria strongly influence iron mineralogy in the water column and sediments of Lake Pavin.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000327420",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0212787","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/327420","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Microbial diversity||Biogeochemical cycles","Microbial diversity involved in iron and cryptic sulfur cycling in the ferruginous, low-sulfate waters of Lake Pavin",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-25T10:27:35Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85062036388",,"000459709100139","PLoS ONE","2","PLoS ONE","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Marine I and Se emissions and subsequent atmospheric wet deposition has been suggested to be an important source of I and Se to soils and terrestrial food chains. However, the contribution of recycled moisture of continental origin to I and Se to precipitation has never been analyzed. Here we report concentrations and speciation of I and Se, as well as of bromine (Br), sulfur (S), and DOC-δ13C signatures for weekly collected precipitation samples (in the period of April 2015 to September 2016) at two high altitude sites, i.e., Jungfraujoch (JFJ; Switzerland) and Pic du Midi (PDM; France). Analysis of precipitation chemistry and moisture sources indicate combined marine and continental sources of precipitation and Se, I, Br, and S at both sites. At JFJ, concentrations of I and Se were highest when continental moisture sources were dominant, indicating important terrestrial sources for these elements. Furthermore, correlations between investigated elements and DOC-δ13C, particularly when continental moisture source contributions were high, indicate a link between these elements and the source of dissolved organic matter, especially for I (JFJ and PDM) and Se (JFJ).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000322419",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.8b05533","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322419","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Marine versus continental sources of iodine and selenium in rainfall at two European high-altitude locations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-01T09:11:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85061860435",,"000459642500019","Environ.

The previously used Atkins–Richman macrocyclization method generally gives lower yields and requires more tedious purification of the product. Solvent, palladium source, ligand, and concentration have all been varied to optimize the yields of two key 12-membered ring bioactive compounds, CADA and VGD020. The new approach tolerates a wide range of functional groups and gives highest yields for symmetrical compounds in which the acidities of the two sulfonamide groups are matched, although the yields of unsymmetrical compounds are still generally good. The method has also been extended to the synthesis of 11-membered rings, pyridine-fused macrocycles, and products bearing an ester or aryl substituent on the exocyclic double bond.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000322310",,"2470-1343",,"10.1021/acsomega.8b02555","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322310","en","American Chemical Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Tsuji-Trost Cyclization of Disulfonamides: Synthesis of 12-Membered, 11-Membered, and Pyridine-Fused Macrocyclic Triamines",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-01T04:45:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060184209",,"000460214700137","ACS Omega","1","ACS Omega","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Transfer of conjugative plasmids among soil bacteria is an important evolutionary driver for fostering adaptation to environmental stresses such as antibiotic or xenobiotic contamination. However, plasmids impose a metabolic burden on host cells and the reason for their persistence over evolutionary times remains unclear. Here, we hypothesize that soil environments favor plasmid maintenance due to habitat fragmentation and nutrient spatial heterogeneity that promote plasmid transfer rates and reduce competition in microniches. We aim to test that hypothesis and disentangle the contributions of transmission and selection. Materials and Methods. The soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida was used as donor and recipient of the conjugative plasmid pIPO2tet (conferring resistance to tetracycline). A tagging system with fluorescent proteins allowed us to visually discriminate recipients, donors and transconjugants using microscope image analysis and plating on selective media. Bacteria were grown in controlled systems of varying complexity, from agar surfaces to micromodels, and in presence or absence of tetracycline as a selective agent. Results. Experiments on homogeneous agar surfaces showed that transfer rate and the final size of the plasmid-carrying population increased with cell density, while competition (as measured by selection coefficient) tended to decrease. The presence of antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations also affected plasmid transfer rate and selection. To address the role of spatial isolation of microhabitats, we have designed micromodels that allow us to observe local variations in the spread of bacterial plasmids, with results still pending. Conclusions. Local (microscale) conditions such as cell density and spatial confinement can enhance or suppress plasmid transfer among bacterial populations, as well as affect the selective effects of carrying a plasmid. The study offers new insights linking soil microhabitats to ecological and evolutionary adaptations of soil bacteria.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000338408",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/338408","en","Swiss Society for Microbiology","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Cell distribution and habitat fragmentation affecting the spread of plasmids in soil bacterial populations",,"Conference Poster","Open access",,,,"2019-04-17T07:39:43Z",,,,,"yes","7th Swiss Microbial Ecology Meeting (SME 2019)","January 30 - February 1,2019","Lausanne, Switzerland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These photosynthetic organisms comprise more than 4300 marine species, but their biogeographic patterns and the resulting species diversity are poorly known, mostly owing to severe data limitations. Here, we compile, synthesize, and harmonize marine phytoplankton occurrence data from the two largest biological occurrence archives (Ocean Biogeographic Information System; OBIS, and Global Biodiversity Information Facility; GBIF) and three recent data collections. The resulting PhytoBase data set contains over 1.36 million marine phytoplankton occurrence records (1.28 million at the level of species) for a total of 1717 species, spanning the principal groups of the Bacillariophyceae, Dinoflagellata, and Haptophyta as well as several other groups. This data compilation increases the amount of phytoplankton occurrence data available through the single largest contributing archive (OBIS) by 65%. Data span all ocean basins, latitudes and most seasons. Analyzing the oceanic inventory of sampled phytoplankton species richness at the broadest spatial scales possible, using a resampling procedure, we find that richness tends to saturate in the pantropics at ~93% of all species in our database, at ~64% in temperate waters, and at ~35% in the cold Northern Hemisphere, while the Southern Hemisphere remains underexplored. We provide metadata on the cruise, research institution, depth, and date for each occurrence record. Cell-counts for 195 339 records are also included. We strongly recommend consideration of global spatiotemporal biases in sampling intensity and varying taxonomic sampling scopes between research programs when analyzing the occurrence database. Including such information into statistical analysis tools, such as species distribution models, may serve to project the diversity, niches, and distribution of species in the contemporary and future ocean, opening the door for a quantification of macro-ecological phytoplankton patterns.",,,,"1866-3591",,"10.1594/PANGAEA.904397","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/392418","en","PANGAEA - Data Publisher for Earth & Environmental Science",,,"abundance data||autotrophic organisms||global ocean||marine microbes||occurrence data||species richness||taxonomic harmonization","PHYTOBASE: A global synthesis of open ocean phytoplankton occurrences",,"Dataset","Metadata only",,,,"2020-01-21T08:24:56Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Earth syst. sci. data, Pap. open discuss.",,"Earth System Science Data Discussions",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The processes controlling this variability have not yet been investigated consistently across all four major EBUSs, i.e., the California (CalCS), Humboldt (HumCS), Canary (CanCS), and Benguela (BenCS) Current systems. In this study, we diagnose the climatic modes of the air–sea CO2 flux variability in these regions between 1920 and 2015, using simulation results from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LENS), a global coupled climate model ensemble that is forced by historical and RCP8.5 radiative forcing. Differences between simulations can be attributed entirely to internal (unforced) climate variability, whose contribution can be diagnosed by subtracting the ensemble mean from each simulation. We find that in the CalCS and CanCS, the resulting anomalous CO2 fluxes are strongly affected by large-scale extratropical modes of variability, i.e., the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), respectively. The CalCS has anomalous uptake of CO2 during the positive phase of the NPGO, while the CanCS has anomalous outgassing of CO2 during the positive phase of the NAO. In contrast, the HumCS is mainly affected by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), with anomalous uptake of CO2 during an El Niño event. Variations in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) are the major contributors to these anomalous CO2 fluxes and are generally driven by changes to large-scale gyre circulation, upwelling, the mixed layer depth, and biological processes. A better understanding of the sensitivity of EBUS CO2 fluxes to modes of climate variability is key in improving our ability to predict the future evolution of the atmospheric CO2 source and sink characteristics of the four EBUSs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000322762",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-16-329-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/322762","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"On the role of climate modes in modulating the air–sea CO2 fluxes in eastern boundary upwelling systems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-02-03T04:32:47Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85060631905",,"000456710800002",,"2","Biogeosciences","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

CPs are produced by nonspecific chlorination of \textit{n}-alkane mixtures. Therefore, they are a complex class of compounds of tens of thousands of different isomers. CPs can differ in carbon chain length (C10-C30) and degree of chlorination (30-70 m/m%Cl}). They are categorized according to their chain length into short-chain (SCCPs, C10-C13), medium-chain (MCCPs, C14-C17) and long-chain CPs (LCCPs, C≥18). CPs are high production volume chemicals (>1000000 t/a) of emerging environmental concern. SCCPs are persistent, bioaccumulative, subject to long-range transport and toxic. In 2017, SCCPs have been listed as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) under the United Nations Stockholm Convention.  Due to their complexity, the analysis of CPs is challenging. Several issues are associated with CP analysis, including (a) chromatographic co-elution of the many isomers, (b) unknown composition of CP standard materials, and (c) broad and complex isotopic clusters often resulting in interfered mass spectra. These issues get worse in presence of CP transformation products. Up to now, CP research mainly focused on reporting SCCP levels in different matrices. Only few studies dealt with their environmental toxicity and the identification of transformation pathways and products. Even fewer studies, reported respective data for MCCPs. Almost no studies are available for LCCPs. Risk assessments and discussions about the regulation of CPs are impeded by the many analytical uncertainties and, hence, the lack of robust data. It is crucial that analytical issues are addressed and solved, and comprehensive data about the fate of CP is generated. The focus of this thesis is on the development of new analytical methods to investigate CPs and potential transformation pathways and transformation products. CPs are considered persistent in the environment and, hence, their abiotic and biotic transformation is slow. This thesis considered thermal exposure during the application of CPs as an important transformation pathway and this subject was herein investigated. In the first part of this thesis, thermal transformation products of CPs were identified by mass spectrometric (MS) analysis using thermally aged chlorinated tridecane mixtures. Direct liquid injection coupled to chloride-enhanced atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) was the method of choice. This method forces the formation of pseudo-molecular chloride-adduct ions without fragmentation and, therefore, is highly suited to investigate CPs and their transformation, when applied in full scan mode. It was found that thermal exposure of CPs causes the elimination of HCl, resulting in chlorinated olefins (COs) with one or more double bonds. Isotope clusters of CP and CO isomers of the same chain length and degree of chlorination strongly interfere even at a moderately high mass resolution of R≈10000. This so called CP/CO problem was tackled by developing a mathematical deconvolution method that resolves interfered mass spectra of CPs and COs. This method derives a linear combination of theoretical CP and CO isotope clusters that best describes the measured cluster. This information was then used to deduce non-interfered CP/CO data. The deconvolution method was later extended to resolve contributions of chlorinated diolefins as well, which is needed to describe highly aged materials, too. In the second part of this thesis, a variety of analytical methods were assessed and compared for their capability to deal with the CP/CO problem. This assessment was based on a common set of thermally exposed chlorinated tridecanes. It was found that novel methods based on liquid chromatography (LC) or direct liquid injection coupled to soft ionization MS methods are suited best to study transformation processes of CPs. The LC-based methods rely on adduct ion formation and, thus, suppress fragmentation reactions that could interfere with the detection of CP transformation products. High-resolution MS (HRMS), with mass resolution of R≈100000, was identified as the preferred method to assess CP/CO mixtures with strongly overlapping isotopic patterns. If HRMS at R≈100000 is not available, the presented deconvolution method was proven to be a reliable alternative. Conventionally, CPs are analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to electron capture negative ionization (ECNI) MS. This thesis could demonstrate that ECNI produces a variety of CP fragment ions, which results in complicated mass spectra, and induces a substantial in-source fragmentation of CPs to COs. Thus, it is not possible to distinguish COs, that are present in the sample, from COs, that are formed in the ion source, due to chromatographic co-elution of CPs and COs. Hence, GC-ECNI-MS is not suited to investigate transformation reactions of CPs that could lead to a formation of COs. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the widely used selected ion monitoring method (SIM) can overlook severe CP/CO mass interferences. Depending on the mass accuracy, this can lead to an over- or underestimation of CP levels. Only full scan methods could reveal CP/CO mass interferences. The third part of this thesis assessed commercially available CP standard materials for their capability to quantify CPs and for their application in CP transformation and toxicity studies. Mostly complex mixtures, containing CPs of different chain lengths, are used for quantification. However, herein, it was demonstrated that CP chain length patterns of standard materials and samples can substantially differ, affecting a correct quantification. An improved quantification method based on pattern deconvolution with single-chain CP mixtures was presented. However, such standard materials are only available for SCCPs. It was highlighted that MCCPs, LCCPs and even very long-chain CPs (vLCCPs, C≥21) can dominate environmental samples. However, no single-chain CP mixtures and almost no constitutionally defined CP standard materials are available for MCCPs and LCCPs. So far, for vLCCPs, no analytical materials are available at all. It was discussed how CP materials of lower complexity, e.g., single-chain CP mixtures and constitutionally defined CPs, can be applied for studying the toxicity and transformation of CPs. With such materials, the influence of carbon chain length, degree of chlorination, chlorine substitution pattern and stereochemistry can be investigated. In the final part of this thesis, the new analytical methods and deconvolution procedures were applied. A single-chain CP mixture of chlorinated tridecanes was used to study the thermolysis of CPs at different temperatures in detail. A LC-based MS method, applying chloride-enhanced soft ionization, was applied to study non-exposed and exposed material. Non-interfered CP/CO data was derived by the mathematical deconvolution of interfered isotope clusters. It was found that thermolysis of CPs follows first-order kinetics. Determined degradation rates and half-lives suggested that CPs with a higher degree of chlorination degrade faster when exposed to heat. Degradation rates increased with increasing temperatures (160-220 °C). The same approach was also applied to study the degradation of chlorinated tridecanes during metal working applications. COs could be identified as CP transformation products formed during metal drilling, when CPs are in contact with freshly cut, hot metal surfaces. Overall, this thesis provides detailed insights into the thermal degradation of CPs to COs. Analytical issues related with the CP/CO analysis were assessed and solutions were presented. This thesis identified the lack of representative CP standard material as the major limitation when studying the fate of longer-chain CPs and their transformation products, which will be needed for a comprehensive risk assessment of MCCPs, LCCPs and vLCCPs in the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000344250",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/344250","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"New Analytical Methods for Investigating the Fate of Chlorinated Paraﬃns and Their Transformation Products",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2019-05-27T14:40:09Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"26012",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Enterococcus faecalis is a leading cause of local and disseminated multidrug-resistant hospital infections, but the molecular mechanisms used by this non-motile bacterium to penetrate surfaces and translocate through tissues remain largely unexplored. Here we present experimental evidence indicating that E. faecalis generates exopolysaccharides containing β-1,6-linked poly-N-acetylglucosamine (polyGlcNAc) as a mechanism to successfully penetrate semisolid surfaces and translocate through human epithelial cell monolayers. Genetic screening and molecular analyses of mutant strains identified glnA, rpiA and epaX as genes critically required for optimal E. faecalis penetration and translocation. Mechanistically, GlnA and RpiA cooperated to generate uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) that was utilized by EpaX to synthesize polyGlcNAc-containing polymers. Notably, exogenous supplementation with polymeric N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) restored surface penetration by E. faecalis mutants devoid of EpaX. Our study uncovers an unexpected mechanism whereby the RpiA-GlnA-EpaX metabolic axis enables production of polyGlcNAc-containing polysaccharides that endow E. faecalis with the ability to penetrate surfaces. Hence, targeting carbohydrate metabolism or inhibiting biosynthesis of polyGlcNAc-containing exopolymers may represent a new strategy to more effectively confront enterococcal infections in the clinic.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000328692",,"1553-7374||1553-7366",,"10.1371/journal.ppat.1007571","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/328692","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"PolyGlcNAc-containing exopolymers enable surface penetration by non-motile Enterococcus faecalis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-03-03T03:31:55Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85062011313",,"000459972100023","PLoS Pathog","2","PLoS Pathogens","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We reviewed the basic principles of water infiltration in soils and we analyzed approaches commonly used in land surface models (LSMs) to quantify infiltration as well as its numerical implementation and sensitivity to model parameters. We reviewed methods to upscale infiltration from the point to the field, hillslope, and grid cell scales of LSMs. Despite the progress that has been made, upscaling of local-scale infiltration processes to the grid scale used in LSMs is still far from being treated rigorously. We still lack a consistent theoretical framework to predict effective fluxes and parameters that control infiltration in LSMs. Our analysis shows that there is a large variety of approaches used to estimate soil hydraulic properties. Novel, highly resolved soil information at higher resolutions than the grid scale of LSMs may help in better quantifying subgrid variability of key infiltration parameters. Currently, only a few LSMs consider the impact of soil structure on soil hydraulic properties. Finally, we identified several processes not yet considered in LSMs that are known to strongly influence infiltration. Especially, the impact of soil structure on infiltration requires further research. To tackle these challenges and integrate current knowledge on soil processes affecting infiltration processes into LSMs, we advocate a stronger exchange and scientific interaction between the soil and the land surface modeling communities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000351286",,"1539-1663",,"10.2136/vzj2018.10.0191","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/351286","en","SSSA","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Infiltration from the Pedon to Global Grid Scales: An Overview and Outlook for Land Surface Modeling",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2019-07-04T02:22:05Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000472523800001","Vadose Zone J.","1","Vadose Zone Journal","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Methane is responsible for most of the climatic impact of lakes and impoundments due to its high global warming potential. In lacustrine sediments and the anoxic water column methane is produced in large quantities as a final step of organic matter degradation, which is further enhanced by anthropogenic eutrophication of freshwaters. This methane accumulates in oxygen-depleted hypolimnia of stratified lakes, which may reach the atmosphere through different pathways. The major methane sink in the lake are methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB), which oxidize the methane with oxygen to carbon dioxide. But, most oxygen and methane found in stratified lakes are separated from each other. Oxygen decreases towards the anoxic hypolimnion in which methane starts to increase. Although MOB would be expected to be found directly at the interface of the oxygen and methane reservoirs, MOB are in fact found throughout the water column. This raises the question whether MOB taxa show preferences and adaptations to the different environmental conditions within the counter gradient. Diverse MOB in the water column belonging to distinct phylogenetic groups, mainly Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, are generally thought to be responsible for methane oxidation in lakes. A comprehensive knowledge on the ecology of the MOB taxa involved is still missing. Upon autumn lake overturn the methane-rich bottom water is mobilized and transported to the surface layer from where methane may evade into the atmosphere. How much methane outgasses upon autumn overturn is a matter of controversy. The amount of methane outgassing will depend on the response of the MOB assemblage to lake overturn in terms of growth and activity, which remains to be investigated. In future, the number of lakes with methane-rich hypolimnia may increase due to ongoing eutrophication of freshwaters. Therefore, a comprehensive knowledge on the fate of stored methane in permanently and transitionally stratified lakes is paramount. How adaptive MOB are to different environmental conditions is critical for the amount of lacustrine methane reaching the atmosphere. The aim of this thesis was to improve the ecological understanding of the structure and function of the MOB assemblage along the vertical oxygen-methane counter gradient of stratified lakes and the dynamics of the MOB assemblage upon disintegration of the counter gradient during autumn overturn. The vertical distribution of MOB taxa and activity along the oxygen-methane counter gradient were investigated in four eutrophic Swiss lakes (Rotsee, Greifensee, Lake Zug, Lake Lugano). A comprehensive study of the MOB response to autumn overturn and their methane oxidation kinetics was performed in Rotsee. To achieve this, molecular methods, incubations with (radio-) isotopes and physico-chemical measurements were applied. In the present thesis it was shown that the water column of stratified lakes is inhabited by an active MOB assemblage, which changes along the oxygen-methane counter gradient. This indicates specialization within the counter gradient. Further, niche preferences for some common lacustrine MOB taxa were proposed. In conclusion, a structured MOB assemblage presumably based on niche-specific adaptations sustains methane oxidation in the water column. During lake overturn in Rotsee the cooling and expanding mixed layer incorporated methane-rich water from the hypolimnion. This overturn process made oxygen and methane available simultaneously and MOB were able to take advantage and grew to high abundances, thereby oxidizing most of the methane entering the mixed layer. But, the MOB assemblage present during stratification was almost entirely replaced during the autumn overturn. Especially the bottom assemblage was severely reduced. In this chapter is was shown that a new MOB assemblage responded fast enough to lake overturn, which is why most of the mobilized methane was not released to the atmosphere. The same period was tested for differences in methane oxidation kinetics between epi- and hypolimnion, which were found to differ both in space and time. This finding supports the view that ecologically different MOB taxa inhabit the stratified lakes in space and time. High affinity variants of the particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) were not detected and the main enzyme transcribed was conventional pMMO. Overall, the results in this thesis suggest that a diverse MOB assemblage, which is spatially and temporally structured, provides an effective methane filter during lake stratification and lake overturn. New insights into the ecology of prevalent and uncultured MOB taxa at a high taxonomic resolution within stratified lakes are given. Many MOB taxa within Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Ca. Methylomirabilis limnetica were detected repeatedly, suggesting that a core set of lacustrine MOB taxa forms the effective methane filter in lakes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000409050",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/409050","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Methane oxidation||Methane emission||METHANOTROPHY + METHANOTROPHIC MICROORGANISMS (MICROBIOLOGY)||niche partitioning||FRESHWATER BIOLOGY + FRESHWATER ECOLOGY (ECOLOGY)||Lake stratification||Lake overturn||AQUATISCHE MIKROBIOLOGIE + AQUATISCHE MIKROORGANISMEN||aquatic microbial ecology||Ecophysiology||Amplicon sequencing||pmoA||metagenomics + metatranscriptomics","Ecology of the aquatic methane filter: Vertical distribution and temporal dynamics of active methanotroph assemblages in stratified lakes",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2020-04-08T15:14:52Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"26154",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Due to the difference in the saturation vapor pressure over ice and water, in mixed-phase clouds (MPCs), ice will grow at the expense of supercooled cloud droplets. As such, MPCs, which contain both supercooled liquid and ice, are particularly susceptible to ice formation. However, measuring and quantifying the concentration of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) responsible for ice formation at temperatures associated with MPCs is challenging due to their very low concentrations in the atmosphere (∼1 in 105 at −30 ∘C). Atmospheric INP concentrations vary over several orders of magnitude at a single temperature and strongly increase as temperature approaches the homogeneous freezing threshold of water. To further quantify the INP concentration in nature and perform systematic laboratory studies to increase the understanding of the properties responsible for ice nucleation, a new drop-freezing instrument, the DRoplet Ice Nuclei Counter Zurich), is developed. The instrument is based on the design of previous drop-freezing assays and uses a USB camera to automatically detect freezing in a 96-well tray cooled in an ethanol chilled bath with a user-friendly and fully automated analysis procedure. Based on an in-depth characterization of DRINCZ, we develop a new method for quantifying and correcting temperature biases across drop-freezing assays. DRINCZ is further validated performing NX-illite experiments, which compare well with the literature. The temperature uncertainty in DRINCZ was determined to be ±0.9 ∘C. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of DRINCZ by measuring and analyzing field-collected snow samples during an evolving synoptic situation in the Austrian Alps. The field samples fall within previously observed ranges for cumulative INP concentrations and show a dependence on air mass origin and upstream precipitation amount.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000387469",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-12-6865-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387469","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Development of the DRoplet Ice Nuclei Counter Zurich (DRINCZ): Validation and application to field-collected snow samples",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-04T03:33:08Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Elucidating Ice Nucleation Mechanisms Relevant to the Atmosphere: Is deposition nucleation really immersion freezing in pores?","156581","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85077113053",,"000504011300004","Atmos. meas. tech.","12","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This is partly because information on the relationship between dams and water quality is relatively sparse and fragmentary, especially for low-latitude developing countries where dam building is now concentrated. In this paper, we review and synthesize information on the effects of damming on water quality with a special focus on low latitudes. We find that two ultimate physical processes drive most water quality changes: the trapping of sediments and nutrients, and thermal stratification in reservoirs. Since stratification emerges as an important driver and there is ambiguity in the literature regarding the stratification behavior of water bodies in the tropics, we synthesize data and literature on the 54 largest low-latitude reservoirs to assess their mixing behavior using three classification schemes. Direct observations from literature as well as classifications based on climate and/or morphometry suggest that most, if not all, low-latitude reservoirs will stratify on at least a seasonal basis. This finding suggests that low-latitude dams have the potential to discharge cooler, anoxic deep water, which can degrade downstream ecosystems by altering thermal regimes or causing hypoxic stress. Many of these reservoirs are also capable of efficient trapping of sediments and bed load, transforming or destroying downstream ecosystems, such as floodplains and deltas. Water quality impacts imposed by stratification and sediment trapping can be mitigated through a variety of approaches, but implementation often meets physical or financial constraints. The impending construction of thousands of planned low-latitude dams will alter water quality throughout tropical and subtropical rivers. These changes and associated environmental impacts need to be better understood by better baseline data and more sophisticated predictors of reservoir stratification behavior. Improved environmental impact assessments and dam designs have the potential to mitigate both existing and future potential impacts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000341175",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-16-1657-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/341175","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Reviews and syntheses: Dams, water quality and tropical reservoir stratification",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2019-05-08T10:51:49Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85064982309",,"000465606600001",,"8","Biogeosciences","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It includes a sectional aerosol model that tracks the sulfate particle size distribution in 40 size bins, between 0.39 nm and 3.2 µm. Sheng et al. (2015) showed that SOCOL-AERv1 successfully matched observable quantities related to stratospheric aerosol. In the meantime, SOCOL-AER has undergone significant improvements and more observational datasets have become available. In producing SOCOL-AERv2 we have implemented several updates to the model: adding interactive deposition schemes, improving the sulfate mass and particle number conservation, and expanding the tropospheric chemistry scheme. We compare the two versions of the model with background stratospheric sulfate aerosol observations, stratospheric aerosol evolution after Pinatubo, and ground-based sulfur deposition networks. SOCOL-AERv2 shows similar levels of agreement as SOCOL-AERv1 with satellite-measured extinctions and in situ optical particle counter (OPC) balloon flights. The volcanically quiescent total stratospheric aerosol burden simulated in SOCOL-AERv2 has increased from 109 Gg of sulfur (S) to 160 Gg S, matching the newly available satellite estimate of 165 Gg S. However, SOCOL-AERv2 simulates too high cross-tropopause transport of tropospheric SO2 and/or sulfate aerosol, leading to an overestimation of lower stratospheric aerosol. Due to the current lack of upper tropospheric SO2 measurements and the neglect of organic aerosol in the model, the lower stratospheric bias of SOCOL-AERv2 was not further improved. Model performance under volcanically perturbed conditions has also undergone some changes, resulting in a slightly shorter volcanic aerosol lifetime after the Pinatubo eruption. With the improved deposition schemes of SOCOL-AERv2, simulated sulfur wet deposition fluxes are within a factor of 2 of measured deposition fluxes at 78 % of the measurement stations globally, an agreement which is on par with previous model intercomparison studies. Because of these improvements, SOCOL-AERv2 will be better suited to studying changes in atmospheric sulfur deposition due to variations in climate and emissions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000364139",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-12-3863-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/364139","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Improved tropospheric and stratospheric sulfur cycle in the aerosol-chemistry-climate model SOCOL-AERv2",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-09-16T02:45:27Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85072040521",,"000484164300001","Geosci. model dev.","9","Geoscientific Model Development","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the effect of photochemistry on the propensity of organic matter to participate in the initial cloud-forming steps is difficult to predict. In this study, we quantify on a molecular scale the effect of photochemical exposure of naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (DOM) and of a fulvic acid standard on its cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nucleation (IN) activity. We find that photochemical processing, equivalent to 4.6 d in the atmosphere, of DOM increases its ability to form cloud droplets by up to a factor of 2.5 but decreases its ability to form ice crystals at a loss rate of −0.04 ∘CT50 h−1 of sunlight at ground level. In other words, the ice nucleation activity of photooxidized DOM can require up to 4 ∘C colder temperatures for 50 % of the droplets to activate as ice crystals under immersion freezing conditions. This temperature change could impact the ratio of ice to water droplets within a mixed-phase cloud by delaying the onset of glaciation and by increasing the supercooled liquid fraction of the cloud, thereby modifying the radiative properties and the lifetime of the cloud. Concurrently, a photomineralization mechanism was quantified by monitoring the loss of organic carbon and the simultaneous production of organic acids, such as formic, acetic, oxalic and pyruvic acids, CO and CO2. This mechanism explains and predicts the observed increase in CCN and decrease in IN efficiencies. Indeed, we show that photochemical processing can be a dominant atmospheric ageing process, impacting CCN and IN efficiencies and concentrations. Photomineralization can thus alter the aerosol–cloud radiative effects of organic matter by modifying the supercooled-liquid-water-to-ice-crystal ratio in mixed-phase clouds with implications for cloud lifetime, precipitation patterns and the hydrological cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000372246",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-19-12397-2019","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/372246","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Photomineralization mechanism changes the ability of dissolved organic matter to activate cloud droplets and to nucleate ice crystals",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-10-23T02:30:12Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Environmental photochemistry of amino acid-based biomolecules","159809","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85073470280",,"000489561300001","Atmos. chem. phys.","19","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) and terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (BIM), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ. For the last decade available (2009–2018), EFF was 9.5±0.5 GtC yr−1, ELUC 1.5±0.7 GtC yr−1, GATM 4.9±0.02 GtC yr−1 (2.3±0.01 ppm yr−1), SOCEAN 2.5±0.6 GtC yr−1, and SLAND 3.2±0.6 GtC yr−1, with a budget imbalance BIM of 0.4 GtC yr−1 indicating overestimated emissions and/or underestimated sinks. For the year 2018 alone, the growth in EFF was about 2.1 % and fossil emissions increased to 10.0±0.5 GtC yr−1, reaching 10 GtC yr−1 for the first time in history, ELUC was 1.5±0.7 GtC yr−1, for total anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 11.5±0.9 GtC yr−1 (42.5±3.3 GtCO2). Also for 2018, GATM was 5.1±0.2 GtC yr−1 (2.4±0.1 ppm yr−1), SOCEAN was 2.6±0.6 GtC yr−1, and SLAND was 3.5±0.7 GtC yr−1, with a BIM of 0.3 GtC. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 407.38±0.1 ppm averaged over 2018. For 2019, preliminary data for the first 6–10 months indicate a reduced growth in EFF of +0.6 % (range of −0.2 % to 1.5 %) based on national emissions projections for China, the USA, the EU, and India and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. Overall, the mean and trend in the five components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959–2018, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr−1 persist for the representation of semi-decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. A detailed comparison among individual estimates and the introduction of a broad range of observations shows (1) no consensus in the mean and trend in land use change emissions over the last decade, (2) a persistent low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) an apparent underestimation of the CO2 variability by ocean models outside the tropics. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new global carbon budget and the progress in understanding of the global carbon cycle compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Quéré et al., 2018a, b, 2016, 2015a, b, 2014, 2013).

Their metalloenzyme methane monooxygenase (MMO) catalyses the first oxidation step converting methane to methanol. Its most prevalent form is the copper-dependent particulate pMMO, however, some MOB are also able to express the iron-containing, soluble sMMO under conditions of copper scarcity. So far, the link between copper availability in different forms and biological methane consumption in freshwater systems is poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution profiles of MOB abundance and pMMO and sMMO functional genes in relation to copper, methane and oxygen profiles across the oxic-anoxic boundary of a stratified lake. We show that even at low nanomolar copper concentrations, MOB species containing the gene for pMMO expression are present at high abundance. The findings highlight the importance of copper as a micronutrient for MOB species and the potential usage of copper acquisition strategies, even under conditions of abundant iron, and shed light on the spatial distribution of these microorganisms.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000334531",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-019-40642-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/334531","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Aerobic methane oxidation under copper scarcity in a stratified lake",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-03-29T04:04:19Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85063048435",,"000461418400002","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide and accounts for about 75% of the climate impact of lakes. The only process that reduces methane emissions from lakes is the oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria. This diverse group of bacteria has the unique ability to use methane and oxygen to gain energy and produce biomass.  Aim of this dissertation was to improve our understanding of the ecology of these bacteria and their importance to prevent methane emissions from freshwater lakes. From the outset, the interdisciplinary project was designed to complement field studies with modelling. The focus was in particular on the methane dynamics during the autumnal overturn of stratified lakes. During this critical phase, large amounts of methane that accumulate in the anoxic hypolimnion during stratification are transported to the surface.  In the studied lake, methanotrophic bacteria were able to oxidise about 98% of the methane accumulated in the hypolimnion before it reached the atmosphere. Using model simulations, we showed that this high percentage was a result of the convectively driven deepening of the thermocline that kept methane fluxes on average at about 27% of the microbial methane oxidation capacity. A scenario analysis with modified meteorological data suggested that microbial methane oxidation is fairly robust even at higher mixing velocities.  In a next step, the thesis addressed the observed diversity and seasonal succession of methanotrophic bacteria. Using a radioactive tracer and metatranscriptomics, we showed that the different communities that dominate methane oxidation in the period of autumn overturn differ significantly in their methane oxidation kinetics.   In a final step, we have developed a model for niche differentiation of methanotrophic bacteria in stratified lakes and showed that differences in methane oxidation kinetics can explain at least some of the observed diversity. However, a systematic analysis of the trait combinations that allowed coexistence revealed that these combinations were confined to very narrow regions in the parameter space. We argue that convergence to physiologically limited trait combinations may be a mechanism that ensures that these combinations of traits arise.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000423771",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/423771","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Modelling perspectives on microbial methane oxidation in stratified lakes",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2020-06-30T10:08:45Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"26384",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This progress has culminated in molecular monitoring methods being employed for the detection of several species for enforceable management purposes of endangered, invasive, and illegally harvested species worldwide. However, the routine application of DNA-based methods to monitor whole communities (typically a metabarcoding approach) in order to assess the status of ecosystems continues to be limited. In aquatic ecosystems, the limited use is particularly true for macroinvertebrate communities. As part of the DNAqua-Net consortium, a structured discussion was initiated with the aim to identify potential molecular methods for freshwater macroinvertebrate community assessment and identify important knowledge gaps for their routine application. We focus on three complementary DNA sources that can be metabarcoded: 1) DNA from homogenised samples (bulk DNA), 2) DNA extracted from sample preservative (fixative DNA), and 3) environmental DNA (eDNA) from water or sediment. We provide a brief overview of metabarcoding macroinvertebrate communities from each DNA source and identify challenges for their application to routine monitoring. To advance the utilisation of DNA-based monitoring for macroinvertebrates, we propose an experimental design template for a series of methodological calibration tests. The template compares sources of DNA with the goal of identifying the effects of molecular processing steps on precision and accuracy. Furthermore, the same samples will be morphologically analysed, which will enable the benchmarking of molecular to traditional processing approaches. In doing so we hope to highlight pathways for the development of DNA-based methods for the monitoring of freshwater macroinvertebrates.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000502266",,"2534-9708","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502278||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502266","10.3897/mbmg.3.34735","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502460","en","Pensoft Publishers","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bulk DNA||community||DNAqua-Net||environmental DNA||experimental methods||fixative DNA||monitoring||Water Framework Directive","Advancing the use of molecular methods for routine freshwater macroinvertebrate biomonitoring – the need for calibration experiments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-26T09:38:53Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85078671673",,,,,"Metabarcoding and Metagenomics","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite being some of the tiniest organisms on Earth, they drive as much as half of global primary production. However, the functional and ecological consequences of phytoplankton species diversity have been poorly known, as global diversity patterns of these microbes have been among the least characterized throughout the history of ecology. To determine global patterns and drivers of phytoplankton diversity, this thesis combines ocean-sourced data with statistical models, developed specifically to address data sparseness.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000383503",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/383503","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Species richness||Phytoplankton||Species distribution modeling||Latitudinal diversity gradient||Vulnerability assessment||Ocean warming||Ecological theory||Cell size||Biodiversity and ecosystem functioning","Global biodiversity patterns of marine phytoplankton",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences",,"2019-12-06T15:35:06Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"26167",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Methane oxidizing bacteria in the water column act as a converter, oxidizing methane into carbon dioxide and biomass before it reaches the atmosphere. Current observations and estimates of this methane oxidation efficiency are diverging, especially for the lake overturn period. Here we combine a model of turbulent mixing, gas exchange and microbial growth with a comprehensive data set for autumn mixing to quantify the relevant physical and microbial processes. We show that the microbial methane converter is effectively transforming the increased methane flux during the overturn period. Only rare events of pronounced surface cooling in combination with persistently strong wind can trigger substantial outgassing. In the context of climate change, these results suggest that changes in the frequency of storms may be even more important for methane emissions from temperate lakes than gradual warming.","text/csv||text/plain","10.3929/ethz-b-000350091",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/350091","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Lake overturn as a key driver for methane oxidation",,"Data Collection","Open access",,,"2016-10-01/2017-02-01","2019-06-27T10:35:15Z",,"indefinite","292278994-08-17T07:12:55Z",,"yes",,,,"Lake Rotsee","47.0705","8.3157",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite the vast environmental importance of SCOAs, many questions remain open concerning the controls on their environmental turnover. This is true for acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which have been the subject of many past investigations, as well as for formate, which is the focus of this dissertation. To better elucidate the controls on environmental formate turnover, I therefore combined detailed analyses on natural geochemical gradients, experimental incubations, thermodynamic calculations, and a newly developed assay targeting a marker gene of formate cycling, the alpha subunit of formate hydrogenase (fdhA).  In my first research chapter, I investigated formate turnover in Swiss lake sediment based on analyses of natural samples and batch incubations with added 13C-formate (Chapter 2). The batch experiments indicate rapid conversion of formate to H2 and HCO3-, and that this process is catalyzed by microbial cells rather than free enzymes. This interpretation is supported by calculations indicating that formate conversion to H2 and HCO3- is an exergonic process with free energies around the minimum that can be conserved by microorganisms. Additional incubations of marine sediments, activated sludge, anaerobic digester sludge, and river water indicate that similar mechanisms control formate cycling in other anaerobic environments, but that formate turnover operates differently in the presence of O2. Furthermore, fdhA analyses indicate the genetic potential for formate cycling to be common, with fdhA gene copy numbers in the same range as total 16S rRNA genes, and widespread among phylogenetically diverse, mostly unknown lacustrine sediment microorganisms. To follow up on the results from marine sediments, I next compared formate turnover to the turnover of acetate, propionate, butyrate in sulfate reducing and methanogenic sediment from Aarhus Bay (Chapter 3). My results indicate that formate is turned over by a similar mechanism as in lake sediment, i.e. via the conversion to H2 and HCO3-, and that the turnover rate of formate is not only vastly higher than for the other SCOAs, but also higher in methanogenic than in sulfate reducing sediment. By contrast, no significant increases in H2 or formate concentrations occurred in acetate, propionate and butyrate treatments, suggesting complete oxidation by single microorganisms and/or presence of highly efficient syntrophic consortia that leak minimal amounts of interspecies electron carriers to growth media. As in lake sediment, gene copy numbers of fdhA are in a range comparable to total 16S rRNA genes, and occur across a phylogenetically diverse number of groups.  In the final research chapter, I investigated a transect of serpentinite mud volcanoes in the Mariana Convergent Margin to shed light into the origin of short-chain organic acids, H2, and methane and their potential to sustain microbial life in these mud volcanoes. My results indicate that high amounts of H2, formate, acetate, and methane are produced by and/or are an indirect outcome of serpeninitic weathering of mantle rock in the underlying subducting slab. Hereby concentrations of these compounds correlate with slab temperatures, and formate and acetate concentrations in mud fluids follow an Arrhenius-type, exponential relationship with temperature in the subducting slab. Unlike lacustrine and marine sediments, formate is at thermodynamic equilibrium with H2 and HCO3-. Thus, the elevated concentrations of formate can be explained with formate equilibration with H2 produced by serpentinization. By contrast, the drivers behind the elevated acetate and methane concentrations are uncertain. Furthermore, even though calculations indicate a wide range of microbial metabolic reactions to be thermodynamically favorable, I find no evidence of an active microbial biosphere.  Overall, this thesis presents new insights into the role and microbial turnover mechanisms of formate, as well as other SCOAs, H2, and methane in seafloor and lacustrine environments. Results can be used for further research by increasing the sequencing depth of available fdhA genes form various environments and samples. This would be highly beneficial to investigate the change of relative abundance in various sediment types and redox conditions and to identify patterns in abundance to see if diversity is due to the redox state and dominating terminal respiration process, or maybe correlated with other parameters like depth and/or diagenetic status of organic matter. Confirmation of the here presented proposal of abiotic serpentinite driven acetate production mechanisms are of interest for further research on origin of life and for astrobiologists, serpentinization in ubiquitous on other planets and acetate is an important energy substrate for known catabolism.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000373058",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/373058","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Microbial cycling of formate and other low-molecular weight aliphatic organic acids in anoxic environments",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences",,"2019-10-27T17:00:56Z","2022-10-28",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"25963",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
