However, intensive animal production relies on the regular use of antimicrobials to maintain health and productivity on farms. The routine use of antimicrobials fuels the development of antimicrobial resistance, a growing threat for the health of humans and animals. Monitoring global trends in antimicrobial use is essential to track progress associated with antimicrobial stewardship efforts across regions. We collected antimicrobial sales data for chicken, cattle, and pig systems in 41 countries in 2017 and projected global antimicrobial consumption from 2017 to 2030. We used multivariate regression models and estimated global antimicrobial sales in 2017 at 93,309 tonnes (95% CI: 64,443, 149,886). Globally, sales are expected to rise by 11.5% in 2030 to 104,079 tonnes (95% CI: 69,062, 172,711). All continents are expected to increase their antimicrobial use. Our results show lower global antimicrobial sales in 2030 compared to previous estimates, owing to recent reports of decrease in antimicrobial use, in particular in China, the world’s largest consumer. Countries exporting a large proportion of their production are more likely to report their antimicrobial sales data than countries with small export markets. © 2020 by the authors.

Td case studies introduce students to key features of transdisciplinarity. Two corresponding learning goals of the case studies are 1. to not only analyse problems, but to also suggest solutions, and 2. to take the complexity of the tackled socio-ecological system into account. In the new course we address both learning goals by integrating systems and design thinking. We present this approach in detail to show how features of transdisciplinarity are transferred to learning contexts. We compare it to the approaches of other td case studies by asking how each interprets and addresses the two learning goals. The comparison shows that the case study approaches implicitly impart different ideas about how a td environmental scientist should support societal problem solving. A key difference to previous approaches is that the new course asks students to enter deeply into the world of practice and the stakeholders' divergent needs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000458794",,"0940-5550",,"10.14512/gaia.29.4.11","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458794","en","Oekom Verlag","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","case study||design thinking||systems thinking||teaching||transdisciplinarity||transformation knowledge||Umweltproblemlosen","Integrating systems and design thinking in transdisciplinary case studies",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-01-01T04:22:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85098721877",,"000599833500010","Gaia","4","GAIA - Ecological Perspectives for Science and Society","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we compared routines for antibiotic use between pig farms of two different levels of intensification in Khon Kaen province in Thailand. Among the 113 family-owned small-scale farms (up to 50 sows) interviewed did 76% get advice from the pharmacy about how to use the antibiotics and 84% used it primarily for treating disease. Among the 51 medium-scale-farms (100–500 sows) belonging to two companies did 100% get advice about antibiotic use from the company’s veterinarian (P<0.0001) and 94% used antibiotics mostly as disease preventive measure (P<0.0001). In 2 small scale farms 3rd generation cephalosporins, tylosin or colistin were used; antibiotics belonging to the group of highest priority critically important antimicrobials for human medicine. Enrofloxacin, belonging to the same group of antimicrobials, was used in 33% of the small-scale and 41% of the medium-scale farms. In the latter farms, the companies supplied 3–4 antibiotics belonging to different classes and those were the only antibiotics used in the farms. The median and mean estimated expenditure on antibiotics per sow was 4.8 USD (IQR = 5.8) for small-scale farms and 7 USD and 3.4 USD for the medium-scale farms belonging to the two respective companies. Our observations suggest to target the following areas when pig farming transitions from small-scale to medium-scale: (i) strengthening access to professional animal health services for all farmers, (ii) review of the competence and role of veterinary pharmacies in selling antibiotics and (iii) adjustment of farming company animal health protocols towards more medically rational use of antibiotics. © 2020 Hallenberg et al.

On the one hand, policy stakeholders require reliable, high-quality information in order to make well-informed decisions in a timely manner, while on the other, creation of sound scientific information upon which such decisions can and should be made, requires time and thoroughness. As a result, uncertainty plays a crucial role when it comes to integrating scientific information into the decision-making process.  To explore further the ways in which uncertainty affects decision-making, the ESPREssO Project developed a serious game for disaster risk reduction (DRR) stakeholders to “play,” termed RAMSETE III. It aims to assess how uncertainty impacts processing of early warning information and subsequent decision-making (such as ordering evacuations), embedded within a fictitious geographic, policy and practice setting. Serious gaming can serve as an useful tool to allow stakeholders with very different backgrounds to work closer together in a simulated environment. Different operational timescales and misunderstandings arising from differing perceptions of risk and uncertainty between policy stakeholders and scientists, are identified as key barriers hindering effective integration of policy and science in disaster management. Hence, RAMSETE III was employed to initiate open discourse between DRR stakeholders across the science-policy spectrum.  The main outcome of this game emphasizes that to overcome these identified barriers, a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and inclusive approach is needed as a first-step foundation, with enhanced efforts in communication and development of common terminologies to assist strengthening of mutual understanding.",,,,"2212-4209",,"10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101802","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444639","en","Elsevier",,,"Uncertainty||Decision-making||Disaster risk reduction||Serious games||Science-policy Divide","Using serious gaming to explore how uncertainty affects stakeholder decision-making across the science-policy divide during disasters",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2019-12-10T09:14:28Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Enhancing Synergies for disaster PRevention in the EurOpean Union","700342||700342","10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100007352","SBFI||SBFI","H2020||H2020",,,"85090025444",,"000599711000008",,,"International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","51","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements. However, they are still expensive to build and maintain, a significant challenge, especially for small and medium-sized cities that are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and cost-effectively. Here, we present a machine learning based method for predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000458056",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0242010","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458056","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Learning from urban form to predict building heights",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-12-22T10:05:09Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85097840599",,"000598626100003","PLoS ONE","12","PLoS ONE","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we develop a framework to assess the fitness of a climate model for providing understanding. The framework is based on three dimensions: representational accuracy, representational depth, and graspability. We show that this framework does justice to the intuition that classical process-based climate models give understanding of phenomena. While simple climate models are characterized by a larger graspability, state-of-the-art models have a higher representational accuracy and representational depth. We then compare the fitness-for-providing understanding of process-based to data-driven models that are built with machine learning. We show that at first glance, data-driven models seem either unnecessary or inadequate for understanding. However, a case study from atmospheric research demonstrates that this is a false dilemma. Data-driven models can be useful tools for understanding, specifically for phenomena for which scientists can argue from the coherence of the models with background knowledge to their representational accuracy and for which the model complexity can be reduced such that they are graspable to a satisfactory extent.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000441066",,"0039-3681",,"10.1016/j.shpsa.2020.08.003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/441066","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Understanding||Climate models||Machine learning||Data-driven models||Representation||Grasping","Understanding climate phenomena with data-driven models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-09-17T15:00:42Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Combining theory with Big Data?

While retrospective scenario studies show that multi-organization, multi-model scenario ensembles increase the diversity of considered uncertainties, it remains unclear whether such ensembles align with the perspectives of transition stakeholders, including the wider public. This study compares a multi-organization, multi-model ensemble of 82 Swiss electricity supply scenarios for 2035 from a review of 19 studies between 2011 and 2018 with preferred scenarios from three samples of stakeholders: citizens from an online survey (N=61), informed citizens from participatory workshops (N=46), and energy experts from another online survey (N=60). The results show that most informed citizens and experts preferred an almost 100% domestic renewable electricity supply in Switzerland in 2035. On the contrary, most model-based scenarios relied significantly on fossil fuel-based generation and net electricity imports. Possible reasons for this misalignment include the lack of broad stakeholder participation in the development of such scenarios and the modeling choices such as cost-optimization models that are known to underrepresent renewable electricity. For both scenario developers and users, this study offers a word of caution that even a rich scenario ensemble could focus on alternatives that are not preferred by stakeholders and that diverse stakeholder and public perspectives can enrich scenario ensembles. For the Swiss electricity supply transition, the results indicate that a large-scale deployment of renewable electricity before 2035 is preferred by the expert and citizen samples and, therefore, such scenarios should be modeled more in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,,"1364-0321",,"10.1016/j.rser.2020.110297","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/439501","en","Elsevier",,,"Scenarios||Electricity supply||Stakeholder perspectives||Scenario choice||Energy system models||Public preferences","Models on the wrong track: Model-based electricity supply scenarios in Switzerland are not aligned with the perspectives of energy experts and the public",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2020-09-10T05:50:04Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Risk governance of electricity portfolios (RIGOROuS): Cross-technology and spatial tradeoffs of multiple risks","160563","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione Energie",,,"85090166568",,"000582927200040","Renew. sustain. energy rev.",,"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","134","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

An integrative behavior model incorporating various psychological and socio-structural variables was applied to explain the ratio of organic vs. non-organic purchases. The theory of planned behavior was considered fundamental for the development of this integrative model, and supplementary variables were included, accounting for moral justifications, education level, income, and further aspects. The resulting model accounted for 42% of the variance of organic food consumption. Financial and environmental justifications for purchasing non-organic food resulted as the most important predictors, followed by recent consumption changes, health-related aspects of attitudes and social norms, perceived behavioral control, environmental values, income, and education level. The participants considered more knowledge and information and having more money at their disposal to be important requirements for achieving more environmentally friendly and healthier food consumption. Furthermore, they considered having more time to prepare meals oneself as particularly important to achieving healthier food consumption.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429178",,"0959-6526",,"10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.123058","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429178","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Organic food||Healthy nutrition||Sustainable food consumption||Environmental awareness||Behavioral decision-making","Increasing organic food consumption: An integrating model of drivers and barriers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-07-30T07:36:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85088382759",,"000579495100087","J Cleaner Prod.",,"Journal of Cleaner Production","275","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This is particularly important considering the potential relationships between CCA and DRR activities at the regional, national, European and global levels.  Serious games have emerged as a valuable tool to communicate information and catalyse discussion in many policy arenas. The games have the power to inform, mainly by exposing strengths and weaknesses of a system but not necessarily create policy choices. This paper presents the development process and rationale behind creation of RAMSETE I, a serious game developed by and for the ESPREssO Project to elicit information from its stakeholders in aiming to inform synergies between CCA and DRR sectors. The results assess its application as a device to frame discussions during an international Think Tank workshop. The serious game focused on three particular aspects of CCA and DRR policy interactions: (1) separation of administrative responsibilities and the use of different terminology, (2) the ongoing competition for funding and political will as well as (3) difficulties regarding the top-down implementation of policies.  The rules and design process are presented briefly, before going in-depth into the information gleaned during its application in the workshop.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000406584",,"2212-4209","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/384246||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/298241","10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101782","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/406584","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Assessing policy preferences amongst climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction stakeholders using serious gaming",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2018-10-23T13:09:52Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85090026013",,"000599711000005",,,"International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","51","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While early warning systems are frequently used to predict the magnitude, location, and timing of potentially damaging events, these systems rarely provide impact estimates, such as the expected amount and distribution of physical damage, human consequences, disruption of services, or financial loss. Complementing early warning systems with impact forecasts has a twofold advantage: It would provide decision makers with richer information to take informed decisions about emergency measures and focus the attention of different disciplines on a common target. This would allow capitalizing on synergies between different disciplines and boosting the development of multihazard early warning systems. This review discusses the state of the art in impact forecasting for a wide range of natural hazards. We outline the added value of impact‐based warnings compared to hazard forecasting for the emergency phase, indicate challenges and pitfalls, and synthesize the review results across hazard types most relevant for Europe.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450154",,"8755-1209||0096-1043||1944-9208",,"10.1029/2020rg000704","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450154","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Impact Forecasting to Support Emergency Management of Natural Hazards",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-11-07T13:23:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85097976344",,"000603664800002","Rev.

Our results indicate that global warming has already more than doubled both the global land area and the global population annually exposed to all six categories of extreme events considered: river floods, tropical cyclones, crop failure, wildfires, droughts, and heatwaves. Global warming of 2°C relative to preindustrial conditions is projected to lead to a more than fivefold increase in cross‐category aggregate exposure globally. Changes in exposure are unevenly distributed, with tropical and subtropical regions facing larger increases than higher latitudes. The largest increases in overall exposure are projected for the population of South Asia.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000458719",,"2328-4277",,"10.1029/2020EF001616","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458719","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Projecting Exposure to Extreme Climate Impact Events Across Six Event Categories and Three Spatial Scales",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-12-30T03:52:53Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85097993623",,"000603662300006",,"12","Earth's Future","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These models can provide decision-relevant predictions, but confident decision-making requires that the involved uncertainties are understood. We argue that existing frameworks for characterizing uncertainties are not appropriate for data-driven models because of their focus on distinct locations of uncertainty. We propose a framework for uncertainty assessment that uses argument analysis to assess the justification of the assumption that the model is fit for the predictive purpose at hand. Its flexibility makes the framework applicable to data-driven models. The framework is illustrated using a case study from environmental science. We show that data-driven models can be subject to substantial second-order uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty in the assessment of the predictive uncertainty, because they are often applied to ill-understood problems. We close by discussing the implications of the predictive uncertainties of data-driven models for decision-making.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000440519",,"1364-8152||1873-6726",,"10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104754","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/440519","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Argument-based assessment of predictive uncertainty of data-driven environmental models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-09-15T03:53:16Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Combining theory with Big Data?

By contrast, the demand side is usually underrepresented, often emphasising technological options for energy efficiency improvements. In this perspective, we argue that scientific support to climate action is not only about exploring capacity of “what”, in terms of policy and outcome, but also about assessing feasibility and desirability, in terms of “when”, “where” and especially for “whom”. Without the necessary behavioural and societal transformations, the world faces an inadequate response to the climate crisis challenge. This could result from poor uptake of low-carbon technologies, continued high-carbon intensive lifestyles, or economy-wide rebound effects. For this reason, we propose a framing for a holistic and transdisciplinary perspective on the role of human choices and behaviours in influencing the low-carbon transition, starting from the desires of individuals and communities, and analysing how these interact with the energy and economic landscape, leading to systemic change at the macro-level. In making a case for a political ecology agenda, we expand our scope, from comprehending the role of societal acceptance and uptake of end-use technologies, to co-developing knowledge with citizens from non-mainstream and marginalised communities, and to defining the modelling requirements to assess the decarbonisation potential of shifting lifestyle patterns in climate change and action.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000442897",,"2214-6296",,"10.1016/j.erss.2020.101780","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/442897","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Integrated assessment modeling||Transdisciplinary research||Behavioral change||Lifestyle||Climate policy||Deliberative democracy","The desirability of transitions in demand: Incorporating behavioural and societal transformations into energy modelling",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-09-27T02:47:51Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Shaping Interdisciplinary Practices in Europe","822705","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85091262003",,"000596625800011",,,"Energy Research & Social Science","70","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Meeting this demand without converting remaining natural ecosystems or further degrading ecosystems is one of the largest global sustainability challenges. A critical step to overcoming this challenge is to increase the productivity of livestock grazing systems, which occupy the largest land area of any type of agriculture globally. Integrated crop−livestock systems (iCL), which re-couple crop and livestock production at the farm scale, have been considered a promising strategy to tackle this challenge by restoring degraded pasturelands and providing supplemental nutrition to livestock. However, few studies have analyzed the economic viability of such systems, especially in Brazil, an important player in global food systems. This paper presents an economic analysis of iCL in Mato Grosso, Brazil, the largest grain and beef producer in the country, which spans the ecologically diverse Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes. We compare the economic performance of an integrated soybean/corn and beef cattle system to a continuous crop (soybean/corn) system and a continuous livestock (beef cattle) production system from 2005 to 2012. We use empirical case study data to characterize a ‘typical’ farm for each production system within the study region. We find that the integrated crop−livestock system has a higher annual net present value (NPV) per hectare (ha) than continuous cropping or livestock under a range of discount rates. However, under a scenario of substantially higher crop prices, the continuous cropping outperforms iCL. While iCL is not feasible in all regions of the Amazon and Cerrado, our results indicate that in places where the biophysical and market conditions are suitable for production, it could be a highly profitable way to intensify cattle production and potentially spare land for other uses, including conservation. Nevertheless, additional credit and technical support may be needed to overcome high upfront costs and informational barriers to increase iCL areas as a sustainable development strategy for agriculture in the Amazon and Cerrado regions.",,,,"1742-1705||1742-1713",,"10.1017/s1742170519000280","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/392516","en","Cambridge University Press",,,"Amazon||Cattle||Cerrado||Land use||Soy||Sustainable agriculture","Assessing the economic viability of integrated crop−livestock systems in Mato Grosso, Brazil",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,"JEL - JEL::Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics::Q0 - General::Q00 - General||JEL - JEL::Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics::Q1 - Agriculture::Q10 - General||JEL - JEL::Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics::Q1 - Agriculture::Q14 - Agricultural Finance",,"2020-01-21T10:01:23Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85072194021",,"000600909300004",,"6","Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems","35","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The framework can be implemented after an earthquake to produce a spatially distributed estimate of damage and, importantly, its uncertainty. An example application with real data collected after the 2015 Nepal earthquake illustrates how regression kriging can combine a diversity of datasets—and downweight uninformative sources—reflecting its ability to accommodate context-specific variations in data type and quality. Through a sensitivity analysis on the number of field surveys, we demonstrate that with only a few surveys, this method can provide more accurate results than a standard engineering forecast.",,,,"8755-2930||1944-8201",,"10.1177/8755293020926190","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/426359","en","SAGE Publications",,,"Post-earthquake damage||geostatistics||data fusion||remote sensing||rapid loss model||damage map","G-DIF: A geospatial data integration framework to rapidly estimate post-earthquake damage",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2020-07-14T13:44:10Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85087631163",,"000591902000004","Earthq. spectra","4","Earthquake Spectra","36","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While project managers have a rather classic view of participatory formats, residents look for formats they can accommodate in their everyday practices. Put together, both perspectives expand common conceptualizations of participation in the literature and enable the detection of blind spots. Based on empirical data from geothermal energy, our findings show that perceptions and expectations of participation vary and, in some cases, diverge, which leads to misunderstandings about the nature and scope of participation.

Yet, it is common to use a single result from a cost-minimizing energy system model to inform planning. This neglects many more alternative results, which might, for example, avoid problematic concentrations of technology capacity in any one region. To explore such alternatives, we develop a method to generate spatially explicit, practically optimal results (SPORES). Applying SPORES to Italy, we find that only photovoltaic and storage technologies are vital components for decarbonizing the power system by 2050; other decisions, such as locating wind power, allow flexibility of choice. Most alternative configurations are insensitive to cost and demand uncertainty, while dealing with adverse weather requires excess renewable generation and storage capacities. For policymakers, the approach can provide spatially detailed power system transformation options that enable decisions that are socially and politically acceptable. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,,,"2542-4351||2542-4785","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465639||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446223","10.1016/j.joule.2020.08.002","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473835","en","Cell Press",,,"Decarbonization||Energy modeling||Policy alternatives||Near-optimal solutions||SPORES||Spatially explicit||Wind deployment||Renewables||Italy||Uncertainty","Policy Decision Support for Renewables Deployment through Spatially Explicit Practically Optimal Alternatives",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2020-10-16T03:40:35Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85090596058",,"000581182900019",,"10","Joule","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, by using integrated cross-realm planning, freshwater benefits could be increased by up to 600% for a 1% reduction in terrestrial benefits.

Focusing on individual sectors and institutions, researchers have given insights as to how climate knowledge is reframed according to institutional cultures and priorities. This study extends such scholarship by comparing how four sectors—greenspace management, building technology, spatial planning, and health—perceive, judge, transfer, and appropriate knowledge on urban heatwaves, and what adaptation options are proposed. Based on semi-structured interviews, documentary materials and observations of two workshops collected in two Swiss cities, I draw on Eviatar Zerubavel and his ‘cultural cognitive sociology’ whose work emphasises how collectively shared patterns of recognition and thinking guide and facilitate human judgement. I find two factors to influence knowledge appropriation. On the one hand, the formative dimension of knowledge underscores that experts understand climate knowledge similarly when a sector shares key concepts with climate science. If such ‘cognitive links’ are missing, the answers on how heatwaves impact experts’ work are more varied. On the other hand, the performative dimension of knowledge highlights that experts’ eagerness to adapt is influenced by diverging technical, legal, and social possibilities. When experts’ decision scope is large, then uptake of climate knowledge is more fluid. With a more explicit understanding of why sectors differ in their appropriation and integration of climate knowledge into their work, this study is a reminder that only fitting knowledge is of value to sectoral experts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000440826",,"0165-0009||1573-1480",,"10.1007/s10584-020-02859-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/440826","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Urban heatwaves||Sectoral climate adaptation||Climate knowledge appropriation||Understanding of climate science||Climate knowledge transfer||Cultural cognitive sociology||Thought styles","How cognitive links and decision-making capacity shape sectoral experts’ recognition of climate knowledge for adaptation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-09-16T12:47:12Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85090956741",,"000569277600001",,"3","Climatic Change","162","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Subsurface technologies involve the risk of induced seismicity. The successful implementation of these technologies depends on the public perception of these risks. Risk governance frameworks propose assessing the level of public concern and designing adapted risk mitigation measures. We propose that concerns should not only be investigated with respect to the perceived risks but also with respect to the potential mitigation measures. We explore this by analyzing the perception of risk mitigation measures for different subsurface technologies. With an online survey (N = 808) in Switzerland we analyzed four technologies (in-between subject design) and four mitigation measures (within subject design). We found that risk mitigation measures are perceived differently, within and across technologies. Thus, public concerns about risk mitigation really matter. We suggest that future research should focus on how risk mitigation measures can be applied and communicated to realize the full potential of risk governance frameworks.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000443776",,"2192-6395||2095-0055",,"10.1007/s13753-020-00298-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/443776","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","carbon capture and storage||enhanced geothermal systems||induced seismicity||Risk mitigation perception||shale gas||Switzerland","The Neglected Role of Risk Mitigation Perception in the Risk Governance of Underground Technologies-The Example of Induced Seismicity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-10-01T07:11:29Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85091114429",,"000570049300001",,"5","International Journal of Disaster Risk Science","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We draw upon qualitative data captured in 183 in-depth interviews and 38 focus group discussions involving village leaders, livelihood aid participants, and NGO workers. Our results show that livelihood assistance helped people stabilize their household finances and partially restore their pre-disaster livelihoods. Furthermore, we found that aid programs were able to help some people without pre-disaster livelihood experience to participate in part-time, ad hoc work. However, aid packages were generally not able to support the development of full-time, sustainable new livelihoods for people lacking pre-disaster training and experience.

These good practice examples reflect the fact that transboundary settings, despite their challenges, act as fertile ground for mutual growth, offering opportunities for CCA and DRR communities to find innovative ways to cooperate and unite in developing synergies and strengthening their mutual efforts towards resilience.

One means of establishing such an exchange involves serious games. During the ESPREssO (Enhancing Synergies for disaster Prevention in the European Union) project, three such games, referred to as RAMSETE (Risk Assessment Model Simulation for Emergency Training Exercise), were developed. They were based on table-top, role-playing, scenario-based exercises, and their purpose was for stakeholder information elicitation about policy issues related to DRR, DRM, and CCA.  Participants in the exercises were assigned roles where they interacted and negotiated in order to deal with the presented scenarios. The scenarios were primarily concerned with selecting an optimal set of policies to deal best with the issue in question. The games, while sometimes including an operational element, were meant to examine the motivations behind the decisions made, rather than to test or to train in response protocols. The participants in general found the games to be useful for framing discussions about complex issues, while their problem-solving character was appreciated and enjoyed.

An environmental behavior model identified general environmental knowledge and attitudes as the strongest predictors of PEBs, followed by green self-identity, justifications, assumed consequences, prescriptive social norms, gender, age, and perceived behavioral control (PBC), respectively. To promote sustainability-oriented behaviors and achieve corresponding societal and economic changes, the identified psychological factors need to be promoted by education and communication strategies as well as complementary measures ranging from policy changes to technology development and systems design. Green self-identity turned out to be significantly more influential for private PEBs than for public sphere PEBs, whereas prescriptive social norms and environmental knowledge were more important for public sphere PEBs. These findings indicate that promoting different types of sustainability-oriented behaviors may require distinct strategies. Public sphere PEBs may be enhanced well by conveying social practices and norms, whereas the promotion of a pro-environmental green self-identity may increase private sphere PEBs effectively.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000448048",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su12208547","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/448048","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","environmental behavior||private sphere||public sphere||environmental citizenship||justification||green identity||behavior determinants||intervention mapping","Determinants of different types of positive environmental behaviors: An analysis of public and private sphere actions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-10-27T00:30:59Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85092914978",,"000583065400001",,"20","Sustainability","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Surface solar radiation is one particularly relevant variable, with implications on policy decisions (e.g. performance of solar panels) and fundamental questions in climate science (e.g. regarding the energy budget). While all current twentieth century reanalyses provide surface solar radiation, we demonstrate that most of them fail to capture multidecadal surface radiation variability in Europe. To this end, we systematically compare the reanalyses 20CRv2c, 20CRv3, ERA20C and CERA20C and the free model run ERA20CM. We show that only CERA20C captures dimming (1949-1979) and brightening (1979-2009) in line with station observations, satellite-era reanalyses and established theory. The lack of multidecadal surface radiation variability in 20CRv2c/v3 is plausible given the use of constant aerosols. In contrast, ERA20CM, ERA20C and CERA20C are forced with time-varying aerosols. Despite this common forcing, ERA20CM and ERA20C surprisingly show no trends in clear-sky fluxes over the dimming and brightening periods while CERA20C shows significant trends. We discuss different potential explanations for this discrepancy (model versions, ocean coupling and ensemble size) and conclude that none of them provides a convincing explanation. Our results therefore imply that only CERA20C is suitable for assessments of surface solar radiation variability on multi-decadal timescales. This particularly applies to impact studies, for example, on long-term potentials of solar power generation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000445823",,"1748-9326||1748-9318","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461616||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/445823","10.1088/1748-9326/aba7e6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473957","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Solar||radiation||dimming||brightening||20th century reanalysis||CERA20C||photovoltaics","European multidecadal solar variability badly captured in all centennial reanalyses except CERA20C",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-10-14T04:06:19Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85092612570",,"000574295300001","Environ.

However, the precise pathways by which they can reach such ambitious goals have yet to be identified. As costs of photovoltaics (PV), batteries, and electric vehicles (EVs) are likely to keep falling, they can jointly play a key role for deep decarbonization. Here, we conduct a techno-economic analysis of a city-scale energy system with roof-top PV, batteries, and EVs for Kyoto City, Japan. We find that aggressive EV adoption and the use of EVs for electricity storage could help roof-top PV penetration in the city with substantially lower costs than just deploying PV and batteries alone or allowing EV to charge only. CO2 emissions from vehicle and electricity usage in the city could be reduced by 60–74% if the entire current car fleet is replaced by EVs while also reducing energy costs by 22–37% by 2030. The largest challenge of a city-wide “PV + EV” system (named as “Solar-EV city”) is its implementation. We explore how it could be realized in Kyoto through peer-to-peer (P2P) power trading/blockchain technology initially on a community scale as smart microgrids, then gradually expanding/converging into a city-wide. For the transition to decentralized power systems, citizen’s decision-making process is one of the keys to overcome social, institutional, and regulatory barriers. © Elsevier Ltd 2020",,,,"0306-2619||1872-9118","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465664||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424366","10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115419","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473834","en","Elsevier",,,,"On the potential of “Photovoltaics + Electric vehicles” for deep decarbonization of Kyoto's power systems: Techno-economic-social considerations",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2020-07-03T19:32:27Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85086911590",,"000565602200004","Appl.

Despite their increasing use, surprisingly, little research has been conducted evaluating how the public perceives of the hazard information provided by these multi-hazard platforms. Because most of them use maps on the start page, we were especially interested in the different approaches towards presenting multiple hazards and towards compiling the contents of the hazard announcements attached to the maps. With an online conjoint choice experiment (N = 768, fully randomised design), we tested different start page designs and hazard announcements representing the diversity of elements used in multi-hazard platforms. The alternatives were randomly displayed as pairs to the participants (between-subjects design), asking them to first rate the alternatives separately and then to choose which of the two they preferred. Our main results are that the participants prefer a start page consisting of a single map with textual information about the current hazards below the map. In addition, they prefer hazard classifications with four or five hazard categories. Moreover, the participants appreciate the embedding of a sharing function in the hazard announcements. Finally, the participants prefer a combination of textual and pictured behavioural recommendations.

Yet, a majority of Brazilian coffee farms are operated by 'smallholders', producers with relatively small properties and primarily reliant on family labor. While previous work indicates that climate change will decrease the area suitable for coffee production in Brazil, no study has assessed the impacts of climate change on coffee yields or the relative exposure and vulnerability of coffee producing regions to changes in climate hazards (climate-associated losses in yield). To address these knowledge gaps, we assess the sensitivity of coffee yields to temperature and precipitation variation from 1974 to 2017 to map coffee climate hazards. Next, we identify which coffee producing regions in Brazil have the highest exposure to climate hazards due to high dependence of coffee production as a proportion of agricultural area. Finally, we generate a Vulnerability Index to identify which regions are theoretically least able to adapt to climate hazards. Our study finds that since 1974, temperatures in Brazilian coffee growing municipalities have been increasing by ~0.25 °C per decade and annual precipitation has been decreasing during the blooming and ripening periods. This historical climate change has already resulted in reductions in coffee yield by more than 20% in the Southeast of Brazil. Minas Gerais, the largest coffee producing state in Brazil, has among the highest climate hazard and overall climate risk, exacerbated by ongoing coffee expansion. Additionally, many municipalities with the lowest adaptive capacity, including the country's mountainous regions, also have high climate exposure and hazards. Negative climate hazard and exposure impacts for coffee producing regions could be potentially offset by targeting climate adaptation support to these high-risk regions, including research, extension, and credit subsidies for improved coffee varieties, irrigation, and agroforestry and diversifying agricultural production.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000446006",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aba471","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446006","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate change||agriculture||smallholder||vulnerability||Cerrado||Latin America||coffee","Climate risks to Brazilian coffee production",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-10-15T02:38:58Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85090206951",,"000574295900001","Environ.

We find the article to be severely flawed and raise concerns in five general areas. Firstly, the term socio-technical is not precisely defined, and is used by the authors to refer to a potential that others term as merely technical. Secondly, the study fails to account for over a decade of research in wind energy resource assessments. Thirdly, there are multiple issues with the use of input data and, because the study is opaque about many details, the effect of these errors cannot be reproduced. Fourthly, the method assumes a very high wind turbine capacity density of 10.73 MW/km2 across 40% of the land area in Europe with a generic 30% capacity factor. Fifthly, the authors find an implausibly high onshore wind potential, with 120% more capacity and 70% more generation than the highest results given elsewhere in the literature. Overall, we conclude that new research at higher spatial resolutions can make a valuable contribution to wind resource potential assessments.

The gendered nature of energy transitions is often implicit and unexplored. As a corrective, this paper explores energy pathways by applying concepts from innovations and gender studies. We examine gender perspectives and niche energy innovations which could disrupt the regime. The regime represents the mainstream pathway that includes the dominant gender perspective and energy system. We explore different gender perspectives of energy transition pathways by applying an Alternative Pathways framework that includes: (1) on-stream pathways that exist within the mainstream pathway to promote equal opportunities for women and men, as well as niches for energy innovations without challenging the high-carbon energy regime; (2) off-stream pathways that depart from the mainstream and promote differences across different genders while creating niches outside the energy regime; and (3) transformative pathways that are fundamentally different from the previous mainstream and includes all gender perspectives in a new energy regime. Applying this framing, in Canada, we explored Indigenous perspectives in the oil sands sector; in Kenya, we studied largescale renewable energy impacting Indigneous communities; in Spain, we evaluate the movement away from fossil fuels and towards renewable technologies. The framework helped to identify that mainstream pathways represented the dominant male perspective while woman's perspective were largely left out. Such absence generate energy pathways that are disconnected from local realities, lack public buy-in and slow-down a sustainable energy transition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000416807",,"2214-6296",,"10.1016/j.erss.2020.101550","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/416807","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Energy transition pathways||Renewable energy||Gender||Women||Intersectionality||Indigenous peoples","Three sides to every story: Gender perspectives in energy transition pathways in Canada, Kenya and Spain",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-05-27T02:34:06Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85084129784",,"000565212600015",,,"Energy Research & Social Science","68","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Such studies are, however, generally based on either single case studies, providing rich and in-depth understanding of (local) dynamics of planning and implementation processes, or they focus on understanding responses to a specific technology (not bound to a location). Therefore these studies tend to overlook a key dynamic in controversy, namely that publics respond to projects by drawing on earlier experiences with a similar technology elsewhere, or with earlier experiences with other technologies in their vicinity. We refer to this dynamic as controversy spillover. The notion of controversy spillover helps to understand how the discursive space of controversy changes over time. In case studies, other controversies are usually considered as context, i.e. as an external condition. However, in order to understand the temporal dynamics of public engagement with energy projects, spillover from other controversies deserves to be investigated more as an object of interest, rather than as an external condition. The aim of this paper is to conceptualize controversy spillover as an important dynamic in controversies and to develop a research agenda. We identify three different types of spillover: 1) geographical (i.e. between the same energy technology in different locations), 2) historical (i.e. with respect to earlier experiences at the same location), 3) technology (i.e. between different technologies). Three empirical examples serve to illustrate the three types of spillover. We finalize the paper with a research agenda for further conceptualization and empirical analysis of the notion of controversy spillover.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000416805",,"2214-6296",,"10.1016/j.erss.2020.101593","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/416805","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"When controversies cascade: Analysing the dynamics of public engagement and conflict in the Netherlands and Switzerland through “controversy spillover”",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-05-27T02:33:42Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85084848355",,"000565212600009",,,"Energy Research & Social Science","68","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The empirical evidence is thin, as most previous studies on the impact of sustainability standards only focused on economic indicators, such as prices, yields, and incomes. Here, we argue that Fairtrade and other sustainability standards can affect agrochemical input use through various mechanisms with possible positive and negative health and environmental effects. We use data from farmers and rural workers in Cote d'Ivoire to analyze effects of Fairtrade certification on fertilizer and pesticide use, as well as on human health and environmental toxicity. Fairtrade increases chemical input quantities and aggregated levels of toxicity. Nevertheless, Fairtrade reduces the incidence of pesticide-related acute health symptoms among farmers and workers. Certified cooperatives are more likely to offer training and other services related to the safe handling of pesticides and occupational health, which can reduce negative externalities in spite of higher input quantities. These results suggest that simplistic assumptions about the health and environmental effects of sustainability standards may be inappropriate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539545",,"0921-8009",,"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2020.106718","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539545","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Fairtrade, Agrochemical Input Use, and Effects on Human Health and the Environment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-03-28T07:36:44Z",,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,"85086084730",,,,,"Ecological Economics","176","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The study was conducted in North-Eastern Thailand, comprising fecal Escherichia coli isolates from pigs, farmers working with the pigs (contact humans) and persons living in the same household as the farmer (non-contact humans) at 51 MSFs and 113 SSFs. Samples from all farms were also screened for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which was not detected in pig samples, but was found in one human sample. Susceptibility was tested by disc-diffusion for seven antibiotics commonly used in the study area. Resistance in pig isolates from MSFs were more frequent for chloramphenicol which (P < 0.001), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (P < 0.001) and gentamicin (P < 0.05) compared with isolates from SSFs, whereas the opposite was true for tetracycline (P < 0.01). Resistance in the human isolates was lower than those in the isolates from pigs for tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol (P < 0.001). The frequency of resistance in the contact human samples from SSFs and MSFs did not differ. There was no difference between isolates from contact and non-contact humans for any of the tested antibiotics. Multidrug resistance in isolates from pigs was 26%, significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the 13% from humans. The data indicate that (i) resistance to antibiotics, including those critical and highly important for human medicine, were more common in fecal E. coli from pigs at the MSFs than at the SSFs, whereas (ii) the resistance in fecal E. coli from pig farmers seemed not to be influenced by the level of intensification of the farm they were working at. © 2020 by the authors.

Given that WoS and Scopus offer homologous search and filtering functionalities, same method was used to query both databases. The method consisted in four steps, each consisting of defining constraints that enabled to filter-down the resources in order to arrive at an optimal data set. STEP 1. First, we created the long list of literature. To do that, we combined project-relevant sets of keywords (Sets A-D) into doubles and triplets using proximity search operators in both databases and searching in title, abstract and keyword fields, according to the following schema: DOUBLES: TRIPLETS: B NEAR/1 A (B NEAR/3 C) NEAR/3 A C NEAR/1 A (D NEAR/3 C) NEAR/3 A D NEAR/1 A (B NEAR/3 D) NEAR/3 A This method enabled us to query the databases in a more precise way, using key-phrases consisting of two interrelated words or “doubles” (e.g. “transdisciplinary approach”) , and three interrelated words or “triplets” (e.g. “interdisciplinary research policy ”), instead of keywords that can appear without specific interrelation (e.g. when using boolean operator AND instead of proximity operator, we would get results even if words “interdisciplinary”, “research” and “policy” appear in random places in the same abstract, title and keywords). STEP 2. Next, within that long list, we looked (again in title, abstract and keywords) for items that either discuss understandings of interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity (keyword set E), or relate to factors or indicators of success or failure (sets E and G correlated through proximity search), according to the following schema: E OR (F NEAR/1 G). STEP 3. We further limited the dataset to only those items that have keywords from set A (interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity in different variants) in the title - considered as a marker of strong relationship to the subject matter. STEP 4.

However, since there was no data readily available on item level, and manual disciplinary encoding of all the items in the bibliography was beyond the scope of this study, the method used is the best approximation of the presence of discourse on interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity, in and between disciplines. In the matrix, each co-occurrence value is weighted by the number of journals that feature the given pair of disciplines, and by the number of articles represented in the dataset that feature in these journals. E.g. if Journals J1 and J2 each featured disciplines D1 and D2, and if 4 articles from J1 and 7 articles from J2 are represented in the SHAPE-ID Literature Review dataset, the co-occurrence value is 11.

We not only show that a continental-scale system is the cheapest, but also that systems on the national scale and below are possible at cost penalties of 20% or less. Transmission is key to low cost, but it is not necessary to vastly expand the transmission system. When electricity is transmitted only to balance fluctuations, the transmission grid size is comparable to today's, albeit with expanded cross-border capacities. The largest differences across scales concern land use and thus social acceptance: in the continental system, generation capacity is concentrated on the European periphery, where the best resources are. Regional systems, in contrast, have more dispersed generation. The key trade-off is therefore not between geographic scale and cost, but between scale and the spatial distribution of required generation and transmission infrastructure.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000440995",,"2542-4351||2542-4785","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465654||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/440995","10.1016/j.joule.2020.07.018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473828","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Trade-Offs between Geographic Scale, Cost, and Infrastructure Requirements for Fully Renewable Electricity in Europe.",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-09-17T12:08:28Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"The transition to a renewable electricity system and its interactions with other policy aims","715132","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85090064924",,"000571389400013",,"9","Joule","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We designed a Modelling Competence Inventory (MCI) to measure the progress of students in acquiring competence in modelling during the bachelor curriculum. As models in environmental science borrow from many disciplines, and modelling is by nature an abstract activity that requires critical thinking, we find that designing an MCI is difficult compared to competence inventories for more physical subjects. We discuss the design process, two iterations of our MCI, and the results of testing these on a group of students before and after a modelling course. Results suggest that students understanding of the learning goals taught in the course improved somewhat, but their score on other learning goals decreased. Overall, we find that bachelor students need more supervised independent practice with modelling and building of confidence in their modelling abilities. The MCI needs further development and differentiated questions specific to the course in which the MCI is administered. The process of searching for competencies to track and developing the MCI, in cooperation with lecturers in the environmental science bachelor, by itself helped build a community of practice and led to steps to better align courses in our curriculum.",,,,"2624-7984||2624-7992",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461727","en","ETH Zurich, Educational Development and Technology (LET)",,,,"Measuring modelling",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-01-12T13:37:28Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://learningteaching.ethz.ch/index.php/lt-eth/article/view/76",,,"1","ETH Learning and Teaching Journal","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, this assumption does not factor in the operational challenges and multiple accountability relations facing policy implementers in contemporary, hybrid policy implementation settings. Shifting the focus to throughput (governance process) and output legitimacy (results), this paper explores how throughput dimensions affect the implementation of policy outputs. We study a hybrid policy—the Swiss Forest Policy 2020—in a federalist, multi-level implementation context. We find that accountability dilemmas have negative consequences for output implementation, particularly when professionalism clashes with rules. Accountability dilemmas are exacerbated by policy incoherence and interact with policy ambiguity. However, high issue salience can partially compensate for the negative effects of these factors. In sum, we highlight how the role of implementing actors in democratic countries goes beyond rule-following: accountability relations and other throughput dimensions crucially affect output legitimacy.",,,,"0032-2687||1573-0891",,"10.1007/s11077-020-09374-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/409063","en","Springer",,,"Throughput legitimacy||Output legitimacy||Implementation||Dilemmas||Accountability||Forest policy||Switzerland","Linking throughput and output legitimacy in Swiss forest policy implementation",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2020-04-09T02:47:48Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85083360707",,"000521700900001","Policy Sci","3","Policy Sciences","53","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, datasets only represent selected aspects of the real world, so when they are used for a specific purpose they can be a source of uncertainty. Here, we present a framework for understanding this uncertainty of observational datasets which distinguishes three general sources of uncertainty: (1) uncertainty that arises during the generation of the dataset; (2) uncertainty due to biased samples; and (3) uncertainty that arises due to the choice of abstract properties, such as resolution and metric. Based on this framework, we identify four different types of dataset ensembles—parametric, structural, resampling, and property ensembles—as tools to understand and assess uncertainties arising from the use of datasets for a specific purpose. We advocate for a more systematic generation of dataset ensembles by using these sorts of tools. Finally, we discuss the use of dataset ensembles in climate model evaluation. We argue that a more systematic understanding and assessment of dataset uncertainty is needed to allow for a more reliable uncertainty assessment in the context of model evaluation. The more systematic use of such a framework would be beneficial for both scientific reasoning and scientific policy advice based on climate datasets.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000420193",,"1757-7780||1757-7799",,"10.1002/wcc.654","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/420193","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate datasets||dataset ensembles||framework||model evaluation||uncertainty","Understanding and assessing uncertainty of observational climate datasets for model evaluation using ensembles",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-06-13T05:18:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Combining theory with Big Data?

This editorial starts by clarifying the definitions and relationships between land-use spillover, indirect land use change—a form of spillover where land use change in one place is caused by land use change in another place—leakage—a form of land use spillover, which is caused by an environmental policy (e.g. a conservation or restoration intervention), and the spillover reduces the overall benefits and effectiveness of this intervention—, and land use displacement processes.

We place a focus on economic effects of sustainability standards and outcome variables that are frequently considered in quantitative studies, including output prices, yields, production costs, farmer profits, and household income. Results suggest that farmers certified under a sustainability standard receive 20–30% higher prices than their non-certified counterparts. Effects of standards on production costs and yields are mixed and vary across standards. Certified farmers gain higher profits, leading to an overall increase in household incomes through standards by 16–22%. Yet substantial heterogeneity exists, which is only partly attributable to observed factors that vary across studies (such as the type of product, standard, or region). Our findings suggest that more context-specific factors—such as the organization of supply chains—play a more decisive role.

However, the effects of climate change will likely cause droughts to occur more frequently and with greater severity also in Austria particularly (Hochrainer-Stigler et al. 2018). Particularly Austrian farmers have frequently been affected by drought over the past decade, and scientific research predicts a continuation of this trend. Targeted efforts at relevant policymaking have been increasing in parallel in different sectors and domains, however, no concerted drought risk management strategies – neither for the agricultural sector nor at a cross sectoral level – are available. This working paper presents a survey that we designed and conducted to investigate Austrian cropping farmers’ perceptions of and experiences with drought risk and its management. The aim was to inform policy making at different levels to design both targeted and integrated drought risk management strategies. The working paper includes a description of the data collection process and the survey design, as well as a detailed characterization of the sample and the data collected. This document thus highlights the main findings of the survey and serves as a background document for further, more detailed analysis. The work presented is part of the ACRP-funded FARM project.

Coffee is considered by many to be the flagship product and sector when it comes to market-driven sustainability approaches. Today about 30% of all global area under coffee production is certified and some say that we’ve reached the tipping point for making sustainable coffee the norm. But have we? The evidence on the impacts of voluntary sustainability tools is mixed. In many contexts, farmers are able to sell and earn more for their coffee but in many others they are not and price volatility, climate change and other market dynamics mean benefits from such schemes are unsure. So the key question we are discussing in this podcast is this – can the use of market-driven tools be the answer to the long-term sustainability of the coffee sector? When do these tools work, when not and what can make them more effective? To discuss this, we're joined by Janina Grabs a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich’s Environmental Policy Lab. Her extensive research on the effectiveness of private sustainability governance in the coffee sector has been widely recognized and now comes together as a compelling story in her recently published book titled “Selling Sustainability Short? The Private Governance of Labor and the Environment in the Coffee Sector”.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/463661","en","ISEAL Alliance",,,,"Selling sustainability short?

In May 2019 a grassroots coalition comprising a range of civil society groups—scientists, labour unions, Indigenous peoples, and youth—launched the Pact for a Green New Deal (PGND) in Canada, with more than 150 town hall meetings across the country. Participants called for 100% renewable energy, phase out of the oil sands, a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030, and the creation of 1 million new green jobs and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples [1]. A significant reorientation to the scale and direction of government expenditure, as happened in the American New Deal of the 1930s, can spur technical innovation but can also exacerbate inequalities. A Canadian green transition is significant globally given its high energy production, exports, and internal use. In this perspective piece we examine the transformative potential of a Canadian PGND by focusing on the social and political characteristics of energy infrastructure: the potential for 100% renewable energy, transitions for oil sands, energy democracy, Indigenous energy leadership, gender equity, and energy poverty. The actor coalitions emerging from these then forge specific energy transition pathways, whether just and inclusive, or not. The Canadian case highlights the complexities and opportunities that accompany countries with large geographies, fraught geo-political histories, strong federalism, inequalities of access to clean affordable energy, and an abundance of renewable energy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000403826",,"2214-6296",,"10.1016/j.erss.2020.101442","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/403826","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Canada's Green New Deal: Forging the socio-political foundations of climate resilient infrastructure?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-03-08T03:54:21Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85080099374",,"000538411700018",,,"Energy Research & Social Science","65","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Most fires accidentally ignite from mismanaged swidden and pasture fires. We provide evidence that fire risk in the Brazilian Amazon, the world's largest remaining tropical forest, perpetuates low yield and environmentally degrading agricultural activities. Using a combination of household interviews and remotely sensed data on fire occurrence in Eastern Amazon municipalities of Paragominas and Santarém, we show that smallholders in consolidated farm-forest frontier regions are locked into a vicious cycle that inhibits their adoption of fire-free practices. Households that invest in more capital-intensive fire-free agricultural technologies experience greater revenue losses from escaped fires than non-fire users. Changes in revenues are as sensitive to these fire impacts as they are to changes in physical capital investments. To overcome this fire-poverty trap, a “big push” of coordinated local incentives is needed. Policies mitigating fire risk may achieve a triple-win that reduces greenhouse gas emissions, forest degradation, and fosters inclusive economic development.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000417562",,"0959-3780||1872-9495",,"10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2020.102096","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/417562","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Brazilian Amazon||fires||land use policy||sustainable development||tropical forests||climate change mitigation","Fire risk perpetuates poverty and fire use among Amazonian smallholders",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-06-02T02:38:46Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85085329080",,"000556563400014","Glob. environ. change",,"Global Environmental Change","63","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This paper looks at the changes in forest-specific legislation applicable to regular productive forests, across 28 European countries. We compare the legal framework applicable in the mid-1990s with that applicable in 2015, using the Property Rights Index in Forestry (PRIF) to measure changes across time and space. The paper shows that forest owners in most western European countries already had high decision-making power in the mid-1990s, following deregulation trends from the 1980s; and for the next two decades, distribution of rights remained largely stable. For these countries, the content and direction of changes indicate that the main pressure on forest-focused legislation comes from environmental discourses (e.g. biodiversity and climate change policies). In contrast, former socialist countries in the mid-1990s gave lower decision-making powers to forest owners than in any of the Western Europe countries; over the next 20 years these show remarkable changes in management, exclusion and withdrawal rights. As a result of these changes, there is no longer a clear line between western and former socialist countries with respect to the national governance systems used to address private forest ownership. Nevertheless, with the exception of Baltic countries which have moved towards the western forest governance system, most of the former socialist countries still maintain a state-centred approach in private forest management. Overall, most of the changes we identified in the last two decades across Europe were recorded in the categories of management rights and exclusion rights. These changes reflect the general trend in European forest policies to expand and reinforce the landowners’ individual rights, while preserving minimal rights for other categories of forest users; and to promote the use of financial instruments when targeting policy goals related to the environmental discourse.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000407139",,"1389-9341",,"10.1016/j.forpol.2020.102146","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/407139","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Forest governance||Institutional changes","Two decades of forest-related legislation changes in European countries analysed from a property rights perspective",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-03-30T04:06:15Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85082106153",,"000533575500006",,,"Forest Policy and Economics","115","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A recurring question raised amongst strategic policy makers tackling climate-related risks in both sectors asks: Can reducing these divergences and seeking new streamlining synergies assist in closing the implementation gap and deliver better integrated Disaster Risk Management (DRM) policies? Specifically, can such synergising action extend to strengthening of trans-border and trans-disciplinary resilience?  The ESPREssO Project explores these questions through a two-year stakeholder engagement process-collecting opinion from European CCA and DRR stakeholders, using novel methods such as crisis simulation exercises (serious games), questionnaires, interviews and international Think Tanks to identify mutual barriers and recommend ways both sectors can overcome them. We prioritise the various solutions with stakeholders, drawing on international and intersectoral CCA and DRR perspectives to refine a set of key recommendations for synergising action.  Results prioritise the importance of clear communication, maintaining political support and inclusion of the currently under-utilised private sector in positively establishing closer cooperation between CCA and DRR. The benefits of strengthening CCA-DRR inter-sectoral links are explored as essential pathways for better-informing hazard mitigation planning under a changing global climate and in aligning localised and strategic efforts. The emphasis is on working in support of each other, avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort and harmonising competing activities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000412728",,"2212-4209",,"10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101616","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/412728","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Climate change adaptation (CCA)||Disaster risk reduction (DRR)||ESPREssO project","Stakeholder solutions for building interdisciplinary and international synergies between Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-05-03T02:52:12Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Enhancing Synergies for disaster PRevention in the EurOpean Union","700342","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,,"85083852960",,"000540295100004",,,"International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","46","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Overall, experts and academics consider more economic risks and assess these with quantitative methods and models, while other stakeholders consider political risks more. To avoid losing sight of risks that cannot be easily quantified and modelled, including some economic risks, impact assessment modelling should be complemented with qualitative research and active stakeholder engagement.

A detailed discussion of the uncertainties they entail would however be beneficial for sounder decisions under uncertainty. In this thesis, I develop a framework that allows for a structured and rigorous analysis of model assumptions and of the epistemic and ethical uncertainty they lead to. The framework consists of two steps: a reconstruction of the model’s justification scheme with regard to its adequacy-for-purpose assumption, and an evaluation and prioritization of the previously detected assumptions. I present a practical application of this framework on one example of climate impact modeling, namely the model CLIMADA. The practical application stresses the importance of the adequacy-for-purpose assumption and reveals that an overall model evaluation is not judicious. Rather, specific evaluations on a case-by-case basis are needed. While model’s quality and overall uncertainty cannot be generalized, many assumptions found in the San Salvador case study could nonetheless be generalized to the use of CLIMADA in general and to other climate impact models as most of the problematics are recurrent in this kind of models. The framework provides a good way to spark discussions on the most ambiguous assumptions to help decision-makers make sounder decisions under uncertainty, particularly regarding climate risk management options. It helps to go beyond the probabilistic assessment of uncertainties and proves useful in discussing ethical uncertainty inherent to climate impact models while not forgetting about epistemic uncertainty ubiquitous in climate change science and its modelling process. This thesis provides users, developers and decision-makers with questions to be asked and discussions to be conducted in order to foster an adequate use of the model.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529985",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529985","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Assumptions and Uncertainty in Climate Impact Modeling",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-31T09:59:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We introduce a global high-resolution asset exposure dataset responding to this challenge. The data are produced using “lit population” (LitPop), a globally consistent methodology to disaggregate asset value data proportional to a combination of nightlight intensity and geographical population data. By combining nightlight and population data, unwanted artefacts such as blooming, saturation, and lack of detail are mitigated. Thus, the combination of both data types improves the spatial distribution of macroeconomic indicators. Due to the lack of reported subnational asset data, the disaggregation methodology cannot be validated for asset values. Therefore, we compare disaggregated gross domestic product (GDP) per subnational administrative region to reported gross regional product (GRP) values for evaluation. The comparison for 14 industrialized and newly industrialized countries shows that the disaggregation skill for GDP using nightlights or population data alone is not as high as using a combination of both data types. The advantages of LitPop are global consistency, scalability, openness, replicability, and low entry threshold. The open-source LitPop methodology and the publicly available asset exposure data offer value for manifold use cases, including globally consistent economic disaster risk assessments and climate change adaptation studies, especially for larger regions, yet at considerably high resolution.

To plan and operate reliable electricity supply systems, an understanding of wind power variability over a range of spatio-temporal scales is critical. In complex terrain, such as that found in mountainous Switzerland, wind speeds are influenced by a multitude of meteorological phenomena, many of which occur on scales too fine to capture with commonly used meteorological reanalysis datasets. Past work has shown that anticorrelation at a continental scale is an important way to help balance variable generation. Here, we investigate systematically for the first time the possibility of balancing wind variability by exploiting anticorrelation between weather patterns in complex terrain. We assess the capability for the Consortium for Small-scale Modeling (COSMO)-REA2 and COSMO-REA6 reanalyses (with a 2 and 6 km horizontal resolution, respectively) to reproduce historical measured data from weather stations, hub height anemometers, and wind turbine electricity generation across Switzerland. Both reanalyses are insufficient to reproduce site-specific wind speeds in Switzerland's complex terrain. We find however that mountain-valley breezes, orographic channelling, and variability imposed by European-scale weather regimes are represented by COSMO-REA2. We discover multi-day periods of wind electricity generation in regions of Switzerland which are anticorrelated with neighbouring European countries. Our results suggest that significantly more work is needed to understand the impact of fine scale wind power variability on national and continental electricity systems, and that higher-resolution reanalyses are necessary to accurately understand the local variability of renewable generation in complex terrain.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000409844",,"1748-9326||1748-9318","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465674||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465643||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/409844","10.1088/1748-9326/ab70bd","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473824","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Wind electricity generation||European weather regimes||Regional meteorological reanalysis||Switzerland","Sub-national variability of wind power generation in complex terrain and its correlation with large-scale meteorology",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-04-16T01:16:43Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000523508700001","Environ.

Vom Erreichen diese Ziele sind wir heute weit entfernt. In der Schweiz verfügen wir zurzeit weder über ein Konzept, wie genetische Vielfalt bzw. genetische Diversität erfasst werden kann, noch haben wir Indikatoren, an Hand derer wir in Zukunft Veränderungen der genetischen Vielfalt feststellen können. Die genetische Vielfalt ist eine der vier Ebenen der Biodiversität, also der Vielfalt des Lebens, welche aus der Vielfalt der Gene, Arten, Ökosysteme und deren Wechselbeziehungen besteht. Genetische Vielfalt ist das Rohmaterial für die Evolution, das für die Weiterentwicklung und Anpassung von Arten und Populationen notwendig ist. Somit ist sie eine Voraussetzung dafür, dass sich Organismen an ihre belebte und unbelebte Umwelt anpassen können. Genetische Vielfalt beeinflusst auch die Ökosystem-Stabilität. In dieser Machbarkeitsstudie zur Untersuchung des Zustands und der Veränderung der genetischen Vielfalt schlagen wir vor, dass für 50 Arten aus den drei grossen Reichen – Tiere, Pflanzen und Pilze – und rund 17'000 Individuen die genetische Vielfalt schweizweit in allen sechs biogeographischen Regionen untersucht wird. Die zu untersuchenden Arten müssen einer Vielfalt von Kriterien genügen, z.B. seltene und häufige Arten, sowie Arten welche durch anthropogene Faktoren, wie z.B. Klimawandel oder Habitat-Fragmentierung betroffen sind. Gleichzeitig sollten sie Synergien mit anderen Biodiversitäts-Monitorings ermöglichen. Der technische Fortschritt im Bereich der DNA-Sequenzierung erlaubt es heute das Erbgut (Genom) von hunderten von Individuen zu sequenzieren und sehr präzise Informationen zur genetischen Vielfalt von Individuen, Population und Arten zu erheben. Da sich die genetische Vielfalt meistens nicht kurzfristig verändert und mit dem hier vorgeschlagen Monitoring erst eine Basis für die Erfassung zukünftiger Veränderungen erarbeitet wird, empfehlen wir zusätzlich ein retrospektives Monitoring der genetischen Vielfalt durchzuführen. Dieses erlaubt es Informationen über den Zustand und die Veränderung der genetischen Vielfalt über die Zeit zu erhalten. Dank zahlreichen und gut dokumentierten Museum- und Herbarium-Proben ist es möglich, Informationen zur genetischen Vielfalt vor mehr als 100 Jahren in der Schweiz zu erhalten. Da es sich bei einem Monitoring der genetischen Vielfalt um ein sehr grosses und komplexes Projekt handelt, empfehlen wir, vorgängig eine 3-jährige Pilotstudie durchführen um Erfahrungen zu sammeln. Dabei würden für fünf Arten heutige Populationen schweizweit genetisch untersucht und zwei Arten auch in einer retrospektiven Analyse behandelt. Die Kostenberechnungen beinhalten drei mögliche Varianten und eine 3-jährige Pilotstudie. Variante 1: Ein vollständiges Monitoring der genetischen Vielfalt mit Stichprobennahme, genetischen und retrospektiven Analysen würde Kosten im Bereich von 9.7 Mio CHF pro 5-Jahres Zyklus generieren. Variante 2: Ein Monitoring der genetischen Vielfalt mit Stichprobennahme und genetischen Analysen ohne retrospektives Monitoring würde ungefähr 8.5 Mio CHF pro 5-Jahreszyklus kosten. Variante 3: Ein Monitoring der genetischen Vielfalt, welches im Moment nur die Stichprobennahme umfasst und die Sequenzierarbeiten erst zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt ausführen würde (z.B. nach einer zweiten Stichprobennahme nach 5 Jahren) würde Kosten im Bereich 4 von 3.9 Mio CHF verursachen. Eine 3-jährige Pilotstudie für fünf Arten (davon zwei Arten auch retrospektiv), würde 1.2 Mio CHF kosten. Der Einbezug von Stakeholdern vereinfacht eine transparente und effiziente Kommunikation und steigert die Akzeptanz von Prozessen. Deshalb wurde im Rahmen der Machbarkeitsstudie eine Stakeholderanalyse durchgeführt. Die Analyse erhob die Meinungen und Bedürfnisse von Schweizer Stakeholdern aus Verwaltung, Wirtschaft, NGOs, Museen und Wissenschaft, welche potenziell von einem Monitoring der genetischen Vielfalt profitieren würden. Zudem wurde untersucht, welche Stakeholder für die Entwicklung eines genetischen Monitorings besonders wichtig wären und welche Stakeholder zu diesem Thema bereits miteinander in Kontakt stehen. Experteninterviews und Online-Fragebögen zeigten, dass die befragten Stakeholder ein grosses Interesse an einem genetischen Monitoring haben. Sie sind sich der zurzeit fehlenden Grundlagen im Bereich genetische Vielfalt bewusst und sehen, dass ein Monitoring der genetischen Vielfalt für ihre Arbeitsbereiche gewinnbringend wäre. Dabei wurde besonders häufig die Überprüfung von Vernetzungsmassnahmen genannt. Stakeholder äusserten auch Bedenken gegenüber einem genetischen Monitoring. Dabei wurden die geringen zeitlichen und finanziellen Ressourcen der Kantone wie auch die Befürchtung, dass die erhobenen Daten in der Praxis zu wenig genutzt würden, genannt. Eine offene Kommunikation der Möglichkeiten und Grenzen eines genetischen Monitorings und ein enger Einbezug der Stakeholder sind somit für eine erfolgreiche Implementierung eines genetischen Monitorings in der Schweiz entscheidend. Aufgrund der vorliegenden Machbarkeitsstudie empfehlen wir zuerst eine Pilotstudie zur Untersuchung der genetischen Vielfalt in der Schweiz durchzuführen, um Erfahrungen zu sammeln und Wissenslücken zu schliessen. Die Pilotstudie kann später von einem umfangreichen genetischen Monitoring abgelöst werden bzw. in ein solches einbezogen werden.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000453093",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453093","de","ETH Zürich, Departement Umweltsystemwissenschaften","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Monitoring der genetischen Diversität","Machbarkeitsstudie zur Untersuchung des Zustands und der Veränderung der genetischen Vielfalt: Vernetzung, Inzucht und Anpassungsfähigkeit",,"Report","Open access",,,,,"2020-11-25T16:22:37Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It finds that while norm generation around responsible supply chain management and the organizational institutionalization of standard‐setting bodies is well advanced, the practice of internalizing social and environmental externalities through the routinized production and purchase of higher priced certified goods continues to be questioned by industry actors.

Several countries have formulated adaptation strategies, so did Switzerland. All these strategies are based on the assumption that the negative perception of climate change does lead to a broader implementation of adaptation measures in different sectors. This thesis scrutinizes this assumption and investigates how Swiss organizations deal with weather. Based on a questionnaire with n = 153 respondents (56 of which are from cable car organizations), it investigates the links between the perception of weather, the actions taken upon weather and the organizational traits. Through the application of theories on organizational decision-making and organizational learning, the reasons for the (in-) action were elicited. It was found that the organizations act more upon weather events, when perceived negatively and organizational traits have a little influence on action. This can lead to the conclusion that organizational learning towards adaptation happens based on negative perception. Put into context, this means that the strategies formulated for adaptation, are based on the correct assumption. However much more organizations could act upon weather, when provided with possibilities to do so and when they would be ready to cross their own traditional boundaries.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000604729",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/604729","en","ETH Zurich",,,,"Under the weather?

The gridded minimum and maximum daily temperature data from the CH2018 scenarios were used to produce the hazards, corresponding to the hourly wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) outside and inside buildings. These are combined with the geographical distribution of workers, categorized based on the physical activity level of their professional occupation, using empirical impact functions linking productivity losses to WBGT. The three entities are implemented in the CLIMADA probabilistic natural catastrophe damage model to determine the economic losses that may be encountered. Finally, different adaptation measures and their potential to reduce the productivity loss are assessed. I find that already today, the loss is significant, with an average value of CHF 250 million a year. I show that this loss may almost double by 2050 under an RCP8.5 scenario. The fraction of the value impacted is heterogenous between economic branches and cantons. Branches that require individuals to be outside and perform physically demanding tasks, as in the construction sector, are likely to lose the highest fraction of their productivity output. The cantons of Geneva, Ticino and Valais will be the most heavily impacted, because of the higher level of heat stress. Adaptation measures show high potential at reducing the productivity losses. Having heat-insulated and cooled buildings, as well as adapting the hours of work can prevent most of the loss.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000535269",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/535269","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Impacts of Heat and Climate Change on Labor Productivity in Switzerland",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,,,"2022-03-04T09:27:54Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This paper investigates the technical and economic feasibility of household energy self-sufficiency in Switzerland, which can be seen as representative for other regions with a temperate climate, by 2050. We compare sixteen cases that vary across four dimensions: household type, building type, electricity demand reduction, and passenger vehicle use patterns. We assume that photovoltaic (PV) electricity supplies all energy, which implies a complete shift away from fossil fuel based heating and internal combustion engine vehicles. Two energy storage technologies are considered: short-term storage in lithium-ion batteries and long-term storage with hydrogen, requiring an electrolyzer, storage tank, and a fuel cell for electricity conversion. We examine technological feasibility and total system costs for self-sufficient households compared to base cases that rely on fossil fuels and the existing power grid. PV efficiency and available rooftop/facade area are most critical with respect to the overall energy balance. Single-family dwellings with profound electricity demand reduction and urban mobility patterns achieve self-sufficiency most easily. Multi-family buildings with conventional electricity demand and rural mobility patterns can only be self-sufficient if PV efficiency increases, and all of the roof plus most of the facade can be covered with PV. All self-sufficient cases are technically feasible but more expensive than fully electrified grid-connected cases. Self-sufficiency may even become cost-competitive in some cases depending on storage and fossil fuel prices. Thus, if political measures improve their financial attractiveness or individuals decide to shoulder the necessary investments, self-sufficient buildings may start to become increasingly prevalent.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000419334",,"1932-6203","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/419334||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465672","10.1371/journal.pone.0227368","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/470961","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Energy self-sufficient households with photovoltaics and electric vehicles are feasible in temperate climate",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-06-10T02:18:49Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85081017238",,"000535264000004","PLoS ONE","3","PLoS ONE","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The integration of modular water systems into existing centralized infrastructures, creating hybrid systems, could mitigate these challenges by enabling more resilient water management. However, the existence of technological alternatives has not changed the continuous reliance on centralized water infrastructure. Supportive policy instruments are key to foster the operation of modular technology within hybrid water systems. This article focuses on the role of substantive and procedural policy instruments for the successful operation of modular water systems within a hybrid water infrastructure. Based on Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), we can confirm the claim in the literature that relying on regulatory instruments is relevant for operating modular technology within hybrid systems. However, we also find combinations of policy instruments where regulatory instruments do not matter. Furthermore, we find that procedural instruments emphasizing stakeholder participation interplay with different substantive policy instruments to support the successful operation of modular systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000393617",,"1462-9011||1873-6416",,"10.1016/j.envsci.2019.12.009","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/393617","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Water governance||Modular water technology||Hybrid water systems||Policy instruments||QCA","Policy instrument mixes for operating modular technology within hybrid water systems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-01-24T03:44:03Z","2022-01-15",,,,"yes",,,,,"Challenges and Opportunities of Modular water Infrastructures for Greening the Swiss Economy (COMIX)","172366","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 73: Gesuch",,,"85077923914",,"000513988400011","Environ.

Key to mitigating the long-term impacts of disasters is the ability to rapidly respond and recover in ways that build resilience and protect hard-fought development gains. However, the information systems needed to support such resilient and equitable recovery are currently lacking, such that decision makers often end up gathering evidence for recovery decisions in ad-hoc ways rather than systematically. This study focuses on the information and the data that influence early decision-making processes after a disaster. We call this project Informatics for Equitable Recovery because we have built frameworks for developing information systems that focus on identifying not only those who are impacted but also those who are least able to recover so that we can inform more equitable long-term recovery processes. Based on data from the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, we developed tools to map post-disaster building damage more accurately, making use of all the data that gets produced after a disaster. We implemented a household survey, interviews, and more to understand and usefully account for the complexities of disaster impact beyond building damage. We also developed a metric to estimate differential post-disaster need and extreme vulnerability in order to inform early decision making that fosters more effective and equitable recovery processes. We close this report with recommendations for use of the tools and ideas we share throughout.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000423856",,,,"10.32656/ier_final_report_2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/423856","en","Earth Observatory of Singapore, Nanyang  Technological  University","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Informatics for Equitable Recovery: Supporting equitable disaster recovery through mapping and integration of social vulnerability into post-disaster impact assessments",,"Report","Open access",,,,,"2020-06-30T14:28:03Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"76513407",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, we compare the joint effect of a contextually embedded intervention in a public swimming pool to promote low-flow showerheads coupled with a mass campaign by a Swiss city’s utility to the stand-alone effect of the mass campaign. We also explore the factors that influence the outcome of the contextually embedded intervention. The quasi-experimental design of the study was possible due to the co-occurring installation of low-flow showerheads in a local public swimming pool and a campaign of a local utility, which offered low-flow showerheads for domestic use at a substantially reduced price. Our findings showed that the combined intervention was substantially more effective than the mass campaign alone. However, this result has to be interpreted with caution owing to the imperfect comparability of the two campaigns. Based on a survey of 402 swimming pool visitors, the study findings demonstrate the crucial role of a positive direct experience in the promotion of low-flow showerheads. This had a significant positive impact on attitudes towards low-flow showerheads, which in turn was found to be the most important determinant of purchase intention. The results suggest that more active communication of energy efficiency measures in public facilities might contribute to reductions in household energy use. Such campaigns can be used to share experiences of energy efficiency technologies and, therefore, promote the use of similar systems at home.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000418588",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0230255","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/418588","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Exploring the role of positive direct experience in the adoption of energy efficient technologies: evidence from a Swiss field study on the promotion of low-flow showerheads",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-06-05T13:35:03Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Using formal social groups to promote energy sufficient behaviour in cities","153769","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","NFP 71: Gesuch",,,"85081981587",,"000535291800019","PLoS ONE","3","PLoS ONE","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This requires taking strategic decisions with long-term consequences under conditions of considerable uncertainty. For this reason, many actors in the energy sector develop model-based scenarios to guide debates and decision-making about plausible future energy systems. Besides being a decision support instrument for policy-makers, energy scenarios are widely recognized as a way of shaping the expectations of experts and of influencing energy policy more generally. However, relatively little is known about how energy scenarios shape preferences and expectations of the public. We use an explorative research design to assess the publics’ expectations of future energy systems through an online survey among Swiss residents (N = 797). We identified four significantly different clusters of people with distinct expectations about the future energy system, each seeing different implications for the acceptability of energy policies and the compatibility with projections of techno-economic energy scenarios. Cluster 1 expects a system-wide energy transition towards renewable energy sources that is similar to the policy-relevant national energy scenario. Cluster 2 also expects an energy transition, but believes it will lead to a range of technical challenges, societal conflicts and controversies with neighboring countries. Cluster 3 is the only cluster not expecting significant changes in the future energy system and thus not anticipating an energy transition. Cluster 4’s expectations are between cluster 1 and 2, but it anticipates a huge increase in per capita electricity demand while prices are expected to remain low. The study at hand offers some initial insights into the interdependencies between energy transition pathways outlined in techno-economic energy scenarios and the energy system expectations of the public. These insights are essential for gaining a better understanding of whether and how energy scenarios can contribute to informed public debates about energy futures and how desirable pathways towards them might look like.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000418585",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0227369","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/418585","en","Public Library of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"How the public imagines the energy future: Exploring and clustering non-experts’ techno-economic expectations towards the future energy system",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-06-05T13:33:22Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85081039312",,"000535265600011","PLoS ONE","3","PLoS ONE","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Certified farmers are typically organized in cooperatives. When sampling only from a small number of cooperatives, as previous studies did, it is not easy to disentangle certification effects from possible cooperative effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by randomly sampling from a large number of cooperatives, thus better capturing existing institutional heterogeneity. In particular, we collect and use data from cocoa farmers in Côte d'Ivoire who are organized in Fairtrade-certified and noncertified cooperatives. Regression models with instrumental variables show that Fairtrade has positive and significant effects on cocoa yields, prices, and living standards. These effects remain significant also after controlling for cooperative characteristics, but the magnitude of the estimates changes. We draw two conclusions. First, in Côte d'Ivoire, Fairtrade certification benefits farmers economically. Second, and more generally, cooperative characteristics are jointly correlated with certification and relevant outcomes, which needs to be accounted for to avoid bias when evaluating the benefits of sustainability standards in the small farm sector.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539548",,"0002-9092||1467-8276",,"10.1002/ajae.12015","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539548","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Certification||Cocoa||Cooperatives||Côte d'Ivoire||Fairtrade||Sustainability standards","Do Sustainability Standards Benefit Smallholder Farmers Also When Accounting For Cooperative Effects?

These commitments offer much promise for sustainable commodity production, but are undermined by a lack of transparency about their coverage and impacts. Here, using state-of-the-art supply chain data, we introduce an approach to evaluate the impact of ZDCs, linking traders and international markets to commodity-associated deforestation in the sub-national jurisdictions from which they source. We focus on the Brazilian soy sector, where we find that ZDC coverage is increasing, but under-represents the Cerrado biome where most soy-associated deforestation currently takes place. Though soy-associated deforestation declined in the Amazon after the introduction of the Soy Moratorium, we observe no change in the exposure of companies or countries adopting ZDCs to soy-associated deforestation in the Cerrado. We further assess the formulation and implementation of these ZDCs and identify several systematic weaknesses that must be addressed to increase the likelihood that they achieve meaningful reductions in deforestation in future. As the 2020 deadline for several of these commitments approaches, our approach can provide independent monitoring of progress toward the goal of ending commodity-associated deforestation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000394383",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab6497","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/394383","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Using supply chain data to monitor zero deforestation commitments: an assessment of progress in the Brazilian soy sector",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-01-27T13:40:47Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000525621800001","Environ.

This genre of discourse studies interprets language use, drawing in this case on a representative sample of authoritative definitions, case studies, and state-of-the-art accounts. The Introduction situates the discussion around the increasing number and size of teams as well as research across both academic disciplines and other sectors, followed by the five keywords that structure the overall argument. Section 2 examines the first of the five keywords, defining interdisciplinarity by marking its alignment with integration, confluence, interdependence, interaction, and balance. Section 3 considers the second keyword—transdisciplinarity—by tracing evolution of a problem-focused connotation, links to sustainability, inclusion of stakeholders, the imperative of critique, and transdisciplinary action research. Section 4 brings together insights on inter- and trans-disciplinarity in a composite “crossdisciplinary” alignment with collaboration, factoring in the nature of teamwork, public engagement, and translation. Section 5 then turns to learning, noting the difference between education and training then emphasizing transformative capacity, double- and triple-loop learning, reflexivity, and a transdisciplinary orientation. Section 6 takes up the final keyword—knowledge—by calling attention to inclusion, indigenous and local perspectives, nomothetic versus idiographic perspectives, the question of fit, and the nature of crossdisciplinary knowledge. The article concludes by identifying future research needs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000405654",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su12041515","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/405654","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","interdisciplinarity||transdisciplinarity||collaboration||learning||knowledge","Sustainability and collaboration: Crossdisciplinary and cross-sector horizons",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-03-19T02:37:38Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85081209987",,,,"4","Sustainability","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To accomplish this, an interdisciplinary, crossnational team from the UK, Switzerland, Spain, Czech Republic, and Sweden reviewed over 50 in-depth policy frameworks. With direction from expert stakeholders and a review of the policy landscape, we identified the most relevant policy instruments influencing PGs across five different biogeographic regions in Europe (Alpine, Atlantic, Boreal, Continental, and Mediterranean). The mapping of each country’s policy mix was guided inter-alia by a ‘cascade framework’ to illustrate the entry points, intermediary actors, mechanisms and pathways through which policies deliver their intended effects on PGs. This entailed an in-depth analysis of publicly available government sources documenting the aims, objectives, targets, monitoring systems, outputs and outcomes of each policy instrument. In total, 24 policies were mapped using 50 different criteria, with 15 of the policies unique to the case study countries. This resulted in an extensive excel database of over 3400 unique cells containing rich qualitative data. The excel data were coded in a consistent manner across the country teams so that they could be compared, synthesized, and used to identify patterns in the policy mix and logic of intervention. We show, for instance, that across Europe, the dominant policy logic uses regulations and incentives to influence farmer adoption of desired landscape compositions. This directly influences, but does not guarantee, the range of ecosystem services (ES) that are possible from the landscape. At the same time, we discovered a lack of policies targeting consumer demand for PG ecosystem services and only a few designed to drive sustainable PG management by directly promoting the value of PGs with beneficiaries. To complement the policy mapping, stakeholders’ assessed the perceived effectiveness of the policy mix in each country. This evaluation included over 50 interviews with key stakeholders across Europe representing government, academia, farmers, and special interests, and covered perceptions of democracy, legitimacy, relevance, efficiency and impact in relation to the effectiveness of policies relevant to the management of PG. Our findings reveal generally positive perceptions of grassland policy effectiveness across Europe, with special interest groups being the least positive and governments the most. The in-depth country case studies reveal striking similarities, as well as differences between countries and stakeholder groups, which are illustrative of the problems, challenges, and barriers confronting policy effectiveness. We conclude this report by offering insights and policy implications. In particular, we suggest that the following four points are taken into consideration to improve the PG policy landscape: 1) Reduce complexity and administrative burden to make policies more understandable and accessible. 2) Require stakeholder involvement when developing strategic plans and assessing policy. 3) Encourage consideration of trade-offs between PG management and ES delivery, by designing policies to explicitly target the interaction between landscape structures and ES (or target them in parallel). 4) Encourage a balance of policy logic, by moving away from targeting farmers with regulation or subsidies to manage the landscape towards targeting consumer demand for ES (through information) and the value of ES (such as direct payments for regulating and cultural services).",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/466589","en",,,,,"The effectiveness of policies promoting sustainable permanent grasslands across five European countries (representing five biogeographic regions): Mapping, understanding, and key stakeholder perceptions",,"Report","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-01-29T08:17:19Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies","774124","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,,,"SUPER-G (Sustainable Permanent Grassland Systems and Policies)","4.1c","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Exploring pathways of change according to the Advocacy Coalition Framework, we find that increased actor resources in the form of expertise, finances and political recognition alongside external and internal events – made the forest issue more salient – contribute to a successful policy change. These factors led to an altered actor coalition structure with less clear-cut positions and the shared recognition that change was necessary.

If disaster resilience is going to contribute to arresting growing disaster risk, it is essential that the expert insight, realities and needs of practitioners are amplified in the discourse. Through in-depth interviews with INGO staff working on disaster resilience across the developing world, we seek to understand how the concept is being understood and used in practice. We compare practitioner perspectives to scientific and policy-oriented goals for, and critiques of, resilience in the disaster and development space. We find that practitioners perceive the resilience paradigm to be driving a genuine shift towards better programming. At the same time, the concern that resilience is a vague buzzword which reinforces the status quo cannot be discredited. The usefulness of resilience as a boundary object within the science-practice interface, and the success of resilience in achieving its goals, is dependent upon scientists, policy-makers, and donors more actively engaging with the insights and experience of practitioners.

Apparently, warnings have no inherent value, but only become valuable once they influence people’s decisions. A good warning message (i.e. in terms of accuracy and timeliness) that is not conveyed to the end-user in a way that leads to desired behaviour is useless. In future, the expected losses of bad weather are projected to further increase: climate change causes more intense, frequent and long-lasting extremes, and social vulnerability grows with population growth and spatial expansion into areas impacted by hazards. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand why some people do not respond to warning messages and to identify effective communication strategies, which provide practical insights for policy- and decision-makers, and help people at risk take better informed decisions. The four contributions that comprise this thesis identify and answer open research questions, which aim at advancing the effectiveness of warning communication and decision-making by increasing the understanding of how message content influence people’s response to warnings.  Contribution I shows how better targeted communication strategies can increase individual preparedness levels. With natural hazard management shifting towards more integrated approaches that address the role of private households in reducing risks, there is a need to investigate the readiness of people in adopting risk reduction behaviours. I build on protection motivation theory that I combine with decision-stage theory to develop a dynamic protection motivation framework, which helps to understand the motivations of different individuals to undertake risk reduction measures. Based on a household survey conducted in an Italian community that was recently affected by flash floods, I show that not all people are motivated by the same threat or coping appraisals, but that these differ depending on people’s risk reduction stage, i.e. the type of measures already undertaken. Findings contribute on better targeting long-term communication strategies to individuals at risk, which ought to motivate them to undertake risk reduction measures.  Contribution II analyses the effects of inconsistent warning messages on the general public’s response. This inconsistency is the result of the duplication of public weather warnings, which are disseminated by different public and private providers. Therefore, I developed a simple matrix to categorize the level of inconsistency across multiple warnings, addressing both visual and textual inconsistencies. Following a severe rainfall event in Switzerland, I conducted an online experiment with different warning pairs that provided participants with more or less consistent information. Results highlight that inconsistent messages were perceived of lower quality and negatively impacted warning response. People were less likely to engage in self-protective behaviours for different types of inconsistent warnings compared to consistent warnings; the higher the level of inconsistency the poorer was the behavioural response.   Contribution III examines how changes in hazard description can help people at risk to translate the warning information into an appraisal of risk. With increasing interests of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services to provide impact-based warnings that focus on the impacts that result from the weather, there is a need to better understand whether these warnings would result in greater self-protective behaviours. I also investigate the individual effect of behavioural recommendations in the warning messages. I conducted the research in Switzerland using an online survey experiment that included a hypothetical decision-scenario. Results show that participants who received impact-based warnings - with and without behavioural recommendations - were more likely to engage in self-protective behaviours than people who received the standard warnings. Messages with impact text and recommendations were also reported to be clearer, easier to understand, and more credible, and people reported to be more concerned for their safety, and better understood the threats and behaviours to engage in.  Contribution IV draws on insights from Contribution III, but the research was conducted with a different method. Theory from cognitive science suggest that people can use a fast decision pathway that is largely driven by feelings and/or a slower pathway that is based on rational deliberation to process risk information. While rational deliberation must be the dominant pathway in an imagined situation, the presence of fear that emerges in a real-crisis situation could influence the effectiveness of impact-based warnings and people’s actual decisions. I conduced a field experiment, in which wind warnings were disseminated through an existing smartphone application of a Swiss weather provider (Wetter-Alarm), and real-time data was collected on people’s responses. Results show a domination of the affective model of decision-making when people are under an imminent threat of life. The influence of fear resulted in no effect of impact-based warnings. However, stronger event severity and shorter lead times generated a greater behavioural response.   The thesis makes four important contributions to the literature. First, it makes a theoretical contribution as it applies a novel protection motivation framework to identify individual motivations for risk preparedness. Second, the thesis performs the first empirical analysis of the influence of inconsistent weather warnings on people’s behaviours. Third, it adds to the growing literature on impact-based warnings by investigating the individual effects of impact text and behavioural recommendations. Fourth, for the first time the dissertation investigates behaviours in real-world crisis in response to actual weather warnings.       Altogether, the findings from the four contributions have implications for practitioners, policy-makers and researchers. First, the protection motivation framework ought to help practitioners to develop more effective strategies that link patterns of perception or capacity to effective patterns of communication and avoid to target large communities at risk with a single communication strategy. Second, public and private weather providers should enhance cooperation and deliver more consistent warning information. If cooperation fails, then policy-makers may perform modifications in the warning process and clarify the stakeholder’s roles and responsibilities. Third, decision-makers should develop and use impact-based warnings with behavioural recommendations only in the case of very severe weather. At the same time, when communicating messages, they should be aware of the importance of affect in making decisions when people are under an imminent threat. Fourth, researchers that investigate responses to threats should use research designs that capture real-world conditions. ","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000404058",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/404058","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","risk communication||warning system||decision-making||Natural hazards","To act or not to act: Warning communication and decision-making in response to weather-related hazards",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment",,,"2020-03-09T14:12:22Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"26533",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Transitioning to alternative energy systems is a challenging endeavor for governments around the world. Including the public in these transitions is paramount for their success. Failing to do so, or doing so inadequately, has far-reaching consequences on local energy projects. Public opposition may slow down or even halt the development of renewable energy infrastructures, thereby putting the energy transition into peril. Further complicating the task, renewable energy projects, though set in a local context, are framed at the crossroads of global challenges, national energy policies and local realities. If authorities and project managers disconnect a planned project from its larger socio-political landscape, unforeseen issues, such as failed projects in the past that at first did not seem connected to the immediate context, may come to surface and influence the public’s perception of the project.     Aim. This dissertation aims to contribute to the improvement of energy transition governance by taking into account the larger landscapes of participation processes. In doing so, it intends to enhance understanding of participation processes in the context of a new technology such as geothermal and how contextual and institutional factors come into play.  Methods. The dissertation is based on an explorative research design combining different qualitative research methods, including focus groups, participant observation, and qualitative document analysis in the context of a local geothermal energy project. The combination of methods provides a thick description of the landscape of participation and its public. Furthermore, it adds empirical insights into the use of longitudinal methods in the context of geothermal energy. Continuous reflection on the implications of the chosen methods, tools, analytical steps, and interpretations is an important validity criterion for this transdisciplinary dissertation. Results. First, this dissertation stresses the importance of conceiving of the social context of a renewable energy project as dynamic and in constant interaction with the actors involved in it. Second, focusing on federal structures and energy transitions, the dissertation finds that national and local dynamics on geothermal energy innovation processes are intertwined and mutually influential, which makes it necessary to consider different aspects of federalism to fully understand the social context of a project. Third, the identification of the most salient public values linked to the roles and responsibilities of the public entity shows that for residents, the most important function of the public authority in relation to the energy transition is to inform and raise awareness. Fourth, the dissertation develops a two-dimensional participation grid based on the residents’ and project managers’ views on participation. Combining these two views allows for taking into account participatory formats that are often left out or forgotten and emphasizing others that initially might not seem as relevant.  Conclusions. The four research contributions together demonstrate that an understanding of participation is only complete and inclusive when different scales and perspectives are considered. Proposing a multi-scalar and multi-perspective approach, the general findings provide critically important elements for the development of public engagement strategies for energy transition policies that fit a given context and correspond to the public’s expectations. Relying on co-productionist and transdisciplinary research, this dissertation seeks to develop analytical and practical tools to navigate this participation landscape. Contributions. The dissertation has significant conceptual implications for understandings of participation, contributes empirical insights into geothermal energy development on a local scale, and offers practical insights into the challenge of including the public while developing a new technology and providing for the appropriate institutional frameworks and policies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492654",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492654","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Mapping the Participation Landscape to Support More Inclusive Public Engagement",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment",,,"2021-07-02T09:05:02Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"27221",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The three areas of urban sustainability, emergency management, and urban resilience are the areas primarily focused on addressing these challenges on a city level. One way to promote an integrative city-level approach across the three fields (sustainability, emergency management and resilience) is through capacity building programs. So far, only a few capacity-building programs attempted to implement an integrated set of two or more competencies and to foster collaboration amongst at least two of the three different fields. To address this gap, the research was conducted in the City of Tempe in Arizona, USA by means of literature research on integrating the competencies’ frameworks, a case study including the hosting of three capacity building trainings including two or more competency sets and the assessment of the trainings through qualitative analysis. The overarching question of how the three sets of competencies can be integrated into a proposal for one capacity building program to support achieving the interrelated sustainability, emergency management and resilience objectives of local governments was assessed. The results show that firstly, no resilience competency framework was found in the literature, thus resilience competencies were not assessed in the training. Secondly, the comparison of sustainability and emergency management competency frameworks suggests that the sustainability competencies (KCS) and emergency management competencies (NGCC) have overlaps as well as distinct differences. Thirdly, all KCS and all of the NGCC were entailed in at least one of the training instructions and fourthly were addressed by participants in at least one of the three trainings. In addition, participants self-reported that all KCS were already part of the city governments’ processes to varying degrees. Lastly, participants’ satisfaction with the trainings individually and combined as training program were high. However, recommendations for improvements of the capacity building program were made and the need for more trainings was expressed, especially trainings including community members and other city partners and stakeholders. Future research ought to explore the relationship between the KCS and NGCC (i.e. NGCC’s behavioral anchors and key actions and the aspects of KCS) more and a resilience competency framework ought to be explored.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000459356",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/459356","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","sustainability||Emergency management||Capacity-building||Competencies||Local government||resilience","Integrating key competencies in sustainability, emergency management and resilience into a capacity building program for local governments",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,,,"2021-01-05T09:47:25Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This corridor runs along the coast spanning one thousand kilometres from Lagos to Abidjan, bringing together a dense network of megacities, towns and villages. Mobility plays an important part in sustaining this corridor as regional migrants travel along it seeking out opportunities. This doctoral thesis addresses the intersection of urbanisation processes and migration trends. It asks how migration is driving urban transformation along this corridor. How are people on the move contributing to the growth of this urban corridor? And how is this reconfiguring specific locations along the corridor?   The Lagos-Abidjan corridor, whilst also a highly relevant region in and of itself, provides an opportunity to consider wider questions surrounding rapid urban growth, and new scales of urbanisation. The thesis draws on the theoretical apparatus of global urbanisation, and, more precisely, notions of extended and concentrated urbanisation. In analysing the role of migration in current urbanisation patterns, this thesis challenges current definitions of the urban fabric, proposing a more rigorous understanding of how exactly this fabric is produced.   It proposes knots as a theoretical device that allows us to think through the various ways in which individuals engage with the urban fabric and transform it. Introducing specific typologies of knots, the thesis demonstrates how precise ways of tying, such as hitches or binds, can provide an analytical entry-point to understand current transformations of the urban environment. Each chapter is associated with a specific knot that reflects particular dynamics of migration-driven urbanisation along the Lagos-Abidjan corridor. This is both a conceptual endeavor, and an attempt to account for the many ways in which people on the move transform the urban fabric.    The thesis draws on twelve months of fieldwork in South Benin, along with national census material, interviews, and mapping. It employs both mobile and multi-sited ethnography, travelling through the corridor, whilst also drawing on in-depth studies of several locations situated along the Beninese stretch of the corridor. This research is part of a trans-disciplinary collaboration with the Global Programme for Migration and Development at the Swiss Development Cooperation. As such it is embedded within ongoing policy debates on the opportunities and challenges posed by migration in the context of poverty reduction in West Africa.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478236",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478236","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Anthropology, Urban Studies, Migration Studies","The Lagos Abidjan Corridor",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::300 - Social sciences||DDC - DDC::9 - History & geography::910 - Geography & travel||DDC - DDC::6 - Technology, medicine and applied sciences::690 - Buildings",,,"2021-04-12T09:56:45Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"26991",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02100 - Dep.

Based on a broad set of different empirical sources such as interviews, document analysis, and survey data, we characterize the forums according to important dimensions emphasized in forum research and use the forum characteristics to explain three types of first-order forum outputs: participation patterns, information exchange, and trust and procedural fairness. We observe that a mix of different forum characteristics accounts for different forum outputs. One forum that is actively promoting networking opportunities, for example, manages to reach many participants that are not reached by other forums. Furthermore, our results indicate that new types of forums that focus more on the implementation of the Agenda 2030 in general rather than single SDGs might become crucial to foster information exchange among actors.",,,,"1741-5268||0960-1406",,"10.1080/13504509.2020.1719546","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/401873","en","Taylor & Francis",,,"Forums||sustainable development goals||agenda 2030||implementation||information exchange||participation","Implementing the Agenda 2030-what is the role of forums?",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2020-02-27T05:46:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85078902401",,"000512389800001","Int. j. sustain. dev.","5","International Journal of Sustainable Development","27","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This advent of big data has led to commercial success stories, for example in recommender systems in online shops. However, scientific research in various disciplines including environmental and climate science will likely also benefit from increasing volumes of data, new sources for data, and the increasing use of algorithmic approaches to analyze these large datasets. This thesis uses tools from philosophy of science to conceptually address epistemological questions that arise in the analysis of these increasing volumes of data in environmental science with a special focus on data-driven modeling in climate research. Data-driven models, here, are defined as models of phenomena that are built with machine learning. While epistemological analyses of machine learning exist, these have mostly been conducted for fields characterized by a lack of hierarchies of theoretical background knowledge. Such knowledge is often available in environmental science and especially in physical climate science, and it is relevant for the construction, evaluation, and use of data-driven models. This thesis investigates predictions, uncertainty, and understanding from data-driven models in environmental and climate research and engages in in-depth discussions of case studies. These three topics are discussed in three topical chapters. The first chapter addresses the term “big data”, and rationales and conditions for the use of big-data elements for predictions. Namely, it uses a framework for classifying case studies from climate research and shows that “big data” can refer to a range of different activities. Based on this classification, it shows that most case studies lie in between classical domain science and pure big data. The chapter specifies necessary conditions for the use of big data and shows that in most scientific applications, background knowledge is essential to argue for the constancy of the identified relationships. This constancy assumption is relevant both for new forms of measurements and for data-driven models. Two rationales for the use of big-data elements are identified. Namely, big-data elements can help to overcome limitations in financial, computational, or time resources, which is referred to as the rationale of efficiency. Big-data elements can also help to build models when system understanding does not allow for a more theory-guided modeling approach, which is referred to as the epistemic rationale.  The second chapter addresses the question of predictive uncertainties of data-driven models. It highlights that existing frameworks for understanding and characterizing uncertainty focus on specific locations of uncertainty, which are not informative for the predictive uncertainty of data-driven models. Hence, new approaches are needed for this task. A framework is developed and presented that focuses on the justification of the fitness-for-purpose of the models for the specific kind of prediction at hand. This framework uses argument-based tools and distinguishes between first-order and second-order epistemic uncertainty. First-order uncertainty emerges when it cannot be conclusively justified that the model is maximally fit-for-purpose. Second-order uncertainty emerges when it is unclear to what extent the fitness-for-purpose assumption and the underlying assumptions are justified. The application of the framework is illustrated by discussing a case study of data-driven projections of the impact of climate change on global soil selenium concentrations. The chapter also touches upon how the information emerging from the framework can be used in decision-making.  The third chapter addresses the question of scientific understanding. A framework is developed for assessing the fitness of a model for providing understanding of a phenomenon. For this, the framework draws from the philosophical literature on scientific understanding and focuses on the representational accuracy, the representational depth, and the graspability of a model. Then, based on the framework, the fitness of data-driven and process-based climate models for providing understanding of phenomena is compared. It is concluded that data-driven models can, under some conditions, be fit to serve as vehicles for understanding to a satisfactory extent. This is specifically the case when sufficient background knowledge is available such that the coherence of the model with background knowledge provides good reasons for the representational accuracy of the data-driven model, which can be assessed e.g. through sensitivity analyses. This point is illustrated by discussing a case study from atmospheric physics in which data-driven models are used to better understand the drivers of a specific type of clouds. The work of this thesis highlights that while big data is no panacea for scientific research, data-driven modeling offers new tools to scientists that can be very useful for a variety of questions. All three studies emphasize the importance of background knowledge for the construction and evaluation of data-driven models as this helps to obtain models that are representationally accurate. The importance of domain-specific background knowledge and the technical challenges of implementing data-driven models for complex phenomena highlight the importance of interdisciplinary work. Previous philosophical work on machine learning has stressed that the problem framing makes models theory-laden. This thesis shows that in a field like climate research, the model evaluation is strongly guided by theoretical background knowledge, which is also important for the theory-ladenness of data-driven modeling. The results of the thesis are relevant for a range of methodological questions regarding data-driven modeling and for philosophical discussions of models that go beyond data-driven models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000399735",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/399735","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Epistemological Issues in Data-Driven Modeling in Climate Research",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::1 - Philosophy & psychology::100 - Philosophy||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,,"2020-02-15T19:25:15Z","2020-02-17",,,,"yes",,,,,"Combining theory with Big Data?

But how has the impressive corpus of knowledge produced by climate scientists been processed and adapted to inform adaptation decisions in practice? This doctoral thesis compares and analyses how different actors have ap-proached, grappled with, understood, generated relevance and acted upon climate science for adaptation. Drawing on surveys, semi-structured interviews, documentary materials, workshop observations, and the peer-reviewed literature, this thesis encompasses three empirical studies – on global customisations, national uses and local appropriations – as well as a reflective review ordering different social-scientific perspectives according to their underlying aims and concerns. Starting with a historiographic perspective on the origin of the concept of ‘climate’, the introduction (chapter 1) illustrates what climate science at the turn of the 21st century is, before reviewing key social-scientific scholarship on climate adaptation and climate sci-ence. Chapter 2 then describes not only the particular data and methods employed in this thesis, but also reflects how methodological considerations influence the research project more generally. Chapter 3 analyses how countries around the globe differ in their ability to customise climate models into climate projections supporting their national adaptation planning. While a surprising amount of nations have produced such information, the degree to which they are able to tailor the information to their needs and political cultures is strongly correlated with the countries’ general competence to publish climate science. Thus, while climate information is widely available, customising it for own purposes remains restricted to a few countries. Chapter 4 introduces the typology of sailors, divers, and observers to emphasise three particu-lar ways climate projections have been used on a national level. It argues that the more qualitative or quantitative use of climate information is neither correlated to climate service users’ affiliation to a sector, academia, or practice. Further, I find that many adaptation actors used information on climate futures in a qualitative way, but number-crunched cur-rent climate data. Communicating climate information, both qualitatively as well as quanti-tatively, is thus key to increase the national use of climate science. Chapter 5 analyses how, and more importantly why, four sectors vulnerable to heatwaves appropriated scientific climate knowledge differently. By drawing on the work of Eviatar Zerubavel and his cultural cognitive sociology, I find that the formative and performative dimen-sions of knowledge play a major role in appropriating climate information. One, whether concepts are shared between a sector and climate science, allowing to similarly recognise the relevance of climate knowledge. Two, the more experts enjoy a large decision scope, the more they seem to be able to integrate heatwaves into their work. The decision scope is, however, influenced by the properties with which experts work: inert matter allows a different style of adaptation than people. Chapter 6 is a reflective review paper that classifies the vast amount of research into five distinct ways social scientists study climate science and climate adaptation. The aim of this review is to draw out distinct underlying ontological and epistemological differences, which are in themselves influenced by partly competing priorities, concerns and aims. By introducing how social scientists committed to a descriptivist style are different to the amelio-rist, argumentivist, interpretivist and critical order of social science, I aim to emphasise how social science on adapting climate science is a rich but also potentially tribal field. Chapter 7 then discusses the three empirical papers and the review further, and details how the collected material on local appropriations could contribute to ongoing academic dis-cussions. It also expands on how the Youth Strike for Climate influences discussions on climate adaptation (not mitigation), and how the entry of a new societal actor offers promising new research opportunities for the study of ‘adapting climate science’.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429417",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429417","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate adaptation||use of climate science||climate projections||ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL SCIENCES, ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIOLOGY||adaptation to urban heatwaves||Customisation of climate science||transferm, uptake and appropriation of climate knowledge||social-scientific perspectives on climate science and adaptation","Adapting climate science",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::300 - Social sciences",,,"2020-07-31T09:16:31Z","2021-08-05",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"26651",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Reports have documented antimicrobial use in the rapidly expanding aquaculture industry, which may contribute to the rise of antimicrobial resistance, carrying potential consequences for animal-, human-, and ecosystem-health. However, quantitative antimicrobial use across a highly diversified aquaculture industry is not well characterized. Here, we estimate global trends in antimicrobial use in aquaculture in 2017 and 2030 to help target future surveillance efforts and antimicrobial stewardship policies. We estimate antimicrobial use intensity (mg kg−1) for six species groups though a systematic review of point prevalence surveys, which identified 146 species-specific antimicrobial use rates. We project antimicrobial use in each country by combining mean antimicrobial use coefficients per species group with OECD/FAO Agricultural Outlook and FAO FishStat production volumes. We estimate global antimicrobial consumption in 2017 at 10,259 tons (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3163–44,727 tons), increasing 33% to 13,600 tons in 2030 (UI 4193–59,295). The Asia–Pacific region represents the largest share (93.8%) of global consumption, with China alone contributing 57.9% of global consumption in 2017. Antimicrobial consumption intensity per species group was: catfish, 157 mg kg−1 (UI 9–2751); trout, 103 mg kg−1 (UI 5–1951); tilapia, 59 mg kg−1 (UI 21–169); shrimp, 46 mg kg−1 (UI 10–224); salmon, 27 mg kg−1 (UI 17–41) and a pooled species group, 208 mg kg−1, (UI 70–622). All antimicrobial classes identified in the review are classified as medically important. We estimate aggregate global human, terrestrial and aquatic food animal antimicrobial use in 2030 at 236,757 tons (95% UI 145,525–421,426), of which aquaculture constitutes 5.7% but carries the highest use intensity per kilogram of biomass (164.8 mg kg−1). This analysis calls for a substantial scale-up of surveillance capacities to monitor global trends in antimicrobial use. Current evidence, while subject to considerable uncertainties, suggests that for some species groups antimicrobial use intensity surpasses consumption levels in terrestrial animals and humans. Acknowledging the fast-growing nature of aquaculture as an important source of animal nutrition globally, our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced antimicrobial stewardship in a high-growth industry with broad links to water and ecosystem health.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000459688",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-020-78849-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/459688","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Global trends in antimicrobial use in aquaculture",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-01-06T03:43:07Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85098212596",,"000600104900045","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Acknowledging that the barriers and impacts of these policies have not been explored in depth and in consideration of the multiplicity of stakeholder views, we then set out to collect stakeholders’ perspectives of implementation and consequential risks associated with the envisaged transition and with the policies aiming to promote this transition. These concerns are evaluated in a multiple-criteria group decision making approach. By focusing on the resulting most critical implementation barriers, we then outline five plausible socioeconomic scenarios, against which we simulate the impacts of the considered policy strategies on the low-carbon transition of the Chinese built environment as well the extent of their key possible negative consequences, by means of fuzzy cognitive maps.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000371490",,"2214-6296",,"10.1016/j.erss.2019.101306","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/371490","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Transition||Risks||Building sector||China","Contested energy futures, conflicted rewards?

Yet, existing long-term planning tools do not provide the scope or level of integration across the nexus to unravel important development constraints. Moreover, existing tools and data are not always made openly available or are implemented across disparate modeling platforms that can be difficult to link directly with modern scientific computing tools and databases. In this paper, we present the NExus Solutions Tool (NEST): a new open modeling platform that integrates multi-scale energy–water–land resource optimization with distributed hydrological modeling. The new approach provides insights into the vulnerability of water, energy and land resources to future socioeconomic and climatic change and how multi-sectoral policies, technological solutions and investments can improve the resilience and sustainability of transformation pathways while avoiding counterproductive interactions among sectors. NEST can be applied at different spatial and temporal resolutions, and is designed specifically to tap into the growing body of open-access geospatial data available through national inventories and the Earth system modeling community. A case study analysis of the Indus River basin in south Asia demonstrates the capability of the model to capture important interlinkages across system transformation pathways towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, including the intersections between local and regional transboundary policies and incremental investment costs from rapidly increasing regional consumption projected over the coming decades.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000406780",,"1991-9603||1991-959X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465670||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/406780","10.5194/gmd-13-1095-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473948","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The NExus Solutions Tool (NEST) v1.0: An open platform for optimizing multi-scale energy-water-land system transformations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-03-27T05:23:36Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85081949865",,"000519884800001","Geosci. model dev.","3","Geoscientific Model Development","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These segregated high input production systems contribute to some of the world’s most pressing sustainability challenges, including climate change, nutrient imbalances, water pollution, biodiversity decline, and increasingly precarious rural livelihoods. There is substantial evidence that by closing the loop in nutrient and energy cycles, recoupling crop and livestock systems at farm and territorial scales can help reduce the environmental externalities associated with conventional commercial farming without declines in profitability or yields. Yet such “integrated” crop and livestock systems remain rare as a proportion of global agricultural area. Based on an interdisciplinary workshop and additional literature review, we provide a comprehensive historical and international perspective on why integrated crop and livestock systems have declined in most regions and what conditions have fostered their persistence and reemergence in others. We also identify levers for encouraging the reemergence of integrated crop and livestock systems worldwide. We conclude that a major disruption of the current regime would be needed to foster crop-livestock reintegration, including a redesign of research programs, credit systems, payments for ecosystem services, insurance programs, and food safety regulations to focus on whole farm outcomes and the creation of a circular economy. An expansion of the number of integrated crop and livestock systems field trials and demonstrations and efforts to brand integrated crop and livestock systems as a form of sustainable agriculture through the development of eco-labels could also improve adoption, but would likely be unsuccessful at encouraging wide-scale change without a more radical transformation of the research and policy landscape.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000414693",,"1708-3087",,"10.5751/ES-11412-250124","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/414693","en","Resilience Alliance Publications","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","innovation||integrated crop livestock systems||mixed farming systems||socio-technical transitions||sustainable agriculture||technology adoption","Drivers of decoupling and recoupling of crop and livestock systems at farm and territorial scales",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-05-14T02:43:43Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000524149700025",,"1","Ecology and Society","25","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Significantly this agreement recognizes the crucial role finance must play in addressing climate change, highlighting the importance of “making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development” (Article 2.1c of the Paris Agreement). A major transition of our energy system will be required in order to reduce CO2 emissions, but the investment necessary for the rapid and large-scale deployment of low-carbon technology may not materialise. Developers continue to face difficulties in sourcing finance, and many investors still perceive low-carbon projects as high risk. Thus there is a demand for policies that can harness countries’ limited public finances to leverage in private sector finance. Subsequently, some governments have launched or appointed green state investment banks (GIBs), a relatively new policy tool, to support their country’s transition to a more sustainable economy. Thus this dissertation seeks to increase the understanding of this specific public finance policy tool, green state investment banks (GIBs), in order to derive practical insights for policymakers. It does so via three separate papers that each seeks to address a gap in the existing research. Collectively, the papers in this dissertation aim to explore the role of GIBs in mobilising finance to accelerate the energy transition, and to study the politics behind their establishment and design. The first paper investigates the role of GIBs in addressing barriers to finance for developers of low-carbon projects. Then, building on insights from Paper 1 that GIBs may be a suitable policy tool for supporting energy transition, Paper 2 aims to better conceptualise and integrate finance into the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) on transitions using the empirical GIB case. Finally paper 3 draws on insights from Papers 1 and 2 that how well a GIB can mobilise finance for transition is subject to its establishment, mandate and design, which in turn may be conditional on the national political and policymaking environment. Paper 3 therefore explores the political discourse and decisions behind the establishment and design of GIBs. This dissertation makes three main contributions to the literature. First, it provides the first empirical analysis of the detailed roles and activities of GIBs that successfully address barriers and mobilise finance for the low-carbon energy sector. Previous GIB literature has been limited to focusing on their role in the overall economy, describing the various existing models and considering GIBs’ potential to expand climate finance in emerging economies. Second, this dissertation makes a theoretical contribution to the literature on the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) on transitions. It takes a step towards better incorporating finance into the MLP, where finance has remained under-conceptualised despite the recognition of its importance by transitions studies. Third, it performs the first empirical exploration of the political decisions and discourse behind the establishment and design of GIBs by analysing parliamentary debates. To date there has been no analysis in the literature on how GIBs are established or why they exist in their present form. Collectively the findings from the three papers are used to derive implications for policymakers. First this work demonstrates that GIBs are an important and effective policy tool for both mobilising finance for the diffusion of innovative low-carbon technology, thereby enabling technological change and helping to accelerate the energy transition. Second, policymakers should use both neoclassical and evolutionary perspectives when establishing, designing and assessing GIBs and other similar public finance policy tools. Policy that is established, designed and assessed exclusively under the neoclassical viewpoint may not be the most effective, and may also be underestimated in terms of its performance and capacity to accelerate transition. Finally, policymakers should keep in mind that politics matters when it comes to establishing and designing GIBs and that they are not ‘immune’ to a country’s existing political controversy. Therefore a political consensus or government majority may be necessary in order for a country to establish a GIB. However if consensus exists, policymakers may then have greater opportunity to contribute to a GIB’s design aspects, and potentially apply this dissertation’s recommendations regarding neoclassical and evolutionary perspectives. This dissertation then concludes with a discussion on its limitations and avenues for further research.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000570353",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/570353","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Energy transition||Green Bank||Clean energy||Finance||State Investment Bank||evolutionary economics","Green state investment banks: Their role in mobilising finance to accelerate the energy transition and the politics behind their establishment and design",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::330 - Economics",,,"2022-09-13T09:31:39Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,"Innovation pathways, strategies and policies for the Low-Carbon Transition in Europe","730403","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020","26359",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We focus on expertise relevant to any complex problem, especially contributory expertise, divided into ‘knowing-that’ and ‘knowing-how.’ We also deal with interactional expertise and the fact that much expertise is tacit. We explore three questions. First, in examining ‘when is expertise in research integration and implementation required?,’ we review tasks essential (a) to developing more comprehensive understandings of complex problems, plus possible ways to address them, and (b) for supporting implementation of those understandings into government policy, community practice, business and social innovation, or other initiatives. Second, in considering ‘where can expertise in research integration and implementation currently be found?,’ we describe three realms: (a) specific approaches, including interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, systems thinking and sustainability science; (b) case-based experience that is independent of these specific approaches; and (c) research examining elements of integration and implementation, specifically considering unknowns and fostering innovation. We highlight examples of expertise in each realm and demonstrate how fragmentation currently precludes clear identification of research integration and implementation expertise. Third, in exploring ‘what is required to strengthen expertise in research integration and implementation?,’ we propose building a knowledge bank. We delve into three key challenges: compiling existing expertise, indexing and organising the expertise to make it widely accessible, and understanding and overcoming the core reasons for the existing fragmentation. A growing knowledge bank of expertise in research integration and implementation on the one hand, and accumulating success in addressing complex societal and environmental problems on the other, will form a virtuous cycle so that each strengthens the other. Building a coalition of researchers and institutions will ensure this expertise and its application are valued and sustained.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000393273",,,,"10.1057/s41599-019-0380-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/393273","en","Palgrave Macmillan","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Expertise in research integration and implementation for tackling complex problems: when is it needed, where can it be found and how can it be strengthened?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-01-23T03:19:41Z",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85077906442",,"000514124200001",,"1","Palgrave Communications","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
