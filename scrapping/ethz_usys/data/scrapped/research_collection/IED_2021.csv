Their ecological impact can be highly variable over space and time: perceived by some species as disastrous but vital for the survival of others. The ability of a system to cope with such events is called ecological resilience and depends on biotic and abiotic factors, as well as the disturbance legacies. With global climate change, intensity, frequency, and spatial distribution of natural hazards will change. As a result, understanding the ecological resilience is crucial to analyse implications of future changes. So far, studies investigated mainly the impact of one natural hazard on specific species, regions, or ecosystem services but an approach to investigate global patterns is still missing. In this thesis, the impact modelling platform CLIMADA was used to assess the current impact of four natural hazards (tropical cyclones, river floods, wildfires, European winter storms) on ecoregions on a global scale. For each natural hazard type, distinct patterns of a hazard’s impact on ecoregions were found with large differences among and within ecological realms and biomes. Based on the current hazard-ecosystem interactions, the relative change of hazard activity over the next 60 years was quantified by comparing current and future hazard patterns. Results indicated global changes in hazard activity with new patterns of tropical cyclone activity and river flood events for most ecoregions. To identify the implications of changing hazard regimes for ecoregions, recovery times of experimental field studies were analysed and linked to local return periods of tropical cyclones. Differences between modelled return periods and measured recovery times were found between the analysed sites, but a global scientific link was difficult to prove because of differences in site and hazard characteristics. The knowledge about hazard-ecosystem interactions combined with the implications of recovery times yields great potential to investigate upcoming changes through climate change for specific regions. Lastly, the findings of this thesis were applied on a set of ecologically important areas. Here again, all regions experienced natural hazards to some extent so far, but future intensities and frequencies will change radically for some areas. Additionally, the statistical tests imply a link between hazard occurrence and ecological status which has great potential for further application.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000545628",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/545628","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Impact of natural hazards on global ecosystems",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,,,"2022-05-06T10:25:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It explores the large-scale development ideologies of modernization, and the policy tools that were deployed to carry them out. Outlining general periods of macro policy shifts, it shows the evolution of the framework for today’s complex interactions between large-scale agroindustry, mining, and hydrocarbons; diverse small-scale livelihoods; the clandestine and illicit economies of land grabbing, gold, coca and timber; and their operation in globalized and regional economies. While Pan-Amazonian governments have oscillated between authoritarian and more or less democratic forms of governance since the mid-20th century, more democratic transformations and trade have led to interactions among a wide array of new civil society actors; including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), social movements, rural syndicates, and urban social movements; and powerful actors such as national and international technical, financial, and corporate groups and international conservation organizations. New international sources of funding expanded well beyond multilateral or traditional bilateral aid; this includes financing from China and hedge funds, and new forms of both informal and corporate production lending. Integration into numerous globalized markets and finance have had enormous effects on Amazonian politics and economies at all scales. These dynamics have generated new kinds of policies, political framings, institutions, and economies, and restructured old ones; reshaped forms of urbanization, settlements, and land regimes; and stimulated extensive and controversial infrastructure development. On the ground, diverse Amazonian peoples have largely suffered the impacts of these processes, and have continued to adapt to changing circumstances while fighting to advance their own proposals for alternative forms of Amazon conservation and development.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000526184",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526184","en","United Nations Sustinable Development Solutions Network","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","Development policy||globalization||urbanization||settlement||clandestine economy||deforestation||roads||dams||social movements","The Amazon in motion: Changing politics, development strategies, peoples, landscapes, and livelihoods",,"Report","Open access","Amazon Assessment Report 2021, Part II",,,"2022-01-17T10:34:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The spatial transferability of empirical vulnerability functions is limited, leading to the need for computation and validation of region-specific vulnerability functions. In data-scarce regions however, this option is not feasible. In contrast, the physical processes of flood impact model chains can be developed in these regions because of the availability of global datasets. Here we evaluated the implementation of a synthetic vulnerability function into a flood impact model. The function bases on expert heuristics on a targeted sample of representative buildings (targeted heuristics). We applied the vulnerability function in a meso-scale river basin and evaluated the new function by comparing the resulting flood damage with the damage computed by other approaches, (1) an ensemble of vulnerability functions available from the literature, (2) an individual vulnerability function calibrated with region-specific data, and (3) the vulnerability function used in flood risk management by the Swiss government. The results show that targeted heuristics can be a valuable alternative for developing flood impact models in regions without any data or only few data on flood damage.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505651",,,,"10.1111/jfr3.12736","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505651","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","extreme events||flood damages||floodplain||vulnerability","Evaluating targeted heuristics for vulnerability assessment in flood impact model chains",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-16T02:30:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85114345084",,"000693379400001",,"4","Journal of Flood Risk Management","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Efficient communication and coordination with these actors is therefore central. However, ongoing structural changes in forest ownership have in many cases silenced traditional communication channels, especially those involving owners of small forests. Their economic performance is often negligible at an individual level, yet collectively their forests play a pivotal role in a context of increasing demand for wood products. In this article, we analyse and compare forest campaigns in nine European countries. Specifically, we assess one-way and two-way communication models applying different techniques to engage (non-traditional) forest owners. Our analysis of 34 campaigns shows that (i) one-way communication models are still more widely used in the forest sector to engage non-traditional forest owners than two-way communication models; (ii) one-way communication aims at informing and is effective for short-term awareness raising, while two-way communication aims at persuading and is essential to trigger forest management activities over the long-term, (iii) interactive learning tools can play a crucial role for reaching and engaging (non-traditional) forest owners. We further conclude that campaigns could be improved by having 1) joint campaigns with public and private actors, 2) convincing narratives developed based on a good understanding of forest owners' motivations, 3) adapting the timing of campaigns to windows of opportunities and 4) developing intermediary associations (e.g. non-traditional forest owner associations) as connectors and trust builders between different actors as they play a crucial role in providing information to forest owners and supporting their engagement.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000514697",,"1389-9341",,"10.1016/j.forpol.2021.102621","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/514697","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Campaigns||Small-scale forest owners||Communication channels","Communication campaigns to engage (non-traditional) forest owners: A European perspective",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-11T03:51:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85118360636",,,,,"Forest Policy and Economics","133","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

All input data are free, public and globally available, ensuring applicability in data-scarce regions of the Global South. The model was calibrated at resolutions of 1, 4 and 10 km using information on past wildfire damage reported by the disaster database EM-DAT. Despite the large remaining uncertainties, the model yields sound damage estimates with a model performance well in line with the results of other natural catastrophe impact models, such as for tropical cyclones. To complement the global perspective of this study, we conducted two case studies on the recent megafires in Chile (2017) and Australia (2020).

The observed systematic wind speed decline up to around 2010 (stilling) and its subsequent recovery have therefore attracted much attention. While this sequence of downward and upwards trends and good connections to well-established modes of climate variability suggest that stilling could be a manifestation of multidecadal climate variability, a systematic investigation is currently lacking. Here, we use the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE) to decompose internal variability from forced changes in wind speeds. We report that wind speed changes resembling observed stilling and its recovery are well in line with internal climate variability, both under current and future climate conditions. Moreover, internal climate variability outweighs forced changes in wind speeds on 20-year timescales by 1 order of magnitude, despite the fact that smaller, forced changes become relevant in the long run as they represent alterations of mean states. In this regard, we reveal that land use change plays a pivotal role in explaining MPI-GE ensemble-mean wind changes in the representative concentration pathways 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. Our results demonstrate that multidecadal wind speed variability is of greater relevance than forced changes over the 21st century, in particular for wind-related infrastructure like wind energy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000517538",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-12-1239-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517538","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Wind speed stilling and its recovery due to internal climate variability",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-29T12:53:46Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85120529002",,,,"4","Earth System Dynamics","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Basis risk arises from two fundamental sources: the intrinsic heterogeneity within an insurance zone (zonal risk), and the lack of predictive accuracy of the index (design risk). Whereas previous work has focused almost exclusively on design risk, a theoretical and empirical understanding of the role of zonal risk is still lacking. Here we investigate the relative roles of zonal and design risk, using the case of maize yields in Kenya. Our first contribution is to derive a formal decomposition of basis risk, providing a simple upper bound on the insurable basis risk that any index can reach within a given zone. Our second contribution is to provide the first large-scale empirical analysis of the extent of zonal versus design risk. To do so, we use satellite estimates of yields at 10m resolution across Kenya, and investigate the effect of using smaller zones versus using different indices. Our results show a strong local heterogeneity in yields, underscoring the challenge of implementing index insurance in smallholder systems, and the potential benefits of low-cost yield measurement approaches that can enable more local definitions of insurance zones.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000592677",,,,"10.48550/arXiv.2111.08601","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/592677","en","Cornell University","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Index insurance||agricultural risk management basis risk||risk decomposition||satellite data","Optimal index insurance and basis risk decomposition: an application to Kenya",,"Working Paper","Open access",,,"JEL - JEL::G - Financial Economics::G2 - Financial Institutions and Services::G22 - Insurance; Insurance Companies; Actuarial Studies||JEL - JEL::O - Economic Development, Innovation, Technological Change, and Growth::O1 - Economic Development::O16 - Financial Markets; Saving and Capital Investment; Corporate Finance and Governance||JEL - JEL::Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics::Q1 - Agriculture::Q14 - Agricultural Finance","2023-01-16T12:42:19Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,"2111.08601",,,,,,,,,"arXiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, climate change affects surface solar radiation and will therefore directly influence future PV power generation. We use scenarios from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) for a mitigation (SSP1-2.6) and a fossil-fuel-dependent (SSP5-8.5) pathway in order to quantify climate risk for solar PV in Europe as simulated by the Global Solar Energy Estimator (GSEE). We find that PV potential increases by around 5 % in the mitigation scenario, suggesting a positive feedback loop between climate change mitigation and PV potential. While increased clear-sky radiation and reduced cloud cover go hand in hand in SSP1-2.6, the effect of a decrease in clear-sky radiation is outweighed by a decrease in cloud cover in SSP5-8.5, resulting in an increase in all-sky radiation. Moreover, we find that the seasonal cycle of PV generation changes in most places, as generation grows more strongly in winter than in summer (SSP1-2.6) or increases in summer and declines in winter (SSP5-8.5). We further analyze climate change impacts on the spatial variability of PV power generation. Similar to the effects anticipated for wind energy, we report an increase in the spatial correlations of daily PV production with large inter-model agreement yet relatively small amplitude, implying that PV power balancing between different regions in continental Europe will become more difficult in the future. Thus, based on the most recent climate simulations, this research supports the notion that climate change will only marginally impact renewable energy potential, while changes in the spatiotemporal generation structure are to be expected and should be included in power system design.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516190",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-12-1099-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516190","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Climate change impacts on solar power generation and its spatial variability in Europe based on CMIP6",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-20T03:49:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: causes of decadal changes of solar radiation","188601","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,"85119200949",,"000716459600001",,"4","Earth System Dynamics","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We use a public values perspective, identifying public values linked to the roles and responsibilities of the state. Analyzing public values allows understanding how the public perceives state actions and consequently how the authority may adequately respond and accommodate these expectations and doing so, anchor policies in public values. We begin by exploring the concepts of public value and posing the contextual background. The article then presents the most salient public values linked to the roles and responsibilities of the authorities based on focus group data. For residents the most important function of the public authority in relation to energy transitions is to inform and raise awareness. Other important functions are providing financial support and regulating. Acknowledging the importance of communication and its associated values allows public authorities to set the anchor to then effectively roll out, plan or support energy transition projects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000506038",,"0301-4215",,"10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112577","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/506038","en","Elsevier BV","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Geothermal energy||Public values||Publicness||Public action||Governance||Energy transition","Rowing, steering or anchoring?

The goal of TreeNet is to generate high temporal resolution datasets of tree growth and tree water dynamics for research and to provide near real-time indicators of forest growth performance and drought stress to a wide audience. This paper explains the key working steps from the installation of sensors in the field to data acquisition, data transmission, data processing, and online visualization. Moreover, we discuss the underlying premises to convert dynamic stem size changes into relevant biological information. Every 10 min, the stem radii of about 420 trees from 13 species at 61 sites in Switzerland are measured electronically with micrometer precision, in parallel with the environmental conditions above and below ground. The data are automatically transmitted, processed and stored on a central server. Automated data processing (R-based functions) includes screening of outliers, interpolation of data gaps, and extraction of radial stem growth and water deficit for each tree. These long-term data are used for scientific investigations as well as to calculate and display daily indicators of growth trends and drought levels in Switzerland based on historical and current data. The current collection of over 100 million data points forms the basis for identifying dynamics of tree-, site- and species-specific processes along environmental gradients. TreeNet is one of the few forest networks capable of tracking the diurnal and seasonal cycles of tree physiology in near real-time, covering a wide range of temperate forest species and their respective environmental conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000513563",,"2624-893X",,"10.3389/ffgc.2021.776905","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/513563","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Early-warning||Radial wood and bark growth||Forest dynamics||Research infrastructure||Tree water relations||Observation system||Near real-time monitoring||Nowcast","TreeNet–The Biological Drought and Growth Indicator Network",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-04T09:57:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,"ICOS-CH: Integrated Carbon Observation System in Switzerland||ICOS-CH Phase 2||ICOS-CH Phase 3","148992||173691||198227","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Forschungsinfrastrukturen||Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,,,"85119529827",,"000720143700001",,,"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet societal decisions on preventive actions depend on the expected impacts of the weather event. In order to better inform such preventive actions, meteorological services are currently working towards including expected impacts into their warnings. We develop an open-source impact forecasting system for building damage due to winter windstorms in Switzerland. It combines a numerical ensemble weather prediction model with exposure and vulnerability data. This system forecasts expected building damage in Swiss Francs with a 2-day lead time on a 500-m grid or aggregated to administrative regions. We compare the forecasted building damage with insurance claims in the canton of Zurich. The uncertainty of the impact forecasts is large. For the majority of days with severe winter windstorm damage, the mean forecasted damage was in the right order of magnitude, with one missed event and one false alarm. For thunderstorms and foehn storms, the rate of missed events and false alarms is much higher, most likely related to the limited meteorological forecast skill. Such impact forecasts can inform decision makers on preventive actions, such as allocating emergency response and other assets. Additionally, impact forecasts could also help communicating the severity of the upcoming event to the general public as well as indirectly help meteorological forecasters with taking warning decisions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522593",,"1350-4827||1469-8080",,"10.1002/met.2035","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522593","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Building damage||impact forecast||Impact modelling||impact-based warning||numerical weather prediction","Towards operational impact forecasting of building damage from winter windstorms in Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-03T03:49:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85121877338",,"000735210400010","Meteorol. appl.","6","Meteorological Applications","28","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement translate global to Swiss mitigation targets, which bring in forests and timber as potential carbon sinks. However, it remains unclear how the sinks are best combined in a local context, especially when forest stands simultaneously fulfill multiple functions. As a result, there is a potential for trade-offs, especially when some functions are prioritized over others to meet climate mitigation targets. Since the Swiss national vote on 13 June 2021 refuted a new CO2 law, future policies and the role of forests are again open to define. So far, few actors have publicly taken position, where information as a potential driver to develop attitudes comes in. Especially in new policy areas, such as carbon sinks, where the knowledge about the problem and its’ underlying factors is incomplete or uncertain, information comes center-stage. Hence, this study’s main goal is to answer the research question how actor attitudes and the exchange of information contribute to policy-oriented learning concerning carbon sinks in the forest vs. timber. In the given context, learning describes an alteration of the mindset or intention of actors including policy objectives through information. I rely on the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) since it combines policy beliefs with the exchange of information. While the ACF serves as the study’s framework, I apply a social network analysis (SNA) to visually and quantitatively explore my expectations. Besides, I use scoping interviews to gain a deeper understanding of the found patterns. The empirical focus on the canton of Berne provides valuable insights about a representative canton for Switzerland with ecologically diverse forests serving multiple functions depending on the local context and a broad range of involved actors for their management. I collected data on policy beliefs and information exchange regarding carbon sinks in the forest vs. timber through five scoping interviews and a comprehensive survey sent to 70 actors relevant for the canton of Berne’s forest policy. Considering my overall research question, I can state that the studied actor attitudes influence to some degree how actors exchange information and hence contribute to policy-oriented learning. The analysis shows that policy instruments partly explain information exchange concerning carbon sinks, especially amongst the supporters of timber use. Therein, few central stakeholders such as cantonal and federal administrations play a crucial role as intermediaries for knowledge transfer. Besides, although many actors described the complexity of carbon sinks as a main hindering factor, it does not explain their information search and patterns of providing information. Finally, the results underline a high potential for policy-oriented learning within as well as across different beliefs concerning carbon sinks in the canton of Berne. Finally, according to the ACF and actors’ comments, a neutral platform to exchange information and define a common baseline for carbon sinks in forests and timber is missing. Since the ACF literature matches actors’ needs, I propose the central stakeholders identified in this study establish, for example, a forum to close this gap. Therein, these actors should become aware of their role as intermediaries between diverging policy beliefs concerning carbon sinks. Finally, based on the results of this study, I assume there is enough common ground to establish effective policies respecting the multifunctionality of the Bernese forests, just as the diversity of values of the people who manage and use it.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516412",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516412","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Share to learn?

As work in the academic sector often involves frequent long-distance travel, this development calls into question academic practices and is causing academics and academic institutions to reconsider, debate, and adapt their travel behavior and policies. This paper discusses a case study at ETH Zurich, one of the first universities with an ongoing, university-wide project to reduce greenhouse gas emissions due to air travel by faculty, staff, and students. Based on a qualitative analysis of interviews (N = 15), a survey (N = 176), and other data sources, I outline arguments for and against reducing air travel. I focus on assumed causal relations between air travel and doing ‘good’ academic work. The results reveal that the participants expected reduced air travel to affect their productivity, success, excellence, internationality, quality of research, teaching, visibility and presence, role modelling, consistency, freedom, and the humanitarian impact of their research. While the dominant assumption was that reducing air travel would harm science, this study reveals alternative assumptions that science would benefit or remain unaffected. Results also show that the debate on reducing air travel may encourage transformations in the organization of academia. Drawing on the experience of the air travel project at ETH Zurich may help other institutions and individuals initiate or advance discussions on the ethics, necessity, and future of academic air travel while acknowledging the diversity of viewpoints on air travel reduction as well as its deep implications for academia.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000490445",,"2214-367X",,"10.1016/j.tbs.2021.04.011","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/490445","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Air travel||Flying less||Business travel||University management||Climate change||Sustainable campus","Does flying less harm academic work?

We estimate an annual global TC exposure increase of 26% (33 million people) for a 1 °C increase in global mean surface temperature, assuming present-day population. The timing of warming matters when additionally accounting for population change, with global population projected to peak around mid-century and decline thereafter. A middle-of-the-road socio-economic scenario combined with 2 °C of warming around 2050 increases exposure by 41% (52 million). A stronger mitigation scenario reaching 2 °C around 2100 limits this increase to 20% (25 million). Rapid climate action therefore avoids interference with peak global population timing and limits climate-change-driven exposure.

The recoupling of crops and livestock is one type of agroecological practice that has potential to help reduce the use of off-farm inputs, improve soil quality, and reduce costs for farmers. Yet, a major part of the world's agricultural landscapes remain dominated by conventional specialized crop and livestock practices. In particular, grazing animals in perennial cropping systems may reduce pesticide and fuel use, decrease labor, and build soil organic carbon and soil fertility. In this study, we examined adopters and non-adopters’ perceptions of a niche system, integrated sheep-vineyard systems (ISVS) in California. We aimed at understanding the conditions under which ISVS, a specific case of ICLS (integrated crop-livestock systems), could be mainstreamed. We then contextualized these interviews using the Multi-Level Perspective framework to analyze the levers favoring or impeding mainstreaming of this niche system. We considered both pull factors arising from changes in the landscape, and push factors arising through decentralized, grassroot processes. Our inductive analysis is a promising first insight into farmers’ perceptions and motivations toward ISVS adoption in California, considering both vineyard managers and contractors (i.e. shepherds renting their sheep to vineyard managers). We found a positive perception of ISVS among both current adopters and non-adopters regarding the potential agronomic, environmental and economic benefits of these practices. All adopters were satisfied with this system as they experienced labor and fuel savings, soil quality improvement and marketing advantages. Local push factors (bottom-up levers emerging from the niche systems) were highlighted by interviewees as contributing to adoption. Push factors identified include knowledge exchange and networking between vineyard managers and developing marketing pathways for “carbon-positive” wool, meat and wine products. However, some pull factors (macro-economic and policy levers acting as top-down levers) could help move the system beyond limited adoption. We point out biotechnical and socio-economic research avenues to encourage the scaling-up of ISVS and ICLS more broadly. On the biotechnical dimension, we recommend continuing and scaling-out system experiments to redesign vineyards considering sheep integration and evaluate the effect of grazing on soil quality and fire management. On the socio-economic dimension, we encourage the exploration of relevant spatial scenarios through co-design of collaborative arrangements between vineyard managers and contractors at the landscape level. Greater research on the social, environmental and economic services provided by ISVS is urgently needed to inform state and federal agricultural policies, including whether such systems should be supported through payment for ecosystem services and as part of environmental good practices and fire safety recommendations.",,,,"0264-8377||1873-5754","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/508933||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504200","10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105680","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510724","en","Elsevier",,,"Crop-livestock integration||Wine||Sustainability||Multi-level perspective","Moving niche agroecological initiatives to the mainstream: A case-study of sheep-vineyard integration in California",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-09-06T02:56:35Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113746551",,"000702845500003","Land Use Policy",,"Land Use Policy","109","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this crowded marketplace of ideas, scholars and practitioners are in danger of adverse ontological selection whereby certain approaches and insights are systematically ignored and certain problem conceptions are prioritized over others.

National and international legislation increasingly mandates a monitoring of genetic diversity. Examples are the United Nation's Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Aichi target 13 and the current post-2020 negotiations to specify a new target for maintaining genetic diversity. To date, only a few pilot projects have been launched that systematically monitor genetic diversity over time in natural populations of a broad variety of wild species. The Swiss Federal Office for the Environment mandated a feasibility study in 2019 for implementing a national monitoring of genetic diversity in natural populations. To obtain information on whether stakeholders are interested in such a systematic monitoring, what they would expect from such a monitoring and where they see respective caveats, we conducted an online survey, which 138 (42% of those surveyed) Swiss stakeholders answered. We find that Swiss stakeholders are generally aware of the lacking evidence regarding the status of genetic diversity in wild populations and species. Accordingly, most stakeholders are interested in a monitoring of genetic diversity and see opportunities for the application of its results in their work. Nevertheless, stakeholders also expressed concerns regarding financial resources and that the results of a genetic diversity monitoring program would not benefit conservation practice. Our findings highlight the importance of stakeholder engagement and demonstrate the value of a detailed stakeholder analysis prior to developing and implementing a genetic diversity monitoring program. A powerful tool for examining the constellation and interactions of the different stakeholders are social network analyses (SNAs). Finally, it is particularly important to communicate transparently about the possibilities and limitations of a genetic diversity monitoring program as well as to closely involve stakeholders from the beginning to increase the acceptance of genetic diversity monitoring and facilitate its implementation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494859",,"1572-9737||1566-0621",,"10.1007/s10592-021-01379-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494859","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Conservation genetics||Genetic diversity||International obligations||Monitoring||Stakeholder analysis","Developing a monitoring program of genetic diversity: what do stakeholders say?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T10:27:34Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85106675674",,"000655540600001","Conserv Genet","5","Conservation Genetics","22","::ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, efforts to use these genomes to track trends in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) have been limited thus far. We used 22,102 genomes from public databases to track AMR trends in nontyphoidal Salmonella in food animals in the United States. In 2018, genomes deposited in public databases carried genes conferring resistance, on average, to 2.08 antimicrobial classes in poultry, 1.74 in bovines, and 1.28 in swine. This represents a decline in AMR of over 70% compared to the levels in 2000 in bovines and swine, and an increase of 13% for poultry. Trends in resistance inferred from genomic data showed good agreement with U.S. phenotypic surveillance data (weighted mean absolute difference ± standard deviation, 5.86% 6 8.11%). In 2018, resistance to 3rd-generation cephalosporins in bovines, swine, and poultry decreased to 9.97% on average, whereas in quinolones and 4th-generation cephalosporins, resistance increased to 12.53% and 3.87%, respectively. This was concomitant with a decrease of blaCMY-2 but an increase in blaCTX-M-65 and gyrA D87Y (encoding a change of D to Y at position 87). Core genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) phylogenies show that resistance to these antimicrobial classes was predominantly associated with Salmonella enterica serovar Infantis and, to a lesser extent, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and its monophasic variant I 4,[5],12:i:2, whereas quinolone resistance was also associated with S. enterica serovar Dublin. Between 2000 and 2018, trends in serovar prevalence showed a composition shift where S. Typhimurium decreased while S. Infantis increased. Our findings illustrate the growing potential of using genomes in public databases to track AMR in regions where sequencing capacities are currently expanding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516419",,"2165-0497",,"10.1128/Spectrum.00495-21","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516419","en","American Society for Microbiology","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Nontyphoidal Salmonella||antimicrobial resistance||food animals||genomic epidemiology||public data||Salmonella||surveillance","Multidrug resistance dynamics in salmonella in food animals in the united states: An analysis of genomes from public databases",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-23T04:04:46Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Piloting on-site interventions for reducing antimicrobial use in livestock farming in emerging economies||Towards quantification of the contribution of plasmids to the spread of antibiotic resistance","180179||167121","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","ERA-NET + EJP||NFP 70: Gesuch",,,,,"85119215351",,"000728629300060","Microbiol Spectr","2","Microbiology Spectrum","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although there have been isolated periods of deforestation control, most recently between 2004 and 2012, the overall trajectory of the region since the colonial period has been one of forest loss and degradation. Addressing this challenge is especially urgent in the context of adverse climate-ecology feedbacks and tipping points. Here we describe the trends and outcomes of deforestation and degradation in the Amazon. We then highlight how historical development paradigms and policies have helped to cement the land use activities and structural lock-ins that underpin deforestation and degradation. We emphasize how the grounds for establishing a more sustainable economy in the Amazon were never consolidated, leading to a situation where forest conservation and development remain dependent on external programs—punitive measures against deforestation and fire and public social programs. This situation makes progress toward a forest transition(arresting forest loss and degradation and restoring forest landscapes) highly vulnerable to changes in political leadership, private sector engagement, and global market signals. After summarizing these challenges, we present a suite of measures that collectively could be transformational to helping overcome destructive path dependencies in the region. These include innovations in agricultural management, improved forest governance through landscape approaches, developing a local forest economy, sustainable peri-urbanization, and the empowerment of women and youth. These initiatives must be inclusive and equitable, enabling the participation and empowerment of local communities, particularly indigenous groups who have faced numerous historical injustices and are increasingly under threat by current politics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000524261",,"1543-5938||1545-2050",,"10.1146/annurev-environ-012220-010228","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524261","en","Annual Reviews","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","conservation||livelihoods||political ecology||governance||forest transition||justice","Forests and Sustainable Development in the Brazilian Amazon: History, Trends, and Future Prospects",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-10T12:48:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85117746431",,"000713670600023","Annu.

Furthermore, we discuss five emerging questions—causality, exclusion, compliance and monitoring, excess supply and emerging country markets—and identify directions for future research.

In fisheries, P50 decreased from 52% [95% CI 39 to 65%] to 22% [95% CI 14 to 30%]. We map AMR at 10-kilometer resolution, finding resistance hotspots along Asia’s major river systems and coastal waters of China and India.

At least three fields address these challenges within cities: sustainability, emergency management and resilience. However, these three fields often still work in silos, separated by administrative structures. One way to promote a synergistic and integrative city-level approach across the three fields is through actively fostering collaboration. This can be facilitated through a competency-based capacity building program. So far, only few capacity building programs attempted to foster collaboration across departments and fields. To address this gap the researchers collaborated with the City of Tempe, Arizona, USA to implement a program that addresses the respective sets of competencies and concepts in these fields. The question was asked how these competency sets and concepts can be integrated into one capacity building program to support collaboration across departments. The focus was on emergency management and sustainability competencies respectively, as a literature review revealed paucity of a resilience competency framework. Three capacity building trainings were implemented and competency development was evaluated using a pre-post survey and analysis of training interactions. The results show that: i) overall collaboration across departments was facilitated; ii) participants demonstrated sustainability and emergency management competencies in at least one of the three trainings, iii) participants were satisfied with the trainings individually and combined into one training program. The work concludes with recommendations to increase the development of collaborative competencies and to foster collaboration in practice in the long-term as part of “institutional work” in order to influence administrative structures as well.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493871",,"2212-4209",,"10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102408","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493871","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Fostering collaboration in city governments’ sustainability, emergency management and resilience work through competency-based capacity building",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-10T05:25:26Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85109048324",,"000688621100003",,,"International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","63","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Observations from exhumed rocks suggest this region of the subduction interface is a shear zone with frictional lenses embedded in a viscous matrix. Here, we use numerical models to explore the transient slip characteristics of finite-width frictional-viscous megathrust shear zones. Our model utilizes an invariant, continuum-based, regularized form of rate- and state-dependent friction (RSF) and simulates earthquakes along spontaneously evolving faults embedded in a 2D heterogeneous continuum. The setup includes two elastic plates bounding a viscoelastoplastic shear zone (subduction interface melange) with inclusions (clasts) of varying distributions and viscosity contrasts with respect to the surrounding weaker matrix. The entire shear zone exhibits the same velocity-weakening RSF parameters, but the lower viscosity matrix has the capacity to switch between RSF and viscous creep as a function of local stress state. Results demonstrate a mechanism in which stress heterogeneity in these shear zones both (a) sets the “speed limit” for earthquake ruptures that nucleate in clasts such that they propagate at slow velocities; and (b) permits the transmission of slow slip from clast to clast, allowing slow ruptures to propagate substantial distances over the model domain. For reasonable input parameters, modeled events have moment-duration statistics, stress drops, and rupture propagation rates that overlap with some natural slow slip events. These results provide new insights into how geologic observations from ancient analogs of the slow slip source may scale up to match geophysical constraints on modern slow slip phenomena.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000508855",,"2576-604X",,"10.1029/2021AV000416","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/508855","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","subduction megathrust||frictional-viscous transition||episodic tremor and slow slip||slow slip events||heterogeneous melange||subduction interface","Transient Slow Slip Characteristics of Frictional-Viscous Subduction Megathrust Shear Zones",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-09T02:43:46Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Influence of plate tectonics on life evolution and biodiversity: bio-geodynamical numerical modeling approach","192296","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,,,"000702380000003",,"3","AGU Advances","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While anticipating the ways in which “places” can potentially affect a technology's deployment is relevant to mitigating social risks, social aspects are often omitted or included late in site selection processes. Here, we present a methodology to include place factors upstream in the site-screening process based on a literature review of former CCS implementation processes and maps of potential locations. We identified the place factors that had been determinative for the acceptance of or opposition to 38 CCS projects. Then, the usability of geographic information system (GIS) maps to represent social factors around potential storage sites in Switzerland was assessed. Our results show that place factors have positively influenced 22 and negatively impacted 16 projects in the past. In addition, it is possible to visualize several factors around potential CO2 storage locations, while unmappable factors must be explored at later stages. We conclude that awareness of place factors coupled with reflection on the values pushed by the technology will likely enable better site choices.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000497956",,"1750-5836||1878-0148",,"10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103399","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/497956","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Place factors||Social site characterisation||GIS||Siting||Public engagement","Anticipating the social fit of CCS projects by looking at place factors",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-28T03:14:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85110273144",,"000696710200003",,,"International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control","110","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

First, this is the first paper to use nationally representative panel data to explore the proliferation and implications of sustainability certification. Second, we consider both small (family-operated) and large (agro-industrial) farms. We use data from Peru’s National Agricultural Survey and panel and pseudo panel methods. In terms of outcome variables, we focus on annual farm income and farm practices. Although sustainability standards rhetorically emphasize small farms, we find that certification is much more common among large farms than among small farms. Further, certified farms are geographically clustered, which confirms previous findings. Results also show that certification is associated with higher farm incomes and changes in farm practices among large but not among small farms. These differences are not attributable to farm size alone but likely associated with other characteristics of large farms such as crop choices and type of standard. We conclude that the importance and potential of certification in the large farm sector have been underappreciated and should receive more scientific attention in the future.",,,,"0305-750X",,"10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105520","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539541","en","Elsevier",,,"Sustainability standards||Certification||Fairtrade||Organic||GlobalGAP","Large farms, large benefits?

Our research shows that different local stakeholders groups disregarded some policy risks for the Alberta oil sands and Canadian energy transition. These stakeholders expected the sector to grow, despite increasing environmental penalties and external market pressures. The study revealed that blind-spots on risks, or “risk blindness”, increased as stakeholders became less certain about policy climate goals. We argue that “risk blindness” could be amplified by dominant institutional narratives that contradict scientific research and international climate policy. Strategies that integrate local narratives, considered as marginalized, provide perspectives beyond emission reductions and are essential for meeting climate targets while supporting a just transition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515036",,"2210-4224","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/301434||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515036","10.1016/j.eist.2021.10.008","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/534019","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Energy transition||Risk and uncertainties||Risk blindness||Ggreenhouse gas emissions||Oil sands||Stranded assets","Risk blindness in local perspectives about the Alberta oil sands hinders Canada's decarbonization",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-11-13T08:09:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85118593842",,"000718147500005",,,"Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions","40","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While there is growing evidence about the environmental effectiveness of these commitments (i.e., whether they meet their conservation goals), there is little information on how they influence producers’ opportunity to access sustainable markets and related livelihood outcomes, or how design and implementation choices influence tradeoffs or potential synergies between effectiveness and equity in access. This paper explores these research gaps and makes three main contributions by: i) defining and justifying the importance of analyzing access equity and its relation to effectiveness when implementing forest-focused supply chain policies such as ZDCs, ii) identifying seven policy design principles that are likely to maximize synergies between effectiveness and access equity, and iii) assessing effectiveness-access equity tensions and synergies across common ZDC implementation mechanisms amongst the five largest firms in each of the leading agricultural forest-risk commodity sectors: palm oil, soybeans, beef cattle, and cocoa. To enhance forest conservation while avoiding harm to the most vulnerable farmers in the tropics, it is necessary to combine stringent rules with widespread capacity building, greater involvement of affected actors in the co-production of implementation mechanisms, and support for alternative rural development paths.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507976",,"0959-3780||1872-9495","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507976||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523072","10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2021.102357","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524881","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Agriculture||Conservation||Supply chain||Voluntary environmental policies||Effectiveness||Equity","Designing effective and equitable zero-deforestation supply chain policies",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-02T02:42:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Assessing the effectiveness and equity of zero-deforestation commitment implementation in the palm oil sector","192373||192373","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte GSW",,,,,"85115795981",,"000704267800003","Glob. environ. change",,"Global Environmental Change","70","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study analyzes determinants of changes in subjective levels of psychological strain experienced during the lockdown.  Methods: An online survey conducted as part of a larger mixed methods study examined the material and emotional aspects of individual reactions to the lockdown from a socio-ecological perspective. Participants (N = 5932) were asked about their personal and employment status, housing features, changes in various activities (e.g., physical activity, watching TV, social media use) and aspects of mental distress and well-being.  Results: A substantial share of participants reported to feel depressed (33%) and anxious (43%) more often during the COVID-19 lockdown than before, whereas significantly (p < 0.001) less persons reported a decrease of these negative feelings (depressed 17%; anxious 14%). Women, single people, students and people who lost their jobs or were temporally unemployed due to the lockdown experienced a particularly strong increase of subjective psychological strain. Important residential factors reducing subjective psychological strain were the general comfort of the housing situation and having a private garden or multiple types of outdoor space. Considering leisure activities, the strongest positive psychological effect resulted from increased physical activities, followed by reading and cooking. However, 45% of the participants reported a decreased frequency of physical activity during the lockdown compared to before, whereas significantly less persons (26%) reported a corresponding increase (p < 0.001).  Conclusion: Consistent with other studies, the results indicate a substantial reduction of subjective psychological well-being of the population during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Switzerland. The psychological burdens which the participants experienced differ depending on personal characteristics and situational factors. Negative psychological and economic consequences and gender inequalities should accordingly be carefully considered and actively prevented when designing COVID-19 measures. Supportive economic and social, cognitive and behavioral psychological interventions need to be designed and implemented to maintain the well-being of residents during lockdown.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000511383",,"1664-1078",,"10.3389/fpsyg.2021.735293","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/511383","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","COVID-19||lockdown||well-being||social factors||housing||employment status||leisure activities","Activities, Housing Situation and Other Factors Influencing Psychological Strain Experienced During the First COVID-19 Lockdown in Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-25T02:50:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85116369446",,"000706157500001","Front Psychol",,"Frontiers in Psychology","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We focus on two characteristics of negotiated agreements that previous literature has not explicitly addressed. First, we scrutinize the role of policy core and secondary policy beliefs in actor constellations. Secondly, we address partial success, that is, the notion that actors concede on some points, but in return succeed in others. We investigate these two characteristics in the 2014 reform of Swiss agricultural policy. Based on cluster and social network analysis, we exemplify how negotiated agreements embedded in a participatory policy process lead to a surprising level of policy change by promoting agricultural production practices with an intended positive effect on the environment. We show that rather than coalitions based on policy core beliefs, the formation of groups of actors based on secondary beliefs who span across the coalitions formed the basis for a negotiated agreement.

Climate sensitive decision-making in companies is vital to addressing the urgent need for making societies resilient to climate change and entailed risks. Providing and using state-of-the-art scientific knowledge in decision-making, an integral aspect of climate services, poses great challenges for climate scientists and decision-makers. This article aims to contribute to more informed decision-making processes in climate adaptation by addressing the question “How can climate scientists practically implement a transdisciplinary (TD) collaboration with an industry partner to reduce the gap between climate science and decision-making in industry?”. We present an engagement framework that provides guidance to address this question. This framework conceptualizes the engagement using two spheres of interests offering the opportunity to explore and widen their overlap as a common space. We present a case study where we apply this framework to a TD collaboration for climate service provision with a Swiss hydropower industry stakeholder; leading to four practical recommendations for effectively using the proposed framework: (1) Secure an anchor person at management level of the decision-maker entity, (2) Be prepared to invest time into triggering and maintaining active engagement by all collaborators, (3) From the start, communicate the open nature of insights and solutions from the engagement process, (4) Be aware that you are working in a field of tension. The presented engagement framework and practical recommendations are particularly beneficial for climate scientists that are not yet familiar with TD collaborations and enables co-development of bespoke climate services.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492647",,"2405-8807",,"10.1016/j.cliser.2021.100237","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492647","en","Elsevier BV","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Research-practice collaboration||Transdisciplinary||Hydropower||Usability gap||Decision-making||Climate change","Widening the common space to reduce the gap between climate science and decision-making in industry",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-02T07:47:21Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85108830378",,"000703656300005",,,"Climate Services","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we mapped AMR rates in pigs, chickens and cattle in China using 446 surveys of event-based surveillance between 2000 and 2019 for foodborne bacteria, in combination with geospatial models to identify locations where conducting new surveys could have the highest benefits. Using maps of uncertainty, we show that eastern China currently has the highest AMR rates, and southwestern and northeastern China would benefit the most from additional surveillance efforts. Instead of distributing new surveys evenly across administrative divisions, using geographically targeted surveillance could reduce AMR prediction uncertainty by two-fold.

We applied a combination of a questionnaire survey and follow up interviews with members of research teams of multiple, broadly comparable projects to make an assessment of achieved RKU levels using a combination of quantitative statistical hypothesis testing and narrative description of survey responses. Research knowledge dissemination by members of the project team who work for non-academic institutions or champions, e.g. particularly motivated people that promote and facilitate implementation or adoption of the project results, and via television was associated with higher research knowledge utilization. By contrast, dissemination by members of the project team working for academic institutions and via peer-reviewed journals was associated with lower RKU. The achieved level of RKU was consistently lower than the targeted level of RKU across spatial scales. The discrepancy between the perceived level of RKU and the evidence provided by survey respondents indicates the need for better monitoring the utilisation of research knowledge in development pathways. Our results further suggest that three years project duration is too short to achieve high levels of RKU in socio-ecological systems.

How does the public perceive CHW and its handling? We address these (so far) open questions in this study that comprises multiple methodological approaches. We combine a technical and system assessment with a societal (perception) assessment, based on a representative survey (N = 3082) among the German-speaking population of Switzerland. We draw some conclusions for a possible way forward in hazardous waste policy and governance. We find a remarkable disparity between technical analysis and public perception. The community should discuss whether the current NW management is forward-looking and may serve as a model for CHW. For CHW, the multiplicity of agents and the heterogeneity of substances may make the situation too complex, non-transparent, and thus less salient in the public perception. Paradoxically, the ubiquity of conventional waste, traditional community landfills, and everyday handling of some waste may make it appear less alarming than NW.",,,,"0304-3894||1873-3336",,"10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.125422","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/475573","en","Elsevier",,,"Conventional hazardous waste||Governance||Nuclear/radioactive waste||Risk perception||Technical safety assessment","Sharp discrepancies between nuclear and conventional toxic waste: Technical analysis and public perception",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-03-22T03:56:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102367497",,"000653031500001",,,"Journal of Hazardous Materials","414","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it is less clear to what extent data-driven models that successfully predict a phenomenon are representationally accurate and thus increase our understanding of the phenomenon. Besides empirical accuracy, we propose three criteria to indirectly assess the relationships learned by the ML algorithms and how they relate to a phenomenon under investigation: first, consistency of the outcomes with background knowledge; second, the adequacy of the measurements, datasets and methods used to construct a data-driven model; third, the robustness of interpretable machine learning analyses across different ML algorithms. We apply the three criteria with a case study modelling of the effect of different urban green infrastructure types on temperature and show that our approach improves the assessment of representational accuracy and reduces representational uncertainty, which can improve the understanding of modelled phenomena.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000479923",,"1364-8152||1873-6726",,"10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105048","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/479923","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Urban heat||Machine learning||Representational accuracy||Interpretable machine learning||Data-driven modelling","Assessing the representational accuracy of data-driven models: The case of the effect of urban green infrastructure on temperature",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-22T03:13:06Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Combining theory with Big Data?

Die Transition in Richtung alternativer Systeme wird durch zwei Szenarien konkretisiert. Als Fallbeispiel wurde die Abwasserreinigungsanlage Bern (ARA Bern) als eine Vertreterin der privatrechtlich organisierten ARAs ausgewählt und untersucht. Grundlagen für die Analyse waren Erlasse und Dokumente bezüglich Gewässerschutz und Abwasserreinigung sowie fünf Experteninterviews. Die Untersuchung bringt drei zentrale Resultate: Erstens wird gezeigt, dass die ARA Bern starke dynamische Kapazitäten besitzt, sie aber zurzeit nicht im Bereich der alternativen Abwassersysteme nutzt. Zweitens wird deutlich, dass die Transition in Richtung alternativer Systeme eine Anpassung der Gesetzgebung, insbesondere der Anschlusspflicht, bedingen würde. Drittens wird aufgezeigt, dass zurzeit kein Druck für eine entsprechende Anpassung besteht, weshalb eine Entwicklung hin zu einem vermehrten Einsatz alternativer Systeme in der nächsten Zeit nicht zu erwarten ist. Aus den Resultaten kann geschlossen werden, dass starke dynamische Kapazitäten einer ARA zu einem hohen Potential bezüglich alternativer Abwassersysteme führen können, die Rahmenbedingungen aber letztlich über die Nutzung dieses Potentials entscheiden.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557663",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557663","de","ETH Zürich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Alternative Abwassersysteme - Analyse der für den Einsatz alternativer Abwassersysteme relevanten dynamischen Kapazitäten und Rahmenbedingungen am Beispiel der ARA Bern",,"Bachelor Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment",,"2022-07-12T13:49:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This poses serious threats to farming activities and has major implications for sustaining rural livelihoods and food security. Farmers’ ability to respond to and withstand the increasing incidence of drought events needs to be strengthened and their resilience enhanced. Implementation of measures to enhance resilience is determined by decisions of farmers and it is important to understand the reasons behind their behavior. We assessed the viability of measures to enhance resilience of farmers to drought, by developing a general framework that covers economic-technical and psychological-cognitive aspects, here summarized under the terms (1) motivation and (2) feasibility. The conceptual framework was applied to cocoa farmers in Ghana and tef farmers in Ethiopia by using questionnaire-based surveys. A portfolio of five specific measures to build resilience (i.e., irrigation, shade trees, fire belts, bookkeeping, mulching, early mature varieties, weather forecast, reduced tillage, improved harvesting) in each country was evaluated with a closed-ended questionnaire that covered the various aspects of motivation and feasibility whereby farmers were asked to (dis)agree on a 5-point Likert scale. The results show that if the motivation mean score is increased by 0.1 units, the probability of implementation increases by 16.9% in Ghana and by 7.7% in Ethiopia. If the feasibility mean score is increased by 0.1 units, the probability of implementation increases by 24.9% in Ghana and by 11.9% in Ethiopia. We can conclude that motivation and feasibility matter, and we improve our understanding of measure implementation if we include both feasibility and motivation into viability assessments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000490829",,"1381-2386||1573-1596",,"10.1007/s11027-021-09952-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/490829","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Vulnerability||Climate change||Sub-Saharan Africa||Cocoa||Tef","Beyond feasibility—the role of motivation to implement measures to enhance resilience: Evidence from drought-affected smallholder farmers in Ghana and Ethiopia",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-23T03:12:12Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85107925118",,"000661474100001","Mitig. adapt. strategies glob. chang.","5","Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change","26","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As a negative side effect, previous studies, however, have suggested that these subsidies lower the efficiency of the companies and thus decrease their operating profit. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the impact of subsidies on the operating profit of Swiss forestry companies. Based on a regression model, the correlation between the operating profit (dependent variable) and independent variables including subsidies was quantified. The regression model showed that subsidies have a significant, positive impact on the operating profit, but six other factors have a higher impact than subsidies. Two assumptions can explain these results, which stand in contrast to those found in previous studies: firstly, the policy cycle has been repeated several times to enable this positive side effect and secondly, that subsidies are primarily paid for outputs of the value chain of forestry companies. These suggested explanations, however, should be tested further.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000509683",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/509683","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"The impact of subsidies on the operating profit in the Swiss forestry sector",,"Bachelor Thesis","Open access",,,,"2021-10-14T07:46:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Relying on weather-dependent power generation, however, poses substantial risks if climate variability is not adequately understood and accounted for in energy system design. Here we quantify European wind and solar generation variability over the last century, finding that both vary on a multidecadal scale, but wind more strongly. We identify hotspots and study dominant patterns of (co-)variability, finding that solar generation varies mostly uniformly across Europe while the leading wind variability modes reveal cross-border balancing potential. Combined wind and solar power generation in the current European system exhibits multidecadal variability of around 5% and can be further reduced through European cooperation or locally optimized wind shares, albeit the latter comes at the expense of significantly enhancing seasonal to interannual variability. Improved spatial planning therefore offers multiple options to mitigate long-term renewable generation variability but requires careful assessments of the trade-offs between climate-induced variations on different timescales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492844",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/abff89","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492844","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Mitigating a century of European renewable variability with transmission and informed siting",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-03T00:55:55Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Sustainable Energy Transition Laboratory","837089","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,"85108705979",,"000655321300001","Environ.

It involves a mapping of steps towards a desired long-term goal supplemented with continuous reflection on how and why change is expected to happen in a particular context. However, there is limited reported experience with the development and application of ToCs in inter- and transdisciplinary research contexts. While some previous publications have focused on ex-post application, there has been little discussion about the process of developing and using ToCs in strategic planning and monitoring in large inter- and transdisciplinary research programs. This article reports challenges and lessons learned from the experience of developing and using ToCs in the inter- and transdisciplinary research program Wings (Water and sanitation innovations for non-grid solutions). Challenges include (1) managing time constraints, (2) balancing between concrete and abstract discussions, (3) ensuring diversity in group composition, (4) fluctuating between reservations and appreciation, and (5) fulfilling both service and science roles while leading the ToC process. The experience highlights the importance of alternating formal and informal interaction formats throughout the process, ensuring heterogenous group formation, involving early career scientists, being responsive to emergent needs and making the added value of developing and using ToCs explicit and tangible for all participants. Although these lessons are mainly derived from developing ToCs within the interdisciplinary program team, they can support other programs in both their inter- and transdisciplinary research endeavors.","application/pdf",,,"1462-9011||1873-6416",,"10.1016/j.envsci.2021.02.009","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474264","en","Elsevier",,,"Interdisciplinary||Transdisciplinary||Theory of change||Leadership||Urban water management||Research programs","Leading inter- and transdisciplinary research: Lessons from applying theories of change to a strategic research program",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-03-13T04:36:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101826020",,"000652746800004","Environ.

Second, we derive an effective time-dependent decay theory and corresponding generalized quantum regression relations for an open quantum system linearly coupled to an environment. This theory covers all timescales and subsumes the Markovian and linear-response results as limiting cases.

This system is under threat from, amongst others, a range of climate related shocks, including extreme weather events as well as more gradual stressors, such as changing rainfall patterns. The impacts of climate related shocks and stressors to the global food system, such as loss of income and hunger, are unequally distributed between food system actors with smallholder farmers (an incredibly diverse yet globally significant grouping) being particularly vulnerable. Increasingly, many smallholder farmers are embedded in global food value chains (GFVCs), producing crops for export, including fruits, vegetables and non-food commodities. GFVCs are international networks of actors that interact at the various stages (production, processing, distribution, retailing and consumption) of the food system. However, little is understood about how farmers engaged in GFVCs are affected by climate shocks and how the impacts are influenced by their participation in a GFVC. Resilience, the ability of a system to cope with shocks and maintain overall function, has emerged as a potentially useful concept for guiding the governance and management of food systems in the face of these evolving threats. Within the broader field of resilience, climate resilience is emerging as a priority topic in smallholder food production in the Global South. This thesis seeks to understand how climate shocks impact smallholders engaged in GFVCs and elicit ways to enhance the climate resilience of the vulnerable actors in these systems.  I created three linked objectives for this thesis : (i) Co-define, with stakeholders, “climate resilience” of smallholder farmers in GFVCs. (ii) Assess the climate resilience of smallholder farmers and its determinants in GFVCs. (iii) Assess and explore different opportunities to enhance climate resilience of smallholders in GFVCs. To operationalise these objectives, I investigated two smallholder driven GFVCs, that share many characteristics, such as polarisation of actor power and climate hazard exposure, but also have some key ecological and institutional contrasts. These are the Ghanaian - Swiss cocoa value chain and the Dominican Republic - UK banana value chain. Both of these GFVCs face regular and intensifying climate threats, with a severe shock being experienced in both GFVCs between 2015 and 2017. As a result of the El Niño oscillation in 2015 there was a strong drought experienced by cocoa farmers in Ghana during the 2015-16 production season. Contrastingly, banana farmers in the Dominican Republic were exposed to severe flood damage caused by two consecutive  hurricanes, Irma and Maria, in September 2017. These climate shocks are the focus of my thesis.  To deliver on the objectives, I adopted (with many crucial collaborations) a four-phase approach: (i) Value chain stakeholder platform establishment, (ii) Characterising climate risks and co-defining climate resilience, (iii) Resilience assessment of smallholder producers in the context of GFVCs, (iv) Exploration of resilience enhancement opportunities. In each value chain, I utilise an overall transdisciplinary research approach, involving multiple methods including; multi-stakeholder workshops, focus groups, value-chain-actor interviews, household surveys, biophysical on farm assessments and satellite remote sensing. Chapter 2 takes the case of the 2015-16 drought shock, to cocoa production in Ghana, to examine whether sustainability certification, namely Organic, UTZ and Rainforest Alliance, can deliver climate resilience for smallholder farmers. In Chapter 3, I again take the case of cocoa producers but move beyond comparison of certification impacts to address the question: What determines the adoption of climate resilience strategies by smallholder farmers? In Chapter 4, taking the Dominican Republic banana case, I ask: What determines the resilience of smallholder farmers embedded in GFVCs to extreme weather events? I address four specific research questions; (i) How are smallholder farmers impacted by hurricane induced flooding? (ii) What actions or strategies do the actors of this GFVC adopt to enhance their climate resilience? (iii) How quickly did farmers recover? and (iv) What determined recovery rates?  Across the banana and cocoa value chains, I find that for climate resilience strategies to be effective they must be both generalisable across diverse (even unknown) threats, whilst also incorporating specificity versus key hazards. This is challenged by the fact that farmer agency relating to resilience strategy utilisation is scale-limited, exemplified by them having little power to act at a landscape scale. Moreover, resilience enhancing strategies are more than just the sum of their parts and therefore, both synergistic and antagonistic, interactions must be considered in their design and promotion. In particular, in relation to GFVCs, climate resilience strategies are not, by default, benevolent and important inter-actor tradeoffs occur, such as traders switching sourcing locations in the face of a shock. I find multiple determinants of climate resilience strategy adoption, including land tenure, income generating capacity and farm scale. Relatedly, I find access to markets for alternative agricultural products is key to developing climate resilient multifunctional agricultural systems. Additionally, the sub-national regional context strongly moderates climate resilience strategy adoption and extreme-weather-shock outcomes and, therefore, should be accommodated in policy and programme design. In terms of mechanisms to enhance the climate resilience of smallholders in GFVCs, certification has the potential to modify smallholder climate resilience but underperforms on the uptake of complex versus simple measures because of a strong commodity focus. I find that climate specific training enhances climate resilience strategy uptake but targeting is key to avoid smaller scale farmers being left behind. Spatial planning at a landscape scale, such as zoning using flood risk maps, can enhance climate resilience and should be pursued as a powerful resilience enhancing tool. Overall, participating in GFVCs is a “double-edged sword” for smallholders’ climate resilience and, therefore, cooperation must be enhanced, for example via mechanisms to increase basin-scale collaboration and trader loyalty, so as to reduce the tradeoffs involved.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504801",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504801","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","sustainable agriculture||food systems||climate change||resilience","Enhancing smallholder farmer climate resilience in cocoa and banana global food value chains",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-09-08T13:21:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"27595",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A vast range of energy system modelling tools is available, providing modelling practitioners, planners, and decision-makers with multiple alternatives to represent the energy system according to different technical and methodological considerations. To better understand this landscape, here we identify current trends in the field of energy system modelling. First, we survey previous review studies, identifying their distinct focus areas and review methodologies. Second, we gather information about 54 energy system modelling tools directly from model developers and users. Unlike previous questionnaire-based studies solely focusing on technical descriptions, we include application aspects of the modelling tools, such as perceived policy-relevance, user accessibility, and model linkages. We find that, to assess the possible applications and to build a common understanding of the capabilities of these modelling tools, it is necessary to engage in dialogue with developers and users. We identify three main trends of increasing modelling of cross-sectoral synergies, growing focus on open access, and improved temporal detail to deal with planning future scenarios with high levels of variable renewable energy sources. However, key challenges remain in terms of representing high resolution energy demand in all sectors, understanding how tools are coupled together, openness and accessibility, and the level of engagement between tool developers and policy/decision-makers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000475214",,"0306-2619||1872-9118",,"10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116731","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/475214","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Energy system modelling tool||Energy models||Energy system analysis||Survey||Review","Trends in tools and approaches for modelling the energy transition",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-18T04:39:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Sustainable Energy Transition Laboratory","837089","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,"85102263743",,"000639337500007","Appl.

One of those challenges is the integration of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (AHSS). The roles these disciplines perform in inter- and transdisciplinary research and education are often mostly limited to instrumental and subordinate ones. Unequal participation of these disciplines causes their exclusion from scientific communities, also affecting career paths of early and senior researchers. I present some results from the project entitled ""Shaping interdisciplinary practices in Europe"" (SHAPE-ID) that addresses the problem of how to better integrate AHSS disciplines in interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity. I conducted a systematic literature review and identified spaces in which integration is performed and roles that AHSS researchers fruitfully develop in an inter- or transdisciplinary setting. I discuss how to facilitate the participation of AHSS researchers by reconfiguring inter- and transdisciplinary spaces and roles. I conclude that AHSS disciplines' participation in collaborative settings is limited and affects the type of inter- and transdisciplinary knowledge production processes that are driven. This has a direct effect on how senior researchers perceive their academic careers and set the research agenda. But also, on how early career researchers build their academic future.",,,,"1983-2664",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494910","en","Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro Escola de Comunicação",,,"Interdisciplinarity||transdisciplinarity||roles||integration||Arts Humanities and Social Sciences","Reconfiguring interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary spaces for Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences integration","Reconfigurando espaços interdisciplinares e transdisciplinares para a integração das Artes, Humanidades e Ciências Sociais","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-07-15T10:31:14Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000646570700004",,"2","Revista EducaOnline","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, in a number of producing countries, laws exist that mirror and go beyond what private labels demand. These countries have two options for placing their sustainable products in the market: signal their national system's equivalence to private schemes, or utilize the existing regulatory framework as favorable preconditions for widespread certification. In framing this choice as a collective reputation challenge, this study analyzes under which conditions states and parastatal actors opt for either approach, provides evidence of the strategies used, and draws conclusions on their respective success and on-the-ground outcomes. Using an in-depth comparative case study of the coffee sectors of Costa Rica and Colombia, the study finds that the divergence in institutional strategies can be explained by three factors: sector-specific institutional capacities; a country's place in the commodity marketplace, which determines the expected added pay-off of certification; and a country's overall international image.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000470657",,"0301-4797||1095-8630",,"10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112053","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/470657","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Transnational private governance||Sustainability||Global value chains||Marketing||Global south","Signaling Southern sustainability: When do actors use private or public regulatory authority to market tropical commodities?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-20T04:45:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85100589969",,"000632616200006","J. environ. manag.",,"Journal of Environmental Management","285","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Antimicrobials are used routinely in intensive pig production to treat infections and increase productivity. However, the use of antimicrobials also contributes to the rise of antimicrobial resistance with potential consequences for animal and human health. Here, we quantify the association between antimicrobial use and resistance rates in extensive and intensive farms with a focus on geographic proximity between farm and drugstores. Of the 164 enrolled farms, 79% reported using antimicrobials for disease prevention, treatment, or as a feed additive. Antimicrobial-resistant E. coli were present in 63% of farms. These drugs included critically important antimicrobials, such as quinolones and penicillins. Medium-scale farms with intensive animal production practices showed higher resistance rates than small-scale farms with extensive practices. Farms with drug-resistant Escherichia coli were located closer to drugstores and a had a higher proportion of disease than farms without drug-resistant E. coli. We found no association between the presence of resistance in humans and antimicrobial use in pigs. Our findings call for actions to improve herd health to reduce the need for antimicrobials and systematic training of veterinarians and drugstore owners on judicious use of antimicrobials in animals to mitigate resistance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000487126",,"2297-1769",,"10.3389/fvets.2021.659051","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/487126","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Escherichia coli||antimicrobial resistance||antimicrobial use||pig||intensive production","Geographic Drivers of Antimicrobial Use and Resistance in Pigs in Khon Kaen Province, Thailand",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-28T03:33:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Piloting on-site interventions for reducing antimicrobial use in livestock farming in emerging economies","180179","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","ERA-NET + EJP",,,,,"85105919803",,"000649285500001","Front.

Despite the existence of numerous apps covering hazard information, little research has been conducted to assess what the public actually expects from such an app. Perceived usefulness is crucial as the public will only use apps offering an added value to them. Several studies have identified that people prefer an app combining relevant hazards instead of single hazard apps. Therefore, we focused our analysis on multi-hazard apps. With seven virtual interactive workshops, we assessed the public's information needs and app feature preferences. With respect to the content of multi-hazard apps, our results show that participants would mainly combine natural hazards but also have an interest in integrating anthropogenic and socio-natural hazards. To this end, participants advocate sending push notifications for low-probability hazards via general-purpose apps (e.g., weather apps) to reach a larger audience. Despite the desired diversity of hazard information, participants wish for an app focusing on relevant information only and redirecting users to other authorized sources for further information. Participants define the following as relevant information: location, time, hazard severity, behavioral recommendations and the contact details of emergency services. In addition, they wish for the following features: push notifications, a help button, a sharing function, a chat forum, an “I am safe” button, and a “Report an event” button.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000477428",,"2212-4209",,"10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102197","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477428","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","User needs||App content and features||Multi-hazard apps||Virtual interactive workshops","Why should I use a multi-hazard app?

In Switzerland, Construction & Demolition (C&D) waste accounts for the largest portion of waste (84%). Beyond limiting the depletion of primary resources, implementing recycling strategies for C&D waste (such as using recycled aggregates to produce recycled concrete (RC)), can also decrease the amount of landfilled C&D waste. The use of RC still faces adoption barriers. In this research, we examined the factors driving the adoption of recycled products for a CE in the C&D sector by focusing on RC for structural applications. We developed a behavioural framework to understand the determinants of architects’ decisions to recommend RC. We collected and analysed survey data from 727 respondents. The analyses focused on architects’ a priori beliefs about RC, behavioural factors affecting their recommendations of RC, and project-specific contextual factors that might play a role in the recommendation of RC. Our results show that the factors that mainly facilitate the recommendation of RC by architects are: a senior position, a high level of RC knowledge and of the Minergie label, beliefs about the reduced environmental impact of RC, as well as favourable prescriptive social norms expressed by clients and other architects. We emphasise the importance of a holistic theoretical framework in approaching decision-making processes related to the adoption of innovation, and the importance of the agency of each involved actor for a transition towards a circular construction sector.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000481969",,"2071-1050",,"10.3390/su13084113","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/481969","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","circular economy||construction and demolition||survey||recycled concrete","Strategies for a Circular Economy in the Construction and Demolition Sector: Identifying the Factors Affecting the Recommendation of Recycled Concrete",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-03T02:43:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85104685207",,"000645342000001",,"8","Sustainability","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The rescue packages imposed by the COVID-19 crisis make the pursuit of global sustainability goals even more dependent on urgent investment decisions to be taken by the public and private sector. This article examines some of the basic conditions for scaling up sustainable finance, focussing in particular on decision-support tools (DSTs) that guide investment decisions, such as metrics, rankings, ratings and standards. It identifies key DST strengths and weaknesses via a literature review of 100 publications containing expert opinions of sustainable finance scientists and professionals. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of three DSTs that represent the state of the art in their respective typologies: RobecoSAM’s Country Sustainability Rankings, IFC Performance Standards, and ETH’s Impact ÆSSURANCE Sovereign Ratings. The analysis reveals that: (i) experts express a strong, persistent criticism of current sustainability assessment practice, (ii) three main weaknesses characterize most DSTs: credibility deficit, narrow focus, and time-horizon limitations, and (iii) by using an integrated impact assessment framework, superior forecasting capacity and distributed verification techniques assisted by artificial intelligence, the Impact ÆSSURANCE rating model is a promising solution to scale up sustainable finance. © 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000468142",,"2212-0416",,"10.1016/j.ecoser.2020.101240","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468142","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Sustainable finance||Impact assessment||Ecosystem services||ESG||Materiality||Artificial intelligence","Challenges and opportunities to scale up sustainable finance after the COVID-19 crisis: Lessons and promising innovations from science and practice Author links open overlay panel",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-05T20:12:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85100435599",,,,,"Ecosystem Services","48","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While there are calls to store carbon by increasing the forest stock, other actors oppose this, arguing that carbon stored in processed timber is more adequate. Applying an adapted version of the policy network analysis (PNA) framework, we uncover both the actors' policy preferences regarding the goal conflict between carbon storage in the forest versus in timber products as well as the actors' perceived importance and information sharing in the forest policy network in a Swiss region (canton Lucerne) via an online stakeholder survey. We find that an increase of carbon storage in the forest does not stand a chance in the Lucerne forest policy network, being rejected by nearly two-thirds of the actors. A majority views increased harvesting for wood products as a superior climate change mitigation measure than harvesting less for carbon storage. We also find that these proponents of wood are more central actors within the policy networks than those in favour of carbon storage in the forest. These findings are relevant for a context where the majority of the forest is privately owned and where interests in timber harvesting might dominate those on carbon storage. The analysis reflects the challenging situation within the timber market, where measures for increased wood harvesting might provide a more acceptable policy option than carbon sequestration for private forest owners. © 2021 The Author(s)","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000465835",,"1389-9341",,"10.1016/j.forpol.2021.102395","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465835","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Forest policy||Carbon storage||Goal conflict||Social network analysis (SNA)||Switzerland","To log or not to log?

River flooding is responsible for a large part of this displacement. Previous studies have shown that river flood risk is expected to change as a result of global warming and its effects on the hydrological cycle. At the same time, future scenarios of socio-economic development imply substantial population increases in many of the areas that presently experience disaster-induced displacement. Here we show that both global warming and population change are projected to lead to substantial increases in flood-induced displacement risk over the coming decades. We use a global climate-hydrology-inundation modelling chain, including multiple alternative climate and hydrological models, to quantify the effect of global warming on displacement risk assuming either current or projected future population distributions. Keeping population fixed at present levels, we find roughly a 50% increase in global displacement risk for every degree of global warming. Adding projected population changes further exacerbates these increases globally and in most world regions, with the relative global flood displacement risk is increasing by roughly 350% at the end of the 21st century, compared to an increase of 150% without the contribution of population change. While the resolution of the global models is limited, the effect of global warming is robust across greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, climate models and hydrological models. These findings indicate a need for rapid action on both climate mitigation and adaptation agendas in order to reduce future risks to vulnerable populations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000477179",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/abd26c","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477179","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Flooding||Climate change||Displacement||Impact modelling||Risk||Vulnerability","Global warming and population change both heighten future risk of human displacement due to river floods",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-31T13:34:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103452752",,"000632366000001","Environ.

Nonetheless, it is often used as a buzzword without specifying what exactly it means or what actually happens during integration. We propose conceptualizing integration as a multidimensional interactive process. We characterize it as an open-ended learning process without pre-determined outcomes. Integration designates relations established throughout a transdisciplinary research process between elements that were not previously related. Those elements are participants in the process and their thought-styles and thought-collectives and more specifically pieces of knowledge, ideas, or practices from different thought-collectives as well as views of individual researchers and practitioners. Integration can happen at manifold instances of a transdisciplinary research process. It can take place among two, several, or all participants and can be one-sided or mutual. It might include insights, practices, frameworks, or concepts shared by two, several, or all participants. Consensus is only one along with other ways of retaining plurality of thought-styles and seeing integration as a balance between them that remains subject to continuous revision. To analyse or achieve effective integration, further dimensions beyond the cognitive have to be taken into account including at least an emotional and a social-interactional dimension.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000467221",,"1462-9011||1873-6416",,"10.1016/j.envsci.2020.12.005","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/467221","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Integration||Transdisciplinary Research||Learning||Co-Production of Knowledge","Conceptualising transdisciplinary integration as a multidimensional interactive process",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-02T08:13:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099852767",,"000697545500003","Environ.

Limited land availability for onshore wind parks and higher wind speeds over sea make offshore wind energy increasingly attractive. While wind variability on different timescales poses challenges for planning and system integration, little focus has been given to multi-decadal variability. Our research therefore focuses on the characteristics of wind power on timescales exceeding ten years. Based on detrended wind data from the coupled centennial reanalysis CERA-20C, we calculate European long-term offshore wind power potential and analyze its variability focusing on three locations with distinct climatic conditions: the German North Sea, the Greek Mediterranean and the Portuguese Atlantic coast. We find strong indications for two significant multi-decadal modes that are identified consistently using two independent spectral analysis methods and in the 20-year running mean time series. In winter, the long-term evolution of wind power and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are directly linked in Germany and Portugal. While German North Sea wind power is positively correlated with the NAO (r=0.82), Portuguese Atlantic coast generation is anti-correlated with the NAO (r=−0.91). We evaluate the corresponding potential for spatial balancing in Europe and report substantial benefits from European cooperation. In particular, optimized allocations off the Portuguese Atlantic coast and in the German North Sea allow to reduce multi-decadal generation variance by a factor of 3–10 compared with country-level approaches.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000461585",,"1680-7340||1680-7359",,"10.5194/adgeo-54-205-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461585","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Multi-decadal offshore wind power variability can be mitigated through optimized European allocation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-12T09:48:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102115715",,,"Adv. geosci.",,"Advances in Geosciences","54","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Increasingly, modelling efforts focus on improving system resilience, but fail to quantify the improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel workflow that allows increases in resilience to be measured quantitatively. It incorporates out-of-sample testing following optimisation, and compares the impacts of demand and power interruption uncertainty on both risk-unaware and risk-aware district energy system models. To ensure we encompass the full range of impacts caused by uncertainty, we consider nine distinct objectives encompassing differences in: investment and operation costs, CO  emissions, and aversion to risk.  We apply the workflow in a case study in Bangalore, India, and demonstrate that scenario optimisation improves system resilience by one to two orders of magnitude. However, systems designed for resilience to demand uncertainty are not able to gracefully extend to managing risk from extreme shocks to the system, such as power interruptions. We show that shock-induced instability can be addressed by specific measures to reduce grid dependence. Finally, by studying out-of-sample test results, we identify an objective which balances cost, CO emissions, and system resilience; this balance is achieved by novel application of the Conditional Value at Risk measure. These results expose the need for out-of-sample testing whenever uncertainty is considered in energy system modelling, and we provide the framework with which it can be undertaken.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000465054",,"0306-2619||1872-9118",,"10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116465","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/465054","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","District energy systems||Mixed integer linear optimisation||Out-of-sample testing||Resilient systems||Scenario optimisation||Two-stage stochastic programming","Quantifying resilience in energy systems with out-of-sample testing",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-24T03:51:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099471461",,"000649545300042","Appl.

It reflects on the consequences that these considerations have on the potential for participation to become a political space. Public participation has become a standard practice in river management at the European level since the 1990s. In Switzerland, the federal government incentivises public participation in river‐work projects through guidelines and additional subsidies for projects planned in a participatory way, with the goal of avoiding costly conflicts. Based on an analysis of expert discourses, we examine how experts activate three different arguments to depoliticise participation: that participation should be implemented to ensure acceptance of the project; that the exclusion of some actors is justified based on assumptions about the type of knowledge required for participation; and that disagreement should not be expressed within participatory processes but through representative politics. We conclude that the consistent motivation of experts to depoliticise also indicates a potential for participation to become political, which is worth exploring with new  perspectives for engaging the public.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000458220",,"0394-0055",,"10.1111/area.12686","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458220","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Participation||Expertise||Depoliticisation||Postpolitics||river management","When experts feel threatened: Strategies of depoliticisation in participatory river restoration projects",,"Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-22T22:09:20Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85573431",,"85097774933",,"000600247400001",,"1","Area","53","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

With a focus on forest-risk food supply chains, we provide a systematic review of the conservation and livelihood outcomes of the mechanisms that companies use to implement their forest-focused supply chain policies (FSPs)—certifications, codes of conduct, and market exclusion mechanisms. More than half of the 37 cases that rigorously measure the outcomes of FSP implementation mechanisms find additional conservation and livelihood benefits resulting from the policies. Positive livelihood outcomes are more common than conservation additionality and most often pertain to improvements in farm income through increases in crop yields on coffee and cocoa farms that have adopted certifications or codes of conduct. However, in some cases certifications lead to a reduction in net household income as farmers increasingly specialize in the certified commodity and spend more on food purchases. Among the five cases that examine conservation and livelihoods simultaneously, there is no evidence of tradeoffs or synergies—most often an improvement in one type of outcome is associated with no change in the other. Interactions with public conservation and agricultural policies influence the conservation gains achieved by all mechanisms, while the marketing attributes of cooperatives and buying companies play a large role in determining the livelihood outcomes associated with certification. Compliance with the forest requirements of FSP implementation mechanisms is high, but challenges to geospatial monitoring and land use related selection biases limit the overall benefits of these policies. Given the highly variable methods and limited evidence base, additional rigorous research across a greater variety of contexts is urgently needed to better understand if and when FSPs can be successful in achieving synergies between conservation and livelihoods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000475417",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/abe0ed","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/475417","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","private environmental governance||certification||rural development||implementation||enabling factors||zero-deforestation commitments","Have food supply chain policies improved forest conservation and rural livelihoods?

Nowhere is this challenge more prominent than in Brazil, where low productivity and environmentally degrading agricultural activities occupy vast areas. We used the emergy synthesis approach, including innovative indices - emergy footprint and carbon-emergy output intensity - to assess and compare the environmental performance of an integrated crop-livestock system to a continuous crop and a continuous livestock system. Our analysis uses survey and empirical case study data from the 2017/18 crop season in Mato Grosso state, Brazil - the largest grain and beef producer in the country. Economic indicators such as gross revenue, production costs and profitability were calculated to complement the sustainability assessments. The emergy indices indicate that integrated crop-livestock system shows a balanced performance between input use and economic and environmental outcomes. In contrast, due to its heavy dependence on external inputs, the cropping system has poor environmental results, but the highest profitability. By excluding these environmental costs, current accounting of soy-corn production in Brazil dramatically overstates its net benefits to society and overall sustainability. The Emergy Sustainability Index for the integrated system was 0.66 and its Net Profit was USD 235.69 ha-1, while for the continuous crop system the values were 0.47 and USD 295 ha−1, respectively. The livestock system performed poorly in both, economic and environmental outcomes, underscoring the need to transition away from existing extensive systems. Livestock shows the highest positive greenhouse gas emissions, 7.98 E−09 tonCO2eq for each joule produced, and Net Loss of USD 0.58 ha-1. These results provide further support for Brazil’s investment in integrated systems as part of its climate mitigation and sustainable agricultural development plans and warrant consideration in sustainable agriculture initiatives in other countries where cattle production is widespread. © 2020 Elsevier",,,,"0959-6526",,"10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124580","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461865","en","Elsevier",,,"Emergy synthesis||Sustainable agriculture||Amazon||Cerrado||Crop-livestock systems","Integrated crop-livestock systems: A sustainable land-use alternative for food production in the Brazilian Cerrado and Amazon",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-13T06:15:08Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85094118630",,"000609032200002","J Cleaner Prod.",,"Journal of Cleaner Production","283","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the research domain focused on the use of climate science for climate adaptation, such disputes revolve around the what “high-quality” climate knowledge and “good” adaptation is or should be. Emphasizing this diversity of orders of social science and the humanities, this article describes five distinct ways social scientists and humanities scholars have thought and written about climate adaptation: descriptivists aim to empirically portray climate adaptation as objectively as possible from an assumed subject-independent perspective; pragmatists' research wants to increase climate resilience through usable climate information; argumentivists strive for assessing the justification of climate scientific findings, as well as adaptation decision-making that is based on these findings; interpretivists seek to empirically redescribe how the use of climate science for adaptation is shaped by, and shapes, various other social processes and political actors; and critical scholars work toward revealing how pervasive powerful interests and marginalizing discourses shape adaptation projects negatively. By comparing these five orders' respective scientific, environmental and social aims and concerns, this article pinpoints to how epistemological, ontological and methodological priorities not only drive scientific controversies on issues such as what “high-quality knowledge” is, but also how interdependent orders' methodological choices are with their epistemological and ontological positions. However, this analysis also reveals that while some scholars implicitly stick to their order, others are comfortable to collaborate across such borders. Overall, the diverging aims, priorities, and methods are unlikely to be ever fully reconciled. A better understanding of why academics from different orders differ in the approaches they take and the issues they care about will likely lead to a larger appreciation of the differences of other orders' research and broaden our understanding of key dynamics in studying “good” climate adaptation and “high-quality” climate knowledge.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000467237",,"2624-9553",,"10.3389/fclim.2021.589265","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/467237","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Research paradigms||Diversity of social science and the humanities||Social-scientific perspectives on climate science and adaptation||Scientific controversies||Use of climate science for climate adaptation||Climate knowledge","Orders of Social Science: Understanding Social-Scientific Controversies and Confluence on What “High-Quality” Knowledge and “Good” Adaptation Is",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-02T09:33:44Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85121641325",,,"Front.

However, these genetic aspects are widely neglected during both planning and implementation of restoration. Decisions on seed sourcing during implementation of forest landscape restoration (FLR) initiatives often prioritize short-term cost savings over long-term benefits. Such considerations result in strategies that favor rapid and cheap mass production of homogeneous plants and, thus, quantity over quality, with no regard for genetic diversity. This paper explores in detail the economic cost of improved integration of genetic diversity into restoration projects and tests the assumption that the benefits accruing from better integration of diversity exceed the costs. Using a bottom-up cost model, based on peer reviewed scientific literature, we analyse different FLR cost drivers, integrating genetic quality, in relation to the total costs of a range of tree-based restoration interventions, with a focus on seed sourcing, and tree species selection. The results indicate that the integration of genetic diversity into the management and planning of landscape restoration projects increased the costs incurred at the beginning of FLR interventions, specifically during seed sourcing, and species selection. These additional costs were largely due to the increased effort for the collection of genetically diverse and suitably adapted seed lots. However, despite this initial increase in costs the overall costs of restoration decreased substantially, due to cost savings relating to replacement costs of replanting. Even without these savings, the inclusion of genetic diversity is advisable since the costs involved in the integration of diversity are negligible compared to other restoration costs, such as labor costs related to controlling vegetative competition. We conclude that the expected long-term benefits associated with high genetic diversity far outweigh the costs. It also highlights that investing in genetic diversity as part of FLR is the smart thing to do to ensure cost effective and resilient landscape restoration. Restoration policies need to incentivise consideration of genetic diversity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000468950",,"2624-893X",,"10.3389/ffgc.2020.615682","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468950","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","genetic diversity||tree genetic resources||forest landscape restoration||costs of forest landscape restoration||tree seed and seedling supply systems||costs of genetic diversity","Initial Investment in Diversity Is the Efficient Thing to Do for Resilient Forest Landscape Restoration",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-11T03:47:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85106202917",,"000612210300001",,,"Frontiers in Forests and Global Change","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We investigate the near- to mid-term cost, industry, market and policy outlook for the global CSP sector and show that CSP costs have decreased strongly and approach cost-competitiveness with new conventional generation. Industry has been strengthened through the entry of numerous new companies. However, the project pipeline is thin: no project broke ground in 2019 and only four projects are under construction in 2020. The only remaining large support scheme, in China, has been canceled. Without additional support soon creating a new market, the value chain may collapse and recent cost and technological advances may be undone.

We carried out content analysis of consultation documents, expert surveys, online questionnaire and social network analysis. The resulting data were then analysed with Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions associated with large influence. Results suggest that only several actors have a major influence on the policy output. Possessing material or non-material resources is found to be necessary yet not sufficient, as actors need to exhibit high activity and embeddedness in social networks or articulate a discourse rich in various concepts. By elucidating the configuration of endowments critical for actors’ influence on formal institutions, this study yields novel insights into the ingredients of strong agency. The analytical approach we present can be applied to various settings and thus can be pursued for a systematic analysis on the determinants of actors’ influence and how it varies with political or organizational context.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000449018",,"0040-1625",,"10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120413","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/449018","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Agency||Transitions||Qualitative comparative analysis||Social network analysis||Discourse analysis||Endowments","What constitutes agency?

However, the empirical evidence on the effect of agricultural information sent through SMS on varied farm outcomes is divided. Using a randomized control trial study design, the present study focuses on a particular agricultural information viz. agri-met advisories, and a particular channel of dissemination viz. SMS to understand the role of information and the medium of information in compliance with recommended information and improvement in farm outcomes. This paper asks two main questions: i) does provision of agri-met advisory via SMS lead to greater compliance with advisory recommendations by the farmers? and ii) Do farm outcomes such as yield differ for those who received the agri-met advisory via SMS?  The study is based on six districts in Haryana divided across three agro-climatic zones focusing on the wheat crop. The results showed positive and significant impact of SMS agri-met advisories on the farmers’ compliance with advisory for the treatment group—particularly when the advisory was about agricultural cycles and processes with which they are familiar. However, for weather-related advisory, the results did not show a significant impact of SMS-based agri-met advice on the farmers’ compliance, which was unexpected. The likely reasons for such a finding could be many—including unfamiliarity of the farmers with acting on weather advice, which suggests that future research is needed on factors affecting the uptake of SMS-based agri-met advice by farmers in developing country context.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488360",,"2212-0963",,"10.1016/j.crm.2021.100321","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488360","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Agri-met advisories||Phone-based short message applications||Farmers’ response to climate risk","Do phone-based short message services improve the uptake of agri-met advice by farmers?

Socio-economic drivers also increase exposure to natural hazards, accelerate environmental degradation, and require adaptive governance structures to moderate negative impacts. Here, we use a social network analysis (SNA) combined with further qualitative information to identify barriers and enablers of adaptive governance in the Barcelona metropolitan area. By analyzing how climate change adaptation is mainstreamed between different administrative scales as well as different societal actors, we can determine the governance structures and external conditions that hamper or foster strategical adaptation plans from being used as operational adaptation tools. We identify a diverse set of stakeholders acting at different administrative levels (local to national), in public administration, science, civil society, and the tourism economy. The metropolitan administration acts as an important bridging organization by promoting climate change adaptation to different interest groups and by passing knowledge between actors. Nonetheless, national adaptation planning fails to take into account local experiences in coastal protection, which leads to an ineffective science policy interaction and limits adaptive management and learning opportunities. Overcoming this is difficult, however, as the effectiveness of local adaptation strategies in the Barcelona metropolitan area is very limited due to a strong centralization of power at the national level and a lack of polycentricity. Due to the high touristic pressure, the legal framework is currently oriented to primarily meet the demands of recreational use and tourism, prioritizing these aspects in daily management practice. Therefore, touristic and economic activities need to be aligned to adaptation efforts, to convert them from barriers into drivers for adaptation action. Our work strongly suggests that more effectively embedding adaptation planning and action into existing legal structures of coastal management would allow strategic adaptation plans to be an effective operational tool for local coastal governance.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488128",,"1381-2386||1573-1596",,"10.1007/s11027-021-09953-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488128","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Adaptive governance||Coastal hazards||Climate change adaptation||Social network analysis||Stakeholders||Barcelona metropolitan area","Integrating climate change adaptation in coastal governance of the Barcelona metropolitan area",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-03T00:27:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85106259341",,"000652547300001","Mitig. adapt. strategies glob. chang.","4","Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change","26","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Successful large-scale deployment of NETs depends not only on technical, biophysical, ecological, and economic factors, but also on public perception and acceptance. However, previous studies on this topic have been scarce. In 2019, Switzerland adopted a net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 target, which will require the use of NETs. To examine the current Swiss public perception and acceptance of five different NETs, we conducted an online survey with Swiss citizens (N = 693). By using a between-subjects design, we investigated differences in public opinion, perception, and acceptance across three of the most used frames in the scientific literature — technological fix, moral hazard, and climate emergency. Results showed that the public perception and acceptance of NETs does not differ between the frames. The technological fix frame best reflected participants’ opinion, whereas participants perceived the moral hazard frame the least credible and the climate emergency frame the most unclear. Moreover, our findings confirm the public’s unfamiliarity with NETs. We found no strong opposition, as participants indicated a moderate acceptance and a neutral evaluation of all five NETs, with afforestation standing out as the most accepted and positively evaluated NET. We conclude that, in the future, the public debate on NETs should be intensified, and the public perception should be monitored regularly to inform the development of NETs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000503523",,"0165-0009||1573-1480",,"10.1007/s10584-021-03150-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/503523","en","Springer Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Negative emission technologies||Net zero||Negative emissions||Public perception||Carbon dioxide removal||framing experiment","Public perception and acceptance of negative emission technologies – framing effects in Switzerland",,"Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-01T12:34:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"99037107",,"85113577207",,"000690972200001",,,"Climatic Change","167","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, not least in a context sustainability governance, heterophily of actor cooperation is claimed to be beneficial. In contrast to homophily, heterophily represents situations where actors cooperate with those that are different, and thus combine diverse sets of knowledge and competences. Based on the case of Swiss actors involved in the implementation of the SDG 6 on water in countries of the global South, we use social network analysis and qualitative interview data to study how homophily and heterophily influence actors' information exchange. According to quantitative network data, information exchange between actors is indeed influenced by homophily regarding the type of actor and the policy forums actors are participating in. Nevertheless, we also find evidence for heterophily, as actors tend to exchange information with actors with different methodological foci. Furthermore, qualitative interview data show that actors perceive heterophilous network ties as beneficial for SDG implementation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000506597",,,,"10.1016/j.crsust.2021.100049","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/506597","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sustainable development goals||Network governance||Sustainability governance||Homophily||Heterophily||Water","Information exchange networks among actors for the implementation of SDGs",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-23T09:42:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85124426402",,,,,"Current Research in Environmental Sustainability","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The atmospheric conditions prior to and during multi-day hail clusters are described and contrasted to the conditions prior to and during isolated hail days. The analysis focuses on hail days that occurred between April and September 2002–2019 within 140 km of the Swiss radar network. Hail days north and south of the Alps are defined using a minimum area threshold of a radar-based hail product. Multi-day clusters are defined as 5 d windows containing 4 or 5 hail days and isolated hail days as 5 d windows containing a single hail day. The reanalysis ERA-5 is used to study the large-scale flow in combination with objectively identified cold fronts, atmospheric blocking events, and a weather type classification. Both north and south of the Alps, isolated hail days have frequency maxima in May and August–September, whereas clustered hail days occur mostly in July and August. Composites of atmospheric variables indicate a more stationary and meridionally amplified atmospheric flow both north and south of the Alps during multi-day hail clusters. On clustered hail days north of the Alps, blocks are more frequent over the North Sea, and surface fronts are located farther from Switzerland than on isolated hail days. Clustered hail days north of the Alps are also characterized by significantly higher most unstable convective available potential energy (MUCAPE) values, warmer daily maximum surface temperatures, and higher atmospheric moisture content than isolated hail days. Hence, both stationary flow conditions and anomalous amounts of moisture are necessary for multi-day hail clusters on the north side. In contrast, differences in MUCAPE on the south side between clustered hail days and isolated hail days are small. The mean sea level pressure south of the Alps is significantly deeper, the maximum temperature is colder, and local moisture is significantly lower on isolated hail days. Both north and south of the Alps, the upper-level atmospheric flow over the eastern Atlantic is meridionally more amplified 3 d prior to clustered hail days than prior to isolated days. Moreover, blocking occurs prior to more than 10 % of clustered hail days over Scandinavia, but no blocks occur prior to isolated hail days. Half of the clustered hail days south of the Alps are also clustered north of the Alps. On hail days clustering only south of the Alps, fronts are more frequently located on the Alpine ridge, and local low-level winds are stronger. The temporal clustering of hail days is coupled to specific synoptic- and local-scale flow conditions; this information may be exploited for short- to medium-range forecasts of hail in Switzerland.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519705",,"2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-2-1167-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519705","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Multi-day hail clusters and isolated hail days in Switzerland – large-scale flow conditions and precursors",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-09T08:55:01Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Weather Clim.

However, clarifying which livelihood challenges can be attributed to which causal factors remains a challenge. In this paper, we used a case study in Vanuatu to show how local populations attribute subsistence challenges to underlying causes. Particularly, we are interested in whether there is a tendency to view climate change as the primary cause, and if so, why. We followed a participatory approach involving local community members and experts at all stages of the study process. For this, we used complementary research methods such as resource mapping, participant observation, and in-depth interviews with local community members and local agriculture experts. The results show that local populations are indeed inclined to attribute problems to external causes, particularly climate change. However, the results also indicate that this external attribution is not definitive. Rather, we find that over the course of participatory reflection, attribution to climate change was supplemented and even replaced by internal causal factors, such as changes in garden practices. Our findings suggest that the initial emphasis on climate change may be related to prevailing narratives that may have influenced individual perceptions of the study participants and created social desirability. If such bias is not recognized, the narratives risk being reified, with potential new insights being overlooked. As a result, local attribution may overstate or understate specific causes, such as climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000511942",,"0165-0009||1573-1480",,"10.1007/s10584-021-03221-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/511942","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Local knowledge||Local perception||Local attribution||Social desirability bias||livelihood vulnerability","How local communities attribute livelihood vulnerabilities to climate change and other causes: a case study in North Vanuatu",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-27T03:03:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85117499290",,"000707699800001",,"3-4","Climatic Change","168","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we review the empirical knowledge available in academic ex‐post analyses of the effectiveness of existing, comparatively high‐price carbon pricing schemes in the European Union, New Zealand, British Columbia, and the Nordic countries. Some articles find short‐term operational effects, especially fuel switching in existing assets, but no article finds mentionable effects on technological change. Critically, all articles examining the effects on zero‐carbon investment found that existing carbon pricing scheme have had no effect at all. We conclude that the effectiveness of carbon pricing in stimulating innovation and zero‐carbon investment remains a theoretical argument.

We compare these policies and programs with citizen poll data. We find that ideology has a small effect: governments and political parties across the spectrum have similar, and relatively ambitious, decarbonization and renewables targets. This mirrors citizens' strong support for ambitious action regardless of their ideological self-description.

In order to assess tropical cyclone risk, direct economic damage is frequently modeled based on hazard intensity, asset exposure, and vulnerability, the latter represented by impact functions. In this study, we show that assessing tropical cyclone risk on a global level with one single impact function calibrated for the USA – which is a typical approach in many recent studies – is problematic, biasing the simulated damage by as much as a factor of 36 in the north West Pacific. Thus, tropical cyclone risk assessments should always consider regional differences in vulnerability, too. This study proposes a calibrated model to adequately assess tropical cyclone risk in different regions by fitting regional impact functions based on reported damage data. Applying regional calibrated impact functions within the risk modeling framework CLIMADA (CLIMate ADAptation) at a resolution of 10 km worldwide, we find global annual average direct damage caused by tropical cyclones to range from USD 51 up to USD 121 billion (value in 2014, 1980–2017) with the largest uncertainties in the West Pacific basin where the calibration results are the least robust. To better understand the challenges in the West Pacific and to complement the global perspective of this study, we explore uncertainties and limitations entailed in the modeling setup for the case of the Philippines. While using wind as a proxy for tropical cyclone hazard proves to be a valid approach in general, the case of the Philippines reveals limitations of the model and calibration due to the lack of an explicit representation of sub-perils such as storm surges, torrential rainfall, and landslides. The globally consistent methodology and calibrated regional impact functions are available online as a Python package ready for application in practical contexts like physical risk disclosure and providing more credible information for climate adaptation studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000468253",,"1561-8633||1684-9981",,"10.5194/nhess-21-393-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468253","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Regional tropical cyclone impact functions for globally consistent risk assessments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-08T09:40:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85100464730",,"000614290400001","Nat. hazards earth syst. sci.","1","Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Challenges arise both due to increasing damage from natural hazards and the complexity in interaction of different actors in risk management. In Switzerland, the Strategy for Natural Hazards Switzerland, aims to establish efficient protection of the population, natural resources and material goods. This requires that all responsible actors are recognized and aware of their role in risk management. However, previous studies indicate that risk awareness and preparedness levels are rather low within the general population. For the first time, our nationwide survey provides empirical data on factors that influence individual risk preparedness in the general population. Multivariate analysis shows that taking responsibility for natural hazard risk prevention is not only related to personal experience and perceived probability of hazard events, but also crucially influenced by social forms of communication and integration. Therefore, we conclude that social capacity building needs to include such factors in order to render integrated risk management strategies successful.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000451865",,"0921-030X||1573-0840",,"10.1007/s11069-020-04381-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/451865","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Natural hazard risk||Household survey||Risk preparedness||Risk awareness||Risk communication||Switzerland||Risk survey||Social capacity building||Risk management","Social integration matters: factors influencing natural hazard risk preparedness—a survey of Swiss households",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-18T12:37:21Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85094194226",,"000584873900002","Nat. hazards","2","Natural Hazards","105","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we present an approach to model urban temperature using the quantile regression forest algorithm and CWS, open government and remote sensing data. The analysis is based on data from 691 sensors in the city of Zurich (Switzerland) during a heat wave using data from for 25-30th June 2019. We trained the model using hourly data from for 25-29th June (n = 71,837) and evaluate the model using data from June 30th (n = 14,105). Based on the model, spatiotemporal temperature maps of 10 × 10 m resolution were produced. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately map urban heat at high spatial and temporal resolution without additional measurement infrastructure. We furthermore critically discuss and spatially map estimated prediction and extrapolation uncertainty. Our approach is able to inform highly localized urban policy and decision-making.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000457358",,"2212-0955",,"10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100739","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/457358","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Random forest||Urban heat||Low-cost sensors||Crowd-sensing||Machine learning","Mapping urban temperature using crowd-sensing data and machine learning",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-20T03:43:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Combining theory with Big Data?

However, new opportunities have arisen to better assess the risks of winter windstorms in Europe through the availability of historic footprints provided by the Windstorm Information Service (Copernicus WISC). In this study, we compare how modelling of building damages complements claims-based risk assessment. We describe and use two windstorm risk models: an insurer's proprietary model and the open source CLIMADA platform. Both use the historic WISC dataset and a purposefully built, probabilistic hazard event set of winter windstorms across Europe to model building damages in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. These approaches project a considerably lower estimate for the annual average damage (CHF 1.4 million), compared to claims (CHF 2.3 million), which originates mainly from a different assessment of the return period of the most damaging historic event Lothar–Martin. Additionally, the probabilistic modelling approach allows assessment of rare events, such as a 250-year-return-period windstorm causing CHF 75 million in damages, including an evaluation of the uncertainties. Our study emphasizes the importance of complementing a claims-based perspective with a probabilistic risk modelling approach to better understand windstorm risks. The presented open-source model provides a straightforward entry point for small insurance companies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000468147",,"1561-8633||1684-9981",,"10.5194/nhess-21-279-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468147","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Comparing an insurer's perspective on building damages with modelled damages from pan-European winter windstorm event sets: A case study from Zurich, Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-06T03:50:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85100106148",,"000613272700003","Nat. hazards earth syst. sci.","1","Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These, however, are strongly affected by local weather conditions and their future potential might be influenced by climate change. Thus, it is essential for decision-makers in the energy sector to integrate information about climate change in their long-term strategic decisions. These types of decisions are, for instance, required for Switzerland’s upcoming concession renewals, i.e., contracts that regulate how hydropower companies are allowed to use the water owned by local government for power generation over decades. The high-level goal of this thesis is to integrate a specific tool from atmospheric science, so-called weather regimes (WRs), with the strategic decision-making of a stakeholder from Swiss hydropower industry. To this end, we engage directly with a Swiss hydropower company throughout the research process. Together we address three main topics. (1)We develop an understanding of the relationships between Swiss hydropower generation and the large-scale atmospheric flow represented by WRs. (2) Based on both an extensive literature review and our own experience gained in the present project, we propose an engagement framework and practical recommendations on how to implement a transdisciplinary (TD) collaboration with an industry partner. (3)We quantify the role that WRs play for weather parameters in a changing climate, and discuss potential implications of this analysis for the stakeholder’s decision making.   Chapter 2 is dedicated to improving our understanding of how WRs have affected surface weather in Switzerland and Europe and hence Swiss hydropower generation in recent years. We present exploratory analyses investigating (i) whether precipitation in Switzerland is similar in all WRs and at all times in a WR’s life cycle, (ii) how the seven North Atlantic European WRs modulate the spatial pattern of precipitation and wind in Switzerland and Europe, and (iii) whether Swiss hydropower generation systematically increases or decreases during specific WRs. Mean daily precipitation over Switzerland is not strongly linked to weather regime type and duration. However, the spatial distribution of precipitation across Switzerland and Europe exhibits a distinct WR-specific dependency, in particular in the cold season. Finally, we find that the link between Swiss hydropower generation and the active WR is only moderate. Reasons for this moderate link can be numerous other factors that influence Swiss hydropower generation; the large WR domain that captures less of the Switzerland-specific atmospheric flow variability; and the limited dataset used for the presented analyses. Nevertheless, these analyses provide an initial overview of the complexities of how weather and climate influence (future) hydropower generation, provoking new perspectives on how weather matters for Swiss hydropower.   Chapter 3 addresses the following question: How can climate scientists practically implement a transdisciplinary (TD) collaboration with an industry partner to reduce the gap between climate science and decision-making in industry? We propose a novel engagement framework that provides guidance to this question. The framework conceptualizes engagement through scientists and stakeholders overlapping spheres of interests, and it offers the opportunity to explore and widen their overlap as a common space of interests. We present a case study where we apply this framework to our collaboration with the Swiss hydropower company, again using the concept of weather regimes. This case study leads to four practical recommendations for using the proposed engagement framework effectively: (1) Secure an anchor person at management level of the decision-making entity; (2) Be prepared to invest time into triggering and maintaining active engagement by all collaborators; (3) From the start, communicate the open nature of insights and solutions from the engagement process; (4) Be aware that you are working in a field of tension due to a range of motivations, methods, and goals of the individuals involved in the TD collaboration. The engagement framework and the practical recommendations are particularly beneficial for climate scientists who are not yet familiar with TD collaborations.   Chapter 4 aims at improving our understanding of the representation of WRs in climate models and how they are affected by climate change. Using a seven-category all-season WR classification for the North Atlantic and European region as a means to represent important aspects of the variability of the large-scale atmospheric dynamics in this region, we present the first year-round evaluation of WRs in a climate model and associated changes due to climate change. We investigate (i) whether the frequency of occurrence of these regimes observed in reanalysis is captured by historical climate simulations, (ii) whether the frequency of occurrence is affected by climate change, (iii) whether precipitation associated with those WRs is affected by climate change, and (iv) to what degree changes in the frequency of WRs explain the overall climate change signal in precipitation. We use output from historical and end-of-the-century (RCP8.5) Community Earth System Model (CESM) large ensemble simulations to determine the frequency of occurrence of the seven WRs and their associated precipitation patterns in both historical and end-of-the-century climate conditions. As in the re-analysis data from the European Centre for Medium-RangeWeather Forecasts (ECMWF), ERA-Interim, the WRs in CESM explain approximately 80% of the year-round variability in geopotential height at 500 hPa in the considered North Atlantic and European region. Climate change causes an annual increase in the frequency of the Atlantic Trough (AT) and European Blocking (EuBL) regimes, and a decrease of the Greenland Blocking (GL) regime. The contribution of these WR frequency changes to the climate change signal of surface precipitation is however surprisingly small. These findings indicate that climate change imposes subtle changes on the large-scale flow over the North-Atlantic and Europe as revealed by the frequency changes of certain WRs. However, the precipitation patterns associated with the WRs are relatively similar and also affected by climate change in a similar fashion. Together, this implies that precipitation in Europe most likely changes in the future due to an overall warming (all WRs get wetter) and due to subtle changes in the WR frequencies, but not due to strongly altered precipitation dynamics in a given large-scale flow configuration nor due to a substantial increase or decrease in occurrence of a specific WR.   The TD engagement and WR analyses provide valuable insight for decision-makers and scientists alike. Active engagement with the Swiss hydropower company guided methodological choices and research questions while providing direct feedback and triggering reflection on scientific results. This in-depth TD engagement process allowed hydropower decision-makers to benefit from complex scientific expertise they would otherwise not have had access to. Additionally, it highlighted that in the long-term consideration around hydropower generation, climate change is one of the most projectable elements. Thus, decision-makers were encouraged to consider how much could be gained by integrating climate knowledge into their long-term strategic decisions. Future work is encouraged to investigate the role of atmospheric flow dynamics for the energy sector, with more renewable energy sources (solar, wind, and hydropower), integrating multiple energy stakeholders across multiple countries (including state-owned and private firms), and employing alternative statistical analyses and machine learning to analyze additional data that arises from the aforementioned suggestion of increasing included energy sources and stakeholders.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000497310",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/497310","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","climate change||weather regimes||decision making||Research-practice collaboration||transdiscipfinarity||hydropower||stakeholder engagement||CESM-LME","Assessing the potential to strengthen the resilience of the Swiss hydropower sector based on understanding the role of weather regimes in a changing climate",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-07-23T08:43:41Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"27765",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Insured losses from the events Daria 1990, Lothar 1999, and Kyrill 2007 amount to 8.6 billion, 8.4 billion, and 7.1 billion USD respectively. In Switzerland, the most recent severe event Burglind/Eleanor caused 165 million CHF in building damages additional to other socio-economic impacts like forest damage and disruption in traffic and power supply. Societal decisions for the management of winter windstorm risk require information about those impacts to be able to reduce them or handle them sustainably and efficiently. This thesis documents the development and prototyping of decision-support tools for different questions of risk management. The tools are implemented in the CLIMADA framework, an open-source risk-modelling platform in the programming language python. It models risk as a combination of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Meteorological and climatological research has culminated in hazard datasets describing the intensity, spatial distribution, and likelihood of storm events. This thesis implements, calibrates and evaluates risk information derived from the combination of these hazard datasets with exposure and vulnerability. The exposure describes the assets or value at risk: a spatial description of infrastructure, natural resources, population, or vulnerable groups. The vulnerability defines how the proportional impact to exposure, such as a damage degree, is linked to the hazard intensity. One tool describes the risk assessment of building damages from winter windstorms and is applied to the building insurance industry. The second tool forecasts building damages based on weather forecasts. It firstly supports decision-making for preventive actions in the building insurance industry, and secondly can be used in the context of incorporating impacts into weather warnings by national meteorological services. In chapter 1, the scientific context of the tools is introduced regarding winter windstorms, impact data, risk modelling, risk assessment and decision-making.  In chapter 2, the socio-economic impacts of winter windstorms are illustrated by the example of a recent event. The impacts of the winter windstorm Burglind/Eleanor (3 January 2018) in Switzerland are collected from different government agencies and other organizations. The event is responsible for the largest infrastructure and forest damage from a winter storm in Switzerland since Lothar 1999. Burglind/Eleanor caused building damages of around 165 million CHF. There were also disruptions to road- and rail-traffic and in power supply. In Swiss forests, around 1.3 million cubic metres of wood were felled. Chapter 3 reviews two newly published hazard datasets of winter storms, one containing high-resolution gust speed intensities of more than 140 historical storms, and the other a synthetic event set with more than 7’660 events generated in climate model runs. A comparison with previously used datasets in industry and academia reveals that the historical dataset represents similar storm severity characteristics to the other datasets. Its high spatial resolution, the long historical time period covered, and its open-access and free availability recommend this dataset for use in risk assessments in industry and research. The synthetic event set shows different storm severity characteristics from industry and academic datasets as well as from the historical dataset, as especially the spatial extends of the events were smaller. The use of this particular synthetic event set in risk assessments is cautioned. In chapter 4, the first decision-support tool, i.e., risk-assessments for building damages, is presented in an applied context. The open-access historical event set from chapter 3 and a purpose-built probabilistic event set are used in a risk assessment for the insurance industry in a collaboration with the cantonal building insurance of the canton of Zurich GVZ. Insurance companies, with access to their claims data, have been in a good position to assess their risk from winter windstorms. The risk assessments based on claims data are compared with risk assessments from modelled building damages from the GVZ proprietary impact model and the open-source impact model within the CLIMADA platform. Insurance companies can benefit from complementing their claims-based risk assessments using the newly available events sets, especially concerning rare events. In a special focus, the uncertainties of the different approaches are discussed and illustrated.  Chapter 5 presents the second decision-support tool, a newly developed impact forecasting system for building damages from winter windstorms in Switzerland. Since societal decisions on preventive actions are best supported with estimations of expected impacts of the weather events, national meteorological services aim to incorporate impacts into their warnings. This system’s forecasted impacts support decision-making for specific users, e.g. the building insurance sector who need to pre-allocate additional resources for claims adjustments and claims handling. In a comparison with claims, the impact forecasts of building damages from winter windstorms are promising, but for other wind phenomena like thunderstorms and foehn storms they do not work as reliably. This is followed by a synthesis of the thesis and the four main chapters. The uncertainties in impact modelling for risk assessment and impact forecasts are discussed. In future endeavors, the uncertainties in exposure and vulnerability could be explicitly represented in an ensemble of opportunity of different model implementations. This would allow a comparison of the uncertainty of the hazard, exposure and vulnerability components, and a discussion of second order uncertainty. The role of exposure in impact warnings is highlighted: it provides the metric and spatial pattern of impact forecasts which are straightforward and relatable information. Suggestions for future topics and implications in research and applications are provided in an outlook. This thesis demonstrates how the decision-support tools within the CLIMADA framework in combination with climatological datasets, as well as open-access weather forecasts, can provide actionable risk assessments and impact warnings. The free, open-source methods lend their support for the suggested future developments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522493",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522493","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","impact-based warning||impact forecast||impact modeling||natural hazard||Winter storms","The impact of winter storms in Switzerland – prototyping decision-support tools",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2021-12-30T15:31:50Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"27670",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A climate storyline is an event-based approach which aims at building “physically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways”. As such, climate storylines may profit from downward counterfactual thinking, which aims at analyzing how past events could have been worse. Notwithstanding the various applications of downward counterfactual thinking in the natural risk management literature, no study relates this with the climate storyline approach. The main goal of this paper is thus to introduce a framework that supports the development of climate storylines from downward counterfactuals. The framework is event-oriented, it focuses on impact, and it is designed to be applied in a participatory fashion. As a proof-of-concept application, we study the impact of tropical cyclone events on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) and do not conduct a participatory analysis. These events represent a serious threat to the European outermost regions, and their impact to the EUSF capital availability has never been studied. We find that payouts due to tropical cyclones can hamper a recovery of the fund if large payouts concurrently occur in mainland Europe. To avoid this also considering future changes, an increase in capitalization up to 90 % percent may be required.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000501366",,"2212-0963",,"10.1016/j.crm.2021.100349","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/501366","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate storylines||Downward counterfactuals||European Union Solidarity Fund","A framework for building climate storylines based on downward counterfactuals: The case of the European Union Solidarity fund",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-19T02:43:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,"REmote Climate Effects and their Impact on European sustainability, Policy and Trade","820712","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,"85112315491",,"000689617300003",,,"Climate Risk Management","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Adaptation is ultimately local, yet similar challenges pose themselves to decision-makers all across the globe and on all levels. The Economics of Climate Adaptation (ECA) methodology has established an economic framework to fully integrate risk and reward perspectives of different stakeholders, underpinned by the CLIMADA (CLIMateADAptation) impact modeling platform. We present an extension of the latter to appraise adaption options in a consistent fashion in order to provide decision-makers from the local to the global level with the necessary facts to identify the most effective instruments to meet the adaptation challenge. We apply the open-source Python implementation to a tropical cyclone impact case study in the Caribbean, using openly available data. This allows us to prioritize a small basket of adaptation options, namely green and gray infrastructure options as well as behavioral measures and risk transfer, and permits inter-island comparisons. In Anguilla, for example, mangroves avert simulated damages more than 4 times the cost estimated for mangrove restoration, whereas the enforcement of building codes is shown to be effective in the Turks and Caicos Islands in a moderate-climate-change scenario. For all islands, cost-effective measures reduce the cost of risk transfer, which covers the damage of high-impact events that cannot be cost-effectively prevented by other measures. This extended version of the CLIMADA platform has been designed to enable risk assessment and options appraisal in a modular form and occasionally bespoke fashion yet with the high reusability of common functionalities to foster the usage of the platform in interdisciplinary studies and international collaboration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000468148",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-14-351-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/468148","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"CLIMADA v1.4.1: Towards a globally consistent adaptation options appraisal tool",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-06T03:50:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85100102973",,"000613183700003","Geosci. model dev.","1","Geoscientific Model Development","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Hundreds of millions of poor rural households, who live in remote and difficult-to-reach areas, are still without access to energy. Solar energy safety nets, in the form of targeted social assistance programs and off-grid technological solutions, do not only advance energy access but also develop capacities of households to prepare for, respond to, and recover from specific threats like pandemics. We discuss ongoing solar energy safety net programs in the largest off-grid solar markets of Bangladesh, India, Kenya, and Nigeria, and how such programs are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that solar energy safety net programs should be maintained and updated to emphasize their potential for building pandemic-resilient livelihoods. These programs can be supported with efforts to build local value chains and economies based on clean electricity.

To monitor disease development over time with respect to critically ill COVID-19 patients, we report near real-time prospective observational data from the RISC-19-ICU registry that indicate changed characteristics of critically ill patients admitted to Swiss intensive care units (ICUs) at the onset of a third pandemic wave.  METHODS 1829 of 3344 critically ill COVID-19 patients enrolled in the international RISC-19-ICU registry as of 31 May 2021 were treated in Switzerland and were included in the present study. Of these, 1690 patients were admitted to the ICU before 1 February 2021 and were compared with 139 patients admitted during the emerging third pandemic wave  RESULTS Third wave patients were a mean of 5.2 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.2–7.1) younger (median 66.0 years, interquartile range [IQR] 57.0–73.0 vs 62.0 years, IQR 54.5–68.0; p <0.0001) and had a higher body mass index than patients admitted in the previous pandemic period. They presented with lower SAPS II and APACHE II scores, less need for circulatory support and lower white blood cell counts at ICU admission. P/F ratio was similar, but a 14% increase in ventilatory ratio was observed over time (p = 0.03)  CONCLUSION Near real-time registry data show that the latest COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs in Switzerland at the onset of the third wave were on average 5 years younger, had a higher body mass index, and presented with lower physiological risk scores but a trend towards more severe lung failure. These differences may primarily be related to the ongoing nationwide vaccination campaign, but the possibility that changes in virus-host interactions may be a co-factor in the age shift and change in disease characteristics is cause for concern, and should be taken into account in the public health and vaccination strategy during the ongoing pandemic.

Changing, often intensifying, weather and climate extremes can increasingly be attributed to anthropogenic climate change, and change is projected to accelerate throughout the 21st century. Against this backdrop, risk awareness is growing across sectors and so is the demand for research and tools supporting efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its adverse consequences. Over the past decades, more and more global-scale climate impact data and models have become available, including archives of reported disaster impacts, storm track datasets, and global gridded crop models simulating yield responses to climate variables. The risk modeling platform CLIMate ADAptation (CLIMADA), implemented in the programming language Python, provides a modular open-source and -access platform for the probabilistic, event-based assessment of climate-related impact and risk. The underlying conceptual framework describes risk as a function of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Hazard is represented by the intensity and frequency of weather and climate events. Exposures constitute the presence of people, ecosystems, or assets that can be affected by a hazard. Vulnerability, implemented in CLIMADA in the form of ‘impact functions’, relates hazard intensity to the degrees of damage experienced by the respective type of exposure. CLIMADA is a growing modeling platform, and the three studies in this thesis aim to bring it to global consistency. The studies constituting this thesis were conducted within a joint research and development project with an implementing partner in the financial sector applying the results directly for forward-looking asset valuation. The main objective of this collaboration was to develop, evaluate, and implement climate risk modeling configurations with a global scope for the assessment of physical climate impacts and related economic risk. The implementing partner has not only integrated the model components as developed in the present thesis, engagement with academia also helped him to design and implement a more consistent risk assessment framework well beyond the scope if this collaboration. In Chapter One of this thesis, both the applied and scientific context of the project are introduced, providing insight in the conceptual framework and its application.  Chapter Two enables the spatially explicit modeling of direct impacts to economic assets by providing a globally consistent asset value exposure layer. The method proposed and implemented makes use of the spatial correlation of economic activity and asset values in a country with both nightlight intensity and population density. The so-called LitPop (‘[night] Li[gh]t Population’) method combines satellite-based nightlight data and population data to disaggregate country-level asset value estimates to a sub-national high-resolution grid. The disaggregation skill is evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, comparing varying weights for nightlight intensity and population count. A global gridded data set of disaggregated asset values in US dollars for the year 2014 is provided alongside the paper at a resolution of 30 arcsec (approx. 1 km globally).  In Chapter Three, LitPop exposure data is combined with a hazard set based on track data of hundreds of historical tropical cyclones (TCs) that made landfall in 53 countries between 1980 and 2017. The objective of the study is the calibration of the vulnerability component for TC risk modeling. For this purpose, wind speed footprints are modeled for each TC event. This allows the fitting of regional impact functions by comparing simulated with reported damage values for 473 reported events matched to individual TC tracks. Chapter Three is concluded with an explorative case study of TC damage in the Philippines, where the calibration comes with a large spread in fitted impact function parameters.  With Chapter Four, attention is shifted from TC impacts to a sectoral risk perspective, for a global, country-level assessment of historical and twenty-first century risk to crop production. This study is based on global gridded crop yield simulations for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat. It uses an unprecedented ensemble of transient yield simulation output from eight global gridded crop models driven by bias-corrected output from five global climate models, as facilitated by the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP). Applying two complementary risk metrics, crop yield simulations are used to calculate the annual probability of projected crop production falling short of a given threshold, by country. Country-specific 21st century crop production risk is assessed by comparing these probabilities for historical and future levels of global warming, considering model agreement as a measure of robustness.  The three main chapters are followed by a summary of key findings: quantitative estimates of exposure value distribution, TC vulnerability, and crop production risk per country. This is followed by discussions of the cascading uncertainties intrinsic to complex risk modeling chains, and practical implications of the thesis within the context of the joint research and development project as well as beyond. To make the resulting data and tools available for research and application – also beyond the scope of this project – the work in this thesis pays special attention to using scientific data and tools licensed for both academic and commercial use. At the same time, methods developed here are published open-source and -access, both as part of the CLIMADA repository and as peer-reviewed research papers. As for an outlook, future research is proposed with the potential to mitigate some of the entailed uncertainties, expand TC risk modeling from historical to future risk, and build on the findings presented here, further integrating output from climate and impact models in the probabilistic risk modeling framework of CLIMADA for globally consistent multi-hazard climate risk modeling.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000489485",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/489485","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","climate risk||Impact modeling||Crop production||Tropical cyclones||Asset exposure data||Impact functions||Model calibration||Risk assessment models||Climate change impacts","Globally Consistent Assessment of Climate-related Physical Risk",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::3 - Social sciences::333.7 - Natural resources, energy and environment||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2021-06-14T14:09:10Z","2022-06-15",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"27518",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, the effectiveness of these commitments is difficult to evaluate. Deforestation is a global phenomenon mediated by market forces; efforts to reduce deforestation in one region may be offset by the displacement (leakage) of agricultural production to other regions. The leakage of production from regions with zero-deforestation (ZD) commitments to other places with less stringent environmental regulations is a major threat to supply-chain ZD commitments. This paper explores the role of leakage in offsetting the potential benefits of ZD commitments implemented in Brazil’s soybean supply changes. Existing assessments of zero-deforestation commitments include some measure of localized within- or cross-biome leakage in their analysis, but to best of our knowledge, the cross-border leakage associated with Brazil soybean supply-chain ZD commitments remains unexplored. In this paper we fill this gap by considering the extent to which the potential deforestation benefits of soybean ZD commitments in Brazil can be offset by displacing production elsewhere in the world, either within or outside Brazil. We pay special attention to Bolivia, Argentina, and Paraguay (the BAP region). A main finding is that due to the overlapping spatial footprint of the traders serving both the EU and China’s market, EU supply-side restrictions are as effective as if these were enforced by China. We also explore an scenario in which the EU applies a unilateral import tariff on all the soybeans sourced from Brazil. Demand-based boycotts and import bans into the EU are increasingly discussed as potential instruments to exert pressure on Brazil’s soybean supply chain. We contrast the land use outcomes of ZD supply-side commitment with the effects of the EU imposing demand-side import tariffs (of 25%, 50% and 75%) on soybeans originated in Brazil.",,,,"2160-2115",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/526198","en","Center for Global Trade Analysis",,,,"Lack of Ambition, Not Leakage, is What Can Make Brazil’s Soybean Supply-Chain Zero Deforestation Commitments Ineffective",,"Conference Paper","Metadata only",,,,"2022-01-17T11:27:48Z",,,,"yes","24th Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis (GTAP 2021)","June 23-25, 2022","Online",,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/res_display.asp?RecordID=6317",,,,"Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis","2021","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, studies that explicitly address the causative role of culture in land systems have been fairly limited relative to those examining other structural dimensions (e.g. markets, policies, climate). In this paper, we aim to start a discussion on how to better include culture in LSS. Through four examples, we show how aspects of culture influence land systems in myriad ways. Building on existing causal land system models, we propose a conceptual framework for the role of culture in land use and summarize promising methodological innovations for exploring it further. We conclude with some thoughts on how the study of culture and its integration through reflexive, locally grounded approaches, while challenging, provides new opportunities for the development of LSS.",,,,"1747-4248||1747-423X",,"10.1080/1747423X.2021.1950229","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500558","en","Taylor & Francis",,,"land-use change||values||attitudes||rational actor||behavioral science","The role of culture in land system science",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-08-12T03:11:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"85111701201",,"000678374000001",,"4","Journal of Land Use Science","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
