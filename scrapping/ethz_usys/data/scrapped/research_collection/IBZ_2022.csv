Primary Sequoia forests are now restricted to < 5 % of their former distribution, and mature secondary forests with trees over 60 m tall are even scarcer due to repeated logging. Leveraging allometric equations recently derived from intensive work in both forest types, we climbed, measured, and core-sampled 235 trees in 45 locations distributed across the species range to examine growth trends and understand how tall Sequoia are responding to recent environmental changes. Paired samples of sapwood and heartwood collected along the height gradient were used to quantify Sequoia investment in decay resistance. During the 20th century, trees in most locations began producing more wood than expected for their size with this growth surge becoming pronounced after 1970 and ending around 2000. Radial increments—ring widths—correlate with climatic variables related to water availability, and these relationships are strengthening as temperatures rise. Sensitivity to drought increased from north to south along a 6° latitudinal gradient of decreasing precipitation and summer fog frequency. Sequoia trees north of 40° were least sensitive to drought, producing similar biomass annually during dry and wet years, whereas trees farther south produced less biomass during individual drought years. Hotter 21st century drought barely affected Sequoia growth efficiency (biomass increment per unit leaf mass) north of 40° until the fourth consecutive year (2015), when growth efficiency dropped precipitously, recovering within two years. South of 40°, Sequoia trees exhibited steadily declining growth efficiency during the multi-year drought followed by recovery, but recovery did not occur south of 37° despite ample precipitation in 2017. Sequoia growth efficiency is currently highest in secondary forests north of 40°, where trees produce relatively small amounts of heartwood with the lowest decay resistance (least fungicide) while receiving the most nocturnal summer fog. Increasing sink limitations, whereby rising temperatures, drier air at night, and extreme tree height collectively lower turgor pressure to inhibit cambial activity, may reduce Sequoia growth efficiency while contributing to more durable biomass production. Heartwood and fungicide increments are higher in primary than secondary forests across the species range. Crown structural complexity promotes development of vascular epiphytes and arboreal soil habitats in Sequoia forests with sufficient moisture availability. These habitats are lacking in secondary forests and rare in primary forests south of 40°. After logging, restoration of tall Sequoia forests can be achieved via silviculture that maximizes height increments during early stand development and then retains some dominant trees in perpetuity, allowing them to gain full stature, produce increasingly decay-resistant heartwood, and support significant arboreal biodiversity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000578207",,"0378-1127||1872-7042",,"10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120573","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/578207","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Redwood||Growth efficiency||Hotter drought||Heartwood||Carbon sequestration||Biodiversity","Rangewide climatic sensitivities and non-timber values of tall Sequoia sempervirens forests",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-10-28T03:21:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85140143403",,"000887251500001","For.

Genotype-by-genotype interactions may constrain the ranges of cooperators upon which particular defectors can cheat, limiting cheater spread. Upon starvation, the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus cooperatively develops into spore-bearing fruiting bodies, using a complex regulatory network and several intercellular signals. Some strains (cheaters) are unable to sporulate effectively in pure culture due to mutations that reduce signal production but can exploit and outcompete cooperators within mixed groups. RESULTS: In this study, interactions between a cheater disrupted at the signaling gene csgA and allopatrically diversified cooperators reveal a very small cheating range. Expectedly, the cheater failed to cheat on all natural-isolate cooperators owing to non-cheater-specific antagonisms. Surprisingly, some lab-evolved cooperators had already exited the csgA mutant's cheating range after accumulating fewer than 20 mutations and without experiencing cheating during evolution. Cooperators might also diversify in the potential for a mutation to reduce expression of a cooperative trait or generate a cheating phenotype. A new csgA mutation constructed in several highly diverged cooperators generated diverse sporulation phenotypes, ranging from a complete defect to no defect, indicating that genetic backgrounds can limit the set of genomes in which a mutation creates a defector. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that natural populations may feature geographic mosaics of cooperators that have diversified in their susceptibility to particular cheaters, limiting defectors' cheating ranges and preventing them from spreading. This diversification may also lead to variation in the phenotypes generated by any given cooperation-gene mutation, further decreasing the chance of a cheater emerging which threatens the persistence of cooperation in the system.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000588754",,,,"10.1186/s12862-022-02094-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588754","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Cheating||Cooperation||Social evolution||Allopatric divergence||Myxococcus xanthus","Allopatric divergence of cooperators confers cheating resistance and limits effects of a defector mutation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-12-22T05:21:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Experimental evolution of motile social bacteria||Mechanisms and indirect effects of adaptation by actively motile populations of Myxococcus xanthus","160005||182830","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Exzellenzbeitrag in Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85143993208",,"000897361500001",,"1","BMC Ecology and Evolution","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The pan-immunity model suggests that such diversity is maintained because the effective immune system of a bacterial species is the one distributed across all strains present in the community. However, only few studies have analyzed the distribution of bacterial defense systems at the community-level, mostly focusing on CRISPR and comparing samples from complex environments. Here, we studied 2778 bacterial genomes and 188 metagenomes from cheese-associated communities, which are dominated by a few bacterial taxa and occur in relatively stable environments.  Results We corroborate previous laboratory findings that in cheese-associated communities nearly identical strains contain diverse and highly variable arsenals of innate and adaptive (i.e., CRISPR-Cas) immunity systems suggesting rapid turnover. CRISPR spacer abundance correlated with the abundance of matching target sequences across the metagenomes providing evidence that the identified defense repertoires are functional and under selection. While these characteristics align with the pan-immunity model, the detected CRISPR spacers only covered a subset of the phages previously identified in cheese, providing evidence that CRISPR does not enable complete immunity against all phages, and that the innate immune mechanisms may have complementary roles.  Conclusions Our findings show that the evolution of bacterial defense mechanisms is a highly dynamic process and highlight that experimentally tractable, low complexity communities such as those found in cheese, can help to understand ecological and molecular processes underlying phage-defense system relationships. These findings can have implications for the design of robust synthetic communities used in biotechnology and the food industry.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000568693",,"2049-2618",,"10.1186/s40168-022-01328-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/568693","en","BioMed Central","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bacteriophage-host interaction||Microbial ecology||Evolutionary dynamics||Shotgun metagenomics","Extensive diversity and rapid turnover of phage defense repertoires in cheese-associated bacterial communities",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-09-04T05:24:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85137075482",,"000845030900001",,"1","Microbiome","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Invaders often face competition by resident microbes. But how invasions play out in communities dominated by facilitative interactions is less clear. We previously showed that growth medium toxicity can promote facilitation between four bacterial species, as species that cannot grow alone rely on others to survive. Following the same logic, here we allowed other bacterial species to invade the four-species community and found that invaders could more easily colonize a toxic medium when the community was present. In a more benign environment instead, invasive species that could survive alone colonized more successfully when the residents were absent. Next, we asked whether early colonists could exclude future ones through a priority effect, by inoculating the invaders into the resident community only after its members had co-evolved for 44 weeks. Compared to the ancestral community, the co-evolved resident community was more competitive toward invaders and less affected by them. Our experiments show how communities may assemble by facilitating one another in harsh, sterile environments, but that arriving after community members have co-evolved can limit invasion success.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000572437",,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-022-01314-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572437","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Microbial ecology","Microbial invasion of a toxic medium is facilitated by a resident community but inhibited as the community co-evolves",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-09-23T03:03:41Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Novel`interactions and species’ responses to climate change","678841","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85138288386",,"000854686200001","ISME J","12","The ISME Journal","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We review the knowledge obtained from the integrative taxonomy of 26 cereal aphid primary parasitoid species, including two allochthonous species (Lysiphlebus testaceipes and Trioxys sunnysidensis) and two recently described species (Lipolexis labialis and Paralipsis brachycaudi).

We also compile knowledge on the presence of secondary endosymbionts in cereal aphids, as these are expected to influence the community composition and biocontrol efficiency of cereal aphid parasitoids. To study aphid–parasitoid–hyperparasitoid food webs more effectively, we present two kinds of DNA-based approach: (i) diagnostic PCR (mainly multiplex PCR), and (ii) DNA sequence-based methods. Finally, we also review the effects of landscape complexity on the different trophic levels in the food webs of cereal aphids and their associated parasitoids, as well as the impacts of agricultural practices and environmental variation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000587507",,"2075-4450",,"10.3390/insects13121142","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587507","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","integrated taxonomy||secondary endosymbionts||landscape complexity||trophic levels||hymenopteran parasitoids","Cereal Aphid Parasitoids in Europe (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae): Taxonomy, Biodiversity, and Ecology",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-12-15T15:15:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85144638804",,"000902533900001",,"12","Insects","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We hypothesized that the chlorotic yellow halos frequently observed around necrotic lesions caused by the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici could result from the activity of necrotrophic effectors interacting with the products of toxin sensitivity genes. As an initial step toward testing this hypothesis, we developed an automated image analysis (AIA) workflow that could quantify the degree of yellow halo formation occurring in wheat leaves naturally infected by a highly diverse pathogen population under field conditions. This AIA based on statistical learning was applied to more than 10,000 naturally infected leaves collected from 335 wheat cultivars grown in a replicated field experiment. We estimated a high heritability (h2 = 0.71) for the degree of yellow halo formation, suggesting that this quantitative trait has a significant genetic component. Using genome-wide association mapping, we identified six chromosome segments significantly associated with the yellow halo phenotype. Most of these segments contained candidate genes associated with targets of necrotrophic effectors in other necrotrophic pathogens.

We hypothesized that the ability of a germline genotype to express a novel phenotype via nonheritable somatic mutations can be selectively advantageous and that this advantage will channel evolving populations toward germline genotypes that constitutively express the phenotype. We tested this hypothesis by simulating evolving populations of developing organisms with an impermeable germline-soma separation navigating a minimal fitness landscape. The simulations revealed the conditions under which nonheritable somatic mutations promote adaptation. Specifically, this can occur when the somatic mutation supply is high, when few cells with the advantageous somatic mutation are required to increase organismal fitness, and when the somatic mutation also confers a selective advantage at the cellular level. We therefore provide proof of principle that nonheritable somatic mutations can promote adaptive evolution via a process we call ""somatic genotypic exploration."" We discuss the biological plausibility of this phenomenon as well as its evolutionary implications.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000579348",,"0003-0147||1537-5323",,"10.1086/721766","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/579348","en","University of Chicago Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","somatic mutations||Weissman||evolutionary theory||development||adaptive landscape||multilevel selection","The Adaptive Potential of Nonheritable Somatic Mutations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-11-04T06:46:37Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Regulatory logic and the evolution of promoter complexity","170604","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,"85142244578",,"000873937100001","Amer Natur","6","The American Naturalist","200","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The drivers of AMR evolution have been studied extensively in vitro but the evolution of plasmid-mediated AMR in vivo remains poorly explored. Here, we tracked the evolution of the clinically relevant plasmid pOXA-48, which confers resistance to the last-resort antibiotics carbapenems, in a large collection of enterobacterial clones isolated from the gut of hospitalized patients. Combining genomic and experimental approaches, we first characterized plasmid diversity and the genotypic and phenotypic effects of multiple plasmid mutations on a common genetic background. Second, using cutting-edge genomic editing in wild-type multidrug-resistant enterobacteria, we dissected three cases of within-patient plasmid-mediated AMR evolution. Our results revealed compensatory evolution of plasmid-associated fitness cost and the evolution of enhanced plasmid-mediated AMR in bacteria evolving in the gut of hospitalized patients. Crucially, we observed that the evolution of pOXA-48-mediated AMR in vivo involves a pivotal trade-off between resistance levels and bacterial fitness.

How tree growth is influenced by the changes in daily to monthly temperatures and its associations with droughts has been extensively investigated, however, few studies have focused on how changes in sub-daily temperatures i.e., DTR, influence tree growth during drought events. Here, we used a network of Larix principis-rupprechtii tree-ring data from 1989 to 2018, covering most of the distribution of planted larch across North China, to investigate how DTR, cloud cover and their interactions influence the relationship between drought stress and tree growth. DTR showed a negative correlation with larch growth in 95 % of sites (rmean = −0.30, significant in 42 % of sites). Cloud cover was positively correlated with growth in 87 % of sites (rmean = 0.13, significant in 5 % of sites). Enhanced tree growth was found at lower DTR in the absence of severe drought. Our findings highlight that in the absence of severe droughts, reduced DTR benefits tree growth, while increased cloud cover tended to benefit tree growth only during severe drought periods. Given how DTR influences drought impacts on tree growth, net tree growth was found to be larger in regions with smaller DTR.",,,,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157808","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566912","en","Elsevier",,,"Diurnal temperature ranges||Cloud cover||Tree growth||Plantation||Larch||Drought stress","Reduced diurnal temperature range mitigates drought impacts on larch tree growth in North China",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2022-08-27T03:04:31Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85135938988",,"000878996300008","Sci.

This mechanism can collect up to two independent samples per mission by pumping water through a pair of glass-fibre GF/F filters.

Bacteria can survive treatment by using both genetic and phenotypic mechanisms to diminish the effect of antimicrobials. We assemble empirical data showing that, for example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections frequently contain persisters, transiently non-growing cells unaffected by antibiotics (AB) and hyper-mutators, mutants with elevated mutation rates, and thus higher probability of genetic resistance emergence. Resistance, persistence and hyper-mutation dynamics are difficult to disentangle experimentally. Hence, we use stochastic population modelling and deterministic fitness calculations to investigate the relative importance of genetic and phenotypic mechanisms for immediate treatment failure and establishment of prolonged, chronic infections. We find that persistence causes 'hidden' treatment failure with very low cell numbers if antimicrobial concentrations prevent growth of genetically resistant cells. Persister cells can regrow after treatment is discontinued and allow for resistance evolution in the absence of AB. This leads to different mutational routes during treatment and relapse of an infection. By contrast, hyper-mutation facilitates resistance evolution during treatment, but rarely contributes to treatment failure. Our findings highlight the time and concentration dependence of different bacterial mechanisms to escape AB killing, which should be considered when designing 'failure-proof' treatments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000581842",,"0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2022.1300","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/581842","en","Royal Society of London","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","antibiotic resistance evolution||persisters||hyper-mutators||stochastic simulations||pharmacodynamic modelling||fitness calculations","Assessing the relative importance of bacterial resistance, persistence and hyper-mutation for antibiotic treatment failure",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-11-20T04:54:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Infectious disease dynamics: spread along contact networks and experimental evolution of antibiotic resistance","176401","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Exzellenzbeitrag in Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85141531434",,"000884382400020","Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1986","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","289","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Collecting images of organisms over large temporal or spatial scales is a promising practice to monitor the biodiversity of natural ecosystems, providing large amounts of data with minimal interference with the environment. Deep learning models are currently used to automate classification of organisms into taxonomic units. However, imprecision in these classifiers introduces a measurement noise that is difficult to control and can significantly hinder the analysis and interpretation of data. We overcome this limitation through ensembles of Data-efficient image Transformers (DeiTs), which not only are easy to train and implement, but also significantly outperform the previous state of the art (SOTA). We validate our results on ten ecological imaging datasets of diverse origin, ranging from plankton to birds. On all the datasets, we achieve a new SOTA, with a reduction of the error with respect to the previous SOTA ranging from 29.35% to 100.00%, and often achieving performances very close to perfect classification. Ensembles of DeiTs perform better not because of superior single-model performances but rather due to smaller overlaps in the predictions by independent models and lower top-1 probabilities. This increases the benefit of ensembling, especially when using geometric averages to combine individual learners. While we only test our approach on biodiversity image datasets, our approach is generic and can be applied to any kind of images.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000587494",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-022-21910-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587494","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biodiversity||Computer science||Ecology||Limnology","Ensembles of data-efficient vision transformers as a new paradigm for automated classification in ecology",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-12-15T15:15:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The assessment of genetic variation at hundreds or thousands of unlinked genetic loci forms a sound basis to address questions ranging from micro- to macroevolutionary timescales, and is now possible thanks to advances in sequencing technology. Major difficulties are associated with (i) the lack of genomic resources for many taxa, especially from tropical biodiversity hotspots; (ii) scaling the numbers of individuals analysed and loci sequenced; and (iii) building tools for reproducible bioinformatic analyses of such data sets. To address these challenges, we developed target capture probes for genomic studies of the highly diverse, pantropically distributed and economically significant rosewoods (Dalbergia spp.), explored the performance of an overlapping probe set for target capture across the legume family (Fabaceae), and built the general purpose bioinformatic pipeline CaptureAl. Phylogenomic analyses of Malagasy Dalbergia species yielded highly resolved and well supported hypotheses of evolutionary relationships. Population genomic analyses identified differences between closely related species and revealed the existence of a potentially new species, suggesting that the diversity of Malagasy Dalbergia species has been underestimated. Analyses at the family level corroborated previous findings by the recovery of monophyletic subfamilies and many well-known clades, as well as high levels of gene tree discordance, especially near the root of the family. The new genomic and bioinformatic resources, including the Fabaceae1005 and Dalbergia2396 probe sets, will hopefully advance systematics and ecological genetics research in legumes, and promote conservation of the highly diverse and endangered Dalbergia rosewoods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000556194",,"1755-098X||1471-8278||1755-0998||1471-8286",,"10.1111/1755-0998.13666","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/556194","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Dalbergia||Fabaceae||Leguminosae||phylogenomics||rosewood||target capture","A target capture approach for phylogenomic analyses at multiple evolutionary timescales in rosewoods (Dalbergia spp.) and the legume family (Fabaceae)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-07-05T03:02:27Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85133269601",,"000816963000001","Mol.

The primary goal of this study was to examine the long-term changes in diatom assemblages in the running waters at high-elevation influenced by rock glaciers, and particularly the use of diatoms as indicators of environmental change. Because streams in the catchment are interconnected with lakes, another objective was to compare diatom assemblages between lake inlets and lake outlets as well as along the chain of lakes. The Macun cirque comprises two main drainage basins with one influenced by waters from rock glaciers. Lakes are interconnected by stream segments in both basins before merging at an outflow lake. We expected changes in diatom assemblages would reflect changes in long-term physico-chemistry of surface waters between basins, between lake inlets and outlets, and along lake chains. The novelty of this work is that covers a unique heterogeneous aquatic environment in the Alps affected by climate change, an area where the temperature has increased over twofold more than other regions in the northern hemisphere. This long-term study provides the opportunity of forecasting how other alpine freshwater ecosystems globally may change in the future. We combined a classical taxonomic approach and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) along with physico-chemical data across a broad spatio-temporal scale. Diatom assemblages showed distinct spatial differences between basins, reflecting basin-wide differences in water physico-chemistry. Diatoms in both basins displayed a major temporal shift in composition between samples collected pre-2010 with those collected post-2010 that also followed temporal changes in physico-chemistry, suggesting a tipping point occurred in the system. There were subtle differences in diatom assemblages between lake inlets and outlets, most evident in the precipitation/groundwater fed north basin. Lastly, a clear lake order effect was detected in both basins with upper basin sites differing from lower basin sites at similar altitude. We conclude that diatoms were effective in documenting the environmental changes that occurred in these alpine waters, specifically reflecting the abrupt change in physico-chemistry (concurrent tipping point in diatom assemblages) and the concomitant increase in surface water homogeneity and similarity of diatom assemblages over the study period.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000575676",,"1470-160X||1872-7034","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587498||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/575676","10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109515","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587733","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Lake order||Alpine streams||Physico-chemistry||Freshwater monitoring||Periphyton","Long-term response of diatoms in high-elevation streams influenced by rock glaciers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-10-13T03:08:08Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85139072556",,,,,"Ecological Indicators","144","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Species minimum resource requirements (R*s) can predict competitive outcomes and evolve under selection in simple communities under controlled conditions. However, whether R*s predict competitive outcomes or demonstrate adaptive evolution in naturally complex communities is unknown. We subjected natural phytoplankton communities to three types of resource limitation (nitrogen, phosphorus, light) in outdoor mesocosms over 10 weeks. We examined the community composition weekly and isolated 21 phytoplankton strains from seven species to quantify responses to the selection of R* for these resources. We investigated the evolutionary change in R*s in the dominant species, Desmodesmus armatus. R*s were good predictors of species changes in relative abundance, though this was largely driven by the success of D. armatus across several treatments. This species also demonstrated an evolutionary change in R*s under resource limitation, supporting the potential for adaptive trait change to modify competitive outcomes in natural communities.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000587489",,"1461-023X||1461-0248",,"https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14103","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587489","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","competition||evolutionary trait change||light||nitrogen||phosphorous||phytoplankton||R*||resource||Resource Competition Theory (RCT)||traits","Ecology and evolution of competitive trait variation in natural phytoplankton communities under selection",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-12-15T15:15:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecol. lett.","11","Ecology Letters","25","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Insects represent an important group of species in freshwater and terrestrial habitats, and they constitute a large proportion of non-native species. However, while many non-native insects are known from terrestrial ecosystems, they appear to be less represented in freshwater habitats. Comparisons between freshwater and terrestrial habitats of invader richness relative to native species richness are scarce, which hinders syntheses of invasion processes. Here, we used data from three regions on different continents to determine whether non-native insects are indeed under-represented in freshwater compared with terrestrial assemblages.  Location Europe, North America, New Zealand.  Methods We compiled a comprehensive inventory of native and non-native insect species established in freshwater and terrestrial habitats of the three study regions. We then contrasted the richness of non-native and native species among freshwater and terrestrial insects for all insect orders in each region. Using binomial regression, we analysed the proportions of non-native species in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. Marine insect species were excluded from our analysis, and insects in low-salinity brackish water were considered as freshwater insects.  Results In most insect orders living in freshwater, non-native species were under-represented, while they were over-represented in a number of terrestrial orders. This pattern occurred in purely aquatic orders and in orders with both freshwater and terrestrial species. Overall, the proportion of non-native species was significantly lower in freshwater than in terrestrial species.  Main conclusions Despite the numerical and ecological importance of insects among all non-native species, non-native insect species are surprisingly rare in freshwater habitats. This is consistent across the three investigated regions. We review hypotheses concerning species traits and invasion pathways that are most likely to explain these patterns. Our findings contribute to a growing appreciation of drivers and impacts of biological invasions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000570897",,"1366-9516||1472-4642","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/570897||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587503","10.1111/ddi.13622","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/588161","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","aquatic insects||biological invasions||established species||freshwater||insect invasions||life history traits||pathways||species richness||terrestrial insects","Fewer non-native insects in freshwater than in terrestrial habitats across continents",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-09-16T03:04:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85137508524",,"000851452600001","Divers.

Here, we use spatially explicit coalescence simulations to explore the properties of the island and the two-dimensional stepping stone models under a wide range of scenarios with spatio-temporal variation in deme size. We avoid the simulation of genetic data, using the fact that under the studied models, summary statistics of genetic diversity and divergence can be approximated from coalescence times. We perform the simulations using gridCoal, a flexible spatial wrapper for the software msprime (Kelleher et al., 2016, Theoretical Population Biology, 95, 13) developed herein. In gridCoal, deme sizes can change arbitrarily across space and time, as well as migration rates between individual demes. We identify different factors that can cause a deviation from theoretical expectations, such as the simulation time in comparison to the effective deme size and the spatio-temporal autocorrelation across the grid. Our results highlight that F-ST, a measure of the strength of population structure, principally depends on recent demography, which makes it robust to temporal variation in deme size. In contrast, the amount of genetic diversity is dependent on the distant past when N-e is large, therefore longer run times are needed to estimate N-e than F-ST. Finally, we illustrate the use of gridCoal on a real-world example, the range expansion of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) since the last glacial maximum, using different degrees of spatio-temporal variation in deme size.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000559644",,"1755-098X||1471-8278||1755-0998||1471-8286",,"10.1111/1755-0998.13676","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/559644","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","coalescence||demography||spatially explicit simulations||island model||2Dstepping stone model||Fst","Using gridCoal to assess whether standard population genetic theory holds in the presence of spatio-temporal heterogeneity in population size",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-07-23T03:02:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85134057271",,"000825873600001","Mol.

In this study, we focus on finite populations evolving on neutral networks comprising viable and unfit genotypes. We provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of recombination by jointly considering different measures of evolvability and mutational robustness over a broad parameter range, such that many evolutionary regimes are covered. We find that several of these measures vary non-monotonically with the rates of mutation and recombination. Moreover, the presence of unfit genotypes that introduce inhomogeneities in the network of viable states qualitatively alters the effects of recombination. We conclude that conflicting trends induced by recombination can be explained by an emerging trade-off between evolvability on the one hand, and mutational robustness on the other. Finally, we discuss how different implementations of the recombination scheme in theoretical models can affect the observed dependence on recombination rate through a coupling between recombination and genetic drift.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000586184",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010710","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/586184","en","PLOS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Point mutation||DNA recombination||Genetic drift||Deletion mutation||Population genetics||Variant genotypes||Population size||Mutation detection","Conflicting effects of recombination on the evolvability and robustness in neutrally evolving populations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-12-11T18:07:42Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85143125516",,"000944160200001","PLOS comput. biol.","11","PLoS Computational Biology","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Amphibian population declines, driven by multiple stressors, are emblematic of the freshwater biodiversity crisis. Habitat creation is a straightforward conservation action that has been shown to locally benefit amphibians, as well as other taxa, but does it benefit entire amphibian communities at large spatial scales? Here, we evaluate a landscape-scale pond-construction program by fitting dynamic occupancy models to 20 y of monitoring data for 12 pond-breeding amphibian species in the Swiss state Aargau, a densely populated area of the Swiss lowlands with intensive land use. After decades of population declines, the number of occupied ponds increased statewide for 10 out of 12 species, while one species remained stable and one species further declined between 1999 and 2019. Despite regional differences, in 77% of all 43 regional metapopulations, the colonization and subsequent occupation of new ponds stabilized (14%) or increased (63%) metapopulation size. Likely mechanisms include increased habitat availability, restoration of habitat dynamics, and increased connectivity between ponds. Colonization probabilities reflected species-specific preferences for characteristics of ponds and their surroundings, which provides evidence-based information for future pond construction targeting specific species. The relatively simple but landscape-scale and persistent conservation action of constructing hundreds of new ponds halted declines and stabilized or increased the state-wide population size of all but one species, despite ongoing pressures from other stressors in a human-dominated landscape.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576139",,"0027-8424||1091-6490","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587496||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576139","10.1073/pnas.2123070119","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587736","en","National Academy of Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","amphibian decline||evidence-based conservation||freshwater biodiversity||recovery||conservation management","Bending the curve: Simple but massive conservation action leads to landscape-scale recovery of amphibians",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-10-17T03:09:08Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85139520146",,"000898705000003","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","42","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","119","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The focus to date has primarily been on bacteriocin interactions at the within-host scale (i.e. within a single bacterial population). Yet in species such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, with relatively short periods of colonization and limited within-host diversity, ecological outcomes are also shaped by processes at the epidemiological (between-host) scale. Here, we first investigate bacteriocin dynamics and diversity in epidemiological models. We find that in these models, bacteriocin diversity is more readily maintained than in within-host models, and with more possible combinations of coexisting bacteriocin profiles. Indeed, maintenance of diversity in epidemiological models does not require rock-paper-scissors dynamics; it can also occur through a competition-colonization trade-off. Second, we investigate the link between bacteriocin diversity and diversity at antibiotic resistance loci. Previous work has proposed that bacterial duration of colonization modulates the fitness of antibiotic resistance. Due to their inhibitory effects, bacteriocins are a plausible candidate for playing a role in the duration of colonization episodes. We extend the epidemiological model of bacteriocin dynamics to incorporate an antibiotic resistance locus and demonstrate that bacteriocin diversity can indeed maintain the coexistence of antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant strains.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576583",,"0080-4649||0950-1193||1471-2954||0962-8452",,"10.1098/rspb.2022.1197","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576583","en","Royal Society of London","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","rock–paper–scissors dynamics||bacteriocin diversity||theoretical ecology||theoretical ecology||antibiotic resistance||bacterial warfare||epidemological modelling","Epidemiological dynamics of bacteriocin competition and antibiotic resistance",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-10-18T09:42:57Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85139572621",,"000868249200001","Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","1984","Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","289","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They were not only instrumental in laying the foundations of molecular biology, but they are also likely to play crucial roles in shaping our biosphere and may offer a solution to the control of drug-resistant bacterial infections. However, it remains challenging to predict the conditions for bacterial eradication by phage predation, sometimes even under well-defined laboratory conditions, and, most curiously, if the majority of surviving cells are genetically phage-susceptible. Here, I propose that even clonal phage and bacterial populations are generally in a state of continuous 'phenotypic flux', which is caused by transient and nongenetic variation in phage and bacterial physiology. Phenotypic flux can shape phage infection dynamics by reducing the force of infection to an extent that allows for coexistence between phages and susceptible bacteria. Understanding the mechanisms and impact of phenotypic flux may be key to providing a complete picture of phage-bacteria coexistence. I review the empirical evidence for phenotypic variation in phage and bacterial physiology together with the ways they have been modeled and discuss the potential implications of phenotypic flux for ecological and evolutionary dynamics between phages and bacteria, as well as for phage therapy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576115",,"2057-1577",,"10.1093/ve/veac086","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576115","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","phage-bacteria co-existence||phenotypic resistance||physiological heterogeneity||phenotypic flux||phage infection dynamics","Phenotypic flux: The role of physiology in explaining the conundrum of bacterial persistence amid phage attack",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-10-17T03:03:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Dynamics of phage Iysis systems and their evolutionary advantages","19-2 FEL-74","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Fellows",,,,,,"000865125100001","Virus Evol.","2","Virus Evolution","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we examined the genetic diversity of Epichloë from three European species of Brachypodium (B. sylvaticum, B. pinnatum and B. phoenicoides) and three species of Calamagrostis (C. arundinacea, C. purpurea and C. villosa), using DNA sequences of tubB and tefA genes. In addition, microsatellite markers were obtained from a larger set of isolates from B. sylvaticum sampled across Europe. Based on phylogenetic analyses the isolates from Brachypodium hosts were placed in three different subclades within the Epichloë typhina complex (ETC) but did not strictly group according to host grass species, suggesting that the host does not always select for particular endophyte genotypes. Analysis of microsatellite markers confirmed the presence of genetically distinct lineages of Epichloë sylvatica on B. sylvaticum, which appeared to be tied to different modes of reproduction (sexual or asexual). Among isolates from Calamagrostis hosts, two subclades were detected which were placed outside ETC. These endophyte lineages are recognized as distinct species for which we propose the names E. calamagrostidis Leuchtm. & Schardl, sp. nov. and E. ftanensis Leuchtm. & A.D. Treindl, sp. nov.

We found that shifts in community structure following an abrupt climate manipulation were not simply accelerated versions of shifts expected under gradual warming, as the former missed the transient rise of species benefiting from moderate warming.

These stands are areas of the forest where the precise locations and repeated size measurements of each tree are recorded, thereby enabling the calculation of spatially-explicit metrics of individual growth rates and of the entire tree community. The most common use of these datasets is to investigate the drivers of variation in forest processes by modeling tree growth rate or mortality as a function of these neighborhood metrics. However, neighborhood metrics could also serve as important covariates of many other spatially variable forest processes, including seedling recruitment, herbivory and soil microbial community composition. Widespread use of stem-mapped forest stand datasets is currently hampered by the lack of standardized, efficient and easy-to-use tools to calculate tree dynamics (e.g. growth, mortality) and the neighborhood metrics that impact them. We present the forestexplorR package that facilitates the munging, exploration, visualization and analysis of stem-mapped forest stands. By providing flexible, user-friendly functions that calculate neighborhood metrics and implement a recently-developed rapid-fitting tree growth and mortality model, forestexplorR broadens the accessibility of stem-mapped forest stand data. We demonstrate the functionality of forestexplorR by using it to investigate how the species identity of neighboring trees influences the growth rates of three common tree species in Mt Rainier National Park, WA, USA. forestexplorR is designed to facilitate researchers to incorporate spatially-explicit descriptions of tree communities in their studies and we expect this increased diversity of contributors to develop exciting new ways of using stem-mapped forest stand data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000560513",,"0906-7590||1600-0587",,"10.1111/ecog.06223","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/560513","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","forest stand||mortality||neighborhood model||tree density||tree growth||visualization","forestexplorR: an R package for the exploration and analysis of stem-mapped forest stand data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-07-28T03:21:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000827667700001",,"10","Ecography","2022","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, how this host diversity evolves over time remains unclear because it depends on the interplay between intraspecific competition among host genotypes and coevolution with pathogens. Here we study experimentally the effect of coevolving phage populations on the diversification of bacterial CRISPR immunity across space and time. We demonstrate that the negative-frequency-dependent selection generated by coevolution is a powerful force that maintains host resistance diversity and selects for new resistance mutations in the host. We also find that host evolution is driven by asymmetries in competitive abilities among different host genotypes. Even if the fittest host genotypes are targeted preferentially by the evolving phages, they often escape extinctions through the acquisition of new CRISPR immunity. Together, these fluctuating selective pressures maintain diversity, but not by preserving the pre-existing host composition. Instead, we repeatedly observe the introduction of new resistance genotypes stemming from the fittest hosts in each population. These results highlight the importance of competition on the transient dynamics of host-pathogen coevolution.",,,,"2397-334X",,"10.1038/s41559-022-01841-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566955","en","Nature",,,,"Competition and coevolution drive the evolution and the diversification of CRISPR immunity",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2022-08-28T05:28:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85135799784",,"000840584700003","Nat Ecol Evol",,"Nature Ecology & Evolution","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using the predatory bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, which undergoes aggregative fruiting body development upon starvation, we tested whether adaptation to distinct growth environments that do not induce development latently alters developmental phenotypes under starvation conditions that do induce development. In an evolution experiment named MyxoEE-3, growing M. xanthus populations swarmed across agar surfaces while adapting to conditions varying at factors such as surface stiffness or prey identity. Such ecological variation during growth was found to greatly impact the latent evolution of development, including fruiting body morphology, the degree of morphological trait correlation, reaction norms, degrees of developmental plasticity and stochastic diversification. For example, some prey environments promoted retention of developmental proficiency whereas others led to its systematic loss. Our results have implications for understanding evolutionary interactions among predation, development and motility in myxobacterial life cycles, and, more broadly, how ecology can profoundly shape the evolution of developmental systems latently rather than by direct selection on developmental features.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000572560",,"2399-3642",,"10.1038/s42003-022-03912-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572560","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Evolutionary developmental biology||Experimental evolution","Hidden paths to endless forms most wonderful: ecology latently shapes evolution of multicellular development in predatory bacteria",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-09-25T03:03:10Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85138220855",,"000854598500005","Commun Biol","1","Communications Biology","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the ultra-low coverage of the sequenced data (<0.05× per cell) mostly limits their usage to the identification of copy number alterations in multi-megabase segments. Many tumors are not copy number-driven, and thus single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based subclone detection may contribute to a more comprehensive view on intra-tumor heterogeneity. Due to the low coverage of the data, the identification of SNVs is only possible when superimposing the sequenced genomes of hundreds of genetically similar cells. Thus, we have developed a new approach to efficiently cluster tumor cells based on a Bayesian filtering approach of relevant loci and exploiting read overlap and phasing.  Results We developed Single Cell Data Tumor Clusterer (SECEDO, lat. ‘to separate’), a new method to cluster tumor cells based solely on SNVs, inferred on ultra-low coverage single-cell DNA sequencing data. We applied SECEDO to a synthetic dataset simulating 7250 cells and eight tumor subclones from a single patient and were able to accurately reconstruct the clonal composition, detecting 92.11% of the somatic SNVs, with the smallest clusters representing only 6.9% of the total population. When applied to five real single-cell sequencing datasets from a breast cancer patient, each consisting of ≈2000 cells, SECEDO was able to recover the major clonal composition in each dataset at the original coverage of 0.03×, achieving an Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) score of ≈0.6. The current state-of-the-art SNV-based clustering method achieved an ARI score of ≈0, even after merging cells to create higher coverage data (factor 10 increase), and was only able to match SECEDOs performance when pooling data from all five datasets, in addition to artificially increasing the sequencing coverage by a factor of 7. Variant calling on the resulting clusters recovered more than twice as many SNVs as would have been detected if calling on all cells together. Further, the allelic ratio of the called SNVs on each subcluster was more than double relative to the allelic ratio of the SNVs called without clustering, thus demonstrating that calling variants on subclones, in addition to both increasing sensitivity of SNV detection and attaching SNVs to subclones, significantly increases the confidence of the called variants.

Despite its relevance, most published family phylogenies are incompletely sampled, generally contain massive polytomies, and/or show incongruent topologies between datasets. Here, we present the most complete Brassicaceae genus-level family phylogenies to date (Brassicaceae Tree of Life, or BrassiToL) based on nuclear (>1,000 genes, almost all 349 genera and 53 tribes) and plastome (60 genes, 79% of the genera, all tribes) data. We found cytonuclear discordance between nuclear and plastome-derived phylogenies, which is likely a result of rampant hybridisation among closely and more distantly related species, and highlight rogue taxa. To evaluate the impact of this rampant hybridisation on the nuclear phylogeny reconstruction, we performed four different sampling routines that increasingly removed variable data and likely paralogs. Our resulting cleaned subset of 297 nuclear genes revealed high support for the tribes, while support for the main lineages remained relatively low. Calibration based on the 20 most clock-like nuclear genes suggests a late Eocene to late Oligocene ‘icehouse origin’ of the family. Finally, we propose five new or re-established tribes, including the recognition of Arabidopsideae, a monotypic tribe to accommodate Arabidopsis. With a worldwide community of thousands of researchers working on this family, our new, densely sampled family phylogeny will be an indispensable tool to further highlight Brassicaceae as an excellent model family for studies on biodiversity and plant biology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000581471",,,,"10.1101/2022.09.01.506188","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/581471","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","mustard family||Tree of Life||Angiosperms353||coalescence||phylogenomics||taxonomy","Global Phylogeny of the Brassicaceae Provides Important Insights into Gene Discordance",,"Working Paper","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences",,,"2022-11-17T15:34:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

First, we validate the model by testing if it can recreate two elevational ecotypes of Dianthus carthusianorum occurring in the Swiss Alps. Second, we use the E-FSP model to disentangle the relative contribution of abiotic (temperature) and biotic (competition and pollination) selection pressures to elevational adaptation in D. carthusianorum.The model reproduced the qualitative differences between the elevational ecotypes in two phenological (germination and flowering time) and one morphological trait (stalk height), as well as qualitative differences in four performance variables that emerge from GxE interactions (flowering time, number of stalks, rosette area and seed production). Our results suggest that elevational adaptation in D. carthusianorum is predominantly driven by the abiotic environment.Our approach shows how E-FSP models incorporating physiological, ecological and evolutionary mechanisms can be used in combination with experiments to examine hypotheses about patterns of adaptation observed in the field.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",,,,,,"10.1101/2022.09.02.506361","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587201","en","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory",,,,"Unravelling drivers of local adaptation through Evolutionary Functional-Structural Plant modelling",,"Working Paper","Metadata only",,,,,"2022-12-14T15:31:46Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"bioRxiv",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Population size reduction via loss of habitat and connectivity can lead to loss of neutral and adaptive genetic diversity. The Hare’s tail cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum) is strongly associated with peat bogs and has undergone major habitat loss in Switzerland, especially in the Central Plateau, over the last two centuries as a consequence of wetland drainage and peat extraction. Assessing herbarium-based georeferencing data and observation records indicates a reduced occurrence of E. vaginatum, especially under relatively warm and dry climates. This raises the question of whether habitat loss has caused a reduction in genetic diversity in general and of variants adaptive under warm conditions in particular. We selected 226 herbarium specimens, collected between 1804 and 1949, from seven Swiss herbaria for whole genome re-sequencing. Where possible, we additionally collected contemporary samples from the same or a nearby location. By comparing the genetic diversity of historical and contemporary samples, we will examine whether an overall loss of genetic diversity has occurred in E. vaginatum across Switzerland. We will assess historical genotype-climate associations in order to test whether genetic variants associated with warm climatic conditions occur at reduced frequency in the contemporary gene pool.

Tadpoles were initially reared in benign conditions at pH 7 and then exposed to a combination of two pH (acid versus neutral) and two predator cue (predator cue versus no predator cue) treatments. We assessed behavioural activity within the first 15 min, and tissue CORT within 8 and 24 h of stress exposure. Both AOP and NOP tadpoles reduced their activity in acidic pH, but the response to the predator cue differed between the populations: AOP tadpoles increased whereas NOP tadpoles decreased their activity. The AOP and NOP tadpoles differed also in their CORT responses, with AOP being more responsive (CORT levels of NOP tadpoles did not differ statistically across treatments). After 8 h exposure, AOP tadpoles had elevated CORT levels in the acid-predator cue treatment and after 24 h exposure they had elevated CORT levels in all three stress treatments (relative to the benign neutral-no-cue treatment). These results suggest that adaptation to environmental acidification in R. arvalis is mediated, in part, via behavioural and hormonal plasticity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000560201",,"0174-1578||1432-136X",,"10.1007/s00360-022-01449-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/560201","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Adaptive divergence||Behaviour||Corticosterone||Phenotypic plasticity||Rana arvalis","Short-term responses of Rana arvalis tadpoles to pH and predator stress: adaptive divergence in behavioural and physiological plasticity?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-07-27T05:31:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85134583188",,"000827919500001","J Comp Physiol B","5","Journal of Comparative Physiology B","192","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To provide insight into their relative importance, we explore the mismatch between three dimensions of biodiversity (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic), and compare their patterns to null models of random community assembly. We focus on a highly diverse tropical group: the tree frogs (hylids) of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. For that, we combined geographic distribution data with phylogenetic and trait information for 158 species to produce maps of the three dimensions of diversity. We show that communities of tree frogs of the Hylidae family tend to have high functional richness along the Atlantic Forest, potentially driven by niche partitioning. However, environmental filtering gains importance in extreme environments, both at high elevations and higher latitudes. In these areas of the forest, clustering of both functional and phylogenetic diversity is observed. Trait overdispersion is found in areas of contact between vegetation types, or of adjacent biomes, reflecting the encounter of amphibian species adapted to distinct environmental conditions and landscape configurations. Considering all three dimensions of diversity along with multiple axes of environmental variation allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the processes shaping amphibian community assembly in this biodiversity hotspot.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000554669",,"0906-7590||1600-0587",,"10.1111/ecog.06138","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/554669","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","community ecology||dimensions of biodiversity||functional diversity||phylogenetic diversity","Extreme environments filter functionally rich communities of Atlantic Forest treefrogs along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-06-26T02:57:11Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85131877664",,"000812280500001",,"9","Ecography","2022","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Genetic diversity is one of the three main levels of biodiversity recognised in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Fundamental for species adaptation to environmental change, genetic diversity is nonetheless under-reported within global and national indicators. When it is reported, the focus is often narrow and confined to domesticated or other commercial species.  2. Several approaches have recently been developed to address this shortfall in reporting on genetic diversity of wild species. While multiplicity of approaches is helpful in any development process, it can also lead to confusion among policy makers and heighten a perception that conservation genetics is too abstract to be of use to organisations and governments.  3. As the developers of five of the different approaches, we have come together to explain how various approaches relate to each other and propose a scorecard, as a unifying reporting mechanism for genetic diversity.  4. Policy implications. We believe the proposed combined approach captures the strengths of its components and is practical for all nations and subnational governments. It is scalable and can be used to evaluate species conservation projects as well as genetic conservation projects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000554170",,"0021-8901||1365-2664",,"10.1111/1365-2664.14225","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/554170","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","biodiversity||conservation||convention on biological diversity||indicators||monitoring||policy||scorecard||wild species","Bringing together approaches to reporting on within species genetic diversity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-06-23T02:56:18Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85137193630",,"000810568500001","J.

To date, few studies have investigated how mixed infections affect transmission between hosts. Zymoseptoria tritici is a highly diverse wheat pathogen in which multiple strains often coexist in the same lesion. Here we demonstrate that the most competitive strains often exclude their competitors during serial passages of mixed infections. The outcome of the competition depended on both the host genotype and the genotypes of the competing pathogen strains. Differences in virulence among the strains were not associated with competitive advantages during transmission, while differences in reproductive potential had a strong effect on strain competitive ability.

First, we evaluated whether the upper elevational limits of alien plants changed between 2008 and 2018 based on the Mountain Invasion Research Network (MIREN) database. Second, we compared the observed upper elevational limits with the upper limits predicted by each species' global climatic niche. On average across species, the upper elevation limit did not change between 2008 and 2018. However, most species maintained the same limit or shifted downward, while only 23% of the species shifted upwards. This lack of change does not mean that the species' distributions are in equilibrium with the climate, because the observed upper limit was lower than the limit predicted by the global niche model for 87% of species. Our results suggest that alien species in this study region may not only be climate-limited, but could also be limited by other local-scale factors, such as seed dispersal, intermittent disturbance rates, soil type and biotic interactions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000573861",,"2223-7747",,"10.3390/plants11182345","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/573861","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Andean mountains||biological invasions||climatic niche||elevation||elevational limit||roadsides","The Upper Range Limit of Alien Plants Is Not in Equilibrium with Climate in the Andes of Central Chile",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-10-03T03:48:22Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85138725602",,"000857037900001",,"18","Plants","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While treetop leaves function in reliably direct light, leaves below the upper crown must tolerate rapid, thermally driven increases in evaporative demand. Using synchrotron-based X-ray microtomography, we visualized impacts of experimentally induced water stress and subsequent fogging on living cells in redwood leaves, adding ecological and functional context through crown-wide explorations of variation in leaf physiology and microclimate. Under drought, leaf transfusion tracheids buckle, releasing water that supplies sufficient temporal reserves for leaves to reduce stomatal conductance safely while stopping the further rise of tension. Tracheid buckling fraction decreases with height and is closely coordinated with transfusion tissue capacity and stomatal conductance to provide temporal reserves optimized for local variation in microclimate. Foliar water uptake fully restores collapsed and air-filled transfusion tracheids in leaves on excised shoots, suggesting that trees may use aerial water sources for recovery. In the intensely variable deep-crown environment, foliar water uptake can allow for repetitive cycles of tracheid buckling and unbuckling, protecting the tree from damaging levels of hydraulic tension and supporting leaf survival.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557116",,"0140-7791||1365-3040",,"10.1111/pce.14381","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557116","en","WIley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","embolism repair||foliar water uptake||microclimate||Sequoia||tracheid buckling||transfusion tissue","Tracheid buckling buys time, foliar water uptake pays it back: Coordination of leaf structure and function in tall redwood trees",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-07-10T03:17:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85133132956",,"000819281600001","Plant cell environ.","9","Plant, Cell & Environment","45","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For example, mutations may contribute additively to a phenotype, but their effects on fitness may combine non-additively because selection favors a low or intermediate value of that phenotype. This can cause incongruence between the topographical properties of a fitness landscape and its underlying genotype-phenotype landscape. Yet, genotype-phenotype landscapes are often used as a proxy for fitness landscapes to study the dynamics and predictability of evolution. Here, we use theoretical models and empirical data on transcription factor-DNA interactions to systematically study the incongruence of genotype-phenotype and fitness landscapes when selection favors a low or intermediate phenotypic value. Using the theoretical models, we prove a number of fundamental results. For example, selection for low or intermediate phenotypic values does not change simple sign epistasis into reciprocal sign epistasis, implying that genotype-phenotype landscapes with only simple sign epistasis motifs will always give rise to single-peaked fitness landscapes under such selection. More broadly, we show that such selection tends to create fitness landscapes that are more rugged than the underlying genotype-phenotype landscape, but this increased ruggedness typically does not frustrate adaptive evolution because the local adaptive peaks in the fitness landscape tend to be nearly as tall as the global peak. Many of these results carry forward to the empirical genotype-phenotype landscapes, which may help to explain why low- and intermediate-affinity transcription factor-DNA interactions are so prevalent in eukaryotic gene regulation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000576094",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010524","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/576094","en","PLOS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sign epistasis||Natural selection||Transcription factors||Fitness epistasis||Reciprocal sign epistasis||DNA transcription||Point mutation||Gene expression","On the incongruence of genotype-phenotype and fitness landscapes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-10-16T02:58:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Regulatory logic and the evolution of promoter complexity||The deformability of empirical genotype-phenotype landscapes","170604||192541","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85139379581",,"000933372800007","PLOS comput. biol.","9","PLoS Computational Biology","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We used published studies to estimate the range of values associated with two critical components of genetic diversity, the number of unique pathogen genotypes and the number of spores produced during an epidemic, for the septoria tritici blotch pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We found that wheat fields experiencing typical levels of infection are likely to carry between 3.1 and 14.0 million pathogen genotypes per hectare and produce at least 2.1-9.9 trillion pycnidiospores per hectare. Given the experimentally derived mutation rate of 3 x 10(-10) substitutions per site per cell division, we estimate that between 27 and 126 million pathogen spores carrying adaptive mutations to counteract fungicides and resistant cultivars will be produced per hectare during a growing season. This suggests that most of the adaptive mutations that have been observed in Z. tritici populations can emerge through local selection from standing genetic variation that already exists within each field.

Phenomena like lake eutrophication, algal blooms, or reorganization in community composition belong to the most studied ecosystem regime shifts. However, although regime shifts have been well documented in several lakes, a global assessment of the prevalence of regime shifts is still missing, and, more in general, of the factors altering stability in lake status, is missing. Here, we provide a first global assessment of regime shifts and stability in the productivity of 1,015 lakes worldwide using trophic state index (TSI) time series derived from satellite imagery. We find that 12.8% of the lakes studied show regime shifts whose signatures are compatible with tipping points, while the number of detected regime shifts from low to high TSI has increased over time. Although our results suggest an overall stable picture for global lake dynamics, the limited instability signatures do not mean that lakes are insensitive to global change. Modeling the interaction between lake climatic, geophysical, and socioeconomic features and their stability properties, we find that the probability of a lake experiencing a tipping point increases with human population density in its catchment, while it decreases as the gross domestic product of that population increases. Our results show how quantifying lake productivity dynamics at a global scale highlights socioeconomic inequalities in conserving natural environments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000587490",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"doi:10.1073/pnas.2116413119","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587490","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Regime shifts, trends, and variability of lake productivity at aglobal scale",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-12-15T15:15:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"35","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","119","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Pleistocene glaciation has been implicated in shaping the contemporary genetic differentiation between populations of the aquatic snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. We investigated whether similar phylogeographic patterns exist for the snail's locally adapted trematode parasite, Atriophallophorus winterbourni. We found evidence for a barrier to gene-flow in sympatry between cryptic, but ecologically divergent species. When focusing on the most common of these species, disjunct geographic distributions are found for mitochondrial lineages that diverged during the Pleistocene. The boundary between these distributions is found in the central part of the South Island and is reinforced by low cross-alpine migration. Further support for a vicariant origin of the phylogeographic pattern was found when assessing nuclear multilocus SNP data. Nuclear and mitochondrial population differentiation was concordant in pattern, except for populations in a potential secondary contact zone. Additionally, we found larger than expected differentiation between nuclear- and mitochondrial-based empirical Bayes FST estimates (global FST: 0.02 vs. 0.39 for nuclear and mitochondrial data, respectively). Population subdivision is theoretically expected to be stronger for mitochondrial genomes due to a smaller effective population size, but the strong difference here, together with mitonuclear discordance in a putative contact zone, is potentially indicative of divergent gene flow of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557113",,"0962-1083||1365-294X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587488||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557113","10.1111/mec.16570","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587753","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","phylogeography||population genetics||New Zealand||species delimitation||mitonuclear discordance","Phylogeography and cryptic species structure of a locally adapted parasite in New Zealand",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-07-10T03:17:56Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85133336531",,"000820504500001","Mol Ecol","15","Molecular Ecology","31","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Systematic and representative monitoring of genetic diversity has rarely been conducted, resulting in under-reporting to national and international authorities. Following our 2020 feasibility study on how genetic diversity and possible changes over time could be assessed across a variety of organisms, we initiated a pilot study for monitoring genetic diversity in five species across Switzerland. The pilot study aims to gain experience on how to implement a genetic diversity monitoring program using genomic approaches. We have selected five candidate species, each of which occurs in a specific habitat type of national importance and/or in anthropogenically modified landscapes. For each of the five species, we de novo assembled a reference genome. In 2021, we sampled >1,100 individuals from 135 populations across all biogeographic regions in Switzerland, applying a proportionally stratified random sampling strategy. We are currently whole-genome re-sequencing all individuals (~10x coverage). To explore possible changes in genetic diversity over time, we started a retrospective analysis of genetic diversity in two species, using specimens from natural history collections dating back up to 218 years. First results indicate that contemporary samples well represent the climate-space of each study species in Switzerland, and that retrospective monitoring based on historic DNA is feasible, but challenging.

The development and improvement of genetic diversity indicators is an intensively discussed topic. The type of genetic indicators that can be inferred from genetic monitoring is strongly dependent on the underlying sampling design. Here, we developed a universally applicable proportionally stratified random sampling strategy optimized for population genetic inferences. We tested and validated this protocol in a pilot study for a monitoring of genetic diversity in Switzerland. Our aim was to sample 30 populations from each of five species with 10 individuals each. Based on a 5x5 kilometer grid with 3,700 cells, we randomly selected 40 cells with recently documented occurrence data of the species, taking into account the species’ distribution across the five major biogeographic regions of Switzerland, which we treated as sampling strata. The sampling design thus accounts for the unequal sizes of the five biogeographic regions while having a random sampling design within these regions. To avoid sampling bias within the 5x5 km cells, the order of locations at which to attempt sampling was again randomized based on available occurrence data. We show that samples obtained by a proportionally stratified random sampling design cover the entire environmental climate-space (temperature and precipitation) of the corresponding species in Switzerland. The developed sampling design provides the foundation to infer population genetic indicators such as e.g. neutral and adaptive genetic diversity, inbreeding, connectivity or adaptive potential.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587138","en","European Conservation Genetics Meeting 2022",,,,"Sampling design for the monitoring of genetic diversity in Switzerland: Considerations and outcomes",,"Other Conference Item","Metadata only","European Conservation Genetics Meeting (ConsGen22) Abstract Book",,,,"2022-12-14T12:59:20Z",,,,"yes","5th European Conservation Genetics Meeting (ConsGen22)","August 30 - September 1, 2022","Edinburgh, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Human-induced habitat loss and landscape fragmentation are important drivers of population size reduction which can lead to genetic diversity loss. As a peat bog specialist, the cottongrass Eriophorum vaginatum has undergone major habitat loss in Switzerland during the past two centuries as a consequence of wetland drainage and peat extraction. Habitat loss has mainly occurred in the central plateau, a densely populated and relatively warm biogeographic region of Switzerland. In the pilot study for a monitoring of genetic diversity in Switzerland, E. vaginatum is monitored retrospectively using samples from natural history collections to understand the potential loss or change of genetic diversity during the last century. We developed a sampling scheme to select available E. vaginatum vouchers and corresponding contemporary samples for whole-genome re-sequencing (WGS) to assess whether past habitat loss has mediated the extinction or isolation of genotypes that are potentially adaptive under future climate change. From >700 vouchers available in seven different Swiss herbaria, we selected 226 specimens from across Switzerland considering age, spatial distribution, and habitat change. We tested and optimized DNA extraction protocols and performed WGS to identify methodological challenges and possible limitations of the data.

They can inhibit growth and activity of pathogens or induce defence responses. In recent years, evidence has emerged that several plant-beneficial rhizosphere bacteria do not only associate with plants but also with insects. Their relationships with insects range from pathogenic to mutualistic and some rhizobacteria can use insects as vectors for dispersal to new host plants. Thus, the interactions of these bacteria with their environment are even more complex than previously thought and can extend far beyond the rhizosphere. The discovery of this secret life of rhizobacteria represents an exciting new field of research that should link the fields of plant-microbe and insect-microbe interactions. In this review, we provide examples of plant-beneficial rhizosphere bacteria that use insects as alternative hosts, and of potentially rhizosphere-competent insect symbionts. We discuss the bacterial traits that may enable a host-switch between plants and insects and further set the multi-host lifestyle of rhizobacteria into an evolutionary and ecological context. Finally, we identify important open research questions and discuss perspectives on the use of these rhizobacteria in agriculture.","application/pdf||application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000540669",,"1462-2912||1462-2920",,"10.1111/1462-2920.15968","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/540669","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"The secret life of plant-beneficial rhizosphere bacteria: insects as alternative hosts",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-04-04T02:56:28Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85127243038",,"000773309300001","Environ. microbiol.","8","Environmental Microbiology","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This type of meeting format was rare before the COVID-19 pandemic, but started to become more common recently given the asynchronous global progression of the pandemic, the uneven access to vaccines and different travel regulations among countries that led to a large proportion of participants being unable to attend conferences in person. Here we report the organization of a middle-sized (581 participants: 159 onsite, 422 online) international hybrid conference that took place in France in September 2021. We highlight particular organizational challenges inherent to this relatively new type of meeting format. Furthermore, we surveyed both in-person and online participants to better understand their conference experience and to propose improvements based on the feedback received. Finally, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of three types of conferences (onsite-only, online-only and hybrid) and suggest that hybrid events should be favored in the future because they offer the most flexibility to participants. We conclude by proposing suggestions and ways forward to maximize accessibility and inclusivity of hybrid conferences. Our study brings novel insights on the challenges and opportunities created by hybrid conferences, by reporting not only the organizing committee experience but also by considering the participants’ perspective.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000587499",,"2296-7745",,"10.3389/fmars.2022.902772","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587499","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","international conference||inclusivity||opinion survey||pandemic||carbon footprint||meeting organization","Hybrid conferences: opportunities, challenges and ways forward",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-12-15T15:15:32Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Frontiers in Marine Science","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To study the evolutionary potential of upper thermal tolerance, we evolved the cold-adapted Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis to survive at 30°C, beyond its ancestral thermal limit. This high-temperature adaptation occurred rapidly and in multiple populations. It involved genomic changes that occurred in a highly parallel fashion and mitigated the effects of protein misfolding. However, it also confronted a physiological limit, because populations failed to grow beyond 30°C. Our experiments aimed to facilitate evolutionary rescue by using a small organism with large populations living at temperatures several degrees below their upper thermal limit. Larger organisms with smaller populations and living at temperatures closer to their upper thermal tolerances are even more likely to go extinct during extreme heat waves.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000559695",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.abk3511","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/559695","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"A limit on the evolutionary rescue of an Antarctic bacterium from rising temperatures",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-07-24T03:13:39Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Adaptation to changing environments and its boundaries","185899","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","PRIMA",,,,"85134197002",,"000826385700001","Sci Adv","28","Science Advances","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Individually, they often cannot account for biofilm recalcitrance. However, their combination can increase the minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotics needed to kill bacterial cells by three orders of magnitude, explaining bacterial survival under otherwise lethal drug treatment. The relative contributions of these factors depend on the specific antibiotics, bacterial strain, as well as environmental and growth conditions. An emerging population genetic property—increased biofilm genetic diversity—further enhances biofilm recalcitrance. Here, we develop a polygenic model of biofilm recalcitrance accounting for multiple phenotypic mechanisms proposed to explain biofilm recalcitrance. The model can be used to generate predictions about the emergence of resistance—its timing and population genetic consequences. We use the model to simulate various treatments and experimental setups. Our simulations predict that the evolution of resistance is impaired in biofilms at low antimicrobial concentrations while it is facilitated at higher concentrations. In scenarios that allow bacteria exchange between planktonic and biofilm compartments, the evolution of resistance is further facilitated compared to scenarios without exchange. We compare these predictions to published experimental observations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000560526",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2022.916035","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/560526","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","biofilm recalcitrance||population genetics||antibiotic resistance||resistance evolution||mathematical modeling||PK/PD","Modeling Polygenic Antibiotic Resistance Evolution in Biofilms",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-07-28T03:31:25Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85134499875",,"000831271000001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Streams interconnect the four largest lakes, forming the drainage network that flows into the Inn River at the town of Lavin. The drainage network of Macun consists of a north and a south basin that overlie an ortho-gneiss, meta-granitoid bedrock. The south basin is influenced by various rock glaciers. The physico-chemistry of surface waters at 10 sites has been monitored annually in midsummer since 2001. Further, an YSI EXO2 Multiparameter Sonde (Exosonde) with various water quality sensors has been employed since 2016 at the last lake in the network to examine seasonal and diel patterns in physico-chemistry. Results showed clear physico-chemical differences between the two basins, which mostly reflect rockglacier inputs in the south basin. Nitrogen values were two-fold higher and particulate phosphorus values two-fold lower in the south basin than in the north basin. Over time, the physico-chemistry in the two basins became more homogeneous, with a reduction in rock-glacial inputs in the south basin and an overall decrease in nitrogen in the catchment. Data from 30 springs and tributaries sampled in 2002 and 2017 reflected the basin differences and temporal changes observed at the primary study sites. Continuous temperature records showed north basin streams to be ca. 3°C warmer than south-basin streams, but with high inter-annual variation that reflected annual differences in weather and no evidence of a general change over time (increase or decrease). Exosonde data revealed strong seasonality in measured parameters as well as seasonality in diel patterns (e. g., dissolved oxygen, temperature, chlorophyll-a); diel fluctuations were most pronounced in summer and least in winter.

To address this, we have generated and compared 15 complete telomere-to-telomere genomes across the phylogeny of a single genus of filamentous fungi, Epichloë. We find that the strik-ing distinction between gene-rich and repeat-rich regions previously reported for isolated species is ubiquitous across the Epichloë genus. We built a species phylogeny from single-copy gene orthologs to provide a comparative framing to study chromosome composition and structural change through evolutionary time. All Epichloë genomes have exactly seven nuclear chromosomes, but despite this conserved ploidy, analyses reveal low synteny and substantial rearrangement of gene content across the genus. These rearrangements are highly lineage-dependent, with most oc-curring over short evolutionary distances, with long periods of structural stasis. Quantification of chromosomal rearrangements shows they are uncorrelated with numbers of substitutions and evolutionary distances, suggesting that different modes of evolution are acting to create nucleotide and chromosome-scale changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557718",,"2309-608X",,"10.3390/jof8070670","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557718","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Epichloë||genome structure||chromosome evolution||structural variation","Telomere-to-Telomere Genome Sequences across a Single Genus Reveal Highly Variable Chromosome Rearrangement Rates but Absolute Stasis of Chromosome Number",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-07-13T03:05:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85133377328",,"000833608700001",,"7","Journal of Fungi","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Social bees receive the most attention, but most flower-visiting species are lesser known, non-bee insects. Nocturnal flower visitors, e.g. moths, are especially difficult to observe and largely ignored in pollination studies. Clearly, achieving balanced monitoring of all pollinator taxa represents a major scientific challenge. Here, we use time-lapse cameras for season-wide, day-And-night pollinator surveillance of Trifolium pratense (L.; red clover) in an alpine grassland. We reveal the first evidence to suggest that moths, mainly Noctua pronuba (L.; large yellow underwing), pollinate this important wildflower and forage crop, providing 34% of visits (bumblebees: 61%). This is a remarkable finding; moths have received no recognition throughout a century of T. pratense pollinator research. We conclude that despite a non-negligible frequency and duration of nocturnal flower visits, nocturnal pollinators of T. pratense have been systematically overlooked. We further show how the relationship between visitation and seed set may only become clear after accounting for moth visits. As such, population trends in moths, as well as bees, could profoundly affect T. pratense seed yield. Ultimately, camera surveillance gives fair representation to non-bee pollinators and lays a foundation for automated monitoring of species interactions in future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000560524",,"1744-9561||1744-957X",,"10.1098/rsbl.2022.0187","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/560524","en","Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","phenology||Lepidoptera||biodiversity||entomology||conservation||computer vision","Moths complement bumblebee pollination of red clover: A case for day-And-night insect surveillance",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-07-28T03:31:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Mechanisms underlying the success and impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of range-expanding species under climate change (RangeX)","193809","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","ERA-NET + EJP",,,,"85134492007",,"000840956500001","Biol.

We studied differences in δ13C and δ18O of wood among 11 forest sites (163 trees). We quantified isotope composition of 10-year bulk samples, and for a subset we also evaluated isotopic annual fluctuations for the last 10 years. Although annual isotopic variability was not correlated to precipitation or elevation, we found a significant relationship between the 10-year bulk stable-isotope composition and average precipitation and elevation. However these relationships were not consistent across all sites. We also explored isotopic site and species differentiation using Kernel Discriminant Analyses. Site discrimination was low: 30% accuracy for C. odorata, and 40% for C. fissilis sites. However, species discrimination was 57.5% for C. odorata and 95.3% for C. fissilis.

When invading these environments, bacteria are confronted with the resident microbiota. To oppose with closely related strains, they rely on narrow-spectrum weaponry such as tailocins, i.e., phage tail-like particles. Little is known about the receptors for these tailocins especially among phylogenetically closely related species. Here, we studied the interaction between an R-tailocin from Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 and a targeted kin, Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5. Using genome-wide transposon insertion sequencing, we identified that lipopolysaccharides are involved in the sensitivity of Pf-5 towards the tailocin of CHA0. By generating Pf-5 lipopolysaccharide mutants and exposing them to extracted tailocin, we specified the two O-antigenic polysaccharides (O-PS) targeted by the tailocin. We affirmed the role of these O-PS through competition assays in vitro as well as in insects. Further, we demonstrate that O-PS are double-edge swords that are responsible for the sensitivity of P. protegens towards tailocins and phages produced by their kin, but shield bacteria from the immune system of the insect. Our results shed light on the trade-off that bacteria are confronted with, where specific O-PS decorations can both be of benefit or disadvantage depending on the host environment and its bacterial inhabitants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539202",,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-022-01217-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539202","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Pivotal role of O-antigenic polysaccharide display in the sensitivity against phage tail-like particles in environmental Pseudomonas kin competition",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-03-25T06:08:51Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Towards building microbial consortia for pest control: exploring adaptation to insect hosts and intraspecific diversity of pathogenicity and competition traits in insecticidal pseudomonads","184666","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85125995697",,"000767011900001","ISME J","7","The ISME Journal","16","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These persisters can be identified phenotypically by plating on nutrient agar because of their altered growth dynamics, resulting in colony-size heterogeneity. The occurrence of within-patient bacterial phenotypic heterogeneity in various infections and clinical determinants of persister formation remains unknown.  Methods: We plated bacteria derived from 132 patient samples of difficult-to-treat infections directly on nutrient-rich agar and monitored colony growth by time-lapse imaging. We retained 36 Staphylococcus aureus monocultures for further analysis. We investigated clinical factors associated with increased colony growth-delay with regression analyses. We corroborated the clinical findings using in vitro grown static biofilms exposed to distinct antibiotics.  Results: The extent of phenotypic heterogeneity of patient-derived S. aureus varied substantially between patients (from no delay to a maximum of 57.6 hours). Increased heterogeneity coincided with increased median colony growth-delay. Multivariable regression showed that rifampicin treatment was significantly associated with increased median growth-delay (13.3 hours; 95% CI 7.13e19.6 hours; p < 0.001). S. aureus grown in biofilms and exposed to high concentrations of rifampicin or a combination of rifampicin with clindamycin or levofloxacin exhibited prolonged growth-delay (p < 0.05 for 11 of 12 comparisons), correlating with a strain-dependent increase in antibiotic tolerance.  Discussion: Colony-size heterogeneity upon direct sampling of difficult-to-treat S. aureus infections was frequently observed. Hence, future studies are needed to assess the potential benefit of phenotypic heterogeneity quantification for staphylococcal infection prognosis and treatment guidelines.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542418",,"1470-9465||1198-743X",,"10.1016/j.cmi.2022.01.021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542418","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Antibiotic tolerance||Biofilm||Phenotypic heterogeneity||Rifampicin||Staphylococcus aureus","Quantification of within-patient Staphylococcus aureus phenotypic heterogeneity as a proxy for the presence of persisters across clinical presentations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-04-14T08:30:07Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,"85125677671",,,"Clin Microbiol Infect","7","Clinical Microbiology and Infection","28","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Commercial high-resolution imagery from Planet Labs, Inc. (Planet, San Francisco, CA, USA) can be used in environmental science, as it has both high spatial (0.7-3.0 m) and temporal (1-2 day) resolution. Deriving snow-covered areas from Planet imagery using traditional radiometric techniques have limitations due to the lack of a shortwave infrared band that is needed to fully exploit the difference in reflectance to discriminate between snow and clouds. However, recent work demonstrated that snow cover area (SCA) can be successfully mapped using only the PlanetScope 4-band (Red, Green, Blue and NIR) reflectance products and a machine learning (ML) approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). To evaluate how additional features improve the existing model performance, we: (1) build on previous work to augment a CNN model with additional input data including vegetation metrics (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and DEM-derived metrics (elevation, slope and aspect) to improve SCA mapping in forested and open terrain, (2) evaluate the model performance at two geographically diverse sites (Gunnison, Colorado, USA and Engadin, Switzerland), and (3) evaluate the model performance over different land-cover types. The best augmented model used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) along with visible (red, green, and blue) and NIR bands, with an F-score of 0.89 (Gunnison) and 0.93 (Engadin) and was found to be 4% and 2% better than when using canopy height- and terrain-derived measures at Gunnison, respectively. The NDVI-based model improves not only upon the original band-only model's ability to detect snow in forests, but also across other various land-cover types (gaps and canopy edges). We examined the model's performance in forested areas using three forest canopy quantification metrics and found that augmented models can better identify snow in canopy edges and open areas but still underpredict snow cover under forest canopies. While the new features improve model performance over band-only options, the models still have challenges identifying the snow under trees in dense forests, with performance varying as a function of the geographic area. The improved high-resolution snow maps in forested environments can support studies involving climate change effects on mountain ecosystems and evaluations of hydrological impacts in snow-dominated river basins.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000562733",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs14143409","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/562733","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","PlanetScope||snow cover mapping||forests||snow||machine learning||convolutional neural networks","High-Resolution Snow-Covered Area Mapping in Forested Mountain Ecosystems Using PlanetScope Imagery",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-08-09T16:41:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85136409244",,"000832031600001","Remote Sens.","14","Remote Sensing","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Currently, 6 types of CRISPR-Cas systems are known and the molecular study of three of these has revealed important molecular differences. It is unknown if and how these molecular differences change the outcome of phage infection and the evolutionary pressure the CRISPR-Cas systems faces. To determine the importance of these molecular differences, we model a phage outbreak entering a population defending exclusively with a type I/II or a type III CRISPR-Cas system. We show that for type III CRISPR-Cas systems, rapid phage extinction is driven by the probability to acquire at least one resistance spacer. However, for type I/II CRISPR-Cas systems, rapid phage extinction is characterized by an a threshold-like behaviour: any acquisition probability below this threshold leads to phage survival whereas any acquisition probability above it, results in phage extinction. We also show that in the absence of autoimmunity, high acquisition rates evolve. However, when CRISPR-Cas systems are prone to autoimmunity, intermediate levels of acquisition are optimal during a phage outbreak. As we predict an optimal probability of spacer acquisition 2 factors of magnitude above the one that has been measured, we discuss the origin of such a discrepancy. Finally, we show that in a biologically relevant parameter range, a type III CRISPR-Cas system can outcompete a type I/II CRISPR-Cas system with a slightly higher probability of acquisition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000563600",,"1553-734X||1553-7358",,"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010329","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/563600","en","PLOS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bacteriophages||Autoimmunity||Evolutionary immunology||Bacterial evolution||Epidemiology||Species diversity||Acquired immune system||Bacterial diseases","Epidemiological and evolutionary consequences of different types of CRISPR-Cas systems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-08-15T03:12:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Infectious disease dynamics: spread along contact networks and experimental evolution of antibiotic resistance","176401","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Exzellenzbeitrag in Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85135599929",,"000952237000001","PLOS comput. biol.","7","PLoS Computational Biology","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the variability of these particles and of the environmental conditions surrounding them present a challenge to the study of the ecological processes shaping particle-associated communities and their function. In this work, we utilize data from experiments in which coastal water communities are grown on synthetic particles to ask which are the most important ecological drivers of their assembly and associated traits. Combining 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing with shotgun metagenomics, together with an analysis of the full genomes of a subset of isolated strains, we were able to identify two-to-three distinct community classes, corresponding to early vs. late colonizers. We show that these classes are shaped by environmental selection (early colonizers) and facilitation (late colonizers) and find distinctive traits associated with each class. While early colonizers have a larger proportion of genes related to the uptake of nutrients, motility, and environmental sensing with few pathways enriched for metabolism, late colonizers devote a higher proportion of genes for metabolism, comprising a wide array of different pathways including the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and xenobiotics. Analysis of selected pathways suggests the existence of a trophic-chain topology connecting both classes for nitrogen metabolism, potential exchange of branched chain amino acids for late colonizers, and differences in bacterial doubling times throughout the succession. The interpretation of these traits suggests a distinction between early and late colonizers analogous to other classifications found in the literature, and we discuss connections with the classical distinction between r- and K-strategists.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000559382",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2022.812116","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/559382","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Particulate Organic Matter (POM)||microbial assembly||neutral theory||marine bacteria||life strategies||r/K selection||ecological succession||omics","Turnover in Life-Strategies Recapitulates Marine Microbial Succession Colonizing Model Particles",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-07-22T05:11:51Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85134056476",,,"Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we report a graph pangenome of tomato constructed by precisely cataloguing more than 19 million variants from 838 genomes, including 32 new reference-level genome assemblies. This graph pangenome was used forgenome-wide association study analyses and heritability estimation of 20,323 gene-expression and metabolite traits. The average estimated trait heritability is 0.41 compared with 0.33 when using the single linear reference genome. This 24% increase in estimated heritability is largely due to resolving incomplete linkage disequilibrium through the inclusion of additional causal structural variants identified using the graph pangenome. Moreover, by resolving allelic and locus heterogeneity, structural variants improve the power to identify genetic factors underlying agronomically important traits leading to, for example, the identification of two new genes potentially contributing to soluble solid content. The newly identified structural variants will facilitate genetic improvement of tomato through both marker-assisted selection and genomic selection. Our study advances the understanding of the heritability of complex traits and demonstrates the power of the graph pangenome in crop breeding.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000553553",,"0028-0836||1476-4687",,"10.1038/s41586-022-04808-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/553553","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Agricultural genetics||Genome-wide association studies||Genomics||Plant breeding||Structural variation","Graph pangenome captures missing heritability and empowers tomato breeding",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-06-21T03:12:41Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85131514247",,"000808011000004",,"7914","Nature","606","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They spread quickly within and between waterbodies, and have the ability to colonize various substrates and depths. The zebra mussel invaded and established in Swiss lakes in the 1960s, whereas the quagga mussel was not detected until 2014. We collected all available data from cantonal as well as local authorities and other institutions to describe the colonization pattern of quagga mussels in perialpine lakes north of the Alps. We also collected data regarding the distribution of larval stages of the mussels, the so-called veliger larvae. We observed that in lakes colonized by the quagga mussel, veligers are present the whole year round, whereas they are absent in winter in lakes with only zebra mussels. Additionally, we present detailed information about the invasion and colonization pattern of quagga mussels in Lake Constance. Quagga mussels colonized the lakeshore within a few years (~ 2016–2018), outcompeted zebra mussels, and have reached densities > 5000 ind. m-2 in the littoral zone, even at 80 m densities above 1000 ind. m-2 were found at some locations.

So far, most serosurvey data have been analyzed with cutoff-based methods, which dichotomize individual measurements into sero-positives or negatives based on a predefined cutoff. However, mixture model methods can gain additional information from the same serosurvey data. Such methods refrain from dichotomizing individual values and instead use the full distribution of the serological measurements from pre-pandemic and COVID-19 controls to estimate the cumulative incidence. This study presents an application of mixture model methods to SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey data from the SEROCoV-POP study from April and May 2020 in Geneva (2766 individuals). Besides estimating the total cumulative incidence in these data (8.1% (95% CI: 6.8%–9.9%)), we applied extended mixture model methods to estimate an indirect indicator of disease severity, which is the fraction of cases with a distribution of antibody levels similar to hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This fraction is 51.2% (95% CI: 15.2%–79.5%) across the full serosurvey, but differs between three age classes: 21.4% (95% CI: 0%–59.6%) for individuals between 5 and 40 years old, 60.2% (95% CI: 21.5%–100%) for individuals between 41 and 65 years old and 100% (95% CI: 20.1%–100%) for individuals between 66 and 90 years old. Additionally, we find a mismatch between the inferred negative distribution of the serosurvey and the validation data of pre-pandemic controls. Overall, this study illustrates that mixture model methods can provide additional insights from serosurvey data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000549500",,"1878-0067||1755-4365",,"10.1016/j.epidem.2022.100572","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/549500","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Serosurvey||Mixture model methods||Sars-Cov-2||Serological assays||COVID-19","Applying mixture model methods to SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey data from Geneva",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-05-30T03:49:55Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85130341074",,"000805050100003",,,"Epidemics","39","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A global synthesis of raw seedproduction data shows a 250-fold increase in seed abundance from cold-dry to warm-wet climates, driven primarily by a 100-fold increase in seed production for a given tree size. The modest (threefold) increase in forest productivity across the same climate gradient cannot explain the magnitudes of these trends. The increase in seeds per tree can arise from adaptive evolution driven by intense species interactions or from the direct effects of a warm, moist climate on tree fecundity.

Here, we characterized starch dynamics in GCs of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants lacking enzymes of the phosphoglucose isomerase-phosphoglucose mutase-ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase starch synthesis pathway in leaf mesophyll chloroplasts or sugar transporters at the plastid membrane, such as glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocators, which are active in heterotrophic tissues. We demonstrate that GCs have metabolic features of both photo-autotrophic and heterotrophic cells. GCs make starch using different carbon precursors depending on the time of day, which can originate both from GC photosynthesis and/or sugars imported from the leaf mesophyll. Furthermore, we unravel the major enzymes involved in GC starch synthesis and demonstrate that they act in a temporal manner according to the fluctuations of stomatal aperture, which is unique for GCs. Our work substantially enhances our knowledge on GC starch metabolism and uncovers targets for manipulating GC starch dynamics to improve stomatal behavior, directly affecting plant productivity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000557073",,"0032-0889||1532-2548",,"10.1093/plphys/kiac087","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/557073","en","Oxford University Press","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Starch biosynthesis in guard cells has features of both autotrophic and heterotrophic tissues",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-07-09T11:39:05Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85131635788",,,"Plant physiol.","2","Plant Physiology","189","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As currently circumscribed, D. maritima has a wide geographic distribution in eastern Madagascar and exhibits significant morphological, ecological, and genetic variation, suggesting it may comprise more than a single entity. Multivariate analyses of leaf, flower, and inflorescence characters as well as eco-geographic features reveal several morphologically well delimited entities with distinct habitat preferences and/or geographic ranges, which are consistent with results from recent phylogenomic and population genomic studies of Malagasy Dalbergia. Based on these findings, we describe and illustrate two new species from southeastern Madagascar comprising material previously assigned to D. maritima, viz. D. pseudomaritima, characterized by paniculate inflorescences and small, broadly elliptic to orbicular, glabrous leaflets, and D. razakamalalae, distinguished by racemose inflorescences with large flowers, and narrowly ovate to narrowly elliptic, glabrous leaflets. Dalbergia maritima is consequently re-circumscribed to include only populations from east-central Madagascar, within which we recognize two subspecies, D. maritima subsp. maritima, with glabrous leaves, inflorescence axes, and gynoecia, occurring in littoral forest habitats, and D. maritima subsp. pubescens, with indument on these structures, and growing in evergreen humid forest farther inland. Photos are provided for each taxon, along with line drawings for the two new species. Provisional IUCN Red List assessments indicate that all three species are Endangered, D. maritima and D. razakamalalae mainly because of selective logging for trade in their high-quality heartwood, and D. pseudomaritima primarily because of habitat degradation due to land clearing and fire for subsistence agriculture, which has important implications for their conservation and sustainable management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000555931",,"0363-6445||1548-2324",,"10.1600/036364422X16512564801614","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/555931","en","American Society of Plant Taxonomists","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bois de rose||IUCN Red List||Leguminosae||multivariate analyses||Volombodipony","Taxonomic Studies on Malagasy Dalbergia (Fabaceae).

Warming is also causing species to expand their ranges into new ecosystems. Yet, in most ecosystems, whether range expanding species will amplify or buffer expected soil carbon loss is unknown. Here, we used two whole-community transplant experiments and a follow-up glasshouse experiment to determine whether the establishment of herbaceous lowland plants in alpine ecosystems influences soil carbon content under warming. We found that warming (transplantation to low elevation) led to a negligible decrease in alpine soil carbon content, but its effects became significant and 52% ± 31% (mean ± 95% confidence intervals) larger after lowland plants were introduced at low density into the ecosystem. We present evidence that decreases in soil carbon content likely occurred via lowland plants increasing rates of root exudation, soil microbial respiration, and CO2 release under warming. Our findings suggest that warming-induced range expansions of herbaceous plants have the potential to alter climate feedbacks from this system, and that plant range expansions among herbaceous communities may be an overlooked mediator of warming effects on carbon dynamics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000554677",,"2050-084X",,"10.7554/eLife.78555","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/554677","en","eLife Sciences Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","carbon cycling||climate change||plant ecophysiology||plant redistributions||plant-soil interactions||soil microbes||Other","Lowland plant arrival in alpine ecosystems facilitates a decrease in soil carbon content under experimental climate warming",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-06-26T02:57:11Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Novel`interactions and species’ responses to climate change||Timescales of changing species interactions under warming climate||Ecological consequences of novel plant-soil interactions under changing climate","678841||173210||176044","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF||SNF","H2020||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85131177612",,"000811318000001",,,"eLife","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A synthesis of fecundity data from 714 species worldwide allowed us to examine hypotheses that are central to quantifying reproduction, a foundation for assessing fitness in forest trees. Four major findings emerged. First, seed production is not constrained by a strict trade-off between seed size and numbers. Instead, seed numbers vary over ten orders of magnitude, with species that invest in large seeds producing more seeds than expected from the 1:1 trade-off. Second, gymnosperms have lower seed production than angiosperms, potentially due to their extra investments in protective woody cones. Third, nutrient-demanding species, indicated by high foliar phosphorus concentrations, have low seed production. Finally, sensitivity of individual species to soil fertility varies widely, limiting the response of community seed production to fertility gradients. In combination, these findings can inform models of forest response that need to incorporate reproductive potential.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000547198",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-022-30037-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/547198","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Limits to reproduction and seed size-number trade-offs that shape forest dominance and future recovery",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-05-14T03:55:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85129342208",,"000789924700024","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite their known importance, they have been overlooked in recent years with work on drought refugia currently seeing greater attention. Moreover, research on the role of flow refugia during artificial flood pulses in regulated rivers, where flood disturbances are no longer part of the hydrograph, is essentially absent. Here, we compared flow refugia for benthic macroinvertebrates among six habitats (main channel, side channel, riffle, margin, lentic including a floodplain pond, and inundated floodplain) within four different sites in response to an artificial flood pulse. We found that the grain-size distribution and macroinvertebrate community composition changed at each site following the flood. Macroinvertebrate assemblages became longitudinally homogeneous, but within-site beta diversity and taxa richness remained temporally stable following the flood pulse, suggesting the presence of flow refugia. In this respect, margin, inundated floodplain and lentic (a floodplain pond) habitats provided important flow refugia locations, particularly for the mobile mayfly Rhithrogena sp. In contrast, low substrate stability in riffle and side channels resulted in limited refugia potential for most taxa. Refuge use was however patchy with high levels of intra-habitat variability being evident for Rhithrogena sp. and the amphipod Gammarus fossarum in margin and side channel habitats. Further work is required to advance our knowledge of flow refugia in rivers with differing flow regimes to enable their integration into management and restoration schemes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000530412",,"1535-1459||1535-1467","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587495||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/530412","10.1002/rra.3941","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587722","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","benthic macroinvertebrates||experimental flood||habitat diversity||patchiness||stability","Patchiness in flow refugia use by macroinvertebrates following an artificial flood pulse",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-02-02T04:04:38Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85122934601",,"000744327200001","River Res.

If aquatic macroinvertebrate communities largely comprise taxa adapted to perennial flows, an increase in flow intermittency substantially reduces biodiversity and affects functional processes. We conducted a before-after-control-impact field experiment to examine how macroinvertebrate communities in an alpine headwater stream responded to and recovered from a repeated experimental increase in flow intermittency. Flow in one channel was manipulated to simulate increased summer intermittency (June-September) over two consecutive years, whilst an adjacent channel served as a control. We monitored the density of benthic macroinvertebrates, periphyton and organic matter at approximately monthly intervals over three years during the snow-free period. Before manipulation, both channels had similar ecological properties. The flow manipulation reduced the overall macroinvertebrate density, and especially the proportional rheophile density, across both years. Recovery of the macroinvertebrate community following experimental flow intermittency took more than a year, and longer than our study period. This could be due to long aquatic life stages, dispersal limitation and biotic interactions. We conclude that climate-induced changes in alpine stream flow regimes can lead to a fundamental shift in macroinvertebrate assemblages through local extinctions, mostly of rheophilic species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542512",,"0018-8158||1573-5117","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587486||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542512","10.1007/s10750-022-04843-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587756","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Glacial||Biodiversity||Intermittent rivers||Ephemeral streams||Rheophilic","Long-lasting effects of experimental flow intermittency on alpine stream macroinvertebrates (Val Roseg, Switzerland)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-04-15T08:16:15Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85127347202",,"000774611900001","Hydrobiologia","8","Hydrobiologia","849","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, high-altitude streams also exhibit varying degrees of flow intermittency, ranging from solely winter-drying streams to others that dry periodically throughout summer and autumn. These environmental drivers may interact in different ways to determine the functional trophic base of macroinvertebrates inhabiting high-altitude streams. Here, we estimated the proportional contribution of autochthonous resources to the assimilated diets of benthic macroinvertebrates in 26 headwater streams of Val Roseg, a high Alpine glacial catchment, using stable isotope analysis (δ13C and δ15N) of different macroinvertebrate families and their potential food sources. We compared dietary estimates along a gradient of flow intermittency and across three seasons (Alpine spring, summer, and autumn). Assimilation from autochthonous sources was highest for collector-gatherers and filter feeders in spring, and for grazers in summer. Grazers had higher estimated assimilation from autochthonous sources in intermittent streams than in perennial streams, particularly in summer, while collector-gatherers showed little effect of flow intermittency on dietary estimates. However, responses were highly taxon-specific, with different responses to variation in flow intermittency and season across families within functional groups. Our results suggest that frequent summer-drying events represent tradeoffs between greater access to algal food resources and a higher risk of desiccation, but that differing life history and functional feeding traits across macroinvertebrate taxa drive marked variation in the risks or benefits associated with inhabitants of drying streams.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000537920",,"0024-3590||1939-5590","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587505||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/537920","10.1002/lno.12059","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587773","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Seasonal and functional variation in the trophic base of intermittent Alpine streams",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-03-19T04:07:24Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85125627396",,"000765294300001","Limnol. oceanogr.","5","Limnology and Oceanography","67","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These climatic grids do not reflect conditions below vegetation canopies and near the ground surface, where critical ecosystem functions occur and most terrestrial species reside. Here, we provide global maps of soil temperature and bioclimatic variables at a 1-km² resolution for 0–5 and 5–15 cm soil depth. These maps were created by calculating the difference (i.e., offset) between in-situ soil temperature measurements, based on time series from over 1200 1-km² pixels (summarized from 8500 unique temperature sensors) across all the world’s major terrestrial biomes, and coarse-grained air temperature estimates from ERA5-Land (an atmospheric reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). We show that mean annual soil temperature differs markedly from the corresponding gridded air temperature, by up to 10°C (mean = 3.0 ± 2.1°C), with substantial variation across biomes and seasons. Over the year, soils in cold and/or dry biomes are substantially warmer (+3.6 ± 2.3°C) than gridded air temperature, whereas soils in warm and humid environments are on average slightly cooler (-0.7 ± 2.3°C). The observed substantial and biome-specific offsets emphasize that the projected impacts of climate and climate change on near-surface biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are inaccurately assessed when air rather than soil temperature is used, especially in cold environments. The global soil-related bioclimatic variables provided here are an important step forward for any application in ecology and related disciplines. Nevertheless, we highlight the need to fill remaining geographic gaps by collecting more in-situ measurements of microclimate conditions to further enhance the spatiotemporal resolution of global soil temperature products for ecological applications.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523670",,"1354-1013||1365-2486",,"10.1111/gcb.16060","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523670","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","Bioclimatic variables||global maps||microclimate||near-surface temperatures||soil temperature||soil-dwelling organisms||temperature offset||weather stations","Global maps of soil temperature",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-06T14:13:49Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Robust models for assessing the effectiveness of technologies and managements to reduce N2O emissions from grazed pastures (Models4Pastures)||ICOS-CH: Integrated Carbon Observation System in Switzerland||ICOS-CH Phase 2||Reconciling innovative farming practices and networks to enable sustainable development of smart Swiss farming systems||Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies","154245||148992||173691||172433||774124","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||EC","FACCE-JPI||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Forschungsinfrastrukturen||NFP 73: Gesuch||H2020",,,,"85123931737",,"000753944300001","Glob.

Differences in growth rate, e.g. induced by sub-lethal antibiotic concentrations or temperature, can also significantly bias conjugation rate estimates. We derive a new ‘end-point’ measure to estimate conjugation rates, which extends the well-known Simonsen method to include the effects of differences in population growth and conjugation rates from donors and transconjugants. We further derive analytical expressions for the parameter range in which these approximations remain valid. We present an easy to use R package and web interface which implement both new and previously existing methods to estimate conjugation rates.

Conservation and establishment of sustainable management rely on viable taxonomy and correct species identification, whether to assess species diversity, to identify population trends, or to verify timber identity declarations. Species identification of Dalbergia is particularly challenging in Madagascar due to a large number of similar species and reliance on flowers and fruits for identification, which are often absent on living specimens. We used recently collected DNA material of Malagasy Dalbergia species in combination with older herbarium specimens (including types) to ascertain whether species can be delimited using a phylogenomics approach based on target enrichment of thousands of nuclear genetic loci. All except two species could be assigned to two genetic supergroups of Malagasy taxa that show pronounced differences in flower and fruit characters. We further identified eleven well-supported clades within those supergroups, most of which are clearly associated with different eco-geographic regions of Madagascar. Each clade contains several described species, each of which can be distinguished using our target enrichment approach, but not with traditional DNA barcoding. Results further indicate that several infraspecific and synonymous taxa recognized in the most recent revision of the group are genetically, eco-geographically and morphologically distinct, and should be elevated to the rank of species. Moreover, DNA sequence results and morphology strongly support the recognition of over twenty new Malagasy Dalbergia species, the majority of which produce large trees. Our results demonstrate that the current taxonomy of Malagasy Dalbergia does not adequately account for the level and patterns of species diversity observed, and they provide insights that are highly informative for a taxonomic revision being conducted on this important genus, which is essential for the development of forensic timber identification strategies that depend on correctly identified reference collections.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/560729","en","AETFAT",,,"Dalbergia (botany)||Madagascar (African Islands)||Republic of Madagascar||Species delimitation||Phylogenomics||Integrative Analysis||Conservation","An Integrative Phylogenomic Approach to Species Delimitation in the Taxonomically Challenging Precious Woods Genus Dalbergia (Fabaceae)",,"Other Conference Item","Metadata only","Diversity and conservation of African plants: challenges and opportunities: 22nd AETFAT Congress Abstracts",,,,"2022-07-28T20:23:32Z",,,,"yes","22nd AETFAT Conference (AETFAT 2022)","June 27 - July 1, 2022","Livingstone, Zambia",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Building on concepts from community ecology and evolutionary biology, we review how biotic interactions can influence adaptation at range limits by impeding the demographic conditions that facilitate evolution (which we term a ‘demographic pathway to adaptation’), and/or by imposing evolutionary trade-offs with the abiotic environment (a ‘trade-offs pathway’). While theory for the former is well-developed, theory for the trade-offs pathway is not, and empirical evidence is scarce for both. Therefore, we develop a model to illustrate how fitness trade-offs along biotic and abiotic gradients could affect the potential for range expansion and niche evolution following ecological release. The model shows that which genotypes are favoured at species' range edges can depend strongly on the biotic context and the nature of fitness trade-offs. Experiments that characterize trade-offs and properly account for biotic context are needed to predict which species will expand their niche or range in response to environmental change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000534839",,"0962-8436||1471-2970||0080-4622",,"10.1098/rstb.2021.0020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/534839","en","Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ecological release||local adaptation||biotic interactions||range limits||niche expansion||trade-offs","Effects of species interactions on the potential for evolution at species' range limits",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-03-02T04:34:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Novel`interactions and species’ responses to climate change","678841","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85125005476",,"000758140300011","Phil.

Notably, different species may respond disparately to similar environmental changes: some species may overcome an environmental change only with difficulty or not at all, while other species may readily overcome the same change. Ranges may contract, expand or move. The drivers and consequences of this variability in species' responses remain puzzling. Importantly, changes in a species' range creates feedbacks to the environmental conditions, populations and communities in its previous and current range, rendering population genetic, population dynamic and community processes inextricably linked. Understanding these links is critical in guiding biodiversity management and conservation efforts. This theme issue presents current thinking about the factors and mechanisms that limit and/or modify species' ranges. It also outlines different approaches to detect changes in species' distributions, and illustrates cases of range modifications in several taxa. Overall, this theme issue highlights the urgency of understanding species' ranges but shows that we are only just beginning to disentangle the processes involved. One way forward is to unite ecology with evolutionary biology and empirical with modelling approaches.

A multitude of hypotheses have been generated trying to explain the underlying mechanisms, many of which require a latitudinal gradient in niche breadth. This study investigates if a latitudinal gradient in niche breadth and/or geographic extent is globally present and if it can explain global species richness patterns for two plant groups. A negative relationship between niche breadth and species richness is detected across all terrestrial biomes. Further, a latitudinal gradient of decreasing niche breadth towards the equator is found for the herbaceous plant group while a more complex gradient is found for the tree group. For both plant groups a global latitudinal gradient in geographic extent increasing from South to North could be identified. This study confirms that niche breadth and species’ geographic extent are linked, however, niche breadth is identified as being a better predictor for species richness, given the geographic limitations to dispersal to which a species’ geographic extent is subjected.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000570595",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/570595","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Latitudinal gradient||Species distribution modelling||Niche breadth||Rapoport's rule","Explaining species richness: latitudinal gradient in niche breadth",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,,"2022-09-14T09:42:16Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, fully realizing this potential will require improved understanding of the specific ways in which microbes influence plant ecology, which are both more complex and less well studied than the direct effects of microbes on host-plant physiology. Microbial effects on mutualistic and antagonistic interactions between plants and insects are of particular interest in this regard. This study examines the effects of two strains of Pseudomonas rhizobacteria on the direct and indirect (predator-mediated) resistance of tomato plants to a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera littoralis) and associated changes in levels of defense compounds. We observed no significant effects of rhizobacteria inoculation on caterpillar weight, suggesting that rhizobacteria did not influence direct resistance. However, the generalist predator Podisus maculiventris avoided plants inoculated with one of our rhizobacteria strains, Pseudomonas simiae. Consistent with these results, we found that inoculation with P. simiae influenced plant volatile emissions, but not levels of defense-related compounds. These findings show that rhizobacteria can negatively affect the attraction of generalist predators, while highlighting the complexity and context dependence of microbial effects on plant–insect interactions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542349",,"2223-7747",,"10.3390/plants11070920","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542349","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","direct resistance||Indirect resistance||Pseudomonas||Spodoptera littoralis||Podisus maculiventris||Tomato plants||Plant volatiles","Negative Effects of Rhizobacteria Association on Plant Recruitment of Generalist Predators",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-04-14T02:55:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85127409008",,"000781618000001",,"7","Plants","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In forests with both wet and dry seasons, evergreen trees would benefit from producing leaves capable of balancing rainy-season photosynthesis with summertime water absorption.  Methods Using samples collected from across the vertical gradient in tall redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) crowns, we estimated tree-level foliar water uptake and employed physics-based causative modeling to identify key functional traits that determine uptake potential by setting hydraulic resistance.  Results We showed that Sequoia has two functionally distinct shoot morphotypes. While most shoots specialize in photosynthesis, the axial shoot type is capable of much greater foliar water uptake, and its within-crown distribution varies with latitude. A suite of leaf surface traits cause hydraulic resistance, leading to variation in uptake capacity among samples.  Conclusions Shoot dimorphism gives tall Sequoia trees the capacity to absorb up to 48 kg H2O h−1 during the first hour of leaf wetting, ameliorating water stress while presumably maintaining high photosynthetic capacity year round. Geographic variation in shoot dimorphism suggests that plasticity in shoot-type distribution and leaf surface traits helps Sequoia maintain a dominate presence in both wet and dry forests.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000543773",,"1914-2016:||0002-9122",,"10.1002/ajb2.1841","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/543773","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Cupressaceae||foliar water uptake||heteroblasty||hydraulic resistance||redwood||Sequoia||structural equation model||traits","Shoot dimorphism enables Sequoia sempervirens to separate requirements for foliar water uptake and photosynthesis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-04-26T05:07:44Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85128088605",,"000782157900001","Am.

These infections are asymptomatic during vegetative host growth, with associations between asexual Epichloe spp. and their hosts considered mutualistic. However, the sexual cycle of Epichloe spp. involves virulent growth, characterized by the envelopment and sterilization of a developing host inflorescence by a dense sheath of mycelia known as a stroma. Microscopic analysis of stromata revealed a dramatic increase in hyphal propagation and host degradation compared with asymptomatic tissues. RNAseq was used to identify differentially expressed genes in asymptomatic vs stromatized tissues from 3 diverse Epichloe-host associations. Comparative analysis identified a core set of 135 differentially expressed genes that exhibited conserved transcriptional changes across all 3 associations. The core differentially expressed genes more strongly expressed during virulent growth encode proteins associated with host suppression, digestion, adaptation to the external environment, a biosynthetic gene cluster, and 5 transcription factors that may regulate Epichloe stroma formation. An additional 5 transcription factor encoding differentially expressed genes were suppressed during virulent growth, suggesting they regulate mutualistic processes. Expression of biosynthetic gene clusters for natural products that suppress herbivory was universally suppressed during virulent growth, and additional biosynthetic gene clusters that may encode production of novel host-protective natural products were identified. A comparative analysis of 26 Epichloe genomes found a general decrease in core differentially expressed gene conservation among asexual species, and a specific decrease in conservation for the biosynthetic gene cluster expressed during virulent growth and an unusual uncharacterized gene.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539659",,"2160-1836",,"10.1093/g3journal/jkac043","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539659","en","Genetics Society of America","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Epichloë||stroma||mutalism||virulence||plant-fungal interactions||RNAseq","Cross-species transcriptomics identifies core regulatory changes differentiating the asymptomatic asexual and virulent sexual life cycles of grass-symbiotic Epichloë fungi",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-03-29T03:25:50Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85128606354",,"000769668300001","G3","4","G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In response to nutrient depletion, cells of the soil-dwelling δ-proteobacterium Myxococcus xanthus undergo collective morphogenesis into multicellular fruiting bodies and transform into stress-resistant spores. This process is strictly regulated by gene networks that incorporate both inter- and intracellular signals. While commonly studied M. xanthus reference strains and some natural isolates undergo development only in nutrient-poor conditions, some lab mutants and other natural isolates commit to development at much higher nutrient levels, but mechanisms enabling such rich medium development remain elusive. Here we investigate the genetic basis of rich medium development in one mutant and find that a single amino acid change (S534L) in RpoB, the β-subunit of RNA polymerase, is responsible for the phenotype. Ectopic expression of the mutant rpoB allele was sufficient to induce nutrient-rich development. These results suggest that the universal bacterial transcription machinery bearing the altered β-subunit can relax regulation of developmental genes that are normally strictly controlled by the bacterial stringent response. Moreover, the mutation also pleiotropically mediates a tradeoff in fitness during vegetative growth between high vs. low nutrient conditions and generates resistance to exploitation by a developmental cheater. Our findings reveal a previously unknown connection between the universal transcription machinery and one of the most behaviorally complex responses to environmental stress found among bacteria.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542335",,"1664-302X",,"10.3389/fmicb.2022.817080","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542335","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","pleiotropy||stringent response||development||nutrient sensing||rpoB","Mutation of rpoB Shifts the Nutrient Threshold Triggering Myxococcus Multicellular Development",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-04-14T02:54:59Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85127551351",,"000798973800001","Front Microbiol",,"Frontiers in Microbiology","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This protection can differ between different symbiont strains with each strain providing protection against certain components of the parasite and pathogen community their host faces. Protective symbionts are especially well known from aphids where, among other functions, they provide protection against different parasitoid wasps. However, most of the evidence for this protection comes from laboratory experiments. Our aim was to understand how consistent protection is across different symbiont strains under natural field conditions and whether symbiont diversity enhanced the species diversity of colonizing parasitoids, as could be expected from the specificity of their protection. We used experimental colonies of the black bean aphid Aphis fabae to investigate symbiont-conferred protection under natural field conditions over two seasons. Colonies differed only in their symbiont composition, carrying either no symbionts, a single strain of the protective symbiont Hamiltonella defensa, or a mixture of three H. defensa strains. These aphid colonies were exposed to natural parasitoid communities in the field. Subsequently, we determined the parasitoids hatched from each aphid colony. The evidence for a protective effect of H. defensa was limited and inconsistent between years, and aphid colonies harbouring multiple symbiont strains did not support a more diverse parasitoid community. Instead, parasitoid diversity tended to be highest in the absence of H. defensa. Symbiont-conferred protection, although a strong and repeatable effect under laboratory conditions may not always cause the predicted bottom-up effects under natural conditions in the field.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000527369",,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587497||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/527369","10.1111/1365-2656.13650","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587719","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","aphids||bottom-up effects||defensive symbiosis||diversity||field experiment||food web||parasitoid wasps||specificity","Bottom-up effect of host protective symbionts on parasitoid diversity: Limited evidence from two field experiments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-21T04:31:06Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85122764268",,"000742866700001",,"3",,"91","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

When decomposing low-nutrient plant litter, microbes acquire nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the environment (i.e., nutrient immobilization), and this process is potentially sensitive to nutrient loading and changing climate. Nonetheless, environmental controls on immobilization are poorly understood because rates are also influenced by plant litter chemistry, which is coupled to the same environmental factors. Here we used a standardized, low-nutrient organic matter substrate (cotton strips) to quantify nutrient immobilization at 100 paired stream and riparian sites representing 11 biomes worldwide. Immobilization rates varied by three orders of magnitude, were greater in rivers than riparian zones, and were strongly correlated to decomposition rates. In rivers, P immobilization rates were controlled by surface water phosphate concentrations, but N immobilization rates were not related to inorganic N. The N:P of immobilized nutrients was tightly constrained to a molar ratio of 10:1 despite wide variation in surface water N:P. Immobilization rates were temperature-dependent in riparian zones but not related to temperature in rivers. However, in rivers nutrient supply ultimately controlled whether microbes could achieve the maximum expected decomposition rate at a given temperature. Collectively, we demonstrated that exogenous nutrient supply and immobilization are critical control points for decomposition of organic matter.",,,,"0886-6236||1944-9224",,"https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GB007163","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587485","en","American Geophysical Union",,,"nutrient cycling||cotton strip assay||nitrogen||phosphorus||ecological stoichiometry||organic matter","Global Patterns and Controls of Nutrient Immobilization on Decomposing Cellulose in Riverine Ecosystems",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2022-12-15T15:15:07Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Glob. biogeochem. cycles","3","Global Biogeochemical Cycles","36","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, the total mercury content was measured in bottom sediments, benthic macroinvertebrates (mayfly larvae), and fish (Siberian dace) along the Boroo River in northern Mongolia. There was a gold recovery plant in the middle reaches of the river until the mid-twentieth century; an accident there in the 1950s caused a mercury spill. We found an increased content of mercury in measured ecosystem components near the plant compared to the upper reaches of the river. The mercury content in sediments varied from trace amounts in the upper Boroo to 2200 ng/g dry weight (dw) in the vicinity of the plant ruins. The mercury content in mayfly larvae ranged from 50 to 2940 ng/g dw and had a spatial pattern as sediments, with the highest concentrations near the plant. The mercury content in sediments was lower at the mouth of the Boroo River than near the plant, reflecting the lower boundary of the mercury spill. Maximum values of mercury content in fish muscle were found at the river's mouth and were several times higher than in other rivers of northern Mongolia. Median mercury content in muscles of dace from the lower Boroo in 2016 has doubled since studies in 2010-2012, which may be the result of current mercury releases from gold mining.",,,,"0963-9292||1573-3017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587508||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524668","10.1007/s10646-021-02502-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587778","en","Springer",,,"Bottom sediments||Mayflies||SIBERIAN dace||Artisanal small gold mines","Mercury levels in sediment, fish and macroinvertebrates of the Boroo River, northern Mongolia, under the legacy of gold mining",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2022-01-12T03:56:51Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85122360485",,"000739256900001","Ecotoxicol.

Expression profiles for most BGCs show comparable patterns of regulation among the isolates, suggesting a conserved biochemical infection program. For all three isolates, we observed a strong upregulation of a putative abscisic acid (ABA) gene cluster during biotrophic host colonization, indicating that Z. tritici interferes with host defenses by the biosynthesis of this phytohormone. Further, during in vitro growth, the isolates show similar metabolomes congruent with the predicted BGC content. We assessed if secondary metabolite production is regulated by histone methylation using a mutant impaired in formation of facultative heterochromatin (H3K27me3). In contrast to other ascomycete fungi, chromatin modifications play a less prominent role in regulation of secondary metabolites. In summary, we show that Z. tritici has a conserved program of secondary metabolite production, contrasting with the immense variation in effector expression, and some of these metabolites might play a key role during host colonization.",,,,"0099-2240||1098-5336",,"10.1128/aem.02296-21","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/591923","en","American Society for Microbiology",,,"genome evolution||gene clusters||gene regulation||chemodiversity||histone modifications||pathogenicity||metabolomics||feature-based molecular network","Differential Regulation and Production of Secondary Metabolites among Isolates of the Fungal Wheat Pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2023-01-12T09:55:22Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Appl.

An experimental investigation is performed using an advanced Temperature Stress Testing Machine to illustrate this approach and an in-depth assessment of Tz is presented. The proposed approach allows to determine the continuous Tz profile in concrete subjected to any arbitrary temperature profile, compared to existing methods that can identify only discrete points.

However, efforts to use these genomes for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance have thus far been limited and geographically heterogeneous. We inferred global resistance trends in Escherichia coli in food animals using genomes from public databases.  Methods We retrieved 7632 E. coli genomes from public databases (NCBI, PATRIC and EnteroBase) and screened for antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) using ResFinder. Selection bias towards resistance, virulence or specific strains was accounted for by screening BioProject descriptions. Temporal trends for MDR, resistance to antimicrobial classes and ARG prevalence were inferred using generalized linear models for all genomes, including those not subjected to selection bias.  Results MDR increased by 1.6 times between 1980 and 2018, as genomes carried, on average, ARGs conferring resistance to 2.65 antimicrobials in swine, 2.22 in poultry and 1.58 in bovines. Highest resistance levels were observed for tetracyclines (42.2%–69.1%), penicillins (19.4%–47.5%) and streptomycin (28.6%–56.6%). Resistance trends were consistent after accounting for selection bias, although lower mean absolute resistance estimates were associated with genomes not subjected to selection bias (difference of 3.16%±3.58% across years, hosts and antimicrobial classes). We observed an increase in extended-spectrum cephalosporin ARG blaCMY-2 and a progressive substitution of tetB by tetA. Estimates of resistance prevalence inferred from genomes in the public domain were in good agreement with reports from systematic phenotypic surveillance.

Resistance may occur in an area because treated infections mutated and developed resistance, and the proportion of infections in a population may then increase. We developed a novel and flexible model that captures several features of resistance dynamics and competition. The model is able to account for many antimicrobials and thus can generally explore competition dynamics and their impact on pathogens and bacteria. Unlike simpler models, our nested model allows the population of resistant pathogen to smoothly increase or decrease. Time dependent dynamics are incorporated into difference equations which examines the effects of 12 parameters. This enables us to explicitly include three key competition dynamics: the transmission cost of resistance that occurs between hosts, the fitness cost of resistance that occurs within untreated hosts, and the release of this competition (from the fitness cost) that occurs once a host is treated. For malaria, our results suggest that without competitive release, drug resistance does not emerge.

These increases should lead to rapid changes in ecological distribution, thereby affecting the costs and benefits of multicellularity and its likelihood to evolve. However, how genetic and cellular traits control this process, their likelihood of emergence over evolutionary timescales, and the variation in these traits as multicellularity evolves are still poorly understood. Here, using isolates of the ichthyosporean genus Sphaeroforma-close unicellular relatives of animals with brief transient multicellular life stages-we demonstrate that sedimentation rate is a highly variable and evolvable trait affected by at least 2 distinct physical mechanisms. First, we find extensive (>300×) variation in sedimentation rates for different Sphaeroforma species, mainly driven by size and density during the unicellular-to-multicellular life cycle transition. Second, using experimental evolution with sedimentation rate as a focal trait, we readily obtained, for the first time, fast settling and multicellular Sphaeroforma arctica isolates. Quantitative microscopy showed that increased sedimentation rates most often arose by incomplete cellular separation after cell division, leading to clonal ""clumping"" multicellular variants with increased size and density. Strikingly, density increases also arose by an acceleration of the nuclear doubling time relative to cell size. Similar size- and density-affecting phenotypes were observed in 4 additional species from the Sphaeroforma genus, suggesting that variation in these traits might be widespread in the marine habitat. By resequencing evolved isolates to high genomic coverage, we identified mutations in regulators of cytokinesis, plasma membrane remodeling, and chromatin condensation that may contribute to both clump formation and the increase in the nuclear number-to-volume ratio. Taken together, this study illustrates how extensive cellular control of density and size drive sedimentation rate variation, likely shaping the onset and further evolution of multicellularity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000541792",,"1544-9173||1545-7885",,"10.1371/journal.pbio.3001551","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/541792","en","PLOS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Sedimentation||Life cycles||Cell cycle and cell division||Genomics||Cloning||Evolutionary genetics||Phenotypes||Cell membranes","Regulation of sedimentation rate shapes the evolution of multicellularity in a close unicellular relative of animals",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-04-10T05:50:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85127291570",,"000778633200001","PLoS biol.","3","PLoS Biology","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The genomic plasticity of this hospital-adapted pathogen contributes to its efficient spread despite infection control measures. Here, we aimed to identify the genomic and phenotypic determinants of health care-associated transmission of VREfm. We assessed the VREfm transmission networks at the tertiary-care University Hospital of Zurich (USZ) between October 2014 and February 2018 and investigated microevolutionary dynamics of this pathogen. We performed whole-genome sequencing for the 69 VREfm isolates collected during this time frame and assessed the population structure and variability of the vancomycin resistance transposon. Phylogenomic analysis allowed us to reconstruct transmission networks and to unveil external or wider transmission networks undetectable by routine surveillance. Notably, it unveiled a persistent clone, sampled 31 times over a 29-month period. Exploring the evolutionary dynamics of this clone and characterizing the phenotypic consequences revealed the spread of a variant with decreased daptomycin susceptibility and the acquired ability to utilize N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc), one of the primary constituents of the human gut mucins. This nutrient utilization advantage was conferred by a novel plasmid, termed pELF_USZ, which exhibited a linear topology. This plasmid, which was harbored by two distinct clones, was transferable by conjugation. Overall, this work highlights the potential of combining epidemiological, functional genomic, and evolutionary perspectives to unveil adaptation strategies of VREfm.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000542415",,"2150-7511||2161-2129",,"10.1128/mbio.03771-21","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/542415","en","American Society for Microbiology","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Enterococcus faecium||transmission networks||linear plasmid||N-acetyl-galactosamine||horizontal gene transfer","Genomic Surveillance of Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus faecium Reveals Spread of a Linear Plasmid Conferring a Nutrient Utilization Advantage",,"Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-04-14T08:25:29Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,"110680932",,,,,,"2","mBio","132","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We found that adding lysate prepared from dead bacteria to cultures of Escherichia coli in nutrient-rich conditions suppressed their final population density. This is in stark contrast with the notion that the primary role of dead cells is nutritional, although we also observed this type of effect when we added dead bacteria to cultures that were not supplied with other nutrients. We only observed the growth-suppressive effect of our dead-bacteria treatment after they had undergone significant lysis, suggesting a key role for cellular contents released during lysis. Transcriptomic analysis indicated changes in gene expression in response to dead cells in growing populations, particularly in genes involved in motility. This was supported by experiments with genetic knockouts and copy-number manipulation.

The different phenologies, lifestyles, and natural enemies of aphid species are predicted to favor the selection for distinct endosymbiont assemblages, as well as the emergence of intra-specific genetic diversity in the symbiotic bacteria. In this study, we (1) investigated the diversity of endosymbionts associated with four species from the genus Aphis in the field, and (2) we characterized the genetic diversity of Hamiltonella defensa, an endosymbiont that protects aphids against parasitoid wasps. We observed strong differences in the composition of endosymbiont communities among the four aphid species. H. defensa was clearly the dominant symbiont, although its abundance in each species varied from 25 to 96%. Using a multilocus sequence-typing approach, we found limited strain diversity in H. defensa. Each aphid species harbored two major strains, and none appeared shared between species. Symbiont phylogenies can thus help to understand the (seemingly limited) mobility of endosymbionts in aphid communities and the selection forces driving strain diversification.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000539825",,"2296-701X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587492||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/539825","10.3389/fevo.2022.816184","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587741","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","defensive symbiosis||Hamiltonella defensa||strain diversity||symbiont diversity||parasitoid wasps","Gated Communities: Inter- and Intraspecific Diversity of Endosymbionts Across Four Sympatric Aphid Species",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-03-30T03:09:48Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000770988000001","Front. ecol. evol.",,"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This mode of adaptation can be characterized quantitatively by a spectrum of adaptive substitutions, i.e., a distribution for types of changes fixed in adaptation. Recent work establishes that the changes involved in adaptation reflect common types of mutations, raising the question of how strongly the mutation spectrum shapes the spectrum of adaptive substitutions. We address this question with a codon-based model for the spectrum of adaptive amino acid substitutions, applied to three large datasets covering thousands of amino acid changes identified in natural and experimental adaptation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Using species-specific mutation spectra based on prior knowledge, we find that the mutation spectrum has a proportional influence on the spectrum of adaptive substitutions in all three species. Indeed, we find that by inferring the mutation rates that best explain the spectrum of adaptive substitutions, we can accurately recover the species-specific mutation spectra. However, we also find that the predictive power of the model differs substantially between the three species. To better understand these differences, we use population simulations to explore the factors that influence how closely the spectrum of adaptive substitutions mirrors the mutation spectrum. The results show that the influence of the mutation spectrum decreases with increasing mutational supply ([Formula: see text]) and that predictive power is strongly affected by the number and diversity of beneficial mutations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000533324",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2119720119","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/533324","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","mutation bias||adaptation||proteins||molecular evolution||population genetics","Mutation bias shapes the spectrum of adaptive substitutions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-02-19T05:49:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Regulatory logic and the evolution of promoter complexity||The deformability of empirical genotype-phenotype landscapes","170604||192541","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85124499623",,"000766915500012","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","7","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","119","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The protocol is frequently followed after an individual presents with disease symptoms, at which point they will be tested for the pathogen. This TTIQ strategy, along with hygiene and social distancing measures, make up the non-pharmaceutical interventions that are utilised to suppress the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here we develop a tractable mathematical model of disease transmission and the TTIQ intervention to quantify how the probability of detecting and isolating a case following symptom onset, the fraction of contacts that are identified and quarantined, and the delays inherent to these processes impact epidemic growth. In the model, the timing of disease transmission and symptom onset, as well as the frequency of asymptomatic cases, is based on empirical distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics, while the isolation of confirmed cases and quarantine of their contacts is implemented by truncating their respective infectious periods. We find that a successful TTIQ strategy requires intensive testing: the majority of transmission is prevented by isolating symptomatic individuals and doing so in a short amount of time. Despite the lesser impact, additional contact tracing and quarantine increases the parameter space in which an epidemic is controllable and is necessary to control epidemics with a high reproductive number. TTIQ could remain an important intervention for the foreseeable future of the COVID-19 pandemic due to slow vaccine rollout and highly-transmissible variants with the potential for vaccine escape. Our results can be used to assess how TTIQ can be improved and optimised, and the methodology represents an improvement over previous quantification methods that is applicable to future epidemic scenarios.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000533794",,"1932-6203",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0263597","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/533794","en","PLOS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Test-trace-isolate-quarantine (TTIQ) intervention strategies after symptomatic COVID-19 case identification",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-02-23T04:13:09Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85124500502",,"000800108800022","PLoS ONE","2 February","PLoS ONE","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we implemented 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing of stream biofilms upstream (US) and downstream (DS) of WWTP effluents in four Swiss streams to test how bacterial and eukaryotic communities respond to wastewater constituents. Stream biofilm composition was strongly affected by geographic location – particularly for bacteria. However, the abundance of certain microbial community members was related to micropollutants in the wastewater – among bacteria, micropollutant-associated members were found e.g. in Alphaproteobacteria, and among eukaryotes e.g. in Bacillariophyta (algal diatoms). This study corroborates several previously characterized responses (e.g. as seen in diatoms), but also reveals previously unknown community responses – such as seen in Alphaproteobacteria.

By imaging compartment-specific fluorescent ATP and NADPH sensor proteins in Arabidopsis, we show that GC photosynthesis is limited and mitochondria are the main source of ATP. Unlike mature mesophyll cell (MC) chloroplasts, which are impermeable to cytosolic ATP, GCCs import cytosolic ATP through NUCLEOTIDE TRANSPORTER (NTT) proteins.

In the calcareous Swiss lowlands, siliceous erratic boulders are exclusive habitat islands for the regionally critically endangered fern Asplenium septentrionale, about 20 bryophyte species and numerous lichens. Focusing on island biogeographical processes, we analysed the conservation genomics of A. septentrionale and the moss Hedwigia ciliata on insular erratic boulders in the Swiss lowlands and the adjacent ""mainland"" in siliceous mountains. We genotyped both species using double digest restriction associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD). For the tetraploid A. septentrionale, abundant identical multilocus genotypes within populations suggested prevalent intragametophytic selfing, and six out of eight boulder populations consisting of a single multilocus genotype each indicated single spore founder events. The genetic structure of A. septentrionale mainland populations coincided with Pleistocene glacial refugia. Four genetic lineages of H. ciliata were identified, and populations consisting of a single multilocus genotype were less common than in A. septentrionale. For both taxa, multilocus genotype diversity on boulders was lower than in mainland populations. The absence of common genetic groups among boulder populations, and the absence of isolation by distance patterns, suggested colonisation of boulders through independent long-distance dispersal events. Successful boulder colonisation of A. septentrionale seems to be rare, while colonisation by H. ciliata appears to be more frequent. We conclude that pivotal principles of conservation biology, such as connectivity and genetic diversity, are of less importance for the studied cryptogams on insular erratic boulders because of long-distance dispersal, intragametophytic selfing and polyploidy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515109",,"1572-9737||1566-0621",,"10.1007/s10592-021-01414-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515109","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bryophytes||ddRAD||Ferns||Island biogeography||Long-distance dispersal","Neither connectivity nor genetic diversity matter in the conservation of a rare fern and a moss on insular erratic boulders",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-11-15T03:54:40Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85118561720",,"000714308600002","Conserv Genet","1","Conservation Genetics","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The disease can reduce grain yield by up to 70% and is best controlled using integrated disease management strategies. The difficulty in disease management is compounded by the lack of durable host resistance and the ineffectiveness of fungicide sprays. New succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides were recently introduced for the management of wheat diseases. Brazilian field populations of the wheat blast pathogen Pyricularia oryzae Triticum lineage (PoTl) sampled from different geographical regions in 2012 and 2018 were shown to be resistant to both QoI (strobilurin) and DMI (azole) fungicides. The main objective of the current study was to determine the SDHI baseline sensitivity in these populations. Moderate levels of SDHI resistance were detected in five out of the six field populations sampled in 2012 and in most of the strains isolated in 2018. No association was found between target site mutations in the sdhB, sdhC, and sdhD genes and the levels of SDHI resistance, indicating that a pre-existing resistance mechanism not associated with target site mutations is probably present in Brazilian wheat blast populations.",,,,"0032-0862||1365-3059",,"10.1111/ppa.13470","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507287","en","Wiley",,,"fluxapyroxad||fungicide resistance||nontarget site resistance||Pyricularia oryzae Triticum lineage||second-generation carboxamides||succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors","Monitoring of Brazilian wheat blast field populations reveals resistance to QoI, DMI, and SDHI fungicides",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-09-28T03:23:02Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85115131408",,"000697719500001","Plant pathol.","2","Plant Pathology","71","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

One specific mechanism by which this risk can be reduced is by minimizing the number of divisions-and hence the mutational risk-that cells accumulate as they divide to maintain tissue homeostasis. Here, we investigate a mathematical model of cell division in a hierarchical tissue, calculating and minimizing the divisional load while constraining parameters such that homeostasis is maintained. We show that the minimal divisional load is achieved by binary division trees with progenitor cells incapable of self-renewal. Contrary to the protection hypothesis, we find that an increased stem cell turnover can lead to lower divisional load. Furthermore, we find that the optimal tissue structure depends on the time horizon of the duration of homeostasis, with faster stem cell division favoured in short-lived organisms and more progenitor compartments favoured in longer-lived organisms.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000535019",,"1742-5689||1742-5662",,"10.1098/rsif.2021.0784","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/535019","en","Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","tissue structure||differentiation||somatic mutation||cancer||haematopoiesis||optimization","Constrained optimization of divisional load in hierarchically organized tissues during homeostasis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-03-03T04:13:54Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Infectious disease dynamics: spread along contact networks and experimental evolution of antibiotic resistance","176401","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Exzellenzbeitrag in Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85125154222",,"000759382800001","J.

Downstream from a dam, ecosystem degradation occurs because of reduced disturbance, mostly derived from limitations on flow variability and sediment supply. In the last decade, most flow restoration/dam impact mitigation was oriented towards the development of environmental flows. Flow variability (and consequent disturbance) can be reintroduced by releasing artificial high flows (experimental floods). Flow-sediment interactions during experimental floods represent strong ecosystem drivers, influencing nutrient dynamics, and metabolic and functional properties. In river networks, sediment and water inputs from tributaries generate points of discontinuity that can drive major changes in environmental conditions, affecting habitat structure and determining functional differences between upstream and downstream. However, despite the relevance for management, flow/sediment relations during environmental flows − and more importantly during experimental floods − remain poorly understood, mostly due to the lack of empirical evidence. In this study, we examined how a major tributary (source of water and sediments) modified the physical habitat template of a regulated river, thereby influencing ecological and geomorphological responses to experimental floods. Methods combined high-resolution drone mapping techniques with a wide range of biological samples collected in field surveys before, during, and after experimental floods in an alpine river. Data were used to quantify changes in relevant functional and structural ecosystem properties, relating ecological responses to geomorphological dynamics. Results highlight the importance of tributaries in restoring ecosystem properties lost after damming, enhancing the resilience of the system. In addition, we observed that disturbance legacy played a fundamental role in determining ecological conditions of a river prior to experimental floods, thus confirming that considering flow variability and sediment availability is crucial in adaptive dam management and environmental flows design.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522324",,"0301-4797||1095-8630","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587484||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522324","10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.114122","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587761","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Environmental flows||Metabolism||Disturbance||Macroinvertebrates||Geomorphology","Tributary effects on the ecological responses of a regulated river to experimental floods",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-12-25T04:00:36Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85119901381",,"000742127700002","J. environ. manag.",,"Journal of Environmental Management","303","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this chapter, we detail the astounding diversity of parental care in insects. We start by presenting forms of parental care that occur before oviposition, then move to forms occurring between oviposition and egg hatching and conclude with forms of post-hatching parental care occurring before and/or after nutritional independence. This comprehensive review demonstrates overall that insects represent a perfect example of the diversity of parental care that can be found in animals, and thus emphasizes why they are excellent biological models for improving our general understanding of its evolution, diversification and underlying physiological and genetic mechanisms.",,,"978-0-367-48857-4||978-1-032-19195-9||978-1-003-04319-5",,,"10.1201/9781003043195-17","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551327","en","CRC Press",,,,"Parental care",,"Book Chapter","Metadata only","Reproductive Strategies in Insects",,,,"2022-06-08T10:47:43Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A widely documented response to such environmental modifications is for plant species to change their elevational ranges. Range shifts are often idiosyncratic and difficult to generalize, partly due to variation in sampling methods. There is thus a need for a standardized monitoring strategy that can be applied across mountain regions to assess distribution changes and community turnover of native and non-native plant species over space and time. Here, we present a conceptually intuitive and standardized protocol developed by the Mountain Invasion Research Network (MIREN) to systematically quantify global patterns of native and non-native species distributions along elevation gradients and shifts arising from interactive effects of climate change and human disturbance. Usually repeated every five years, surveys consist of 20 sample sites located at equal elevation increments along three replicate roads per sampling region. At each site, three plots extend from the side of a mountain road into surrounding natural vegetation. The protocol has been successfully used in 18 regions worldwide from 2007 to present. Analyses of one point in time already generated some salient results, and revealed region-specific elevational patterns of native plant species richness, but a globally consistent elevational decline in non-native species richness. Non-native plants were also more abundant directly adjacent to road edges, suggesting that disturbed roadsides serve as a vector for invasions into mountains. From the upcoming analyses of time series, even more exciting results can be expected, especially about range shifts. Implementing the protocol in more mountain regions globally would help to generate a more complete picture of how global change alters species distributions. This would inform conservation policy in mountain ecosystems, where some conservation policies remain poorly implemented.",,,,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.8590","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/534832","en","Wiley",,,"climate change||invasive species||long-term ecological monitoring||MIREN||mountain biodiversity,||Mountain Invasion Research Network||range dynamics||range expansions","Think globally, measure locally: The MIREN standardized protocol for monitoring plant species distributions along elevation gradients",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2022-03-02T04:33:52Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85125148422",,"000760366500001","Ecol Evol","2","Ecology and Evolution","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To conserve biodiversity in a sustainable manner, measures are needed that combine the human life with nature. One such effort is to employ blue-green infrastructure (BGI)  in cities, which are networks of elements such as vegetated basins, green roofs, or urban streams. The city of Zurich is a pioneer in urban stream daylighting, where they brought over 19 km of previously culverted streams to the surface as vegetated habitats. These solutions have been lauded for their positive contribution to biodiversity in the urban matrix; monitoring studies that quantify and validate these effects, however, are lacking. An important aspect that could be used to quantify urban stream biodiversity is the floral composition. Plants being food, shelter, and home to various animals have an important role in the urban ecosystem and are thus an optimal proxy to investigate biodiversity.  This study presents a first assessment of the flora of the urban stream habitat in the city of Zurich. Several aspects of floristic composition of different sites on the stream banks of the numerous daylighted streams were analysed: species occurrence of species of conservation concern, species occurrence of neophytes, as well as, the number of fen and dry meadow species, which are two habitats of national interest that are deteriorating. Finally, the ecological factors that drive the biodiversity in this habitat were evaluated.  Results show that daylighted streams in Zurich do not host many neophytes, which is positive. However, the streams lack many plants of conservation interest. Furthermore, the streams tend to contain more dry meadow species than fen species. Ultimately, soil nutrients have been shown to have a negative influence on plant biodiversity, whereas light has a positive effect. Moreover, the impervious surface in the surrounding area also had a negative influence on plant biodiversity. The potential for cities to use these results to improve floral diversity is possible, yet it must also be weighed with other priorities in a human dominated system.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000550074",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/550074","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","Urban flora||Urban ecology||Biodiversity||Daylighting||stream restoration||Zurich City (Canton of Zurich)","The flora of daylighted urban streams and their banks in the city of Zurich",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,,"2022-06-01T08:24:17Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Plasmid dynamics are shaped not only by plasmid-host interactions but also by ecological interactions between plasmid variants. These interactions are complex: plasmids can co-infect the same cell and the consequences for the co-resident plasmid can be either beneficial or detrimental. Many of the biological processes that govern plasmid co-infection-from systems that exclude infection by other plasmids to interactions in the regulation of plasmid copy number-are well characterized at a mechanistic level. Modelling plays a central role in translating such mechanistic insights into predictions about plasmid dynamics and the impact of these dynamics on bacterial evolution. Theoretical work in evolutionary epidemiology has shown that formulating models of co-infection is not trivial, as some modelling choices can introduce unintended ecological assumptions. Here, we review how the biological processes that govern co-infection can be represented in a mathematical model, discuss potential modelling pitfalls, and analyse this model to provide general insights into how co-infection impacts ecological and evolutionary outcomes. In particular, we demonstrate how beneficial and detrimental effects of co-infection give rise to frequency-dependent selection on plasmid variants.

Studies addressing the dynamics of plasmid conjugation have yet neglected one omnipresent factor: prophages (viruses integrated into bacterial genomes), whose activation can kill host and surrounding bacterial cells. To investigate the impact of prophages on conjugation, we combined experiments and mathematical modelling. Using Escherichia coli, prophage lambda and the multidrug-resistant plasmid RP4 we find that prophages can substantially limit the spread of conjugative plasmids. This inhibitory effect was strongly dependent on environmental conditions and bacterial genetic background. Our empirically parameterized model reproduced experimental dynamics of cells acquiring either the prophage or the plasmid well but could only reproduce the number of cells acquiring both elements by assuming complex interactions between conjugative plasmids and prophages in sequential infections. Varying phage and plasmid infection parameters over empirically realistic ranges revealed that plasmids can overcome the negative impact of prophages through high conjugation rates. Overall, the presence of prophages introduces an additional death rate for plasmid carriers, the magnitude of which is determined in non-trivial ways by the environment, the phage and the plasmid.

Most plasmids entail a metabolic burden that reduces the fitness of their host if there is no selection for plasmid-encoded genes. It has been hypothesized that the translational demand imposed by plasmid-encoded genes is a major mechanism driving the fitness cost of plasmids. Plasmid-encoded genes typically present a different codon usage from host chromosomal genes. As a consequence, the translation of plasmid-encoded genes might sequestrate ribosomes on plasmid transcripts, overwhelming the translation machinery of the cell. However, the pervasiveness and origins of the translation-derived costs of plasmids are yet to be assessed. Here, we systematically altered translation efficiency in the host cell to disentangle the fitness effects produced by six natural antibiotic resistance plasmids. We show that limiting translation efficiency either by reducing the number of available ribosomes or their processivity does not increase plasmid costs. Overall, our results suggest that ribosomal paucity is not a major contributor to plasmid fitness costs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000524295",,"0962-8436||1471-2970||0080-4622",,"10.1098/rstb.2020.0463","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/524295","de","The Royal Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Translational demand is not a major source of plasmid-associated fitness costs",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-10T13:55:31Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Phil.

Both approaches, however, lead to models of Mars that are unable to self-consistently explain major element chemistry and match its observed geophysical properties, unless ad hoc adjustments to key parameters, namely, bulk Fe/Si ratio, core composition, and/or core size are made. Here, we combine geophysical observations, including high-quality seismic data acquired with the InSight mission, with a cosmochemical model to constrain the composition of Mars. We find that the FeO content of Mars' mantle is 13.7±0.4 wt%, corresponding to a Mg# of 0.81±0.01. Because of the lower FeO content of the mantle, compared with previous estimates, we obtain a higher mean core density of 6150±46 kg/m3 than predicted by recent seismic observations, yet our estimate for the core radius remains consistent around 1840±10 km, corresponding to a core mass fraction of 0.250±0.005. Relying on cosmochemical constraints, volatile element behaviour, and planetary building blocks that match geophysical and isotopic signatures of Martian meteorites, we find that the liquid core is made up of 88.4±3.9 wt% Fe-Ni-Co with light elements making up the rest. To match the mean core density constraint, we predict, based on experimentally-determined thermodynamic solution models, a light element abundance in the range of ≈9 wt% S, ⩾3 wt% C, ⩽2.5 wt% O, and ⩽0.5 wt% H, supporting the notion of a volatile-rich Mars.

So far, the possibilities of deep learning approaches for this purpose have not been explored adequately, partly due to a lack of publicly available, appropriate datasets. This study presents a workflow based on DeepLab v3+ and on a diverse annotated dataset of 190 RGB (350 x 350 pixels) images. Images of winter wheat plants of 76 different genotypes and developmental stages have been acquired throughout multiple years at high resolution in outdoor conditions using nadir view, encompassing a wide range of imaging conditions. Inconsistencies of human annotators in complex images have been quantified, and metadata information of camera settings has been included. The proposed approach achieves an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.77 and 0.90 for plants and soil, respectively. This outperforms the benchmarked machine learning methods which use Support Vector Classifier and/or Random Forrest. The results show that a small but carefully chosen and annotated set of images can provide a good basis for a powerful segmentation pipeline. Compared to earlier methods based on machine learning, the proposed method achieves better performance on the selected dataset in spite of using a deep learning approach with limited data. Increasing the amount of publicly available data with high human agreement on annotations and further development of deep neural network architectures will provide high potential for robust field-based plant segmentation in the near future.

However, vegetation classifications less frequently consider the actual forest attributes within each type. To address this in an objective way across different regions and to link forest attributes with their climate, we aimed to improve the distribution of forest types to be more realistic and useful for biodiversity preservation, forest management, and ecological and forestry research. The forest types were classified using an unsupervised cluster analysis method by combining climate variables with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Unforested regions were masked out to constrict our study to forest type distributions, using a 20% tree cover threshold. Descriptive names were given to the defined forest types based on annual temperature, precipitation, and NDVI values. Forest types had distinct climate and vegetation characteristics. Regions with similar NDVI values, but with different climate characteristics, which would be merged in previous classifications, could be clearly distinguished. However, small-range forest types, such as montane forests, were challenging to differentiate. At macroscale, the resulting forest types are largely consistent with land-cover types or vegetation types defined in previous studies. However, considering both potential and current vegetation data allowed us to create a more realistic type distribution that differentiates actual vegetation types and thus can be more informative for forest managers, conservationists, and forest ecologists.

This is due to a disconnect between point or transect scale albedo sampling and the coarser spatial, spectral and/or temporal resolutions of available satellite products. Here, we present time-series of bare-ice surface reflectance data that span a range of length scales, from the 500 m for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer’s MOD10A1 product, to 10 m for Sentinel-2 imagery, 0.1 m spot measurements from ground-based field spectrometry, and 2.5 cm from uncrewed aerial drone imagery. Our results reveal broad similarities in seasonal patterns in bare-ice reflectance, but further analysis identifies short-term dynamics in reflectance distribution that are unique to each dataset. Using these distributions, we demonstrate that areal mean reflectance is the primary control on local ablation rates, and that the spatial distribution of specific ice types and impurities is secondary. Given the rapid changes in mean reflectance observed in the datasets presented, we propose that albedo parameterizations can be improved by (i) quantitative assessment of the representativeness of time-averaged reflectance data products, and, (ii) using temporally-resolved functions to describe the variability in impurity distribution at daily time-scales. We conclude that the regional melt model performance may not be optimally improved by increased spatial resolution and the incorporation of sub-pixel heterogeneity, but instead, should focus on the temporal dynamics of bare-ice albedo.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522618",,"2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs14010062","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522618","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Greenland ice sheet||Reflectance||Albedo||MODIS||Sentinel-2||Uncrewed aerial vehicle||Spectrometry||Multiscale","Temporal variability of surface reflectance supersedes spatial resolution in defining greenland’s bare-ice albedo",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-03T03:51:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85121696816",,"000759474800001","Remote Sens.","1","Remote Sensing","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The combination of a synthetic polymer, to be able to tune the structure and the physicochemical and mechanical properties, and a natural polymer, to ensure the specific biological functions of the scaffold, with inorganic filler was applied. The goal was to make a new material with superior properties for applications in the biomedical field which mimics as closely as possible the native bone extracellular matrix (ECM). Biodegradable PHEMA hydrogel was obtained by crosslinking HEMA by poly(β-amino esters) (PBAE). The scaffold’s physicochemical and mechanical properties, in vitro degradation, and biological activity were assessed so to study the effects of the incorporation of nHAp in the (PHEMA/PBAE/gelatin) hydrogel, as well as the effect of the different pore-forming methods. Cryogels had higher elasticity, swelling, porosity, and percent of mass loss during degradation than the samples obtained by poro-genation. The composite scaffolds had a higher mechanical strength, 10.14 MPa for the porogenated samples and 5.87 MPa for the cryogels, but a slightly lower degree of swelling, percent of mass loss, and porosity than the hybrid ones. All the scaffolds were nontoxic and had a high cell adhesion rate, which was 15–20% higher in the composite samples. Cell metabolic activity after 2 and 7 days of culture was higher in the composites, although not statistically different. After 28 days, cell metabolic activity was similar in all scaffolds and the TCP control. No effect of integrating nHAp into the scaffolds on osteogenic cell differentiation could be observed. Synergetic effects occurred which influenced the mechanical behavior, structure, physicochemical properties, and interactions with biological species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522614",,"2073-4360",,"10.3390/polym14010018","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522614","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate/PBAE/gelatin/dopped hydroxyapatite||Hydrogel scaffolding biomaterial||Biodegradable scaffolds||Biocompatibility||Tissue regeneration engineering","Biodegradable hydrogel scaffolds based on 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, gelatin, poly(β-amino esters), and hydroxyapatite",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-03T03:51:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85121803851",,"000751013700001","Polymers (Basel)","1","Polymers","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

All endosymbionts, whether they provide net benefits or costs, utilize host resources; in yeast, this should induce an earlier onset of sporulation. Here, we tested whether the presence of endosymbiotic dsRNA viruses (M satellite and L-A helper) correspond with higher sporulation rate of their host, S. cerevisiae. We find that S. cerevisiae hosting both the M and L-A viruses (so-called “killer yeasts”) have significantly higher sporulation efficiency than those without. We also found that the removal of the M virus did not reduce sporulation frequency, possibly because the L-A virus still utilizes host resources with and without the M virus. Our findings indicate that either virulent resource use by endosymbionts induces sporulation, or that viruses are spread more frequently to sporulating strains. Further exploration is required to distinguish cause from effect.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000531010",,"2045-7758",,"10.1002/ece3.8558","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/531010","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","dsRNA viruses||host manipulation||insect vectors||mutualism–parasitism continuum||phenotypic plasticity||selfish genetic elements||sexual reproduction||yeast","Infection by dsRNA viruses is associated with enhanced sporulation efficiency in Saccharomyces cerevisiae",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-02-07T07:37:59Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Chasing the killer yeasts and their dsRNA viruses in the wild","ETH-23 20-1","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,,"85123837136",,"000747845400057","Ecol Evol","1","Ecology and Evolution","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In addition to their behavioral and immune defenses, many host species rely on heritable bacterial endosymbionts for defense against parasitoids. Studies on aphids and flies show that resistance conferred by symbionts can be very strong and highly specific, possibly as a result of variation in symbiont-produced toxins. I argue that defensive symbionts are therefore an important source of diversifying selection, promoting the evolution of host specialization by parasitoids. This is likely to affect the structure of host-parasitoid food webs. I consider potential changes in terms of food web complexity, although the nature of these effects will also be influenced by whether maternally transmitted symbionts have some capacity for lateral transfer. This is discussed in the light of available evidence for horizontal transmission routes. Finally, I propose that defensive mutualisms other than microbial endosymbionts may also exert diversifying selection on insect parasitoids.",,,,"0066-4170","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587509||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/547204","10.1146/annurev-ento-072621-062042","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587771","en","Annual Reviews",,,"defensive symbiosis||endosymbionts||food webs||host specialization||parasitoids||vertical transmission||horizontal transmission","Defensive Symbionts and the Evolution of Parasitoid Host Specialization",,"Review Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2022-05-15T02:46:00Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85122862780",,"000789891400019",,,"Annual Review of Entomology","67","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We explore various observational scenarios to assess the impact of mission duration on the main science objectives of the mission.

Studying evolution in its simplest terms, for example via the LTEE, distills patterns and basic mechanisms. Yet biology is as much about complexity as it is about simplicity, and considering the factors that disrupt the patterns and complexify the mechanisms can reveal emergent truths. Microbial interactions are often studied as pairwise modules, yet they are influenced by the complexity of interaction networks. The prey in predator-prey interactions have competitors and cross-feeders, and the predators have their own predators and competitors to avoid or fight. In this thesis, I explore how behavior and evolution respond in multi-species microbial communities that are structured by predator-prey interactions. I focus on the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, a social soil bacterium that swarms cooperatively through soil habitats, preying on other bacteria and fungi it encounters and, when nutrients are depleted, aggregating and developing into spore-filled fruiting bodies. The mechanisms, evolution, and origin of M. xanthus’s charismatic social traits offer a fascinating and fruitful target for this lens, and I investigate how M. xanthus responds over ecological and evolutionary time to interactions with lower trophic levels (prey) and higher trophic levels (predators). First, I construct a four-member community with two prey bacteria and M. xanthus and the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as competing predators, and I measure the behavioral responses of the predators to each other. C. elegans generally avoids M. xanthus, leaving agar plates where it is the only food source (although worms who remain preferentially interact with M. xanthus over sterile buffer) and choosing patches of the lower-quality prey when M. xanthus is present in the patch of higher-quality prey. M. xanthus also shows a behavioral response to C. elegans, although this depends on third-party interactions – when the prey is of high quality, M. xanthus swarms faster in the presence of C. elegans. Next, I construct a three-member community comprising a food chain: Escherichia coli as a prey, M. xanthus as a mesopredator, and another bacterivorous nematode, Pristionchus pacificus, as an apex predator. I allow M. xanthus to evolve for 20 weeks in different community compositions: alone, with just E. coli, with just P. pacificus, or with both E. coli and P. pacificus. I first consider specific adaptation of evolved M. xanthus lineages to the different evolution treatments. Almost all lineages show evidence of adaptation to their own evolution environment, and it seems that exposure to at least one other organism during evolution provides some kind of benefit when encountering the other. However, exposure to both organisms is needed to do well in the three-member community. Swarming rates decreased relative to the ancestor, indicating that motility evolved across environments. I next consider trait-based evolution of M. xanthus in each of the communities in order to identify their contribution to the different long-term forces that shape M. xanthus as an organism. E. coli seems to simply offer a nutrient source, relaxing selection on starvation-related traits and allowing lack of maintenance to introduce phenotypic changes – in many cases, lineages that evolved in the presence of E. coli show lower levels of sporulation and no longer make fruiting bodies under starvation conditions. P. pacificus, on the other hand, selects for M. xanthus populations to form more and smaller fruiting bodies (although with unchanged levels of spore production), which may reflect an increased need for sheltering benefits. Strikingly, evolved lineages which descend from a variant of the wild type which contains a single point mutation in rpoB, and is therefore resistant to rifampicin, show a much smaller degree of trait-based evolution than lineages which descend from the wild type itself. This suggest that trade-offs between antibiotic resistance and anti-predator defense may shape evolutionary responses to inter-species antagonism under natural conditions. Finally, I argue for the development of microbial systems, such as the one I present here, both as a way to enrich the ecological, evolutionary, and mechanistic understanding of microbial communities and the specific trophic relationships which structure them and as a tool for addressing open questions about the evolution of predator behaviors and prey defenses more broadly. As we study interactions between simple ecological and evolutionary rules, surprising and beautiful complexity emerges.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000579076",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/579076","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Evolution||Microbial communities||Predation||Experimental evolution||Food web","Ecology and evolution in microbial food webs",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences",,,"2022-11-02T12:17:29Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28453",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Phylogenies of bacteria and their plasmids contain clues regarding the frequency of plasmid transfer events, as well as the co-evolution of plasmids and their hosts. However, whole genome sequencing data from diverse ecological or clinical bacterial samples are rarely used to study plasmid phylogenies and resistance gene transfer. This is partially due to the difficulty of extracting plasmids from short-read sequencing data. Here, we use both short- and long-read sequencing data of 24 clinical extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli to estimate chromosomal and plasmid phylogenies. We compare the impact of different sequencing and assembly methodologies on these phylogenies and on the inference of horizontal gene transfer. We find that chromosomal phylogenies can be estimated robustly with all methods, whereas plasmid phylogenies have more variable topology and branch lengths across the methods used. Specifically, hybrid methods that use long reads to resolve short-read assemblies (HybridSPAdes and Unicycler) perform better than those that started from long reads during assembly graph generation (Canu). By contrast, the inference of plasmid and antibiotic resistance gene transfer using a parsimony-based criterion is mostly robust to the choice of sequencing and assembly method.

Since the start of the SARS- CoV- 2 pandemic, many methods and online dashboards have sprung up to monitor this number through time. However, these methods are not always thoroughly tested, correctly placed in time, or are overly confident during high incidence periods. Here, we present a method for timely estimation of Re, applied to COVID- 19 epidemic data from 170 countries. We thoroughly evaluate the method on simulated data, and present an intuitive web interface for interactive data exploration. We show that, in early 2020, in the majority of countries the estimated Re dropped below 1 only after the introduction of major non-pharmaceutical interventions. For Europe the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions was broadly associated with reductions in the estimated Re. Globally though, relaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions had more varied effects on subsequent Re estimates. Our framework is useful to inform governments and the general public on the status of epidemics in their country, and is used as the official source of Re estimates for SARS- CoV- 2 in Switzerland. It further allows detailed comparison between countries and in relation to covariates such as implemented public health policies, mobility, behaviour, or weather data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000572580",,"2050-084X",,"10.7554/eLife.71345","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/572580","en","eLife","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","SARS-CoV-2||public health surveillance||infectious disease||reproductive number||Human||Viruses","Estimation and worldwide monitoring of the effective reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-09-26T04:26:03Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Real-time monitoring of COVID-19 transmission through phylodynamics||Causal learning in complex systems||Infectious disease dynamics: spread along contact networks and experimental evolution of antibiotic resistance||Towards quantification of the contribution of plasmids to the spread of antibiotic resistance","196267||172603||176401||167121","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","Special Call on Coronaviruses||Projekte MINT||Exzellenzbeitrag in Lebenswissenschaften||NFP 70: Gesuch",,,,,,"000853661800001",,,"eLife","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02000 - Dep.

What determines whether an organism is selected or not is its phenotype. Therefore, in order to figure out the actual evolutionary potential of organisms it is essential to understand how phenotypes are constructed and how those constructions can evolve. During the history of life on Earth some lineages have evolved key novelties that drastically impacted how phenotypes can develop, and, therefore, how those lineages evolve. One of the most drastic novelties in organismal organisation was the evolution of multicellularity in the stem-lineage to animals. This novelty was followed by an impressive exploration of shapes and habits that make up some of the most exquisite and intriguing diversity populating our planet. In this thesis, I will particularly focus on two features of animal organisation that represented novelties that accompanied the evolution of multicellularity. First, I will explore the influence of the evolution of novel distal regulatory elements called enhancers on the evolution of gene regulatory networks. Regulatory networks control the spatiotemporal gene expression patterns that give rise to and define the individual cell types of multicellular organisms. In eumetazoa, enhancers play a key role in determining the structure of such networks, particularly the wiring diagram of “who regulates whom”. Mutations that affect enhancer activity can therefore rewire regulatory networks, potentially causing adaptive changes in gene expression. Here, I will present results from analyzing whole-tissue and single-cell transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility data from mouse to show that enhancers play an additional role in the evolution of regulatory networks: They facilitate network growth by creating transcriptionally active regions of open chromatin that are conducive to de novo gene evolution. I also show that open reading frames gradually acquire interactions with enhancers over macroevolutionary timescales, helping integrate genes—those that have arisen de novo or by other means—into existing regulatory networks. Taken together, these results highlight a dual role of enhancers in expanding and rewiring gene regulatory networks. Secondly, I will present how the separation of reproductive and somatic cells during the development of animals can influence evolutionary trajectories. The evolution of a germline-soma separation in animals has the implication that much of the genetic variation that arises in the body of an individual cannot be inherited. Because of that, the adaptive potential of non-heritable somatic mutations has received limited attention in traditional evolutionary theory. I will here show how the ability of a germline genotype to express a novel phenotype via non-heritable somatic mutations can be selectively advantageous, and that this advantage can channel evolving populations toward germline genotypes that constitutively express the phenotype. I will present the results of simulations of evolving populations of developing organisms with an impermeable germline-soma separation navigating a minimal fitness landscape. Those simulations revealed the conditions under which non-heritable somatic mutations promote adaptation. Specifically, this can occur when the somatic mutation supply is high, when few cells with the advantageous somatic mutation are required to increase organismal fitness, and when the somatic mutation also confers a selective advantage at the cellular level. These results therefore provide proof-of-principle that non-heritable somatic mutations can promote adaptive evolution. These discoveries have important implications for how we understand the evolutionary potential of organisms, showing how the evolution of complex molecular mechanisms can facilitate the evolution of completely novel biochemical components, and how the ontological configuration of an organism can guide the evolutionary trajectories of its lineage. I conclude by emphasizing the importance of developmental and historical processes for the understanding of biological evolution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000583476",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/583476","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","evolutionary theory||gene regulation||genetic novelty||somatic mutations||adaptation||developmental biology","Regulatory and developmental novelties and their implications for evolutionary trajectories",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences",,,"2022-11-28T12:46:45Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28551",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it remains unclear under which conditions and through which processes competition can do so, limiting the comprehensive understanding of species distributions and accurate predictions of range dynamics under changing environments. In this thesis, I aim to understand how the role of competition in shaping range limits varies across environmental gradients (Chapter 1), unpack the demographic processes by which competition regulates population growth (Chapter 2), and investigate the usefulness of plant traits in predicting competition under changing environments (Chapter 3). To do so, I conduct a field experiment in which pairs of plant species originating from low and high elevations (seven lowland species and seven highland species) interact across an elevation gradient in the Swiss Alps. I measure individual-based vital rates and parameterise integral projection models (IPMs) to model population growth in the absence and presence of neighbours across the elevation gradient.  In Chapter 1, I evaluate the hypothesis that species experience a reduced ability to coexist with neighbours beyond versus within their range edges and examine the contributions of niche differences and relative fitness differences to changing coexistence across the elevation gradient. To do this, I quantify population-level outcomes of competition and underlying coexistence determinants (i.e., niche differences and fitness differences) using parameterised IPMs. The results show that both lowland and highland species can better persist in the presence of competition within, rather than beyond, their elevation ranges. These findings suggest that competition helps set both lower and upper elevation range limits of these species. Moreover, the results demonstrate that species’ range limits can be influenced by competitors from both within and outside their range (i.e., sympatric and parapatric species) and mediated through niche differences and relative fitness differences. Specifically, the reduced ability of pairs of lowland or highland species to coexist beyond their range edges is mainly driven by diminishing niche differences; changes in both niche differences and relative fitness differences drive weakening competitive dominance of lowland over highland species with increasing elevation. These results suggest the general importance of species interactions for regulating distributions and highlight the need to consider species interactions and investigate underlying coexistence mechanisms to better understand current and future species distributions.  In Chapter 2, I investigate how the responses of individual vital rates to competition translate to population growth under competition and species coexistence. I quantify the contributions of each vital rate to the effects of competition on population growth rates using parameterised IPMs. The results show that the responses of vital rates at earlier life stages, that is, individual growth and seedling establishment, made the greatest contributions to competition-induced declines in population growth compared with the vital rates at later life stages, that is, the survival and reproduction of mature plants. Surprisingly, survival and reproduction frequently show compensatory responses that occurred in 92% of species pairs, which significantly promote species coexistence by reducing niche overlap. Our study highlights the importance of integrating species’ full life cycles to better understand the role of competition in regulating plant population and community dynamics.  In Chapter 3, I investigate how well traits predict competition and whether and how the predictive ability varies across the elevation gradient and between current (lowland-lowland and highland-highland species pairs) and novel interactions (lowland-highland species). I measure 15 traits covering morphology, phenology, physiology, and resource uses for each species within each site and relate species’ differences in traits to the strength and outcomes of competition between them. The results show that traits can predict current and novel interactions equally well, and the predictive ability is greater under warmer than cooler climates. These results reinforce the usefulness of traits in predicting the outcomes of changing species interactions under changing environments and highlight the importance of considering environmental context when using traits to predict the effects of species interactions under changing environments.   In conclusion, this thesis reveals that competition can shape population growth and species distributions through different processes that vary across demographic components and environmental gradients and between species. The complex processes underlying the effects of competition on species distributions present a major challenge for ecologists to understand species distributions and accurately predict range dynamics under changing environments. One promising way to overcome this challenge is to incorporate plant demography, coexistence theory and functional ecology into biogeography. By doing so, ecologists can gain deeper insights into the processes and mechanisms by which competition shapes species distributions and build a mechanistic link that scales the responses of individuals to environments up to species distributions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000584289",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/584289","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","alpine plant, coexistence, competition, compensatory responses, elevation gradient, demography, functional traits, integral projection model, life history strategy, lowland plant, niche difference, niche overlap, population growth, relative fitness difference, vital rate","Mechanisms and predictions of competitive population dynamics across an elevation gradient",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::570 - Life sciences",,,"2022-12-01T09:38:59Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,"28534",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In black bean aphids (Aphis fabae), costs in terms of reduced lifespan and lifetime reproduction were demonstrated by introducing 11 isolates of the protective symbiont Hamiltonella defensa into previously uninfected aphid clones. Transfection of H. defensa isolates into a common genetic background allows to compare the costs of different endosymbiont isolates unconfounded by host genetic variation, but has been suggested to overestimate the realized costs of the endosymbiont in natural populations, because transfection creates new and potentially maladapted host–symbiont combinations that would be eliminated by natural selection in the field. In this experiment, we show that removing H. defensa isolates from their natural host clones with antibiotics results in a fitness gain that is comparable to the fitness loss from their introduction into two new clones. This suggests that estimating cost by transfecting endosymbiont isolates into a shared host genotype does not lead to gross overestimates of their realized costs, at least not in the two recipient genotypes used here. By comparing our data with data reported in previous publications using the same lines, we show that symbiont-induced costs may fluctuate over time. Thus, costs estimated after extended culture in the laboratory may not always be representative of the costs at the time of collection in the field. Finally, we report the accidental observation that two isolates from a distinct haplotype of H. defensa could not be removed by cefotaxime treatment, while all isolates from two other haplotypes were readily eliminated, which is suggestive of variation in susceptibility to this antibiotic in H. defensa.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000531011",,"2045-7758","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587493||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/531011","10.1002/ece3.8551","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587749","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Similar cost of Hamiltonella defensa in experimental and natural aphid-endosymbiont associations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-02-07T07:37:59Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85123801684",,"000747845400061","Ecol Evol","1","Ecology and Evolution","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

An example of this are invasive crayfish species in Europe (Faxonius limosus, Pacifastacus leniusculus, Procambarus clarkii), which carry the deadly plague agent (Aphanomyces astaci). Effective disease management requires comprehensive monitoring, however, pathogen detection in carrier populations with low pathogen prevalence and intensities is challenging. We simultaneously collected and analysed crayfish tissue samples of invasive crayfish populations and water samples to compare A. astaci detection in different sample types using quantitative PCR. Combined, the two sampling methods revealed A. astaci presence with DNA concentrations above limit of detection (LOD; the lowest concentration which can be detected with reasonable certainty) in 13 of 23 invasive crayfish populations. In four additional sites, A. astaci DNA concentrations below LOD were found in water. In four populations only were A. astaci concentrations above LOD detected in both sample types and in three populations in concentrations above LOD in tissue but below LOD in water. The likely reason for these discrepancies is the low A. astaci prevalence and concentration in resistant invasive crayfish, which limit detection reliability. Consistency may be improved by timing surveys with seasonal periods of high A. astaci abundance and by increasing water sampling effort. Considering the ease of collecting eDNA samples, compared to crayfish tissue sampling, eDNA methods would facilitate frequent and comprehensive surveys. However, remaining uncertainties in eDNA-based detection reveal the relevance of combining monitoring tools to improve detection of invasive pathogens and their management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000514989",,"1387-3547||1573-1464","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587504||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/514989","10.1007/s10530-021-02644-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587774","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Aphanomyces astaci||Invasive crayfish||Environmental DNA||Pathogen monitoring","Parasite DNA detection in water samples enhances crayfish plague monitoring in asymptomatic invasive populations",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-11-13T07:56:53Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85118378040",,"000713537000001",,"1","Biological Invasions","24","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In many communities, antagonistic flower visitors, including nectar  robbers, have likely declined in abundance as well. Given the negative effects that  these visitors can sometimes inflict, might declines in their populations benefit  plants? During the 1970s, the floral visitor community of the Colorado columbine,  Aquilegia caerulea (Ranunculaceae), was documented near Gothic, Colorado. At  that time, Bombus occidentalis, the Western Bumble bee, was one of its many  pollinators, but more commonly acted as its only known nectar robber. Bombus  occidentalis abundance has declined precipitously throughout the Western USA  since the 1970s. In 2016, we documented the floral visitor community in sites near  to those used in the original survey. We then experimentally quantified the effects  of nectar robbing, allowing us to estimate the reproductive consequences of losing  B. occidentalis. We also quantified the potential pollination services of muscid flies  (Muscidae, Diptera). The floral visitor community was dramatically different in 2016  compared to the 1970s. Bombus occidentalis, a frequent A. caerulea visitor from  1969-1976, was infrequently observed visiting the plant, and nectar robbing was  negligible. Our experiments suggested that a high level of nectar robbing would  lead to significantly reduced fruit set, although not seeds per fruit. Fly visits to  flowers were dramatically higher in 2016 compared to the 1970s. We show that, in  the absence of bumble bee pollinators, muscid flies significantly reduced fruit set  below the self-pollination rate. The negative effect of the increase in these flies  likely outweighed any positive effects A. caerulea experienced from the absence of  its nectar robber. Although the field observations were conducted in a single year,  when they are interpreted in combination with our manipulative experiments, they  suggest how A. caerulea may fare in a changing visitation landscape.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000587429",,"1920-7603",,"10.26786/1920-7603(2022)663","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/587429","en","Enviroquest","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bombus occidentalis||bee declines||nectar robbing||floral larceny||Aquilegia caerulea||Muscidae","What are the plant reproductive consequences of losing a nectar robber?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-12-15T13:22:21Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"10","Journal of Pollination Ecology","31","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Siderophores can be ‘public goods’ by delivering iron to individuals possessing matching receptors; but they can also be ‘public bads’ by withholding iron from competitors lacking these receptors. Accordingly, siderophores should either promote or impede invasion, depending on their effects on invader and resident growth. Using supernatant feeding and invasion assays, we show that invasion success indeed increased when the invader could use its siderophores to inhibit (public bad) rather than stimulate (public good) resident growth. Conversely, invasion success decreased the more the invader was inhibited by the residents’ siderophores. Our findings identify siderophores as a major driver of invasion dynamics in bacterial communities under iron-limited conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000551326",,"1461-023X||1461-0248",,"10.1111/ele.13912","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/551326","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","bacterial interactions||bacterial public goods||biological invasion||cheating||community ecology||competition||microbial ecology||Pseudomonas||pyoverdine||siderophores","Siderophores drive invasion dynamics in bacterial communities through their dual role as public good versus public bad",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-06-08T10:42:20Z",,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,"85118828206",,"000716087800001","Ecol. lett.","1","Ecology Letters","25","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it remains unclear where and how competition regulates species' range limits. In a field experiment with plants originating from low and high elevations and conducted across an elevation gradient in the Swiss Alps, we find that both lowland and highland species can better persist in the presence of competition within, rather than beyond, their elevation ranges. These findings suggest that competition helps set both lower and upper elevation range limits of these species. Furthermore, the reduced ability of pairs of lowland or highland species to coexist beyond their range edges is mainly driven by diminishing niche differences; changes in both niche differences and relative fitness differences drive weakening competitive dominance of lowland over highland species with increasing elevation. These results highlight the need to account for competitive interactions and investigate underlying coexistence mechanisms to understand current and future species distributions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000547520",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-022-30013-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/547520","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Competition contributes to both warm and cool range edges",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-05-17T02:48:23Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Novel`interactions and species’ responses to climate change","678841","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85129718385",,"000791826000022","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To meet the high standards of the modern manufacturing industry, parts built with powder bed fusion require consistent properties and to be free of defects, which is intrinsically connected to the quality of the powder bed prior to melting. The hypothesis of this work is that the roughness of the top surface of an unmelted powder bed can serve as a proxy for the powder bed density, which is known to correlate with final part density. In this study, a laser line scan profilometer is integrated onto the recoater arm of a custom powder test bench, which is able to automatically create layers of powder. A diverse group of polymers was investigated including polyamide 12 (PA12), polyamide 11 (PA11), polypropylene (PP), and a thermoplastic elastomer (TPU) under different recoating speed in order to increase the variance of the dataset. Data analytics were employed to compare roughness to measured powder bed density and a statically significant correlation was established between them.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522611",,"2073-4360",,"10.3390/polym14010081","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522611","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","polymer powder bed fusion||laser profilometry||powder layer density||roughness||powder layer topography","Powder Surface Roughness as Proxy for Bed Density in Powder Bed Fusion of Polymers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-03T03:51:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85121869241",,"000750920100001","Polymers (Basel)","1","Polymers","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Great progress has been made in agricultural practices to improve quality and crop yield. However, pathogens still pose a threat to crop production, and many aspects of the biology and the ecology of pathogens remain unexplored or not fully understood. A major knowledge gap is represented by the little comprehension of pathogen-pathogen interactions in natural infections. The following doctoral thesis aims to shed light on infections involving more than one pathogen, which greatly affect the population dynamics of plant pathogens. The final objective is to improve our understanding of pathogens and design better control strategies to prevent the damage produced by diseases and to hinder pathogen spread. An optimal model to study pathogen-pathogen-plant interactions is represented by the heterothallic ascomycete fungus Zymoseptoria tritici and its host wheat. Septoria tritici blotch (STB) caused by this fungus is one of the most damaging diseases of wheat cultivars in Europe and in the world. Remarkably during conducive years, it can lead to up to 50% yield losses. Characterized by its high evolutionary potential and by its genotypic and phenotypic plasticity, Z. tritici is highly diverse. In certain wheat fields, it has been described that more than several millions of different genotypes occur per hectare. A direct consequence of this extremely high diversity is that mixed infections in wheat fields are extremely frequent. To explore how pathogen-pathogen interactions affect the transmission of Z. tritici, we serial passaged a mixture of four different strains through the same host. The results obtained demonstrated that competition between strains leads to strain exclusion, and after several cycles of transmission, only one strain remains. Remarkably, the outcome of the serial passages depended on the cultivar genotype, indicating that the competitive ability of the strains is cultivar-specific. Against what has been previously described for other pathosystems, virulence does not positively affect the competitive ability of Z. tritici strains, while reproductive potential does. Overall, these findings suggest that mixed infections potentially affect the population structure and the evolution of virulence of pathogens. Mixed infections involve at least two pathogens and the host. Some pathogens harboring avirulence factors (Avrs) are recognized by resistance proteins (R) expressed in the plant. Consequently, the infection and the reproduction of those pathogens are hindered by the resistant host, resulting in incompatible interactions. How avirulent pathogens behave in mixed infection with a virulent pathogen remained largely unexplored. To investigate the interaction between avirulent strains and their resistant host in the presence of virulent strains, transcriptomic analysis of single and mixed infections was pursued. Results demonstrated that virulent strains of Z. tritici suppress the plant immune system enabling the infection and the reproduction of the co-infecting avirulent strain locally and distally. The prior arrival (priority effect) of the virulent strain did not increase the reproductive capacity of the avirulent strains, while infection on detached leaves revealed that competition for resources significantly affected the reproduction of the avirulent strains. We demonstrated that host immune suppression by virulent strains favors infection by avirulent strains, and we speculate that this could potentially also benefit colonization by opportunistic microorganisms.  The results obtained during this doctoral thesis indicate that mixed infections importantly impact the dynamic of pathogen populations and their composition. This could have consequences for the evolution of pathogens and the survival and spread of avirulent pathogens.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000556181",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/556181","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Mixed infections||serial passage experiment||competitive ability||competitive exclusion||transmission potential||wheat pathogen||ZYMOSEPTORIA TRITICI, SEPTORIA LEAF BLOTCH (PLANT PATHOLOGY)||Gene-for-gene interaction||immune system","Plant-Fungal and Fungal-Fungal Interaction Dynamics in a Major Pathogen of Wheat",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::580 - Botanical sciences","JEL - JEL::Q - Agricultural and Natural Resource Economics; Environmental and Ecological Economics::Q1 - Agriculture::Q18 - Agricultural Policy; Food Policy",,"2022-07-04T18:57:08Z",,,,"yes",,,,"The effect of mixed-infections on disease development in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici","ETH-23 15-2","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants","28326",,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A key characteristic of these phages is their mosaic genome structure, which served as the basis for the ‘modular genome hypothesis’. Accordingly, lambdoid phages evolve by transferring genomic regions, each of which constitutes a functional unit. Nevertheless, it is unknown which genes are preferentially transferred together and what drives such co-transfer events. Here we aim to characterize genome modularity by studying co-transfer of genes among 95 distantly related lambdoid (pro-)phages. Based on gene content, we observed that the genomes cluster into 12 groups, which are characterized by a highly similar gene content within the groups and highly divergent gene content across groups. Highly similar proteins can occur in genomes of different groups, indicating that they have been transferred. About 26 % of homologous protein clusters in the four known operons (i.e. the early left, early right, immunity and late operon) engage in gene transfer, which affects all operons to a similar extent. We identified pairs of genes that are frequently co-transferred and observed that these pairs tend to be near one another on the genome. We find that frequently co-transferred genes are involved in related functions and highlight interesting examples involving structural proteins, the cI repressor and Cro regulator, proteins interacting with DNA, and membrane-interacting proteins. We conclude that epistatic effects, where the functioning of one protein depends on the presence of another, play an important role in the evolution of the modular structure of these genomes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000593339",,"2057-5858",,"10.1099/mgen.0.000915","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/593339","en","Microbiology Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Co-transfer||Horizontal gene transfer||Phage evolution||Phage lambda","Co-transfer of functionally interdependent genes contributes to genome mosaicism in lambdoid phages",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2023-01-18T12:16:19Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Microb Genom","11","Microbial Genomics","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Automatically collected digital receipts from loyalty cards hereby promise to serve as an objective and automatically traceable digital marker for individual food choice behavior and do not require users to manually log individual meal items. With the introduction of the General Data Privacy Regulation in the European Union, millions of consumers gained the right to access their shopping data in a machine-readable form, representing a historic chance to leverage shopping data for scalable monitoring of food choices. Multiple quantitative indicators for evaluating the nutritional quality of food shopping have been suggested, but so far, no comparison has validated the potential of these alternative indicators within a comparative setting. This manuscript thus represents the first study to compare the calibration capacity and to validate the discrimination potential of previously suggested food shopping quality indicators for the nutritional quality of shopped groceries, including the Food Standards Agency Nutrient Profiling System Dietary Index (FSA-NPS DI), Grocery Purchase Quality Index-2016 (GPQI), Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015), Healthy Trolley Index (HETI) and Healthy Purchase Index (HPI), checking if any of them performs differently from the others. The hypothesis is that some food shopping quality indicators outperform the others in calibrating and discriminating individual actual dietary intake. To assess the indicators’ potentials, 89 eligible participants completed a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and donated their digital receipts from the loyalty card programs of the two leading Swiss grocery retailers, which represent 70% of the national grocery market. Compared to absolute food and nutrient intake, correlations between density-based relative food and nutrient intake and food shopping data are stronger. The FSA-NPS DI has the best calibration and discrimination performance in classifying participants’ consumption of nutrients and food groups, and seems to be a superior indicator to estimate nutritional quality of a user’s diet based on digital receipts from grocery shopping in Switzerland.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522615",,"2072-6643",,"10.3390/nu14010159","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522615","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","food shopping quality indicators||FSA-NPS DI||dietary intake||diet monitoring||digital receipts","Estimating dietary intake from grocery shopping data— A comparative validation of relevant indicators in Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-03T03:51:43Z",,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"85121801585",,"000752608100001",,"1","Nutrients","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A major aim of ecology is to upscale attributes of individuals to understand processes at population, community and ecosystem scales. Such attributes are typically described using functional traits, that is, standardised characteristics that impact fitness via effects on survival, growth and/or reproduction. However, commonly used functional traits (e.g. wood density, SLA) are becoming increasingly criticized for not being truly mechanistic and for being questionable predictors of ecological processes.  2. This Special Feature reviews and studies how the metabolome (i.e. the thousands of unique metabolites that underpin physiology) can enhance trait-based ecology and our understanding of plant and ecosystem functioning.  3. In this Editorial, we explore how the metabolome relates to plant functional traits, with reference to life-history trade-offs governing fitness between generations and plasticity shaping fitness within generations. We also identify solutions to challenges of acquiring, interpreting and contextualising metabolome data, and propose a roadmap for integrating the metabolome into ecology.  4. We next summarise the seven studies composing the Special Feature, which use the metabolome to examine mechanisms behind plant community assembly, plant-organismal interactions and effects of plants and soil micro-organisms on ecosystem processes.  5. Synthesis. We demonstrate the potential of the metabolome to improve mechanistic and predictive power in ecology by providing a high-resolution coupling between physiology and fitness. However, applying metabolomics to ecological questions is currently limited by a lack of conceptual, technical and data frameworks, which needs to be overcome to realise the full potential of the metabolome for ecology.",,,,"0022-0477",,"10.1111/1365-2745.13826","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/527698","en","Wiley",,,"ecophysiology||fitness||functional traits||life history||metabolite||metabolomics||plasticity||trade-offs","Functional Traits 2.0: The power of the metabolome for ecology",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2022-01-24T04:44:58Z",,,,"yes",,,,"Ecological consequences of novel plant-soil interactions under changing climate||Novel`interactions and species’ responses to climate change","176044||678841","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","H2020||Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,,,"85122789613",,"000741645500002","J.
