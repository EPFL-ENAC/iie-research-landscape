Here, we investigate factors determining the location and magnitude of humid-heat extremes, framing our analysis around the four regions with the highest values: the southern Persian Gulf, north-central Pakistan, eastern South Asia, and the western Amazon. We find that strong boundary-layer moisture fluxes, together with stability that inhibits moist convection, explain well the timing and location of near-surface humid-heat extremes. These favorable conditions are achieved through regionally distinct factors, including shallow sea breezes in the Persian Gulf and large-scale subsidence in eastern South Asia.

This is a complex task involving many uncertainties in the model design and setup and observations. We analyze the performance of the aerosol-chemistry-climate model SOCOL-AERv2 for three medium-sized volcanic eruptions. We focus on the impact of differences in volcanic plume height and SO2 estimates on the stratospheric aerosol burden. The influence of internal model variability and dynamics are addressed through an ensemble of free-running and nudged simulations at different vertical resolutions. Comparing the modeled evolution of the stratospheric aerosol loading to satellite measurements reveals a good model performance. However, a conclusive validation is complicated by uncertainties in observations and emission estimates. The large spread in emitted sulfur amount and its vertical distribution consequently lead to differences in simulated aerosol burdens. Varying tropopause heights among free-running simulations add to these differences, modulating the amount of sulfur injected into the stratosphere. In nudged mode, volcanic aerosol burden peaks are well reproduced, however changes in convection and clouds affect SO2 oxidation paths and cross-tropopause transport, leading to increased background burdens compared to observations. This effect can be reduced by leaving temperatures unconstrained. A higher vertical resolution of 90 levels increases the stratospheric residence time of sulfate aerosol by reducing the diffusion out of the tropical reservoir. We conclude that the model set-up (vertical resolution and free-running vs. nudged) as well as forcing parameters (volcanic emission strength and plume height) contribute equally to the model uncertainties.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000520870","0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2021JD035472","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/520870","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Modeling the Sulfate Aerosol Evolution After Recent Moderate Volcanic Activity, 2008–2012","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-12-16T04:11:10Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Global Atmospheric Selenium Cycling: Chemical Speciation and Transport Pathways","ETH-39 15-2","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,"85120777759","000729996000040","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","23","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","126","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The heterogeneous oxidation of oleic acid particles by ozone is one of the most frequently investigated model systems. The available kinetic data span a wide range of particle size and ozone concentration and are obtained with different experimental techniques including electrodynamic balance (EDB), optical tweezers, environmental chamber, and aerosol flow tube reactors using mass spectrometry and Raman spectroscopy as detection methods. Existing kinetic and mechanistic analyses, however, reveal systematic differences and inconsistencies that are a matter of ongoing debate. We developed and applied an inverse modeling approach using a kinetic multilayer model (KM-SUB) and Monte Carlo-based global optimization algorithms to 11 literature data sets and an additional new set of EDB data. We were able to reconcile most experimental data with consistent sets of multiphase chemical kinetic parameters. For a unique determination of these parameters, however, further experiments with simultaneous measurement of multiple observables at specific, insightful reaction conditions are required. We tested three different reaction mechanisms and conclude that secondary chemistry involving Criegee intermediates appears crucial to resolve the discrepancies found in earlier studies. Primary ozone chemistry occurs close to the particle surface and secondary reactions seem to dominate in the particle bulk, involving OH formation and radical chain reactions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523776","2472-3452",,"10.1021/acsearthspacechem.1c00232","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523776","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Heterogeneous chemistry||Aerosol||Reaction kinetics||Ozonolysis||Lipids||Inverse modeling||Criegee Intermediate","Ozonolysis of Oleic Acid Aerosol Revisited: Multiphase Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-07T06:26:21Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85120316227","000757012400004","ACS earth space chem.","12","ACS Earth and Space Chemistry","5","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Above 235 K, sparse particles with the special ability to initiate ice formation, ice-nucleating particles (INPs), are responsible for primary ice formation within these clouds. Mineral dust has been found to be one of the most abundant INPs in the atmosphere at temperatures colder than 258 K. However, the extent of the abundance and distribution of INPs remains largely unknown. To better constrain and quantify the impact of mineral dust on ice nucleation, we investigate the frequency of Saharan dust events (SDEs) and their contribution to the INP number concentration at 243 K and at a saturation ratio with respect to liquid water (Sw) of 1.04 at the High Altitude Research Station Jungfraujoch (JFJ; 3580 m a.s.l.) from February to December 2020. Using the single-scattering albedo Ångström exponent retrieved from a nephelometer and an Aethalometer, satellite-retrieved dust mass concentrations, simulated tropospheric residence times, and the attenuated backscatter signal from a ceilometer as proxies, we detected 26 SDEs, which in total contributed to 17 % of the time span analyzed. We found every SDE to show an increase in median INP concentrations compared to those of all non-SDE periods; however, they were not always statistically significant. Median INP concentrations of individual SDEs spread between 1.7 and 161 INP std L−1 and thus 2 orders of magnitude. In the entire period analyzed, 74.7 ± 0.2 % of all INPs were measured during SDEs. Based on satellite-retrieved dust mass concentrations, we argue that mineral dust is also present at JFJ outside of SDEs but at much lower concentrations, thus still contributing to the INP population. We estimate that 97 % of all INPs active in the immersion mode at 243 K and Sw=1.04 at JFJ are dust particles. Overall, we found INP number concentrations to follow a leptokurtic lognormal frequency distribution. We found the INP number concentrations during SDEs to correlate with the ceilometer backscatter signals from a ceilometer located 4.5 km north of JFJ and 1510 m lower in altitude, thus scanning the air masses at the same altitude as JFJ. Using the European ceilometer network allows us to study the atmospheric pathway of mineral dust plumes over a large domain, which we demonstrate in two case studies. These studies showed that mineral dust plumes form ice crystals at cirrus altitudes, which then sediment to lower altitudes. Upon sublimation in dryer air layers, the residual particles are left potentially pre-activated. Future improvements to the sampling lines of INP counters are required to study whether these particles are indeed pre-activated, leading to larger INP number concentrations than reported here.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519707","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-18029-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519707","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Ice-nucleating particles (INPs)","The contribution of Saharan dust to the ice-nucleating particle concentrations at the High Altitude Station Jungfraujoch (3580 m a.s.l.), Switzerland","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-12-09T09:04:42Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85121270733","000729349200001","Atmos. chem. phys.","23","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To overcome this spatial limitation, this study performs a spatial interpolation based on amachine learning method, randomforest, to interpolatemonthly SSR anomalies using a number of climatic variables (various temperature indices, cloud coverage, etc.), time-point indicators (years and months of SSR observations), and geographical characteristics of locations (latitude, longitude, etc.). The predictors that provide the largest explanatory power for interannual variability are diurnal temperature range and cloud coverage. The output of the spatial interpolation is a 0.58 3 0.58 monthly gridded dataset of SSR anomalies with complete land coverage over the period 1961 2019, which is used afterward in a comprehensive trend analysis for (i) each continent separately and (ii) the entire globe. The continental-level analysis reveals the major contributors to the global dimming and brightening. In particular, the global dimming before the 1980s is primarily dominated by negative trends in Asia and North America, whereas Europe and Oceania have been the two largest contributors to the brightening after 1982 and up until 2019.",,,"0894-8755||1520-0442",,"10.1175/JCLI-D-21-0165.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518944","en","American Meteorological Society",,,,"Global Trends in Downward Surface Solar Radiation from Spatial Interpolated Ground Observations during 1961 2019","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-12-06T17:32:05Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: causes of decadal changes of solar radiation","188601","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85119979913","000752649500017","J. climate","23","Journal of Climate","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This allows for an investigation on a potential future shift in monthly foehn frequencies. First, inputs from various atmospheric fields from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) interim reanalysis (ERAI) were used to train an XGBoost model. Here, similar predictive performance to previous work was achieved, showing that foehn can accurately be diagnosed from the coarse synoptic situation. In the next step, the algorithm was generalized to predict foehn based on the Community Earth System Model (CESM) ensemble simulations of a present-day and warming future climate. The best generalization between ERAI and CESM was obtained by including the present-day data in the training procedure and simultaneously optimizing two objective functions, namely, the negative log loss and squared mean loss, on both datasets, respectively. It is demonstrated that the same synoptic fingerprint can be identified in CESM climate simulation data. Finally, predictions for present-day and future simulations were verified and compared for statistical significance. Our model is shown to produce valid output for most months, revealing that south foehn in Altdorf is expected to become more common during spring, while north foehn in Lugano is expected to become more common during summer.",,,"0882-8156||1520-0434",,"10.1175/waf-d-21-0036.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523862","en","American Meteorological Society",,,"Downslope winds||Climate prediction||Ensembles||Forecast verification/skill||Forecasting techniques||Numerical weather prediction/forecasting||Probability forecasts/models/distribution||Statistical forecasting||Classification||Data science||Machine learning||Model interpretation and visualization","Evaluating foehn occurrence in a changing climate based on reanalysis and climate model data using machine learning","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2022-01-07T10:53:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons||Foehn Dynamics - Lagrangian Analysis and Large-Eddy Simulation","787652||181992","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF","H2020||Projekte MINT",,,,"000757394200008","Weather forecast.","6","Weather and Forecasting","36","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Additionally, RCM simulations forced by different global climate models for the historical period (1972–2000) and mid-of-century (2042–2070; under the two emission scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) are analysed. Results point to different regional responses of wheat and barley. In the southernmost regions, results indicate that the main yield driver is spring maximum temperature, while further north a larger dependence on spring precipitation and early winter maximum temperature is observed. Climate change seems to induce severe yield losses in the southern region, mainly due to an increase in spring maximum temperature. On the contrary, a yield increase is projected in the northern regions, with the main driver being early winter warming that stimulates earlier growth. These results warn on the need to implement sustainable agriculture policies, and on the necessity of regional adaptation strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000500031","2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-021-95014-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500031","en","Nature","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The impact of climate change in wheat and barley yields in the Iberian Peninsula","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-08-09T02:55:29Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Risk assessment of critical ecological thresholds in Amazonia and Cerrado","186282||186282||186282","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Brazilian-Swiss Joint Research Programme (full proposal)||Brazilian-Swiss Joint Research Programme (full proposal)||Brazilian-Swiss Joint Research Programme (full proposal)",,,"85111526903","000681066000075","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this simulation, ERA5’s initial and boundary conditions are perturbed with atmospheric changes between 1995–2025 and 2070–2100, projected by CMIP6’s ensemble mean. It was found that future decreases in both mean precipitation and wind gusts over Lake Victoria can be attributed to a weaker mean mesoscale circulation that reduces the trigger for over-lake nighttime convection and decreases the mean wind shear. However, an intensification of extremes is projected for both over-lake precipitation and wind gusts. The observed ∼7 %K−1 Clausius–Clapeyron extreme precipitation scaling is ascribed to increased water vapor content and a compensation of weaker mesoscale circulations and stronger thunderstorm dynamics. More frequent wind gust extremes result from higher wind shear conditions and more compound thunderstorms with both intense rainfall and severe wind gusts. Overall, our study emphasizes Lake Victoria's modulating role in determining regional current and future extremes, in addition to changes expected from the Clausius–Clapeyron relation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515075","2212-0947",,"10.1016/j.wace.2021.100391","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515075","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Lake Victoria||Regional climate modeling||Climate projections||Severe wind gusts||Intense precipitation||Compound events","Future intensification of precipitation and wind gust associated thunderstorms over Lake Victoria","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-11-14T03:56:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85118604495","000720439400001",,,"Weather and Climate Extremes","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The surface energy and mass balances are tightly coupled to the terrestrial water cycle, mainly through the state of soil moisture. An inadequate representation of the terrestrial water cycle will deteriorate the state of the land surface model and introduce biases to the atmospheric model. The validation of land surface models is challenging, as there are very few observations and the soil is highly heterogeneous. In this paper, a validation framework for land surface schemes based on catchment mass balances is presented. The main focus of our development lies in the application to kilometer-resolution numerical weather prediction and climate models, although the approach is scalable in both space and time. The methodology combines information from multiple observation-based datasets. Observational uncertainties are estimated by using independent sets of observations. It is shown that the combination of observation-based datasets and river discharge measurements close the water balance fairly well for the chosen catchments. As a showcase application, the framework is then applied to compare and validate four different versions of TERRA ML, the land surface scheme of the COSMO numerical weather prediction and climate model over five mesoscale catchments in Switzerland ranging from 105 to 1713 km2. Despite large observational uncertainties, validation results clearly suggest that errors in terrestrial storage changes are closely linked to errors in runoff generation and emphasize the crucial role of infiltration processes.",,,"1525-755X||1525-7541",,"10.1175/jhm-d-20-0273.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/525248","en","American Meteorological Society",,,"Atmosphere-land interaction||Water budget/balance||Land surface model||Model evaluation/performance||Numerical weather prediction/forecasting||Regional models","Validation of a High-Resolution Numerical Weather Prediction Land Surface Scheme Using Catchment Water Balances","Review Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2022-01-13T11:18:44Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85122742938","000757437000004","J. hydrometeorol.","12","Journal of Hydrometeorology","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The observed systematic wind speed decline up to around 2010 (stilling) and its subsequent recovery have therefore attracted much attention. While this sequence of downward and upwards trends and good connections to well-established modes of climate variability suggest that stilling could be a manifestation of multidecadal climate variability, a systematic investigation is currently lacking. Here, we use the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE) to decompose internal variability from forced changes in wind speeds. We report that wind speed changes resembling observed stilling and its recovery are well in line with internal climate variability, both under current and future climate conditions. Moreover, internal climate variability outweighs forced changes in wind speeds on 20-year timescales by 1 order of magnitude, despite the fact that smaller, forced changes become relevant in the long run as they represent alterations of mean states. In this regard, we reveal that land use change plays a pivotal role in explaining MPI-GE ensemble-mean wind changes in the representative concentration pathways 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. Our results demonstrate that multidecadal wind speed variability is of greater relevance than forced changes over the 21st century, in particular for wind-related infrastructure like wind energy.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000517538","2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-12-1239-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/517538","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Wind speed stilling and its recovery due to internal climate variability","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-11-29T12:53:46Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85120529002",,,"4","Earth System Dynamics","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We show that urban trees exhibit lower temperatures than urban fabric across most European cities in summer and during hot extremes. Compared to continuous urban fabric, LSTs observed for urban trees are on average 0-4 K lower in Southern European regions and 8-12 K lower in Central Europe. Treeless urban green spaces are overall less effective in reducing LSTs, and their cooling effect is approximately 2-4 times lower than the cooling induced by urban trees.

In the experiments, soil moisture over Australia is set to 61 standard deviation (STD) of an ERA-Interim-derived soil moisture reconstruction for the years 2009–16 and 50 ensemble members are run. The local response is a positive heating anomaly in the dry simulations that results in a thermal low–like circulation anomaly with an anomalous surface low and upper-level anticyclone. Significant differences in convective rainfall over Australia are related to differences in convective instability and associated with changes in near-surface moisture and moisture advection patterns. A circum-hemispheric flow response is identified both in the upper-level flow and in the surface storm tracks that overall resembles a positive southern annular mode–like flow anomaly in the dry simulations. The structure of this atmospheric response strongly depends on the background flow. The results point to a modulation of the hemispheric flow response to the forcing over Australia by El Niño–Southern Oscillation.

However, climate change affects surface solar radiation and will therefore directly influence future PV power generation. We use scenarios from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) for a mitigation (SSP1-2.6) and a fossil-fuel-dependent (SSP5-8.5) pathway in order to quantify climate risk for solar PV in Europe as simulated by the Global Solar Energy Estimator (GSEE). We find that PV potential increases by around 5 % in the mitigation scenario, suggesting a positive feedback loop between climate change mitigation and PV potential. While increased clear-sky radiation and reduced cloud cover go hand in hand in SSP1-2.6, the effect of a decrease in clear-sky radiation is outweighed by a decrease in cloud cover in SSP5-8.5, resulting in an increase in all-sky radiation. Moreover, we find that the seasonal cycle of PV generation changes in most places, as generation grows more strongly in winter than in summer (SSP1-2.6) or increases in summer and declines in winter (SSP5-8.5). We further analyze climate change impacts on the spatial variability of PV power generation. Similar to the effects anticipated for wind energy, we report an increase in the spatial correlations of daily PV production with large inter-model agreement yet relatively small amplitude, implying that PV power balancing between different regions in continental Europe will become more difficult in the future.

But the complex interactions of the dynamical and physical processes controlling the variability in the moisture budget of this sensitive region of the subtropical atmosphere are still not fully understood. Stable water isotopes can provide important information about several of the latter processes, namely subsidence drying, turbulent mixing, and dry and moist convective moistening. In this study, we use high-resolution simulations of the isotope-enabled version of the regional weather and climate prediction model of the Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling (COSMOiso) to investigate predominant moisture transport pathways in the Canary Islands region in the eastern subtropical North Atlantic. Comparison of the simulated isotope signals with multi-platform isotope observations (aircraft, ground- and space-based remote sensing) from a field campaign in summer 2013 shows that COSMOiso can reproduce the observed variability of stable water vapour isotopes on timescales of hours to days, thus allowing us to study the mechanisms that control the subtropical free-tropospheric humidity. Changes in isotopic signals along backward trajectories from the Canary Islands region reveal the physical processes behind the synoptic-scale isotope variability. We identify four predominant moisture transport pathways of mid-tropospheric air, each with distinct isotopic signatures: air parcels originating from the convective boundary layer of the Saharan heat low (SHL) - these are characterised by a homogeneous isotopic composition with a particularly high δD (median mid-tropospheric δDCombining double low line-122‰), which results from dry convective mixing of low-level moisture of diverse origin advected into the SHL; air parcels originating from the free troposphere above the SHL - although experiencing the largest changes in humidity and δD during their subsidence over West Africa, these air parcels typically have lower δD values (median δDCombining double low line-148‰) than air parcels originating from the boundary layer of the SHL; air parcels originating from outside the SHL region, typically descending from tropical upper levels south of the SHL, which are often affected by moist convective injections from mesoscale convective systems in the Sahel - their isotopic composition is much less enriched in heavy isotopes (median δDCombining double low line-175‰) than those from the SHL region; air parcels subsiding from the upper-level extratropical North Atlantic - this pathway leads to the driest and most depleted conditions (median δDCombining double low line-255‰) in the middle troposphere near the Canary Islands. The alternation of these transport pathways explains the observed high variability in humidity and δD on synoptic timescales to a large degree. We further show that the four different transport pathways are related to specific large-scale flow conditions. In particular, distinct differences in the location of the North African mid-level anticyclone and of extratropical Rossby wave patterns occur between the four transport pathways. Overall, this study demonstrates that the adopted Lagrangian isotope perspective enhances our understanding of air mass transport and mixing and offers a sound interpretation of the free-tropospheric variability of specific humidity and isotope composition on timescales of hours to days in contrasting atmospheric conditions over the eastern subtropical North Atlantic.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000516241","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-16319-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/516241","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Disentangling different moisture transport pathways over the eastern subtropical North Atlantic using multi-platform isotope observations and high-resolution numerical modelling","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-11-22T03:56:10Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"MOisture Transport pathways and Isotopologues in water Vapour (MOTIV)","164721","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85119150409","000716429000001","Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we uncover the human imprint on lakes worldwide using hindcasts and projections from five lake models. Reanalysed trends in lake temperature and ice cover in recent decades are extremely unlikely to be explained by pre-industrial climate variability alone. Ice-cover trends in reanalysis are consistent with lake model simulations under historical conditions, providing attribution of lake changes to anthropogenic climate change. Moreover, lake temperature, ice thickness and duration scale robustly with global mean air temperature across future climate scenarios (+0.9 °C °Cair–1, –0.033 m °Cair–1 and –9.7 d °Cair–1, respectively).

Studying compound events often requires a multidisciplinary approach combining domain knowledge of the underlying processes with, for example, statistical methods and climate model outputs. Recently, to aid the development of research on compound events, four compound event types were introduced, namely (a) preconditioned, (b) multivariate, (c) temporally compounding, and (d) spatially compounding events. However, guidelines on how to study these types of events are still lacking. Here, we consider four case studies, each associated with a specific event type and a research question, to illustrate how the key elements of compound events (e.g., analytical tools and relevant physical effects) can be identified. These case studies show that (a) impacts on crops from hot and dry summers can be exacerbated by preconditioning effects of dry and bright springs. (b) Assessing compound coastal flooding in Perth (Australia) requires considering the dynamics of a non-stationary multivariate process. For instance, future mean sea-level rise will lead to the emergence of concurrent coastal and fluvial extremes, enhancing compound flooding risk. (c) In Portugal, deep-landslides are often caused by temporal clusters of moderate precipitation events. Finally, (d) crop yield failures in France and Germany are strongly correlated, threatening European food security through spatially compounding effects. These analyses allow for identifying general recommendations for studying compound events. Overall, our insights can serve as a blueprint for compound event analysis across disciplines and sectors.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000518254","2328-4277",,"10.1029/2021ef002340","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518254","en","Wiley-Blackwell","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Guidelines for Studying Diverse Types of Compound Weather and Climate Events","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-12-02T13:59:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85119835583","000722483400006",,"11","Earth's Future","9","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Several methods for performance-based weighting exist that have the potential to increase the robustness of the change signal. Here we use future projections of an ensemble of three hydrological models forced with climate datasets from the Coordinated Downscaling Experiment - European Domain (EURO-CORDEX). The experiment is set-up for nine river basins spread over Europe that hold different climate and catchment characteristics. We evaluate the ensemble consistency and apply two weighting approaches; the Climate model Weighting by Independence and Performance (ClimWIP) that focuses on meteorological variables and the Reliability Ensemble Averaging (REA) in our study applied to discharge statistics per basin. For basins with a strong climate signal, in Southern and Northern Europe, the consistency in the set of projections is large. For rivers in Central Europe the differences between models become more pronounced. Both weighting approaches assign high weights to single General Circulation Models (GCMs). The ClimWIP method results in ensemble mean weighted changes that differ only slightly from the non-weighted mean. The REA method influences the weighted mean more, but the weights highly vary from basin to basin. We see that high weights obtained through past good performance can provide deviating projections for the future. It is not apparent that the GCM signal dominates the overall change signal, i.e., there is no strong intra GCM consistency. However, both weighting methods favored projections from the same GCM.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000514797","2624-9375",,"10.3389/frwa.2021.713537","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/514797","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Ensemble projections||Performance-based weighting||EURO-CORDEX||Climate change||Hydrological impact||Europe","Estimating Regionalized Hydrological Impacts of Climate Change Over Europe by Performance-Based Weighting of CORDEX Projections","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-11-11T12:59:07Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"European Climate Prediction System","776613","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85119653677","000733799000001",,,"Frontiers in Water","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The analyzed simulations produce low cloud fields that look in general realistic in comparison with satellite images. The evaluation of the radiative balance, however, reveals substantial inter-model differences and an under estimated low cloud cover in most models. Models that simulate increased low cloud cover are found to have a deeper marine boundary layer (MBL), stronger entrainment, and an enhanced latent heat flux. These findings demonstrate that some of the fundamental relations of the MBL are systematically represented by the model ensemble, which implies that the relevant dynamical processes start to become resolved on the model grid at a kilometer-scale resolution. A sensitivity experiment with the COSMO model suggests that differences in the strength of turbulent vertical mixing may contribute to the inter-model spread in cloud cover.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000522036","0026-1165",,"10.2151/jmsj.2021-062","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/522036","en","J-STAGE","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","tropical marine low clouds||stratocumulus||marine boundary layer||convection-resolving models||model intercomparison||DYAMOND project","Inter-model Variability in Convection-Resolving Simulations of Subtropical Marine Low Clouds","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-12-23T03:42:35Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"INFRAEDI-02-2018 I Excellence in Simulation of Weather and Climate in Europe, Phase 2||Exploiting km-resolution climate models in the tropics to constrain climate change uncertainties (trCLIM)||LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constraining uncertainty of multi decadal climate projections","823988||192133||820829","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","EC||SNF||EC","H2020||H2020||Projekte MINT",,,"85118637310","000731006400001","J.

In this region mixing between contrasting air masses, strong convective activity, as well as surface and rain evaporation lead to high variability in the distribution of stable water isotopologues. Using backward trajectories based on high-resolution isotope-enabled model data, we obtain information not only about the source regions of Sahelian air masses, but also about the evolution of (Formula presented.) O and its isotopologue HDO (expressed as (Formula presented.) D) along the pathways of individual air parcels. We sort the full trajectory ensemble into groups with similar transport pathways and hydro-meteorological properties, such as precipitation and relative humidity, and investigate the evolution of the corresponding paired { (Formula presented.) O, (Formula presented.) } distributions. The use of idealized process curves in the { (Formula presented.) O, (Formula presented.) } phase space allows us to attribute isotopic changes to contributions from (a) air mass mixing, (b) Rayleigh condensation during convection, and (c) microphysical processes depleting the vapor beyond the Rayleigh prediction, i.e., partial rain evaporation in unsaturated and isotopic equilibration in saturated conditions. Different combinations of these processes along the trajectory ensembles are found to determine the final isotopic composition in the Sahelian troposphere during the monsoon. The presented Lagrangian framework is a powerful tool for interpreting tropospheric water vapor distributions. In the future, it will be applied to satellite observations of { (Formula presented.)

Enhanced ice formation through secondary ice production (SIP) could account for this discrepancy. Here, in a region over the eastern Swiss Alps, we perform sensitivity studies of additional simulated SIP processes on precipitation formation and surface precipitation intensity. The SIP processes considered include rime splintering, droplet shattering during freezing and breakup through ice–graupel collisions. We simulated the passage of a cold front at Gotschnagrat, a peak at 2281 m a.s.l. (above sea level), on 7 March 2019 with the Consortium for Smallscale Modeling (COSMO), at a 1 km horizontal grid spacing, as part of the RACLETS (Role of Aerosols and CLouds Enhanced by Topography and Snow) field campaign in the Davos region in Switzerland. The largest simulated difference in the ICNC at the surface originated from the breakup simulations. Indeed, breakup caused a 1 to 3 orders of magnitude increase in the ICNC compared to SIP from rime splintering or without SIP processes in the control simulation. The ICNCs from the collisional breakup simulations at Gotschnagrat were in best agreement with the ICNCs measured on a gondola near the surface. However, these simulations were not able to reproduce the ice crystal habits near the surface. Enhanced ICNCs from collisional breakup reduced localized regions of higher precipitation and, thereby, improved the model performance in terms of surface precipitation over the domain.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000509592","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-15115-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/509592","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Modeling and simulation||Microphysics||Mixed-phase clouds||Secondary ice production","Sensitivity of precipitation formation to secondary ice  production in winter orographic mixed-phase clouds","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-10-14T00:29:14Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Exploiting orographic clouds for constraining the sources of ice crystals","175824","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85117146834","000706527100001","Atmos. chem. phys.","19","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, we use the ERA5 and a cyclone tracking scheme combined with a Lagrangian diagnostic to identify the sources of moisture precipitating close to the center of 676 deep North Atlantic cyclones in winters 1979-2018. Moisture uptakes occur predominantly in originally cold and dry air heated over the North Atlantic, in particular, over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, whereas more remote sources from land or the subtropics are less important. Analyzing the dynamical environment of moisture uptakes, we find that moisture precipitating during the cyclone intensification phase originates in the precyclone environment in the cold sectors of preceding cyclones and the cyclone-anticyclone interaction zone. These moisture uptakes are linked to the cyclone's ascent regions via the so-called feeder airstream, a northeasterly cyclone-relative flow that arises due to the cyclone propagation exceeding the advection by the low-level background flow. During the decay phase, more and more of the moisture originates in the cyclone's own cold sector. Consequently, the residence time of precipitating waters in cyclones is short (median of ≈ 2 days) and transport distances are typically less than the distance traveled by the cyclone itself. These findings emphasize the importance of preconditioning by surface fluxes in the precyclone environment for the formation of precipitation in cyclones and suggest an important role for the hand-over of moisture from one cyclone to the next within a storm track.",,,"0022-4928||1520-0469",,"10.1175/JAS-D-21-0105.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510200","en","American Meteorological Society",,,"North Atlantic Ocean||Lagrangian circulation/transport||Trajectories||Extratropical cyclones||Precipitation||Moisture/moisture budget","Sources and transport pathways of precipitating waters in cold-season Deep North Atlantic cyclones","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-10-17T02:59:28Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85116456080","000757425900018","J. atmos. sci.","10","Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences","78","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, these findings have not yet been generalized beyond case studies since at any specific location only very few seasonal events of such rarity occurred in the observational record. In this concept paper, a pragmatic approach to pool seasonal extremes across space is developed and applied to investigate hot summers and cold winters in ERA-Interim and the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LENS). We identify spatial extreme season objects as contiguous regions of extreme seasonal mean temperatures based on statistical modeling. Regional pooling of extreme season objects in CESM-LENS then yields considerable samples of analogs to even the most extreme ERA-Interim events. This approach offers numerous opportunities for systematically analyzing large samples of extreme seasons, and several such analyses are illustrated. We reveal a striking co-occurrence of El Niño to La Niña transitions and the largest ERA-Interim midlatitude extreme summer events. Moreover, we perform a climate model evaluation with regard to extreme season size and intensity measures and estimate how often an extreme winter like the cold North American 2013/14 winter is expected anywhere in midlatitude regions. Furthermore, we present a large set of simulated analogs to this event, which makes it possible to study commonalities and differences of their underlying physical processes. Finally, substantial but spatially varying climatological differences in the size of extreme summer and extreme winter objects are identified.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505318","0894-8755||1520-0442",,"10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0953.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505318","en","American Meteorological Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate variability||Surface temperature||Statistical techniques||Statistics||Climate models||Ensembles||General circulation models||Model evaluation/performance||Reanalysis data||Seasonal variability","A New Framework for Identifying and Investigating Seasonal Climate Extremes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-09-13T04:22:00Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Constraining dynamic and thermodynamic drivers of mid-term regional climate change projections for Northern mid-latitudes","174128||174128","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Ambizione||Ambizione",,,"85114329355","000752634100001","J. climate","19","Journal of Climate","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While there has been a debate on the role of monsoon convective intensities on the UT/LS water vapor accumulations, there are ambiguities with regard to the effects of organized monsoon convection on the spatial distribution of water vapor. We provide insights into this aspect using high precision balloon measurements of water vapor from a high-elevation site Nainital (29.4° N, 79.5° E), India, located in the Himalayan foothills and satellite retrievals of water vapor from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). We also use precipitation estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite (i.e., merged product 3B42 and precipitation radar 3A25 estimates of rain rate and rain type viz convective/stratiform), reanalysis circulation data, as well as numerical model simulations. We first evaluate the MLS estimates of water vapor mixing ratios with in situ high precision hygrometer balloon observations over Nainital. It is seen from our analyses of the MLS data that the LS water vapor distribution is closely linked to the organization of the South Asian monsoon convection and its influence on the UT/LS circulation. This link between LS water vapor distribution and organized monsoon convection is also captured in the in situ observations on 3 August 2016. It is evidenced that periods of organized summer monsoon convective activity over the Indian subcontinent and Bay of Bengal promote divergence of water vapor flux in the UT/LS; additionally the Tibetan anticyclonic circulation causes widespread distribution of the UT/LS water vapor. In addition to the effects of Asian monsoon convection, we also note that global climate drivers such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Brewer–Dobson circulation (BDC), and Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) can contribute to nearly 38% of the UT/LS water vapor variability over the Asian monsoon region. The main result of our study indicates that widespread spatial distribution and accumulation of water vapor in the LS (about 80% of total accumulation between May and August months) tend to co-occur with organized monsoon convection, intensified divergence of water vapor flux in the UT/LS and intensified Tibetan anticyclone. On the other hand, the circulation response and LS water vapor distribution to pre-monsoon localized deep convection tend to have a limited spatial scale confined to Southeast Asia. Results from model experiments suggest that the UT/LS circulation pattern to organized monsoon convection has resemblance to stationary Rossby waves forced by organized latent heating, with the westward extending response larger by about 15° longitudes as compared to that of the pre-monsoon localized deep convection. © 2021 Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany",,,"0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-021-05772-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494999","en","Springer",,,,"Linkage of water vapor distribution in the lower stratosphere to organized Asian summer monsoon convection","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-07-15T10:38:22Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Stratospheric and upper tropospheric processes for better climate predictions.","603557","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,"85105275813","000643188100001","Clim Dyn","7","Climate Dynamics","57","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, estimates of the magnitude of decadal-scale variability from models and observations are uncertain, limiting determination of the fraction of warming attributable to external forcing. Here, we use statistical learning to extract a fingerprint of climate change that is robust to different model representations and magnitudes of internal variability. We find a best estimate forced warming trend of 0.8°C over the past 40 years, slightly larger than observed. It is extremely likely that at least 85% is attributable to external forcing based on the median variability across climate models. Detection remains robust even when evaluated against models with high variability and if decadal-scale variability were doubled. This work addresses a long-standing limitation in attributing warming to external forcing and opens up opportunities even in the case of large model differences in decadal-scale variability, model structural uncertainty, and limited observational records.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000513307","2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.abh4429","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/513307","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Robust detection of forced warming in the presence of potentially large climate variability","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-11-02T16:43:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Combining theory with Big Data?

This has been possible thanks to a considerable effort in developing comprehensive ensembles of RCM projections, especially for Europe, in the EURO-CORDEX community (Jacob et al., 2014, 2020). As of end of 2019, EURO-CORDEX has developed a set of 55 historical and scenario projections (RCP8.5) using 8 driving global climate models (GCMs) and 11 RCMs. This article presents the ensemble including its design. We target the analysis to better characterize the quality of the RCMs by providing an evaluation of these RCM simulations over a number of classical climate variables and extreme and impact-oriented indices for the period 1981–2010. For the main variables, the model simulations generally agree with observations and reanalyses. However, several systematic biases are found as well, with shared responsibilities among RCMs and GCMs: Simulations are overall too cold, too wet, and too windy compared to available observations or reanalyses. Some simulations show strong systematic biases on temperature, others on precipitation or dynamical variables, but none of the models/simulations can be defined as the best or the worst on all criteria. The article aims at supporting a proper use of these simulations within a climate services context.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505946",,,"10.1029/2019JD032344","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505946","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate change||regional climate modeling||EURO-CORDEX||climate model evaluation||model biases||European climate","Evaluation of the Large EURO-CORDEX Regional Climate Model Ensemble","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-09-18T02:55:49Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85112726943","000694671900022",,"17","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","126","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The quantitative role of early summer soil moisture (ESSM) trends, versus that of trends in atmospheric circulations and other large-scale drivers (LS), in explaining the long-term trends in summer warming have not been investigated so far. Using regional climate simulations with forced large-scale circulation and different possible initial soil moisture, we show that the increasing ESSM deficit explains almost all of the warming summer trend (1980–2011) in Western Europe (∼0.1–0.2°C.decade−1, p-value < 0.05). It also contributed a similar amount to summer warming trend in Eastern Europe, although here LS explains a much larger part of the overall warming.

However, SSWs themselves are difficult to predict, with a predictability limit of around 1 to 2 weeks. The predictability limit for determining the type of event, i.e., wave-1 or wave-2 events, is even shorter. Here we analyze the dynamics of the vortex breakdown and look for early signs of the vortex deceleration process at lead times beyond the current predictability limit of SSWs. To this end, we employ a mode decomposition analysis to study the potential vorticity (PV) equation on the 850 K isentropic surface by decomposing each term in the PV equation using the empirical orthogonal functions of the PV. The first principal component (PC) is an indicator of the strength of the polar vortex and starts to increase from around 25 d before the onset of SSWs, indicating a deceleration of the polar vortex. A budget analysis based on the mode decomposition is then used to characterize the contribution of the linear and nonlinear PV advection terms to the rate of change (tendency) of the first PC. The linear PV advection term is the main contributor to the PC tendency at 25 to 15 d before the onset of SSW events for both wave-1 and wave-2 events. The nonlinear PV advection term becomes important between 15 and 1 d before the onset of wave-2 events, while the linear PV advection term continues to be the main contributor for wave-1 events. By linking the PV advection to the PV flux, we find that the linear PV flux is important for both types of SSWs from 25 to 15 d prior to the events but with different wave-2 spatial patterns, while the nonlinear PV flux displays a wave-3 wave pattern, which finally leads to a split of the polar vortex. Early signs of SSW events arise before the 1- to 2-week prediction limit currently observed in state-of-the-art prediction systems, while signs for the type of event arise at least 1 week before the event onset.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505291","2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-2-841-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505291","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Emergence of representative signals for sudden stratospheric warmings beyond current predictable lead times","Journal Article||Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-09-12T21:15:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application||Dynamical constraints for the predictability of heat waves in current future climates","170523||847456","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||H2020",,"99564917",,,"Weather Clim.

Consequently, FIR measurements need to be made from high-altitude sites or on board airborne platforms or satellites. This paper describes the dataset of FIR spectral radiances of the atmosphere and snow surface emission measured in the 100-1000 cm(-1) range by the Far-Infrared Radiation Mobile Observation System (FIRMOS) instrument during a 2-month campaign carried out from the ground at about 3000m of altitude on the top of Mt. Zugspitze in the German Alps in 2018-2019. This campaign is part of the preparatory activity of a new space FIR mission, named Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring (FORUM), which is under development by the European Space Agency (ESA). The dataset acquired during the campaign also includes all the additional measurements needed to provide a full characterisation of the observed atmospheric state and the local atmospheric and surface conditions. It includes co-located spectral measurements in the infrared range from 400 to 1800 cm(-1); lidar backscatter profiles; radio soundings of temperature, humidity and aerosol backscatter profiles; local weather parameters; and snow/ice microphysical properties. These measurements provide a unique dataset that can be used to perform radiative closure experiments to improve modelling parameters in the FIR that are not well-characterised, such as water vapour spectroscopy, scattering properties of cirrus clouds, and the FIR emissivity of the surface covered by snow.

Biases in the SW fluxes from AeroCom models are quantitatively related to biases in AOD and land surface albedo by using their radiative kernels. Over ocean, AOD contributes about 25% to the 60˚S - 60˚N mean SW flux bias for the multi-model mean (MMM) result. Over land, AOD and land surface albedo contribute about 40% and 30%, respectively, to the 60˚S-60˚N mean SW flux bias for the MMM result. Furthermore, the spatial patterns of the SW flux biases derived from the radiative kernels are very similar to those between models and CERES observation, with the correlation coefficient of 0.6 over ocean and 0.76 over land for MMM using data of 2010. Satellite data used in this evaluation are derived independently from each other, consistencies in their bias patterns when compared with model simulations suggest that these patterns are robust. This highlights the importance of evaluating related variables in a synergistic manner to provide an unambiguous assessment of the models, as results from single parameter assessments are often confounded by measurement uncertainty. Model biases in land surface albedos can and must be corrected to accurately calculate TOA flux. We also compare the AOD trend from three models with the observation-based counterpart. These models reproduce all notable trends in AOD except the decreasing trend over eastern China and the adjacent oceanic regions due to limitations in the emission data set.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000507982","1942-2466",,"10.1029/2021MS002584","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507982","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","aerosols||radiative flux||surface albedo","Understanding Top-of-Atmosphere Flux Bias in the AeroCom Phase III Models: A Clear-Sky Perspective","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-10-02T02:42:44Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85115717466","000702262000012",,"9","Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this teleconnection. These mechanisms include both tropical and extratropical pathways, contributing to anomalous trade winds and static stability over the TNA region. The TNA SST response to ENSO has been suggested to be nonlinear. Yet the overall linearity of the ENSO-TNA teleconnection via the two pathways remains unclear. Here we use reanalysis data to confirm that the SST anomaly (SSTA) in the TNA is nonlinear with respect to the strength of the SST forcing in the tropical Pacific, as further increases in El Niño magnitudes cease to create further increases of the TNA SSTA. We further show that the tropical pathway is more linear than the extratropical pathway by sub-dividing the inter-basin connection into extratropical and tropical pathways. This is confirmed by a climate model participating in the CMIP5. The extratropical pathway is modulated by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the location of the SSTA in the Pacific, but this modulation insufficiently explains the nonlinearity in TNA SSTA. As neither extratropical nor tropical pathways can explain the nonlinearity, this suggests that external factors are at play. Further analysis shows that the TNA SSTA is highly influenced by the preconditioning of the tropical Atlantic SST. This preconditioning is found to be associated with the NAO through SST-tripole patterns.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000489136","0894-8755||1520-0442",,"10.1175/jcli-d-20-0952.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/489136","en","American Meteorological Society","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Dynamics||ENSO||Teleconnections||Tropical variability","Non-linearity in the pathway of El Niño-Southern Oscillation to the tropical North Atlantic","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-06-10T14:35:00Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application","170523","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,"85111895714","000752587000019","J. climate","17","Journal of Climate","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Variations in z0 are substantial across different  types of land cover from typically less than 1 mm over fresh snow or sand deserts up to more than 1 m over urban areas or forests. In this study, we revise the parameterizations and parameter choices related to z0 in the Community Land Model 5.1 (CLM), the land component of the Community Earth System Model 2.1.2 (CESM). We propose a number modifications for z0 in CLM, which are guided by observational data. Most importantly, we increase the z0 for all types of forests, while we decrease the momentum z0 for bare soil, snow, glaciers, and crops. We then assess the effect of those modifications in land-only (CLM) and land-atmosphere coupled (CESM) simulations. Diurnal variations of the land surface temperature (LST) are dampened in regions with forests, while they are amplified over warm deserts. These changes mitigate model biases compared to MODIS remote sensing observations, which have been identified in several earlier studies. The alterations in LST are mostly stronger during the day than at night. For example, the LST at 13:30 increases by more than 4.80 K during boreal summer across the entire Sahara. The induced changes in the diurnal variability of air temperatures at the bottom of the atmosphere generally oppose changes in LST in sign and are of smaller magnitude. Further, winds close to the land surface accelerate in areas where the momentum z0 was lowered, such as the Sahara desert, the Middle East, or the Antarctica, and decelerate in regions with forests. Overall, this study highlights that the current representation of z0 in CLM is not in agreement with observational constraints for several types of land cover. The resultant model modifications are shown to considerably alter the simulated climate in terms of temperatures and wind speed at the land surface.","application/zip||application/xml||text/plain||application/x-hdf5||application/netcdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000503165",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/503165","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Land-atmosphere interactions||Surface roughness||Earth system modelling||Land surface modelling","Supplementary Material of ""Impacts of a Revised Surface Roughness Parameterization in the Community Land Model 5.1""","Model","Open access",,,,,"2021-08-31T06:31:07Z",,"15 years","292278994-08-17T07:12:55Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,"CLimate IMPacts of Utilizing Land in Switzerland and Europe (CLIMPULSE)","172715||172715||172715||172715||172715||172715","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This characterization was made possible by thousands (2500) of sondes distributed to measure circulations on meso- (200 km) and larger (500 km) scales, roughly 400 h of flight time by four heavily instrumented research aircraft; four global-class research vessels; an advanced ground-based cloud observatory; scores of autonomous observing platforms operating in the upper ocean (nearly 10 000 profiles), lower atmosphere (continuous profiling), and along the air-sea interface; a network of water stable isotopologue measurements; targeted tasking of satellite remote sensing; and modeling with a new generation of weather and climate models. In addition to providing an outline of the novel measurements and their composition into a unified and coordinated campaign, the six distinct scientific facets that EUREC4A explored - from North Brazil Current rings to turbulence-induced clustering of cloud droplets and its influence on warm-rain formation - are presented along with an overview of EUREC4A's outreach activities, environmental impact, and guidelines for scientific practice.

Here, we illustrate that strong relationships between observables and future climate across an ensemble can arise from common structural model assumptions with few degrees of freedom. Such cases have the potential to produce strong yet overconfident constraints when processes are represented in a common, oversimplified fashion throughout the ensemble. We consider these issues in the context of a collection of published constraints and argue that although emergent constraints are potentially powerful tools for understanding ensemble response variation and relevant observables, their naive application to reduce uncertainties in unknown climate responses could lead to bias and overconfidence in constrained projections. The prevalence of this thinking has led to literature in which statements are made on the probability bounds of key climate variables that were confident yet inconsistent between studies. Together with statistical robustness and a mechanism, assessments of climate responses must include multiple lines of evidence to identify biases that can arise from shared, oversimplified modelling assumptions that impact both present and future climate simulations in order to mitigate against the influence of shared structural biases.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000503340","2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-12-899-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/503340","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The potential for structural errors in emergent constraints","Review Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-09-01T02:41:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113378536","000688074300001",,"3","Earth System Dynamics","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We then show that a more holistic understanding of the thermal environment at the landscape and urban, building, and individual scales supports the identification of numerous sustainable opportunities to keep people cooler.

High heat stress can also reduce physical work capacity and motor-cognitive performances, with consequences for productivity, and increase the risk of occupational health problems. Almost half of the global population and more than 1 billion workers are exposed to high heat episodes and about a third of all exposed workers have negative health effects. However, excess deaths and many heat-related health risks are preventable, with appropriate heat action plans involving behavioural strategies and biophysical solutions. Extreme heat events are becoming permanent features of summer seasons worldwide, causing many excess deaths. Heat-related morbidity and mortality are projected to increase further as climate change progresses, with greater risk associated with higher degrees of global warming. Particularly in tropical regions, increased warming might mean that physiological limits related to heat tolerance (survival) will be reached regularly and more often in coming decades. Climate change is interacting with other trends, such as population growth and ageing, urbanisation, and socioeconomic development, that can either exacerbate or ameliorate heat-related hazards. Urban temperatures are further enhanced by anthropogenic heat from vehicular transport and heat waste from buildings. Although there is some evidence of adaptation to increasing temperatures in high-income countries, projections of a hotter future suggest that without investment in research and risk management actions, heat-related morbidity and mortality are likely to increase.",,,"0140-6736||0023-7507||1474-547X","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502296||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502424","10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01208-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504450","en","Elsevier",,,,"Hot weather and heat extremes: health risks","Review Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-08-26T10:52:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113136825","000687280700026","Lancet","10301","The Lancet","398","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using several versions of the COSMO-CLM-Community model, ERA-Interim reanalysis and eight global climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) were dynamically downscaled with horizontal grid spacings of 0.44g (g1/4g50gkm), 0.22g (g1/4g25gkm), and 0.11g (g1/4g12gkm) over the CORDEX domains Europe, South Asia, East Asia, Australasia, and Africa. This major effort resulted in 80 regional climate simulations publicly available through the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) web portals for use in impact studies and climate scenario assessments. Here we review the production of these simulations and assess their results in terms of mean near-surface temperature and precipitation to aid the future design of the COSMO-CLM model simulations. It is found that a domain-specific parameter tuning is beneficial, while increasing horizontal model resolution (from 50 to 25 or 12gkm grid spacing) alone does not always improve the performance of the simulation. Moreover, the COSMO-CLM performance depends on the driving data. This is generally more important than the dependence on horizontal resolution, model version, and configuration. Our results emphasize the importance of performing regional climate projections in a coordinated way, where guidance from both the global (GCM) and regional (RCM) climate modeling communities is needed to increase the reliability of the GCM-RCM modeling chain.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000502425","1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-14-5125-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502425","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"COSMO-CLM regional climate simulations in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) framework: A review","Review Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-08-27T03:01:06Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85113243653","000686635700002","Geosci. model dev.","8","Geoscientific Model Development","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Dynamical adjustment techniques aim to remove unforced variability from a target variable by identifying patterns associated with circulation, thus effectively acting as a filter for dynamically induced variability. The forced contributions are interpreted as the variation that is unexplained by circulation. However, dynamical adjustment of precipitation at local scales remains challenging because of large natural variability and the complex, nonlinear relationship between precipitation and circulation particularly in heterogeneous terrain. Building on variational autoencoders, we introduce a novel statistical model - the Latent Linear Adjustment Autoencoder (LLAAE) - that enables estimation of the contribution of a coarse-scale atmospheric circulation proxy to daily precipitation at high resolution and in a spatially coherent manner. To predict circulation-induced precipitation, the Latent Linear Adjustment Autoencoder combines a linear component, which models the relationship between circulation and the latent space of an autoencoder, with the autoencoder's nonlinear decoder. The combination is achieved by imposing an additional penalty in the cost function that encourages linearity between the circulation field and the autoencoder's latent space, hence leveraging robustness advantages of linear models as well as the flexibility of deep neural networks. We show that our model predicts realistic daily winter precipitation fields at high resolution based on a 50-member ensemble of the Canadian Regional Climate Model at 12gkm resolution over Europe, capturing, for instance, key orographic features and geographical gradients. Using the Latent Linear Adjustment Autoencoder to remove the dynamic component of precipitation variability, forced thermodynamic components are expected to remain in the residual, which enables the uncovering of forced precipitation patterns of change from just a few ensemble members. We extend this to quantify the forced pattern of change conditional on specific circulation regimes. Future applications could include, for instance, weather generators emulating climate model simulations of regional precipitation, detection and attribution at subcontinental scales, or statistical downscaling and transfer learning between models and observations to exploit the typically much larger sample size in models compared to observations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000501918","1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-14-4977-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/501918","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Latent Linear Adjustment Autoencoder v1.0: A novel method for estimating and emulating dynamic precipitation at high resolution","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-08-24T04:24:42Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Constraining dynamic and thermodynamic drivers of mid-term regional climate change projections for Northern mid-latitudes","174128","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,"85112826084","000685223400002","Geosci. model dev.","8","Geoscientific Model Development","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is unclear whether temperatures could have exceeded these anomalies even without further climate change. Developing storylines and quantifying the highest possible temperature levels is challenging given the lack of a long homogeneous time series and methodological framework to assess them. Here, we address this challenge by analyzing summer temperatures in a nearly 5000-yr preindustrial climate model simulation, performed with the Community Earth System Model CESM1. To assess how anomalous temperatures could get, we compare storylines generated by three different methods: 1) a return-level estimate, deduced from a generalized extreme value distribution; 2) a regression model, based on dynamic and thermodynamic heat wave drivers; and 3) a novel ensemble boosting method, generating large samples of reinitialized extreme heat waves in the long climate simulation. All methods provide consistent temperature estimates, suggesting that historical exceptional heat waves such as those in Chicago in 1995, Europe in 2003, and Russia in 2010 could have been substantially exceeded even in the absence of further global warming. These estimated unseen heat waves are caused by the same drivers as moderate observed events, but with more anomalous patterns. Moreover, altered contributions of circulation and soil moisture to temperature anomalies include amplified feedbacks in the surface energy budget. The methodological framework of combining different storyline approaches of heat waves with magnitudes beyond the observational record may ultimately contribute to adaptation and to the stress testing of ecosystems or socioeconomic systems to increase resilience to extreme climate stressors.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000499221","0894-8755||1520-0442",,"10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0916.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499221","en","American Meteorological Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Atmosphere-land interaction||Atmospheric circulation||Extreme events||Summer||Warm season||Surface temperature||Regression analysis||Statistical techniques||Ensembles","Very Rare Heat Extremes: Quantifying and Understanding Using Ensemble Reinitialization","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-08-04T00:03:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Understanding and quantifying the occurrence of  very rare climate extremes in a changing climate","178778","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85111080096","000677665400008","J. climate","16","Journal of Climate","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Climate sensitive decision-making in companies is vital to addressing the urgent need for making societies resilient to climate change and entailed risks. Providing and using state-of-the-art scientific knowledge in decision-making, an integral aspect of climate services, poses great challenges for climate scientists and decision-makers. This article aims to contribute to more informed decision-making processes in climate adaptation by addressing the question “How can climate scientists practically implement a transdisciplinary (TD) collaboration with an industry partner to reduce the gap between climate science and decision-making in industry?”. We present an engagement framework that provides guidance to address this question. This framework conceptualizes the engagement using two spheres of interests offering the opportunity to explore and widen their overlap as a common space. We present a case study where we apply this framework to a TD collaboration for climate service provision with a Swiss hydropower industry stakeholder; leading to four practical recommendations for effectively using the proposed framework: (1) Secure an anchor person at management level of the decision-maker entity, (2) Be prepared to invest time into triggering and maintaining active engagement by all collaborators, (3) From the start, communicate the open nature of insights and solutions from the engagement process, (4) Be aware that you are working in a field of tension. The presented engagement framework and practical recommendations are particularly beneficial for climate scientists that are not yet familiar with TD collaborations and enables co-development of bespoke climate services.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492647","2405-8807",,"10.1016/j.cliser.2021.100237","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492647","en","Elsevier BV","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Research-practice collaboration||Transdisciplinary||Hydropower||Usability gap||Decision-making||Climate change","Widening the common space to reduce the gap between climate science and decision-making in industry","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-07-02T07:47:21Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85108830378","000703656300005",,,"Climate Services","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

At these scales, deep convective processes can be partially resolved explicitly by the model dynamics. Next to horizontal resolution, other aspects such as the applied numerical methods, the use of the hydrostatic approximation, and time step size are factors that might influence a model's ability to resolve deep convective processes.  In order to improve our understanding of the role of these factors, a model intercomparison between the nonhydrostatic COSMO model and the hydrostatic Integrated Forecast System (IFS) from ECMWF has been conducted. Both models have been run with different spatial and temporal resolutions in order to simulate 2 summer days over Europe with strong convection. The results are analyzed with a focus on vertical wind speed and precipitation.  Results show that even at around 3 km horizontal grid spacing the effect of the hydrostatic approximation seems to be negligible. However, time step proves to be an important factor for deep convective processes, with a reduced time step generally allowing for higher updraft velocities and thus more energy in vertical velocity spectra, in particular for shorter wavelengths. A shorter time step is also causing an earlier onset and peak of the diurnal cycle. Furthermore, the amount of horizontal diffusion plays a crucial role for deep convection with more diffusion generally leading to larger convective cells and higher precipitation intensities. The study also shows that for both models the parameterization of deep convection leads to lower updraft and precipitation intensities and biases in the diurnal cycle with a precipitation peak which is too early.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000500382","1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-14-4617-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500382","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Model intercomparison of COSMO 5.0 and IFS 45r1 at kilometer-scale grid spacing","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-08-11T04:49:03Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"INFRAEDI-02-2018 I Excellence in Simulation of Weather and Climate in Europe, Phase 2","823988","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85111775538","000678371200001","Geosci. model dev.","7","Geoscientific Model Development","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Observations are critical for evaluating and constraining the process. To this end, aerosol size distributions, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), hygroscopicity, and lidar-derived vertical velocities were observed in alpine mixed-phase clouds during the Role of Aerosols and Clouds Enhanced by Topography on Snow (RACLETS) field campaign in the Davos, Switzerland, region during February and March 2019. Data from the mountain-top site of Weissfluhjoch (WFJ) and the valley site of Davos Wolfgang are studied. These observations are coupled with a state-of-the-art droplet activation parameterization to investigate the aerosol–cloud droplet link in mixed-phase clouds. The mean CCN-derived hygroscopicity parameter, κ, at WFJ ranges between 0.2–0.3, consistent with expectations for continental aerosols. κ tends to decrease with size, possibly from an enrichment in organic material associated with the vertical transport of fresh ultrafine particle emissions (likely from biomass burning) from the valley floor in Davos. The parameterization provides a droplet number that agrees with observations to within ∼ 25 %. We also find that the susceptibility of droplet formation to aerosol concentration and vertical velocity variations can be appropriately described as a function of the standard deviation of the distribution of updraft velocities, σw, as the droplet number never exceeds a characteristic limit, termed the “limiting droplet number”, of ∼ 150–550 cm−3, which depends solely on σw. We also show that high aerosol levels in the valley, most likely from anthropogenic activities, increase the cloud droplet number, reduce cloud supersaturation (< 0.1 %), and shift the clouds to a state that is less susceptible to changes in aerosol concentrations and very sensitive to vertical velocity variations. The transition from an aerosol to velocity-limited regime depends on the ratio of cloud droplet number to the limiting droplet number, as droplet formation becomes velocity limited when this ratio exceeds 0.65. Under such conditions, droplet size tends to be minimal, reducing the likelihood that large drops are present that would otherwise promote glaciation through rime splintering and droplet shattering. Identifying regimes where droplet number variability is dominated by dynamical – rather than aerosol – changes is key for interpreting and constraining when and which types of aerosol effects on clouds are active.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000498798","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-10993-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/498798","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"On the drivers of droplet variability in alpine mixed-phase clouds","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-07-31T02:30:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Exploiting orographic clouds for constraining the sources of ice crystals","175824","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85111076981","000675388100005","Atmos. chem. phys.","14","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The relative role of air temperature and rainfall in determining the stable isotope composition of precipitation changes along the west-to-east transect, with air temperature being highly correlated with δ18Op at daily and monthly timescales, while a few sites along the transect show a significant negative correlation with precipitation. The highest air temperature-δ18Op dependency is found for a station located in the Pyrenees. Frontal systems associated with North Atlantic cyclones are the dominant mechanism inducing precipitation in this region, particularly in winter. This study allows an exploration of the role of air mass source and trajectory in determining the isotopic composition of rainfall in northern Iberia by characterizing the moisture uptake for three of the seven stations. The importance of continental versus marine moisture sources is evident, with clear seasonal and spatial variations. In addition, the type of precipitation (convective versus frontal rainfall) plays a key role, with convective rainfall associated with higher δ18Op values.

Numerous modelling studies have indicated that alterations at the land surface can result in considerable changes in precipitation. Yet land-cover-induced precipitation changes remain largely unconstrained by observations. Here we use an observation-based continental-scale statistical model to show that forestation of rain-fed agricultural land in Europe triggers substantial changes in precipitation. Locally, we find an increase in precipitation following forestation, in particular in winter, which is supported by a paired rain-gauge analysis. In addition, forests are estimated to increase downwind precipitation in most regions during summer. By contrast, the downwind effect in winter is positive in coastal areas but near neutral and negative in Continental and Northern Europe, respectively. The combined local and non-local effects of a realistic reforestation scenario, constrained by sustainability safeguards, are estimated to increase summer precipitation by 7.6 ± 6.7% on average over Europe (0.13 ± 0.11 mm d–1), potentially offsetting a substantial part of the projected precipitation decrease from climate change. We therefore conclude that land-cover-induced alterations of precipitation should be considered when developing land management strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493339","1752-0908||1752-0894",,"10.1038/s41561-021-00773-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493339","en","Nature Publishing Group","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Land cover and land use||Precipitation||Hydrology||Climate change||Europe","Empirical Estimate of Forestation-Induced Precipitation Changes in Europe","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-07-06T17:18:14Z","2022-01-05",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"CLimate IMPacts of Utilizing Land in Switzerland and Europe (CLIMPULSE)","172715","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85109331832","000669835000001","Nat.

O3 is a secondary pollutant with adverse effects on population health and ecosystems and with negative impacts on climate, acting as greenhouse gas. Most of these studies focused on spring 2020 (i.e. March–May) and on observations in the planetary boundary layer (PBL), mostly in the vicinity of urban agglomerates. Here, we analyzed the variability of O3 above the PBL of northern Italy in 2020 by using continuous observations carried out at a high mountain WMO/GAW global station in Italy (Mt. Cimone–CMN; 44°12' N, 10°42' E, 2165 m a.s.l.). Low O3 monthly anomalies were observed during spring (MAM) and summer (JJA), when periods of low O3 intertwined with periods with higher O3, within climatological ranges. A similar variability was observed for O3 precursors like NO2 and 15 anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic carbons, but the systematic O3 anomalies were not reflected in these variables. The analysis of meteorological variables and diel O3 cycles did not suggest major changes in the vertical transport related to the thermal circulation system in the mountain area. The analysis of five days back-trajectories suggested that the observed O3 anomalies cannot be explained by differences in the synoptic-scale circulation with respect to the previous years alone. On the other hand, the characterization of two transport patterns (i.e. air masses from the regional PBL or from the free troposphere) and the analysis of back-trajectories suggested an important contribution of transport from the continental PBL during the periods with the lowest O3 at CMN. When proxies of air mass transport from the regional PBL are considered, a lower NOx content was pointed out with respect to the previous years, suggesting a lower O3 production in a NOx-limited atmosphere. Our study suggested for the first time that, during MAM and JJA 2020, the reduced anthropogenic emissions related to the COVID-19 restrictions lowered the amount of this short-lived climate forcer/pollutant at remote locations above the PBL over northern Italy. This work suggests the importance of limiting anthropogenic precursor emissions for decreasing the O3 amount at remote locations and in upper atmospheric layers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494189","1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ac0b6a","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494189","en","Institute of Physics Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","COVID-19||ozone||air mass transport||mitigation||Europe||Po basin","Negative ozone anomalies at a high mountain site in northern Italy during 2020: a possible role of COVID-19 lockdowns?","Other Journal Item","Open access",,,,,"2021-07-13T02:27:24Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85110553825","000669652300001","Environ.

Overall, the flight emissions have decreased in 2019 compared to the base period 2016-2018, and more than half of the departments have already met their pledged 2025 reduction targets. This conclusion should be interpreted with care since year-to-year variations in the flight activity and therefore emissions are large. The data however show that in 2019 almost all employment categories contributed to this decrease, but overall less burden for emissions reductions are put on early career researchers (doctoral students) compared to more established researchers and professors, and emissions from guests have been cut the most (in %).  For the base period, long-haul flights caused most of the emissions (86 %) although these only come from 38 % of the flights. For 2019, these numbers are 86 % and 41 %, respectively. Policies addressing or discouraging short distance flights are often aimed at flights that can be replaced by other means of transport. For the period 2016-2018, 38 % of the long-haul flights were also related to non long-haul flights, and 34 % of all short flights are related to a long-haul flight. Even thought most (94 %) flights recorded during the base period are economy class, 19 % of the emissions come from business and first class flights. This number decreased to 16 % in 2019.    These numbers show that there is still potential for halving the emissions from business (and first) class flights just by changing flight class, and by cutting short flights that are not connected to other flights.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000498721",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/498721","en","ETH Zurich, Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","flight emissions||ETH Zurich||Academic travel||Emissions||emissions reductions||ETH air travel project","The ETH Zurich flight emission project: Emissions 2016-2019","Report","Open access",,,,,"2021-07-30T13:27:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Our results show that the seasonal ensemble predictions have high prediction skill for MCAOs over the Nordic Seas for about 20 days starting from November initial conditions. To study causal drivers of MCAOs, we utilize a causal effect network approach applied to the atmospheric reanalysis ERA‐Interim and identify local sea surface temperature and atmospheric circulation patterns over Scandinavia as valuable predictors.

There is a well-founded hope that a more accurate representation of the soil moisture-precipitation feedback would improve the simulation of summer precipitation on daily to seasonal, to climate time scales. However, uncertainties have persistently remained as the simulated feedback is strongly sensitive to the model representation of deep convection. Here we assess the feedback representation using a GPU-accelerated version of the regional climate model COSMO.We simulate and compare the impact of continentalscale springtime soil moisture anomalies on summer precipitation at convection-resolving (2.2 km) and convectionparameterizing resolution (12 km). We conduct reanalysis-driven simulations of 10 summer seasons (1999-2008) in continental Europe.While both simulations qualitatively agree on a positive sign of soil moisture-induced precipitation, they strongly differ in precipitation frequency: when convection is parameterized, wetter soil predominantly leads tomore frequent precipitation events, and when convection is treated explicitly, they primarily become more intense. The results indicate that the sensitivity to soil moisture is stronger with parameterized convection, suggesting that the land surface-atmosphere coupling may be overestimated. In addition, the feedback's sensitivity in complex terrain is assessed for soil perturbations of different horizontal scales. The convection-resolving simulations confirm a negative feedback for subcontinental soil moisture anomalies, which manifests itself in a local decrease of wet-hour frequency. However, the intensity feedback reinforces precipitation events at the same time (positive feedback). The two processes are represented differently in simulations with explicit and parameterized convection, explaining much of the difference between the two simulations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488452","0894-8755||1520-0442",,"10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0415.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488452","en","American Meteorological Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Atmosphere-land interaction||Climate models||Cloud resolving models||Interannual variability||Seasonal variability","The continental-scale soil moisture-precipitation feedback in europe with parameterized and explicit convection","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-06-07T02:32:22Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85106934764",,"J. climate","13","Journal of Climate","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A total of 23 simulations run with a horizontal grid spacing of ∼ 3 km, driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis, and performed by 22 European research groups are analysed. Six different regional climate models (RCMs) are represented in the ensemble. The simulations are compared against available high-resolution precipitation observations and coarse resolution (∼ 12 km) RCMs with parameterized convection. The model simulations and observations are compared with respect to mean precipitation, precipitation intensity and frequency, and heavy precipitation on daily and hourly timescales in different seasons. The results show that kilometer-scale models produce a more realistic representation of precipitation than the coarse resolution RCMs. The most significant improvements are found for heavy precipitation and precipitation frequency on both daily and hourly time scales in the summer season. In general, kilometer-scale models tend to produce more intense precipitation and reduced wet-hour frequency compared to coarse resolution models. On average, the multi-model mean shows a reduction of bias from ∼ −40% at 12 km to ∼ −3% at 3 km for heavy hourly precipitation in summer. Furthermore, the uncertainty ranges i.e. the variability between the models for wet hour frequency is reduced by half with the use of kilometer-scale models. Although differences between the model simulations at the kilometer-scale and observations still exist, it is evident that these simulations are superior to the coarse-resolution RCM simulations in the representing precipitation in the present-day climate, and thus offer a promising way forward for investigations of climate and climate change at local to regional scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492862","0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-021-05708-w","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492862","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Regional climate models||Multi-model ensemble simulations||Kilometer-scale resolution||Precipitation","The first multi-model ensemble of regional climate simulations at kilometer-scale resolution, part I: evaluation of precipitation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-07-03T00:57:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Cloud-resolving climate modeling on future supercomputing platform||European Climate Prediction System","154486||776613","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","Sinergia||H2020",,,"85104159180","000638541000001","Clim Dyn","1-2","Climate Dynamics","57","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Many 2- to 7-day ensemble forecasts predicted the maximum of the extreme precipitation and the location of the upper-level PV cut-off too far to the east. This eastward shift primarily resulted from an underestimation of the cut-off intensity two days before the HIW and the subsequent downstream propagation and amplification of these errors in the vicinity of Sanchez. Improving the representation of the cut-off two days before the event significantly improved the forecast quality. Another error source were inaccuracies in the moisture structure in the eastern North Atlantic. Specifically, an underestimation of the moisture in the warm conveyor belt inflow led to errors in the low- and upper-level circulation that eventually contributed to the eastward shift of the HIW two days later. Corrections in the eastern North Atlantic humidity structure further improved the forecast quality. On the other hand, corrections in the Mediterranean humidity structure had only a small impact on the accuracy of the forecast. The findings illustrate the importance of downstream error propagation and moist diabatic processes for the prediction of extreme weather over Europe, and demonstrate how targeted changes in the PV and humidity field a few days in advance can improve the quality of the forecasts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000502757","0035-9009||1477-870X",,"10.1002/qj.4127","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502757","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","diabatic processes||dynamics||forecast sensitivity||high-impact weather||humidity||NAWDEX||numerical weather prediction","Dynamics of forecast-error growth along cut-off Sanchez and its consequence for the prediction of a high-impact weather event over southern France","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-08-29T03:25:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Understanding the influence of warm conveyor belts in extratropical cyclones on tropopause dynamics: analysis with observations, reanalyses and global climate simulations","185049","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85112779754","000687053400001","Q.

While climatological frequencies of such near-tropopause cyclonic vortices are well known, their life cycle and in particular their three-dimensional evolution is poorly understood. To address this gap, a novel method is introduced that uses isentropic air parcel trajectories to track PV cutoffs as three-dimensional objects. With this method, we can distinguish the two fundamentally different PV cutoff lysis scenarios on isentropic surfaces: complete diabatic decay vs. reabsorption by the stratospheric reservoir. This method is applied to the ERA-Interim dataset (1979–2018), and the first global climatology of PV cutoffs is presented that is independent of the selection of a vertical level and identifies and tracks PV cutoffs as three-dimensional features. More than 150 000 PV cutoff life cycles are identified and analyzed. The climatology confirms known frequency maxima of PV cutoffs and identifies additional bands in subtropical areas in the summer hemispheres and a circumpolar band around Antarctica. The first climatological analysis of diabatic decay and reabsorption shows that both scenarios occur equally frequently – in contrast to the prevailing opinion that diabatic decay dominates. Then, PV cutoffs are classified according to their position relative to jet streams (equatorward (Type I), between two jets (Type II), and poleward (Type III)). A composite analysis shows distinct dynamical scenarios for the genesis of the three types. Type I forms due to anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking above subtropical surface anticyclones and hardly results in precipitation. Type II results from anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking in mid-latitudes in regions with split-jet conditions and is frequently accompanied by surface cyclogenesis and substantial precipitation. Type III cutoffs preferentially form due to cyclonic Rossby wave breaking within extratropical cyclones in the storm track regions. We show that important track characteristics (speed, travel distance, frequency of decay and reabsorption, isentropic levels) differ between the categories, while lifetime is similar in all categories. Finally, 12 PV cutoff genesis regions in DJF and JJA are selected to study the regional characteristics of PV cutoff life cycles. As a particularly novel aspect, the vertical evolution of PV cutoffs along the life cycle is investigated. We find that, climatologically, PV cutoffs reach their maximum vertical extent about one day after genesis in most regions. However, while in some regions PV cutoffs rapidly disappear at lower levels by diabatic decay, they can grow downward in other regions. In addition, regional differences in lifetimes, the frequencies of diabatic decay and reabsorption, and the link to surface cyclones are identified that cannot be explained only by the preferred regional occurrence of the different cutoff types as defined above. Finally, we also show that in many regions PV cutoffs can be involved in surface cyclogenesis even after their formation.  This study is an important step towards quantifying fundamental dynamical characteristics and the surface impacts of PV cutoffs. The proposed classification according to the jet-relative position provides a useful way to improve the conceptual understanding of PV cutoff life cycles in different regions of the globe. However, these life cycles can be substantially modified by specific regional conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523870","2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-2-507-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523870","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The three-dimensional life cycles of potential  vorticity cutoffs: a global and selected regional  climatologies in ERA-Interim (1979–2018)","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-07T11:09:50Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The role of PV cutoff reabsorption for atmospheric predictability","ETH-07 16-2","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,,,"Weather Clim.

However, it has so far not been investigated thoroughly, especially with regard to the influence of snow cover. Several parameterization approaches have been raised but not yet evaluated in a more uniform and quantitative manner. Based on the three-dimensional (3-D) ray-tracing simulation, we explored the temporal and spatial characteristics of the terrain reflected radiation in 15 domains on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, and comprehensively evaluated different parameterization approaches. The results indicate that the ratio of reflected radiation to total daily radiation ranges from 0.25% to 10.85% at the scale of 5 × 5 km2 in a winter clear day, and it is 57% higher at noon in spring and autumn due to the higher snow cover fraction. Snow cover not only enhances the magnitude of reflected radiation by increasing surface albedo but also changes the spatial distribution pattern of radiation in partial snow-covered mountains, causing more snow-reflected radiation to be received by the surrounding surfaces. Three forms of terrain configuration factors in common parameterization approaches were evaluated by the ray-tracing model. The complementary of sky view factor shows good consistency with ray-tracing model at domain-averaged scales, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.55 (14%) W/m2, while the other two both underestimate the radiation. The parameterization approach involving the multi-reflection shows better performance with the normalized RMSE decreasing by 5%. However, the uncertainty of it increases with the surface spatial heterogeneity caused by the partial snow cover, especially at high resolution.",,,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2020JD034294","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/490043","en","American Geophysical Union",,,"terrain reflected radiation||snow-covered mountains||ray-tracing model||parameterization approach","Quantitative Analysis of Terrain Reflected Solar Radiation in Snow-Covered Mountains: A Case Study in Southeastern Tibetan Plateau","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-06-17T02:50:33Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85107480955","000663557500017","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","11","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","126","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Particularly, dust ice nuclei are believed to enhance cloud glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere. We used satellite observations of the hemispheric and seasonal contrast in cloud top phase to assess the dust-driven droplet freezing in a climate model. The required freezing efficiency for dust ice nuclei suggests that climate models glaciate too few clouds through immersion droplet freezing. After tuning, the model leads to more realistic cloud-top-phase contrasts and a dust-driven glaciation effect of 0.14 ± 0.13 W m−2 between 30°N and 60°N. Observations of cloud-top-phase contrasts provide a strong constraint for ice formation in mixed-phase clouds and may provide a weak constraint for the associated impact on radiation and precipitation. Future studies should therefore consider both the mean-state cloud-phase partitioning and cloud-phase contrasts to achieve a more accurate simulation of dust-driven cloud glaciation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000490232","0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2021GL092687","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/490232","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Constraining the Impact of Dust-Driven Droplet Freezing on Climate Using Cloud-Top-Phase Observations","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-06-18T03:45:26Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85107537719","000663558200021","Geophys.

Postprocessing is particularly relevant in complex terrain, where even state-of-the-art high-resolution NWP systems cannot resolve many of the small-scale processes shaping local weather conditions. In addition, statistical postprocessing can also be used to combine forecasts from multiple NWP systems. Here we assess an ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) approach to produce seamless temperature forecasts based on a combination of short-term ensemble forecasts from a convection-permitting limited-area ensemble and a medium-range global ensemble forecasting model. We quantify the benefit of this approach compared to only postprocessing the high-resolution NWP. The multimodel EMOS approach (“mixed EMOS”) is able to improve forecasts by 30% with respect to direct model output from the high-resolution NWP. A detailed evaluation of mixed EMOS reveals that it outperforms either one of the single-model EMOS versions by 8%–12%. Temperature forecasts at valley locations profit in particular from the model combination. All forecast variants perform worst in winter (DJF); however, calibration and model combination improves forecast quality substantially. In addition to increasing skill as compared to single-model postprocessing, it also enables us to seamlessly combine multiple forecast sources with different time horizons (and horizontal resolutions) and thereby consolidates short-term to medium-range forecasting time horizons in one product without any user-relevant discontinuity. © 2021 American Meteorological Society",,,"0882-8156||1520-0434",,"10.1175/WAF-D-20-0141.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492849","en","American Meteorological Society",,,"Postprocessing||Complex terrain||Statistical techniques||Forecast verification/skill||Operational forecasting||Model output statistics","Seamless Multimodel Postprocessing for Air Temperature Forecasts in Complex Topography","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-07-03T00:56:07Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85108529427","000662894800017","Weather forecast.","3","Weather and Forecasting","36","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In a changing climate with rising temperatures, extreme events, such as droughts, are expected to increase in frequency and intensity, particularly in Mediterranean climates. In this context, the assessment of the evolution of drought in terms of its duration and intensity in the Iberian Peninsula (IP) is paramount, as it affects several socio-economic activities. The use of new high-resolution gridded datasets allows for the identification of patterns with finer temporal and spatial scales. In the current study, drought assessment in the IP was accomplished with both the Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for short-, medium- and long-timescales. A recently developed high-resolution dataset, Iberia01, was used, for the period 1971–2015, with 0.1° horizontal resolution. The lower-resolution CRU dataset was also used. A clear drying trend in most of the IP is identified with both indices and both datasets. The trends of drought duration are also positive in most of the territory, whereas the mean drought intensity decreases slightly. The drivers of this drying trend are both the decreased precipitation and the increased reference evapotranspiration. The Iberia01 dataset allowed to identify more complex patterns of drought trends, mainly due to the improved representation of precipitation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478379","2212-0947",,"10.1016/j.wace.2021.100320","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478379","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index (SPEI)||Standardized precipitation index (SPI)||Meteorological extremes||Precipitation||Temperature||Evapotranspiration","A high-resolution view of the recent drought trends over the Iberian Peninsula","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-04-13T03:09:26Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103723861","000653193400005",,,"Weather and Climate Extremes","32","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The technique is to first downscale the CMIP5 GCM projections to an intermediate 12–15 km resolution grid using RCMs, and then use these fields to downscale further to the kilometer scale. The aim of the paper is to provide an overview of the representation of the precipitation characteristics and their projected changes over the greater Alpine domain within a Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment Flagship Pilot Study and the European Climate Prediction system project, tasked with investigating convective processes at the kilometer scale. An ensemble of 12 simulations performed by different research groups around Europe is analyzed. The simulations are evaluated through comparison with high resolution observations while the complementary ensemble of 12 km resolution driving models is used as a benchmark to evaluate the added value of the convection-permitting ensemble. The results show that the kilometer-scale ensemble is able to improve the representation of fine scale details of mean daily, wet-day/hour frequency, wet-day/hour intensity and heavy precipitation on a seasonal scale, reducing uncertainty over some regions. It also improves the representation of the summer diurnal cycle, showing more realistic onset and peak of convection. The kilometer-scale ensemble refines and enhances the projected patterns of change from the coarser resolution simulations and even modifies the sign of the precipitation intensity change and heavy precipitation over some regions. The convection permitting simulations also show larger changes for all indices over the diurnal cycle, also suggesting a change in the duration of convection over some regions. A larger positive change of frequency of heavy to severe precipitation is found. The results are encouraging towards the use of convection-permitting model ensembles to produce robust assessments of the local impacts of future climate change.",,,"0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-021-05657-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/489268","en","Springer",,,"Regional climate models||Multi-model simulations ensemble||km-scale resolution||Precipitation projections||Climate change","The first multi-model ensemble of regional climate simulations at kilometer-scale resolution part 2: historical and future simulations of precipitation","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-06-12T04:39:15Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85100076668","000613614500002","Clim Dyn","11-12","Climate Dynamics","56","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Constraints for uninitialized projections are generally based on model performance in simulating climatology and climate change. For initialized predictions, skill scores over the hindcast period provide insight into the relative performance of models, and the value of initialization as compared to projections. Predictions and projections combined can, in principle, provide seamless decadal to multi-decadal climate information. For that, though, the role of observations in skill estimates and constraints needs to be understood in order to use both consistently across the prediction and projection time horizons. This paper discusses the challenges in doing so, illustrated by examples of state-of-the-art methods for predicting and projecting changes in European climate. It discusses constraints across prediction and projection methods, their interpretation, and the metrics that drive them such as process accuracy, accurate trends or high signal-to-noise ratio. We also discuss the potential to combine constraints to arrive at more reliable climate prediction systems from years to decades. To illustrate constraints on projections, we discuss their use in the UK's climate prediction system UKCP18, the case of model performance weights obtained from the Climate model Weighting by Independence and Performance (ClimWIP) method, and the estimated magnitude of the forced signal in observations from detection and attribution. For initialized predictions, skill scores are used to evaluate which models perform well, what might contribute to this performance, and how skill may vary over time. Skill estimates also vary with different phases of climate variability and climatic conditions, and are influenced by the presence of external forcing. This complicates the systematic use of observational constraints. Furthermore, we illustrate that sub-selecting simulations from large ensembles based on reproduction of the observed evolution of climate variations is a good testbed for combining projections and predictions. Finally, the methods described in this paper potentially add value to projections and predictions for users, but must be used with caution.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000513306","2624-9553",,"10.3389/fclim.2021.678109","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/513306","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Climate predictions||Future projections||Observational constraints||Model evaluation||Climate modeling","Toward Consistent Observational Constraints in Climate Predictions and Projections","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-11-02T16:38:16Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"European Climate Prediction System||Artic Impact on Weather and Climate||Climate-Carbon Interactions in the Coming Century","776613||727852||821003","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC||EC","H2020||H2020||H2020",,,"85116470489",,"Front.

PSC particles provide sites for heterogeneous reactions that convert stable chlorine reservoir species to radicals that destroy ozone catalytically. PSCs also prolong ozone depletion by delaying chlorine deactivation through the removal of gas-phase HNO3 and H2O by sedimentation of large nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) and ice particles. Contemporary observations by the spaceborne instruments Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS), Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) have provided an unprecedented polar vortex-wide climatological view of PSC occurrence and composition in both hemispheres. These data have spurred advances in our understanding of PSC formation and related dynamical processes, especially the firm evidence of widespread heterogeneous nucleation of both NAT and ice PSC particles, perhaps on nuclei of meteoritic origin. Heterogeneous chlorine activation appears to be well understood. Reaction coefficients on/in liquid droplets have been measured accurately, and while uncertainties remain for reactions on solid NAT and ice particles, they are considered relatively unimportant since under most conditions chlorine activation occurs on/in liquid droplets. There have been notable advances in the ability of chemical transport and chemistry-climate models to reproduce PSC temporal/spatial distributions and composition observed from space. Continued spaceborne PSC observations will facilitate further improvements in the representation of PSC processes in global models and enable more accurate projections of the evolution of polar ozone and the global ozone layer as climate changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492852","8755-1209||0096-1043||1944-9208",,"10.1029/2020RG000702","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492852","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Polar Stratospheric Clouds: Satellite Observations, Processes, and Role in Ozone Depletion","Review Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-07-03T00:56:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102245569","000667476800006","Rev.

However, large uncertainties about the magnitude of Greenland’s future ice loss remain. One process that contributes to this uncertainty are transient ice accelerations, so-called ice speed-up events, caused by a short-term increase in rain-/meltwater, which descends to the glacier bed and can enhance basal sliding. Here, we investigate this phenomenon focusing on two main objectives. First, we present an analysis of local conditions on the Russell glacier in Southwest Greenland, which confirms the importance of meltwater variability for ice speed-up events. We find the strongest influence in early summer with correlations between surface melt and ice velocities above 0.8 in May and identify a typical lag of zero to one day between meltwater peaks and their ice velocity responses. Contrastingly, we find rainfall to have a minor influence with only 4 out of 51 ice speed-up events, where daily increases in water input on the glacier are dominated by rainfall. Secondly, we study the atmospheric drivers of ice speed-up events using a Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) classification of synoptic weather situations over Greenland. Two main patterns that induce most ice speed-up events emerge: The first pattern is characterized by southerly advection of warm and moist air that increases local surface melting by enhanced downward longwave radiation and high sensible heat flux. The second one is a large-scale anticyclone that induces GrIS surface melting through strong downward shortwave radiation and descending air that warm adiabatically. Our study provides new insights into atmospheric drivers of short-term ice accelerations and contributes towards an effort to constrain the impact of ice speed-up events on GrIS mass loss under a changing climate, which can be achieved when more high-resolution ice velocity data is available.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000561596",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/561596","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Greenland ice sheet||Atmospheric dynamics||Glaciology","Influence of synoptic scale weather variability on ice speed-up events in Southwest Greenland","Master Thesis","Open access",,,,,"2022-08-03T08:11:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While FSWs tend to be less abrupt than reversals of the boreal polar vortex in midwinter, known as sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events, their timing and characteristics can be significantly modulated by atmospheric planetary-scale waves. While SSWs are commonly classified according to their wave geometry, either by how the vortex evolves (whether the vortex displaces off the pole or splits into two vortices) or by the dominant wavenumber of the vortex just prior to the SSW (wave-1 vs. wave-2), little is known about the wave geometry of FSW events. We here show that FSW events for both hemispheres in most cases exhibit a clear wave geometry. Most FSWs can be classified into wave-1 or wave-2 events, but wave-3 also plays a significant role in both hemispheres. The timing and classification of the FSW are sensitive to which pressure level the FSW central date is defined, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) where trends in the FSW dates associated with ozone depletion and recovery are more evident at 50 than 10 hPa. However, regardless of which FSW definition is selected, we find the wave geometry of the FSW affects total column ozone anomalies in both hemispheres and tropospheric circulation over North America. In the Southern Hemisphere, the timing of the FSW is strongly linked to both total column ozone before the event and the tropospheric circulation after the event.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000487850","2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-2-453-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/487850","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The wave geometry of final stratospheric warming events","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-06-01T08:54:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application","170523","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,,"Weather Clim.

One poorly understood process is the impact of atmospheric aging of aerosol particles on ice nucleation. Here we study the impact of cloud processing on the ice nucleation abilities of two physicochemically different aerosol particles by taking two model systems for atmospheric organic aerosol (OA), as well as coal fly ash (CFA) particles representing an inorganic aerosol type. The ice nucleation activity of the unprocessed particles is compared to aerosol particles that are first exposed to conditions mimicking trajectories though cirrus clouds (CC) and mixed-phase clouds (MPC) prior to testing their ice nucleation activity at temperatures below 243 K. We observed that unprocessed OA do not exhibit heterogeneous ice nucleation, requiring homogeneous freezing conditions of solution droplets to form ice. However, after CC processing raffinose particles showed heterogeneous ice nucleation activity at 218 K and a water saturation ratio of 0.68–0.82, reaching activated fractions of up to 0.3. This enhancement compared to unprocessed raffinose particles results from an increase in particle viscosity upon CC processing. We also present new results of unprocessed CFA particles exhibiting strong heterogeneous ice nucleation activity at temperatures below 235 K in the deposition and/or pore condensation and freezing mode. In contrast to the OA, the CFA show a decrease in ice nucleation activity after both MPC and CC processing. Furthermore, cloud processing and generating CFA particles from aqueous suspensions do not have the same effect on their ice nucleation ability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488422","0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2020JD033338","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488422","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","cloud processing||coal fly ash||ice nucleation||organic aerosol||viscous glassy aerosol||aging||phase state","The Role of Cloud Processing for the Ice Nucleating Ability of Organic Aerosol and Coal Fly Ash Particles","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-06-07T02:29:59Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85106918232","000656960400001","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","10","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","126","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, we developed the modified Climate Extremes Index (mCEI) to obtain unified information about different types of extremes. For this purpose, we calculated 10 different climate change indexes considering the temperature extremes, extreme precipitation, and moisture surplus and drought over the Europe–Mediterranean (EURO– MED) region for the 1979–2016 period. As a holistic approach, mCEI provides spatiotemporal information, and the high-resolution grid-based data allow us to accomplish detailed country-based and city-based analyses. The analyses indicate that warm temperature extremes rise significantly over the EURO–MED region at a rate of 1.9% decade−1, whereas the cold temperature extremes decrease. Extreme drought has a significant increasing trend of 3.8% decade−1 . Although there are regional differences, extreme precipitation indexes have a significant increasing tendency. According to the mCEI, the major hotspots for the combined extremes are the Mediterranean coasts, the Balkan countries, Eastern Europe, Iceland, western Russia, western Turkey, and western Iraq. The decadal changes of mCEI for these regions are in the range of 3–5% decade−1 . The city-scale analysis based on urbanized locations reveals that Fes (Morocco), Izmir (Turkey), Marseille and Aix-en-Provence (France), and Tel Aviv (Israel) have the highest increasing trend of mCEI, which is greater than 3.5% decade−1 .","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488381","2073-4433",,"10.3390/atmos12050633","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488381","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","combined climate extremes||climate change indexes||Europe–Mediterranean region||urban areas","Exposure assessment of climate extremes over the Europe–mediterranean region","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-06-05T02:29:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85106716329","000653465400001",,"5","Atmosphere","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Ongoing climate change will continue to result in a pressure to adapt, while socio-economic development could make it easier to do so. Countries' effectiveness in fostering climate resilience will depend on the pace of both developments under different socio-economic and emission pathways. Here we assess trajectories of adaptation readiness in comparison with the continued emergence of hot days as a proxy for climate change hazards for different emission and socio-economic pathways over the 21st century. Putting the future evolution of both indices in relation to the observed dynamics over the recent past allows us to provide an assessment of the prospects of future climate resilience building beyond what has been experienced to date. We show that only an inclusive and sustainable stringent mitigation pathway allows for effective climate resilient development over the 21st century. Less inclusive or fossil-fuel driven development will not allow for improvements in resilience building beyond the recent past. Substantial differences emerge already in the 2020s.

Nonetheless, gauging stations are distributed unevenly around the world, leaving many white spaces on global freshwater resources maps. Here, we use a machine learning algorithm and historical weather data to upscale sparse in situ river discharge measurements. We provide a global reanalysis of monthly runoff rates for periods covering decades to the past century at a resolution of 0.5° (about 55 km), and with up to 525 ensemble members based on 21 different atmospheric forcing data sets. This global runoff reconstruction, named Global RUNoff ENSEMBLE (G-RUN ENSEMBLE), is evaluated using independent observations from large river basins and benchmarked against other publicly available runoff data sets over the period 1981–2010. The accuracy of the data set is evaluated on observed river flow from basins not used for model calibration and is found to compare favorably against state-of-the-art global hydrological model simulations. The G-RUN ENSEMBLE estimates the global mean runoff volume to range between 3.2 × 104 and 3.8 × 104 km3 yr−1.

Dew and radiation fog occur in combination during clear and calm nights, and both use ambient water vapor as a source. Research on the combined mechanisms involved in NRW inputs to ecosystems is rare, and distillation of water vapor from the soil as a NRW input pathway for dew formation has hardly been studied. Furthermore, eddy covariance (EC) measurements are associated with large uncertainties on clear, calm nights when dew and radiation fog occur. The aim of this paper is thus to use stable isotopes as tracers to investigate the different NRW input pathways into a temperate Swiss grassland at Chamau during dry spells in summer 2018. Stable isotopes provide additional information on the pathways from water vapor to liquid water (dew and fog) that cannot be measured otherwise. We measured the isotopic composition (δ18O, δ2H, and d=δ2H−8⋅δ18O) of ambient water vapor, NRW droplets on leaf surfaces, and soil moisture and combined them with EC and meteorological observations during one dew-only and two combined dew and radiation fog events. The ambient water vapor d was found to be strongly linked with local surface relative humidity (r=−0.94), highlighting the dominant role of local moisture as a source for ambient water vapor in the synoptic context of the studied dry spells. Detailed observations of the temporal evolution of the ambient water vapor and foliage NRW isotopic signals suggest two different NRW input pathways: (1) the downward pathway through the condensation of ambient water vapor and (2) the upward pathway through the distillation of water vapor from soil onto foliage. We employed a simple two-end-member mixing model using δ18O and δ2H to quantify the NRW inputs from these two different sources. With this approach, we found that distillation contributed 9 %–42 % to the total foliage NRW, which compares well with estimates derived from a near-surface vertical temperature gradient method proposed by Monteith in 1957. The dew and radiation fog potentially produced 0.17–0.54 mm d−1 NRW gain on foliage, thereby constituting a non-negligible water flux to the canopy, as compared to the evapotranspiration of 2.7 mm d−1. Our results thus underline the importance of NRW inputs to temperate grasslands during dry spells and reveal the complexity of the local water cycle in such conditions, including different pathways of dew and radiation fog water inputs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484997","1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-25-2617-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484997","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The role of dew and radiation fog inputs in the local water cycling of a temperate grassland during dry spells in central Europe","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-05-19T14:38:30Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The importance of fog and dew for Swiss grasslands today and in the future (Acronym: IFDewS)","175733","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85106673448","000654339500003","Hydrol.

This has been led in a concerted international effort by the INTENSE Crosscutting Project of the GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Exchanges) Hydroclimatology Panel. Here, we summarize the main findings so far and suggest future directions for research, including: the benefits of convection-permitting climate modelling; towards understanding mechanisms of change; the usefulness of temperature-scaling relations; towards detecting and attributing extreme rainfall change; and the need for international coordination and collaboration. Evidence suggests that the intensity of long-duration (1 day+) heavy precipitation increases with climate warming close to the Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) rate (6–7% K−1), although large-scale circulation changes affect this response regionally. However, rare events can scale at higher rates, and localized heavy short-duration (hourly and sub-hourly) intensities can respond more strongly (e.g. 2 × CC instead of CC). Day-to-day scaling of short-duration intensities supports a higher scaling, with mechanisms proposed for this related to local-scale dynamics of convective storms, but its relevance to climate change is not clear. Uncertainty in changes to precipitation extremes remains and is influenced by many factors, including large-scale circulation, convective storm dynamics andstratification. Despite this, recent research has increased confidence in both the detectability and understanding of changes in various aspects of intense short-duration rainfall. To make further progress, the international coordination of datasets, model experiments and evaluations will be required, with consistent and standardized comparison methods and metrics, and recommendations are made for these frameworks.

The central question that we raise is effective communication. How can climate scientists best and effectively communicate their findings to crucial non-expert audiences, including public policy makers and civil society? To address this question, we look at the mismatch between what courts require and what climate scientists are setting as a bar of proof. Our first point is that scientists typically demand too much of themselves in terms of evidence, in comparison with the level of evidence required in a legal, regulatory, or public policy context. Our second point is to recommend that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommend more prominently the use of the category “more likely than not” as a level of proof in their reports, as this corresponds to the standard of proof most frequently required in civil court rooms. This has also implications for public policy and the public communication of climate evidence.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000481842","0165-0009||1573-1480",,"10.1007/s10584-021-03061-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/481842","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Extreme event attribution||Standards of proof||Policy and evidence||Legal contexts of climate attribution||Science communication","Climate scientists set the bar of proof too high","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-05-01T05:19:32Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85104507420","000641696700002",,"3","Climatic Change","165","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It remains uncertain to what extent temperature and water availability can explain these variations at the global scale2,3,4,5. Here we use factorial climate model simulations6 and show that variability in soil moisture drives 90 per cent of the inter-annual variability in global land carbon uptake, mainly through its impact on photosynthesis. We find that most of this ecosystem response occurs indirectly as soil moisture–atmosphere feedback amplifies temperature and humidity anomalies and enhances the direct effects of soil water stress. The strength of this feedback mechanism explains why coupled climate models indicate that soil moisture has a dominant role4, which is not readily apparent from land surface model simulations and observational analyses2,5. These findings highlight the need to account for feedback between soil and atmospheric dryness when estimating the response of the carbon cycle to climatic change globally5,7, as well as when conducting field-scale investigations of the response of the ecosystem to droughts8,9. Our results show that most of the global variability in modelled land carbon uptake is driven by temperature and vapour pressure deficit effects that are controlled by soil moisture.

But their projections are affected by three major sources of uncertainty: (i) internal variability, i.e., natural climate variability, (ii) ESM structural uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty in the response of the climate system to given greenhouse gas concentrations, and (iii) emission scenario uncertainty, i.e., which emission pathway the world chooses. The large computational cost of running full ESMs limits the exploration of this uncertainty phase space since it is only feasible to create a limited number of ESM runs. However, climate change impact and integrated assessment models, which require ESM projections as their input, could profit from a more complete sampling of the climate change uncertainty phase space. In this contribution, we present MESMER (Beusch et al., 2020), a Modular ESM Emulator with spatially Resolved output, which allows for a computationally efficient exploration of the uncertainty space of yearly temperatures. MESMER approximates ESM land temperature fields at a negligible computational cost by expressing grid-point-level temperatures as a function of global mean temperature and an overlaid spatio-temporally correlated variability term. Within MESMER all three major sources of uncertainty can be accounted for. Stochastic simulation of natural climate variability allows to account for internal variability. ESM structural uncertainty can be addressed by calibrating MESMER on different ESMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) archives. Finally, emission scenario uncertainty can be accounted for by ingesting forced global mean temperature trajectories from global climate model emulators, such as MAGICC or FaIR. MESMER is a flexible statistical tool which is under active development and in the process of becoming an open-source software.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528416",,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-8640","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528416","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Emulating Earth System Model land temperature fields with MESMER","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-25T12:45:51Z",,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19-30, 2021","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The employed technique entails the empirical-statistical downscaling method quantile mapping (QM), which is applied in two different settings, first for bias correction and downscaling of raw climate model data to rural stations with long-term measurements and second for spatial transfer of bias-corrected and downscaled climate model data to the respective urban target site. The resulting products are daily minimum and maximum temperatures at five urban sites in Switzerland until the end of the 21st century under three emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5). We test the second-step QM approach in an extensive evaluation framework, using long-term observational data of two exemplary weather stations in Zurich. Results indicate remarkably good skill of QM in present-day climate. Comparing the generated urban climate projections with existing climate scenarios of adjacent rural sites allows us to represent the urban heat island (UHI) effect in future temperature-based heat indices, namely tropical nights, summer days and hot days. Urban areas will be more strongly affected by rising temperatures than rural sites in terms of fixed threshold exceedances, especially during nighttime. Projections for the end of the century for Zurich, for instance, suggest more than double the number of tropical nights (Tmin above 20 °C) at the urban site (45 nights per year, multi-model median) compared to the rural counterpart (20 nights) under RCP8.5.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488119","2405-8807",,"10.1016/j.cliser.2021.100228","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488119","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Climate change||Climate projections||Urban climate||Urban heat island||Heat extremes||Climate services","Urban multi-model climate projections of intense heat in Switzerland","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-06-03T00:26:43Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85106275217","000664759000010",,,"Climate Services","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In practice, however, data is often available at lower resolution only, for which there are many practical reasons, such as data coarsening to meet memory constraints, limited computational resources, favoring multiple low-resolution ensemble simulations over few high-resolution simulations, as well as limits of sensing instruments in observations. In order to enable a more insightful analysis, we investigate the capabilities of neural networks to reconstruct high-resolution data from given low-resolution simulations. For this, we phrase the data reconstruction as a super-resolution problem from multiple data sources, tailored toward meteorological and climatological data. We therefore investigate supervised machine learning using multiple deep convolutional neural network architectures to test the limits of data reconstruction for various spatial and temporal resolutions, low-frequent and high-frequent input data, and the generalization to numerical and observed data. Once such downscaling networks are trained, they serve two purposes: First, legacy low-resolution simulations can be downscaled to reconstruct high-resolution detail. Second, past observations that have been taken at lower resolutions can be increased to higher resolutions, opening new analysis possibilities. For the downscaling of high-frequent fields like precipitation, we show that error-predicting networks are far less suitable than deconvolutional neural networks due to the poor learning performance. We demonstrate that deep convolutional downscaling has the potential to become a building block of modern weather and climate analysis in both research and operational forecasting, and show that the ideal choice of the network architecture depends on the type of data to predict, i.e., there is no single best architecture for all variables.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000529358","2624-9553",,"10.3389/fclim.2021.656479","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/529358","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Spatio-Temporal Downscaling of Climate Data Using Convolutional and Error-Predicting Neural Networks","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-28T04:05:10Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Guided Large-Scale Exploration of Meteorological Data","180114","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,"85123184875",,"Front.

Our approach applies online potential vorticity (PV) budget diagnostics and piecewise PV inversion to WRF model simulations of the mature stage of 100 intense Mediterranean cyclones. We quantify the relative contributions of different processes to cyclone development and therefore deliver, for the first time, a comprehensive insight into the variety of cyclonic systems that develop in the Mediterranean from the perspective of cyclone dynamics.  In particular, we show that all 100 cyclones are systematically influenced by two main PV anomalies: a major anomaly in the upper troposphere, related to the baroclinic forcing of cyclone development, and a minor anomaly in the lower troposphere, related to diabatic processes and momentum forcing of wind. Among the diabatic processes, latent heat is shown to act as the main PV source (reinforcing cyclones), being partly balanced by PV sinks of temperature diffusion and radiative cooling (weakening cyclones). Momentum forcing is shown to have an ambiguous feedback, able to reinforce and weaken cyclones while in certain cases playing an important role in cyclone development. Piecewise PV inversion shows that most cyclones develop due to the combined effect of both baroclinic and diabatic forcing, i.e. due to both PV anomalies. However, the stronger the baroclinic forcing, the less a cyclone is found to develop due to diabatic processes. Several pairs of exemplary cases are used to illustrate the variety of contributions of atmospheric processes to the development of Mediterranean cyclones: (i) cases where both baroclinic and diabatic processes contribute to cyclone development; (ii) cases that mainly developed due to latent-heat release; (iii) cases developing in the wake of the Alps; and (iv) two unusual cases, one where momentum forcing dominates cyclone development and the other presenting a dual-surface pressure centre. Finally, we focus on 10 medicane cases (i.e. tropical-like cyclones). In contrast to their tropical counterparts – but in accordance with most intense Mediterranean cyclones – most medicanes are shown to develop under the influence of both baroclinic and diabatic processes. In discussion of medicane-driving processes, we highlight the need for a physical definition of these systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523858","2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-2-255-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523858","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A process-based anatomy of Mediterranean cyclones: from baroclinic lows to tropical-like systems","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-07T10:39:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","787652","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,"Weather Clim.

In this paper, the role of upper-level extratropical dynamics for the development of contrasting shallow cumulus cloud patterns in the western North Atlantic trade wind region is investigated. Stable water isotopes are used as tracers for the origin of air parcels arriving in the sub-cloud layer above Barbados, measured continuously in water vapour at the Barbados Cloud Observatory during a 24 d measurement campaign (isoTrades, 25 January to 17 February 2018). These data are combined with a detailed air parcel back-trajectory analysis using hourly ERA5 reanalyses of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. A climatological investigation of the 10 d air parcel history for January and February in the recent decade shows that 55 % of the air parcels arriving in the sub-cloud layer have spent at least 1 d in the extratropics (north of 35∘ N) before arriving in the eastern Caribbean at about 13∘ N. In 2018, this share of air parcels with extratropical origin was anomalously large, with 88 %. In two detailed case studies during the campaign, two flow regimes with distinct isotope signatures transporting extratropical air into the Caribbean are investigated. In both regimes, the air parcels descend from the lower part of the midlatitude jet stream towards the Equator, at the eastern edge of subtropical anticyclones, in the context of Rossby wave breaking events. The zonal location of the wave breaking and the surface anticyclone determine the dominant transport regime. The first regime represents the “typical” trade wind situation, with easterly winds bringing moist air from the eastern North Atlantic into the Caribbean, in a deep layer from the surface up to ∼600 hPa. The moisture source of the sub-cloud layer water vapour is located on average 2000 km upstream of Barbados. In this regime, Rossby wave breaking and the descent of air from the extratropics occur in the eastern North Atlantic, at about 33∘ W. The second regime is associated with air parcels descending slantwise by on average 300 hPa (6 d)−1 directly from the north-east, i.e. at about 50∘ W. These originally dry airstreams experience a more rapid moistening than typical trade wind air parcels when interacting with the subtropical oceanic boundary layer, with moisture sources being located on average 1350 km upstream to the north-east of Barbados. The descent of dry air in the second regime can be steered towards the Caribbean by the interplay of a persistent upper-level cut-off low over the central North Atlantic (about 45∘ W) and the associated surface cyclone underneath. The zonal location of Rossby wave breaking and, consequently, the pathway of extratropical air towards the Caribbean are shown to be relevant for the sub-cloud layer humidity and shallow-cumulus-cloud-cover properties of the North Atlantic winter trades. Overall, this study highlights the importance of extratropical dynamical processes for the tropical water cycle and reveals that these processes lead to a substantial modulation of stable water isotope signals in the near-surface humidity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523851","2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-2-281-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523851","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"How Rossby wave breaking modulates the water cycle in the North Atlantic trade wind region","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-07T10:15:44Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"MOisture Transport pathways and Isotopologues in water Vapour (MOTIV)||Large-scale circulation drivers and stable water isotope characteristics of low-level clouds over the tropical North Atlantic","164721||188731","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT||Projekte MINT",,,,,"Weather Clim.

We identify cloud‐free days based on synop cloud observations as well as on days with maximum atmospheric transmission. Irrespective of the cloud‐screening method, strong dimming and brightening tendencies in the atmospheric transmission are evident not only under all‐sky but also of similar magnitude under clear‐sky conditions, causing multidecadal variations in surface solar radiation on the order of 10 Wm−2. This points to the cloud‐free atmosphere as a main responsible for dimming and brightening in central Europe and suggests that these variations are anthropogenically forced rather than of natural origin, with aerosol pollutants as likely major drivers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000477374","0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2020GL092216","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477374","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","air pollution||forced and unforced climate variability||global dimming and brightening||surface radiation","Evidence for Clear‐Sky Dimming and Brightening in Central Europe","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-04-03T02:55:12Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: absorption of solar radiation||Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: temporal variation of solar radiation in the climate system||Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: causes of decadal changes of solar radiation","135395||159938||188601","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projekte MINT||Projekte MINT",,,"85103156029","000635209100079","Geophys.

RRWPs significantly alter (decrease and increase) dry and wet spell persistence across the globe. Spatial patterns of statistically significant links between RRWPs and spell durations arise from the superposition of a zonally symmetric component and a wave-like component that is modulated by local factors such as orography and the position relative to major moisture sources. The zonally symmetric component is apparent during the Northern Hemisphere winter and dominates the Southern Hemisphere signal in winter and summer. The wave-like component appears primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, changes its wavenumber with the season and is thus, conceivably related to stationary wave dynamics. © 2021.

The results differ significantly from the ones reported in the literature. We distinguish between the resulting EC values being weakly and strongly correlated to LY observations as well as systematic and random deviations between the LY and EC values. Overall, an excellent match could be achieved between the LY and EC measurements after applying evaporation-linked weights. But there remain large differences between the standard deviations of the LY and adjusted EC values. For further studies we recommend data collected at time intervals even below 0.5 h.  No correlation could be found between evaporation weights and weather indices. Only for some datasets, a positive correlation between evaporation and the evaporation weight could be found. This effect appears pronounced for cases with high radiation and plant water stress.  Without further knowledge of the causes of energy imbalance one might perform full closure using equally distributed weights. Full closure, however, is not dealt with in this paper.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474385","1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-25-1151-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474385","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Partial energy balance closure of eddy covariance evaporation measurements using concurrent lysimeter observations over grassland","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-03-15T05:22:26Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102151559","000626742700002","Hydrol.

In Europe, the pandemic started to develop strongly at the end of February and beginning of March 2020. Subsequently, it spread over the continent, with special virulence in northern Italy and inland Spain. In this study we show that an unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing in southwestern Europe during February 2020 (i.e. anomalously strong positive phase of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations) could have resulted in favorable conditions, e.g., in terms of air temperature and humidity among other factors, in Italy and Spain for a quicker spread of the virus compared with the rest of the European countries. It seems plausible that the strong atmospheric stability and associated dry conditions that dominated in these regions may have favored the virus propagation, both outdoors and especially indoors, by short-range droplet and aerosol (airborne) transmission, or/and by changing social contact patterns. Later recent atmospheric circulation conditions in Europe (July 2020) and the U.S. (October 2020) seem to support our hypothesis, although further research is needed in order to evaluate other confounding variables. Interestingly, the atmospheric conditions during the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 seem to have resembled at some stage with the current COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,,"0013-9351||1096-0953",,"10.1016/j.envres.2020.110626","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458874","en","Elsevier",,,"COVID-19 disease||Atmospheric circulation||North Atlantic Oscillation||Air humidity||1918 Spanish flu","Did anomalous atmospheric circulation favor the spread of COVID-19 in Europe?","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-01-03T03:39:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85098137821","000632602900003","Environ.

Recurrent Rossby wave patterns (RRWPs) are among the atmospheric features that have been linked to extreme weather events involving persistent surface weather. In this thesis, the link between RRWPs and the occurrence of extremely hot summers in the Northern Hemisphere is investigated and quantified. To this aim the synoptic evolution of RRWP events is studied in three case studies of extremely hot summers using ERA5 and CESM data. Next, the link between RRWPs and the occurrence of extremely hot summers is quantified in present-day (1990 - 1999) and end-of-the-century (2091 - 2100) climate using a grid point-wise logistic regression model. In order to differentiate between the effect of collocated and upstream RRWPs on the occurrence of extremely hot summers, two different model implementations are used. Finally, we compare the results of the logistic regression model between the present-day and end-of-the-century climate in order to assess potential changes in the link between RRWPs and extremely hot summers due to global warming. We find that the effect of RRWPs on the occurrence of extremely hot summers is significant in many regions in the Northern Hemisphere, e.g., in the western U.S. (odds’ increase of up to +16%), eastern Europe (up to +14%) and in the region of the Caspian Sea (up to +18%). However, in the end-of-the-century climate, this link is much weaker. Uncertainties about the causes of a weakening link between RRWPs and extremely hot summers remain, and are possibly linked to the increasing importance of thermodynamic processes or altered jet stream dynamics. To conclude, RRWPs have significant effects on the occurrence of extremely hot summers in the Northern Hemisphere and are therefore essential when studying seasonal heat extremes. Thus, RRWPs should be further investigated - especially in the context of global warming.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000479076",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/479076","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Quantifying the effect of recurrent Rossby wave patterns on extremely hot summers in present-day and end-of-the-century climate","Master Thesis","Open access",,,,,"2021-04-16T12:32:39Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

SSWs are caused by the breaking of planetary‐scale waves that propagate upwards from the troposphere. During an SSW, the polar vortex breaks down, accompanied by rapid descent and warming of air in polar latitudes, mirrored by ascent and cooling above the warming. The rapid warming and descent of the polar air column affects tropospheric weather, shifting jet streams, storm tracks, and the Northern Annular Mode, making cold air outbreaks over North America and Eurasia more likely. SSWs affect the atmosphere above the stratosphere, producing widespread effects on atmospheric chemistry, temperatures, winds, neutral (non‐ionized) particles and electron densities, and electric fields. These effects span both hemispheres. Given their crucial role in the whole atmosphere, SSWs are also seen as a key process to analyze in climate change studies and subseasonal to seasonal prediction.

This paper presents a range of its outcomes by synthesizing results from the participating global coupled Earth system models. We limit our scope to the analysis of strictly geophysical outcomes: mainly global averages and spatial patterns of change for surface air temperature and precipitation. We also compare CMIP6 projections to CMIP5 results, especially for those scenarios that were designed to provide continuity across the CMIP phases, at the same time highlighting important differences in forcing composition, as well as in results. The range of future temperature and precipitation changes by the end of the century (2081–2100) encompassing the Tier 1 experiments based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) and SSP1-1.9 spans a larger range of outcomes compared to CMIP5, due to higher warming (by close to 1.5 ∘C) reached at the upper end of the 5 %–95 % envelope of the highest scenario (SSP5-8.5). This is due to both the wider range of radiative forcing that the new scenarios cover and the higher climate sensitivities in some of the new models compared to their CMIP5 predecessors. Spatial patterns of change for temperature and precipitation averaged over models and scenarios have familiar features, and an analysis of their variations confirms model structural differences to be the dominant source of uncertainty. Models also differ with respect to the size and evolution of internal variability as measured by individual models' initial condition ensemble spreads, according to a set of initial condition ensemble simulations available under SSP3-7.0. These experiments suggest a tendency for internal variability to decrease along the course of the century in this scenario, a result that will benefit from further analysis over a larger set of models. Benefits of mitigation, all else being equal in terms of societal drivers, appear clearly when comparing scenarios developed under the same SSP but to which different degrees of mitigation have been applied. It is also found that a mild overshoot in temperature of a few decades around mid-century, as represented in SSP5-3.4OS, does not affect the end outcome of temperature and precipitation changes by 2100, which return to the same levels as those reached by the gradually increasing SSP4-3.4 (not erasing the possibility, however, that other aspects of the system may not be as easily reversible). Central estimates of the time at which the ensemble means of the different scenarios reach a given warming level might be biased by the inclusion of models that have shown faster warming in the historical period than the observed. Those estimates show all scenarios reaching 1.5 ∘C of warming compared to the 1850–1900 baseline in the second half of the current decade, with the time span between slow and fast warming covering between 20 and 27 years from present. The warming level of 2 ∘C of warming is reached as early as 2039 by the ensemble mean under SSP5-8.5 but as late as the mid-2060s under SSP1-2.6. The highest warming level considered (5 ∘C) is reached by the ensemble mean only under SSP5-8.5 and not until the mid-2090s.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474394","2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-12-253-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474394","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Climate model projections from the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) of CMIP6","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-03-15T05:23:41Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach||LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constraining uncertainty of multi decadal climate projections","641816||820829","10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100000780","SBFI||EC","H2020||H2020",,,"85102007893","000625878300001",,"1","Earth System Dynamics","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, using ensemble hydrological simulations, we show that climate change could reduce TWS in many regions, especially those in the Southern Hemisphere. Strong inter-ensemble agreement indicates high confidence in the projected changes that are driven primarily by climate forcing rather than land and water management activities. Declines in TWS translate to increases in future droughts. By the late twenty-first century, the global land area and population in extreme-to-exceptional TWS drought could more than double, each increasing from 3% during 1976-2005 to 7% and 8%, respectively.

Here we use climate model simulations from the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project, as well as regularized optimal fingerprinting, to show that anthropogenic forcings caused 0.9 to 1.3 degrees C of warming in global mean near-surface air temperature in 2010-2019 relative to 1850-1900, compared with an observed warming of 1.1 degrees C.

For these cyclone cases, which primarily emerge over the central Arctic in summer or otherwise originate from the North Atlantic, the amount of moisture transport is found to closely depend on track orientation and poleward propagation. Cyclone tracks oriented in the poleward direction along with coupling to an upper-level vortex which influences the steering flow are the most important characteristics that determine the moisture flux into the Arctic. Back trajectories highlight low-level moisture source regions over the Atlantic Gulf Stream throughout the year and over the high-latitude continental land surface during the warm season.","application/pdf",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2020GL090353","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/489747","en","John Wiley & Sons",,,,"The Role of Cyclones in Moisture Transport into the Arctic","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-06-16T02:59:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101505237","000623802900020","Geophys.

Optical modeling was employed to estimate the cirrus microphysical properties from the COBALD backscatter measurements.

The relatively low concentration and CFH ice supersaturation (1.5) suggests a homogeneous freezing event stalled by a high‐frequency gravity wave.

The RCM ensemble results are compared with the driving CMIP5 global models but also with a subset of available last generation CMIP6 projections. Maximum warming is projected by all ensembles in Northern Europe in winter, along with a maximum precipitation increase there; in summer, maximum warming occurs in the Mediterranean and Southern European regions associated with a maximum precipitation decrease. The CMIP6 ensemble shows the largest signals, both for temperature and precipitation, along with the largest inter‐model spread. There is a high model consensus across the ensembles on an increase of extreme precipitation and drought frequency in the Mediterranean region. Extreme temperature indices show an increase of heat extremes and a decrease of cold extremes, with CMIP6 showing the highest values and EURO‐CORDEX the finest spatial details.

By analyzing precipitation intensities with short accumulation times, we show that the model can capture the observed percentiles of extreme subhourly precipitation measured at surface rain‐gauge stations. Then, by simulating the future climate, we show that the associated increases in intensity of subhourly extreme precipitation events grow with the intensity of the events but tends asymptotically toward 6.5% per degree warming. This suggests that the most extreme intensities scale with the Clausius‐Clapeyron scaling rate that represents the ability of a warmer atmosphere to hold more water vapor. It should be expected that these changes will lead to increased risks of flash flooding, land‐slides, and erosion over Europe in a warmer climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000472318","0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2020GL089506","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472318","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate||extreme precipitation||modeling||projection","Extreme Sub-Hourly Precipitation Intensities Scale Close to the Clausius-Clapeyron Rate Over Europe","Other Journal Item","Open access",,,,,"2021-03-02T03:53:55Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101171539","000620058900044","Geophys.

They are deemed to be the main cause of 'dimming' and 'brightening' in China, respectively. China, therefore, provides an ideal testbed to investigate the multi-decadal evolution of clouds under a background of large variations in the amount of atmospheric aerosols. We used a unique combination of long-term in-situ observational records combined with a radiative transfer model to investigate the changes in clouds and aerosols over the last 60 years (1958–2018) over China. We found during the dimming period, the clouds over China shrunk in area steadily, gradually thinned in terms of optical depth, and thereby blocked less and less solar radiation. This situation reversed during the brightening period. The clouds over China showed a quick expansion in extent and thickening in terms of optical depth, and accordingly the amounts of solar radiation blocked by clouds recovered rapidly. It is observationally demonstrated that high levels of pollution and the associated amount of aerosols cause a suppression of cloud growth and a reduction of optical depth.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474387","1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/abdf89","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474387","en","Institute of Physics Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Cloud 'shrinking' and 'optical thinning' in the 'dimming' period and a subsequent recovery in the 'brightening' period over China","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-03-15T05:22:51Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: absorption of solar radiation||Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: temporal variation of solar radiation in the climate system||Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: causes of decadal changes of solar radiation","135395||159938||188601","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projekte MINT||Projekte MINT",,,"85102123934","000618338900001","Environ.

In this Review, we examine evidence from observational, theoretical and modelling studies for the intensification of these rainfall extremes, the drivers and the impact on flash flooding. Both short-duration and long-duration (>1 day) rainfall extremes are intensifying with warming at a rate consistent with the increase in atmospheric moisture (~7% K−1), while in some regions, increases in short-duration extreme rainfall intensities are stronger than expected from moisture increases alone. These stronger local increases are related to feedbacks in convective clouds, but their exact role is uncertain because of the very small scales involved. Future extreme rainfall intensification is also modulated by changes to temperature stratification and large-scale atmospheric circulation. The latter remains a major source of uncertainty. Intensification of short-duration extremes has likely increased the incidence of flash flooding at local scales, and this can further compound with an increase in storm spatial footprint to considerably increase total event rainfall. These findings call for urgent climate change adaptation measures to manage increasing flood risks.",,,"2662-138X",,"10.1038/s43017-020-00128-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491563","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,"Climate-change impacts||Hydrology||Natural hazards||Water resources","Anthropogenic intensification of short-duration rainfall extremes","Review Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-06-28T04:02:16Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101738773","000671874300006","Nat Rev Earth Environ","2","Nature Reviews Earth & Environment","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Stringent mitigation will have clear societal benefits in the second half of this century by limiting peak warming and stabilizing climate. However, the near-term benefits of mitigation are generally thought to be less clear because forced surface temperature trends can be masked by internal variability. Here we use observationally constrained projections from the latest comprehensive climate models and a simple climate model emulator to show that pursuing stringent mitigation consistent with holding long-term warming below 1.5 °C reduces the risk of unprecedented warming rates in the next 20 years by a factor of 13 compared with a no mitigation scenario, even after accounting for internal variability. Therefore, in addition to long-term benefits, stringent mitigation offers substantial near-term benefits by offering societies and ecosystems a greater chance to adapt to and avoid the worst climate change impacts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000455516","1758-6798",,"10.1038/s41558-020-00957-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/455516","en","Nature Publishing Group","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Stringent mitigation substantially reduces risk of unprecedented near-term warming rates","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-12-09T11:33:37Z","2021-06-08",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constraining uncertainty of multi decadal climate projections","820829","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,"85097238879","000598987000001","Nat.

The results confirm clouds and aerosols as the major contributors to such all-sky SSR trends over China but play differing roles over sub-regions. Aerosol variations during this period result in a widespread brightening, while cloud effects show opposite trends from south to north. Moreover, aerosols contribute more to the increasing all-sky SSR trends over northern China, while clouds dominate the SSR decline over southern China. A radiative transfer model is used to explore the relative contributions of cloud cover from different cloud types to the all-types-of-cloud-cover-induced (ACC-induced) SSR trends during this period in four typical sub-regions over China. The simulations point out that the decreases in low-cloud-cover (LCC) over the North China Plain are the largest positive contributor of all cloud types to the marked annual and seasonal ACC-induced SSR increases, and the positive contributions from both high-cloud-cover (HCC) and LCC declines in summer and winter greatly contribute to the ACC-induced SSR increases over East China. The contributions from medium-low-cloud-cover (mid-LCC) and LCC variations dominate the ACC-caused SSR trends over southwestern and South China all year round, except for the larger HCC contribution in summer.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000472088","2072-4292",,"10.3390/rs13040704","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472088","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","SSR trends under different conditions||cloud and aerosols||radiative transfer model||relative contributions||different types of cloud cover","Potential driving factors on surface solar radiation trends over china in recent years","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-03-01T05:04:19Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: absorption of solar radiation||Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: temporal variation of solar radiation in the climate system||Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: causes of decadal changes of solar radiation","135395||159938||188601","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projekte MINT||Projekte MINT",,,"85100941018","000624443600001","Remote Sens.","4","Remote Sensing","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the mechanisms behind this downward impact are not well understood. We investigate this surface impact through its associated predictability limits, by studying the 2018 SSW event. We search for predictability barriers that occurred after the onset of the SSW and before its surface impact. It is found that dynamical tropospheric events consisting of two cyclogenesis events were the main reasons for these predictability barriers in the prediction of negative NAM/NAO anomalies reaching the surface.

These complexes can absorb light over a broad wavelength range, inducing the reduction of iron(III) and the oxidation of carboxylate ligands. In the presence of O-2, the ensuing radical chemistry leads to further decarboxylation, and the production of center dot OH, HO2 center dot, peroxides, and oxygenated volatile organic compounds, contributing to particle mass loss. The center dot OH, H-2 center dot, and peroxides in turn reoxidize iron(II) back to iron(III), closing a photocatalytic cycle. This cycle is repeated, resulting in continual mass loss due to the release of CO2 and other volatile compounds. In a cold and/or dry atmosphere, organic aerosol particles tend to attain highly viscous states. While the impact of reduced mobility of aerosol constituents on dark chemical reactions has received substantial attention, studies on the effect of high viscosity on photochemical processes are scarce. Here, we choose iron(III) citrate (Fe-III (Cit)) as a model light-absorbing iron carboxylate complex that induces citric acid (CA) degradation to investigate how transport limitations influence photochemical processes. Three complementary experimental approaches were used to investigate kinetic transport limitations. The mass loss of single, levitated particles was measured with an elec- trodynamic balance, the oxidation state of deposited particles was measured with X-ray spectromicroscopy, and H-2 center dot radical production and release into the gas phase was observed in coated-wall flow-tube experiments. We observed significant photochemical degradation with up to 80 % mass loss within 24 h of light exposure. Interestingly, we also observed that mass loss always accelerated during irradiation, resulting in an increase of the mass loss rate by about a factor of 10. When we increased relative humidity (RH), the observed particle mass loss rate also increased. This is consistent with strong kinetic transport limitations for highly viscous particles. To quantitatively compare these experiments and determine important physical and chemical parameters, a numerical multilayered photochemical reaction and diffusion (PRAD) model was developed that treats chemical reactions and the transport of various species. The PRAD model was tuned to simultaneously reproduce all experimental results as closely as possible and captured the essential chemistry and transport during irradiation. In particular, the photolysis rate of Fe-III, the reoxidation rate of Fe-II, H-2 center dot production, and the diffusivity of O-2 in aqueous Fe-III (Cit)/CA system as function of RH and Fe-III (Cit)/CA molar ratio could be constrained. This led to satisfactory agreement within model uncertainty for most but not all experiments performed. Photochemical degradation under atmospheric conditions predicted by the PRAD model shows that release of CO2 and repartitioning of organic compounds to the gas phase may be very important when attempting to accurately predict organic aerosol aging processes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000451607","1680-7375||1680-7367","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495304||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/451607","10.5194/acp-21-315-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505214","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Photochemical degradation of iron(III) citrate/citric acid aerosol quantified with the combination of three complementary experimental techniques and a kinetic process model","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-11-16T16:19:16Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Feedbacks between atmospheric aerosol microphysics and photochemical aging","163074","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"000610947900001","Atmos. chem. phys.","1","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the mesosphere, both H2O and CO are sensitive to solar irradiance (SI) variability because of their destruction/production by solar radiation. This enables us to analyze the solar signal in both models and observed data. Here, we evaluate the mesospheric H2O and CO response to solar irradiance variability using the Chemistry- Climate Model Initiative (CCMI-1) simulations and satellite observations. We analyzed the results of four CCMI models (CMAM, EMAC-L90MA, SOCOLv3, and CESM1- WACCM 3.5) operated in CCMI reference simulation REFC1SD in specified dynamics mode, covering the period from 1984-2017. Multiple linear regression analyses show a pronounced and statistically robust response of H2O and CO to solar irradiance variability and to the annual and semiannual cycles. For periods with available satellite data, we compared the simulated solar signal against satellite observations, namely the GOZCARDS composite for 1992-2017 for H2O and Aura/MLS measurements for 2005-2017 for CO. The model results generally agree with observations and reproduce an expected negative and positive correlation for H2O and CO, respectively, with solar irradiance. However, the magnitude of the response and patterns of the solar signal varies among the considered models, indicating differences in the applied chemical reaction and dynamical schemes, including the representation of photolyzes. We suggest that there is no dominating thermospheric influence of solar irradiance in CO, as reported in previous studies, because the response to solar variability is comparable with observations in both low-top and high-top models. We stress the importance of this work for improving our understanding of the current ability and limitations of state-of-the-art models to simulate a solar signal in the chemistry and dynamics of the middle atmosphere. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

It is vital to understand enhanced regional warming anomalies as they locally increase heat-related risks to human health and ecosystems. We argue that tropospheric lapse-rate changes play a key role in shaping the future summer warming pattern around the globe in mid-latitudes and the tropics. We present multiple lines of evidence supporting this finding based on idealized simulations over Europe, as well as regional and global climate model ensembles. All simulations consistently show that the vertical distribution of tropospheric summer warming is different in regions characterized by enhanced or reduced surface warming. Enhanced warming is projected where lapse-rate changes are small, implying that the surface and the upper troposphere experience similar warming. On the other hand, strong lapse-rate changes cause a concentration of warming in the upper troposphere and reduced warming near the surface. The varying magnitude of lapse-rate changes is governed by the temperature dependence of the moist-adiabatic lapse rate and the available tropospheric humidity. We conclude that tropospheric temperature changes should be considered along with surface processes when assessing the causes of surface warming patterns.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000525245","2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-2-1093-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/525245","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Future summer warming pattern under climate change is affected by lapse-rate changes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-13T11:10:28Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constraining uncertainty of multi decadal climate projections||Exploiting km-resolution climate models in the tropics to constrain climate change uncertainties (trCLIM)","820829||192133","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF","H2020||Projekte MINT",,,,,"Weather Clim.

As a result, our knowledge of this vast region remains largely incomplete. The Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE, austral summer 2016/2017) surveyed a large number of variables describing the state of the ocean and the atmosphere, the freshwater cycle, atmospheric chemistry, and ocean biogeochemistry and microbiology. This circumpolar cruise included visits to 12 remote islands, the marginal ice zone, and the Antarctic coast. Here, we use 111 of the observed variables to study the latitudinal gradients, seasonality, shorter-term variations, geographic setting of environmental processes, and interactions between them over the duration of 90 d. To reduce the dimensionality and complexity of the dataset and make the relations between variables interpretable we applied an unsupervised machine learning method, the sparse principal component analysis (sPCA), which describes environmental processes through 14 latent variables. To derive a robust statistical perspective on these processes and to estimate the uncertainty in the sPCA decomposition, we have developed a bootstrap approach. Our results provide a proof of concept that sPCA with uncertainty analysis is able to identify temporal patterns from diurnal to seasonal cycles, as well as geographical gradients and ""hotspots"" of interaction between environmental compartments. While confirming many well known processes, our analysis provides novel insights into the Southern Ocean water cycle (freshwater fluxes), trace gases (interplay between seasonality, sources, and sinks), and microbial communities (nutrient limitation and island mass effects at the largest scale ever reported). More specifically, we identify the important role of the oceanic circulations, frontal zones, and islands in shaping the nutrient availability that controls biological community composition and productivity; the fact that sea ice controls sea water salinity, dampens the wave field, and is associated with increased phytoplankton growth and net community productivity possibly due to iron fertilisation and reduced light limitation; and the clear regional patterns of aerosol characteristics that have emerged, stressing the role of the sea state, atmospheric chemical processing, and source processes near hotspots for the availability of cloud condensation nuclei and hence cloud formation. A set of key variables and their combinations, such as the difference between the air and sea surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, sea surface height, geostrophic currents, upper-ocean layer light intensity, surface wind speed and relative humidity played an important role in our analysis, highlighting the necessity for Earth system models to represent them adequately. In conclusion, our study highlights the use of sPCA to identify key ocean-atmosphere interactions across physical, chemical, and biological processes and their associated spatio-temporal scales. It thereby fills an important gap between simple correlation analyses and complex Earth system models. The sPCA processing code is available as open-access from the following link: https://renkulab.io/gitlab/ACE-ASAID/spca-decomposition (last access: 29 March 2021). As we show here, it can be used for an exploration of environmental data that is less prone to cognitive biases (and confirmation biases in particular) compared to traditional regression analysis that might be affected by the underlying research question.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000518876","2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-12-1295-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518876","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Exploring the coupled ocean and atmosphere system with a data science approach applied to observations from the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-12-06T17:20:32Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85120746804","000723912200001",,"4","Earth System Dynamics","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Indeed, second-order conditions are derived which are not influenced either by the specific formulation of the governing equations, nor by the number of parameterizations, nor by the structural design and implementation details of the time-stepping methods. The theoretical findings are verified on two idealized test beds. Particularly, a hydrostatic model in isentropic coordinates is used for vertical slice simulations of a moist airflow past an isolated mountain. Self-convergence tests show that the sensitivity of the prognostic variables to the coupling scheme may vary. For those variables (e.g., momentum) whose evolution is mainly driven by the dry dynamics, the truncation error associated with the dynamical core dominates and hides the error due to the coupling. In contrast, the coupling error of moist variables (e.g., the precipitation rate) emerges gradually as the spatio-temporal resolution increases. Eventually, each coupling scheme tends toward the formal order of accuracy, upon a careful treatment of the grid cell condensation. Indeed, the well-established saturation adjustment may cap the convergence rate to first order. A prognostic formulation of the condensation and evaporation process is derived from first principles. This solution is shown effective to alleviate the convergence issues in our experiments. Potential implications for a complete forecasting system are discussed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000518585","1942-2466",,"10.1029/2020MS002377","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518585","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"A Numerical Analysis of Six Physics-Dynamics Coupling Schemes for Atmospheric Models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-12-04T04:52:22Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85111731710","000723144900019",,"11","Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite the predominantly stratiform character of the WCB's large-scale cloud band, convective clouds can be embedded in it. This embedded convection leads to a heterogeneously structured cloud band with locally enhanced hydrometeor content, intense surface precipitation and substantial amounts of graupel in the middle troposphere. Recent studies showed that embedded convection forms dynamically relevant quasi-horizontal potential vorticity (PV) dipoles in the upper troposphere. Thereby one pole can reach strongly negative PV values associated with inertial or symmetric instability near the upper-level PV waveguide, where it can interact with and modify the upper-level jet. This study analyzes the characteristics of embedded convection in the WCB of cyclone Sanchez based on WCB online trajectories from a convection-permitting simulation and airborne radar observations during the North Atlantic Waveguide and Downstream Impact Experiment (NAWDEX) field campaign (intense observation periods, IOPs, 10 and 11). In the first part, we present the radar reflectivity structure of the WCB and corroborate its heterogeneous cloud structure and the occurrence of embedded convection. Radar observations in three different sub-regions of the WCB cloud band reveal the differing intensity of its embedded convection, which is qualitatively confirmed by the ascent rates of the online WCB trajectories. The detailed ascent behavior of the WCB trajectories reveals that very intense convection with ascent rates of 600 hPa in 30–60 min occurs, in addition to comparatively moderate convection with slower ascent velocities as reported in previous case studies. In the second part of this study, a systematic Lagrangian composite analysis based on online trajectories for two sub-categories of WCB-embedded convection – moderate and intense convection – is performed. Composites of the cloud and precipitation structure confirm the large influence of embedded convection: intense convection produces very intense local surface precipitation with peak values exceeding 6 mm in 15 min and large amounts of graupel of up to 2.8 g kg−1 in the middle troposphere (compared to 3.9 mm and 1.0 g kg−1 for the moderate convective WCB sub-category). In the upper troposphere, both convective WCB trajectory sub-categories form a small-scale and weak PV dipole, with one pole reaching weakly negative PV values. However, for this WCB case study – in contrast to previous case studies reporting convective PV dipoles in the WCB ascent region with the negative PV pole near the upper-level jet – the negative PV pole is located east of the convective ascent region, i.e., away from the upper-level jet. Moreover, the PV dipole formed by the intense convective WCB trajectories is weaker and has a smaller horizontal and vertical extent compared to a previous NAWDEX case study of WCB-embedded convection, despite faster ascent rates in this case. The absence of a strong upper-level jet and the weak vertical shear of the ambient wind in cyclone Sanchez are accountable for the weak diabatic PV modification in the upper troposphere. This implies that the strength of embedded convection alone is not a reliable measure for the effect of embedded convection on upper-level PV modification and its impact on the upper-level jet. Instead, the profile of vertical wind shear and the alignment of embedded convection with a strong upper-level jet play a key role for the formation of coherent negative PV features near the jet. Finally, these results highlight the large case-to-case variability of embedded convection not only in terms of frequency and intensity of embedded convection in WCBs but also in terms of its dynamical implications.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523869","2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-2-89-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523869","en","Copernicus GmbH","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Observations and simulation of intense convection embedded in a warm conveyor belt – how ambient vertical wind shear determines the dynamical impact","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-07T11:07:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Diabatic processes in North Atlantic weather systems: synoptic and mesoscale dynamics||An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","165941||787652","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","H2020||Projekte MINT",,,,,"Weather Clim.

This study has a twofold aim: first to identify and statistically characterize extreme wet seasons around the globe and second to elucidate their relationship with specific weather systems.  Extreme wet seasons are defined independently at every grid point of ERA-Interim reanalyses as the consecutive 90 d period with the highest accumulated precipitation in the 40-year period of 1979–2018. In most continental regions, the extreme seasons occur during the warm months of the year, especially in the midlatitudes. Nevertheless, colder periods might be also relevant, especially in coastal areas. All identified extreme seasons are statistically characterized in terms of climatological anomalies of the number of wet days and of daily extreme events. Results show that daily extremes are decisive for the occurrence of extreme wet seasons in regions of frequent precipitation, e.g., in the tropics. This is in contrast to arid regions where wet seasons may occur only due to anomalously frequent wet days. In the subtropics and more precisely within the transitional zones between arid areas and regions of frequent precipitation, both an anomalously high occurrence of daily extremes and of wet days are related to the formation of extreme wet seasons.  A novel method is introduced to define the spatial extent of regions affected by a particular extreme wet season and to relate extreme seasons to four objectively identified synoptic-scale weather systems, which are known to be associated with intense precipitation: cyclones, warm conveyor belts, tropical moisture exports and breaking Rossby waves. Cyclones and warm conveyor belts contribute particularly strongly to extreme wet seasons in most regions of the globe. But interlatitudinal influences are also shown to be important: tropical moisture exports, i.e., the poleward transport of tropical moisture, can contribute to extreme wet seasons in the midlatitudes, while breaking Rossby waves, i.e., the equatorward intrusion of stratospheric air, may decisively contribute to the formation of extreme wet seasons in the tropics. Three illustrative examples provide insight into the synergetic effects of the four identified weather systems on the formation of extreme wet seasons in the midlatitudes, the Arctic and the (sub)tropics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523856","2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-2-71-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523856","en","Copernicus GmbH","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Extreme wet seasons – their definition and relationship  with synoptic-scale weather systems","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-07T10:37:07Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","787652","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,"Weather Clim.

Previous studies considered two synoptic-scale processes, Rossby wave breaking and intense moisture transport, typically in isolation, and their linkage to such EPEs in several regions. This study presents for the first time a global and systematic climatological analysis of these two synoptic-scale processes, in tandem and in isolation, for the occurrence of EPEs. To this end, we use 40-year ERA-Interim reanalysis data (1979–2018) and apply object-based identification methods for (i) daily EPEs, (ii) stratospheric potential vorticity (PV) streamers as indicators of Rossby wave breaking, and (iii) structures of high vertically integrated horizontal water vapour transport (IVT). First, the importance of these two synoptic-scale processes is demonstrated by case studies of previously documented flood events that inflicted catastrophic impacts in different parts of the world. Next, a climatological quantification shows that Rossby wave breaking is associated with >90 % of EPEs over central North America and the Mediterranean, whereas intense moisture transport is linked to >95 % of EPEs over many coastal zones, consistent with findings of atmospheric river-related studies. Combined Rossby wave breaking and intense moisture transport contributes up to 70 % of EPEs in several subtropical and extratropical regions, including (semi)arid desert regions where tropical–extratropical interactions are of key importance for (heavy) rainfall. Odds ratios of EPEs linked to the two synoptic-scale processes suggest that intense moisture transport has a stronger association with the occurrence of EPEs than Rossby wave breaking. Furthermore, the relationship between the PV and IVT characteristics and the precipitation volumes shows that the depth of the wave breaking and moisture transport intensity are intimately connected with the extreme precipitation severity. Finally, composites reveal that subtropical and extratropical EPEs, linked to Rossby wave breaking, go along with the formation of upper-level troughs and cyclogenetic processes near the surface downstream, reduced static stability beneath the upper-level forcing (only over water), and dynamical lifting ahead (over water and land). This study concludes with a concept that reconciles well-established meteorological principles with the importance of Rossby wave breaking and intense moisture transport for the formation of EPEs. Another conclusion with major implications is that different combinations of Rossby wave breaking and intense moisture transport can reflect a large range of EPE-related weather systems across climate zones and can thus form the basis for a new classification of EPE regimes. The findings of this study may contribute to an improved understanding of the atmospheric processes that lead to EPEs and may find application in climatic studies on extreme precipitation changes in a warming climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492342","2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-2-129-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492342","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A global climatological perspective on the importance of Rossby wave breaking and intense moisture transport for extreme precipitation events","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-06-30T14:00:38Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Lagrangian analysis of ice cloud formation pathways and their isotopic signals in high-resolution COSMO-iso simulations of the African and Asian monsoon","177996","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","PIRE",,,,,"Weather Clim.

The physical and optical properties of a cloud, as well as the evolution of precipitation, are strong functions of the cloud hydrometeor phase. Aerosol particles support the phase transition of water in the atmosphere from a meta-stable to a thermodynamically preferred stable phase. In the troposphere, the transition of liquid droplets to ice crystals in clouds, via ice-nucleating particles (INPs) which make up only a tiny fraction of all tropospheric aerosol, is of particular relevance. For accurate cloud modeling in climate projections, the parameterization of cloud processes and information such as the concentrations of atmospheric INPs are needed. Presently, only few continuous real-time INP counters are available and the data acquisition often still requires a human operator. To address this restriction, we developed HINC-Auto, a fully automated online INP counter, by adapting an existing custom-built instrument, the Horizontal Ice Nucleation Chamber. HINC-Auto was able to autonomously sample INPs in the immersion mode at a temperature of 243 K and a water saturation ratio of 1.04 for 97 % of the time for 90 consecutive days. Here, we present the technical setup used to acquire automation, discuss improvements to the experimental precision and sampling time, and validate the instrument performance. In the future, the chamber will allow a detailed temporal analysis (including seasonal and annual variability) of ambient INP concentrations observing repeated meteorological phenomena compared to previous episodic events detected during campaigns. In addition, by deploying multiple chambers at different locations, a spatiotemporal variability of INPs at any sampling site used for monitoring INP analysis can be achieved for temperatures ≤ 243 K.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492338","1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-14-269-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492338","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Continuous online monitoring of ice-nucleating particles: development of the automated Horizontal Ice Nucleation Chamber (HINC-Auto)","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-06-30T13:54:41Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000611014800002","Atmos. meas. tech.","1","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Surface cyclones are identified in three regions (Argentina, Uruguay and SEBrazil) and it is quantified how often PV streamers and PV cutoffs co‐occur with cyclogenesis events. There are interesting regional and seasonal differences: in Argentina PV streamers occur mainly with cyclogenesis in summer, and in Uruguay and SEBrazil in both summer and winter. In the three regions, PV streamers associated with cyclogenesis occur most frequently at 320 K, except for summer in SEBrazil, where they predominate at 340 K. PV cutoffs occur with lower frequencies than PV streamers during cyclogenesis, and they occur more often in summer than in winter in all three regions. The dynamics of cyclogenesis differs among the three regions in some important aspects. In Argentina, the environment is slightly more baroclinic in summer and genesis occurs beneath the equatorial entrance of a jet streak. In this season, the anomalous PV associated with a PV streamer is important to favour ascent in the baroclinic environment contributing to surface cyclogenesis. Similar patterns occur for cyclogenesis in summer and winter in Uruguay, and in winter in SEBrazil. In Argentina during winter, cyclogenesis is located beneath the poleward exit of a jet streak, with a weaker PV streamer upstream. In SEBrazil during summer, the jet stream is far displaced from the genesis region and cyclogenesis occurs in a more barotropic environment.",,,"0899-8418||1097-0088",,"10.1002/joc.6644","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/421440","en","Wiley",,,"Cyclogenesis||Potential vorticity||PV cutoffs||PV streamers||South America","A potential vorticity perspective on cyclogenesis over centre-eastern South America","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2020-06-20T02:55:19Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85085875145","000538487200001","Int. j. climatol.","1","International Journal of Climatology","41","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

With increasing temperatures, there is an a priori assumption that droughts are becoming more severe. However, the link between droughts and climate change is not sufficiently understood. Here we investigate trends in long-term agricultural drought and the influence of increasing temperatures and precipitation deficits.  Using a combination of models and observational datasets, we studied trends, spanning the period from 1900 (to approximate pre-industrial conditions) to 2018, for six regions in eastern Africa in four drought-related annually averaged variables: soil moisture, precipitation, temperature, and evaporative demand (E0). In standardized soil moisture data, we found no discernible trends. The strongest influence on soil moisture variability was from precipitation, especially in the drier or water-limited study regions; temperature and E0 did not demonstrate strong relations to soil moisture. However, the error margins on precipitation trend estimates are large and no clear trend is evident, whereas significant positive trends were observed in local temperatures. The trends in E0 are predominantly positive, but we do not find strong relations between E0 and soil moisture trends. Nevertheless, the E0 trend results can still be of interest for irrigation purposes because it is E0 that determines the maximum evaporation rate.  We conclude that until now the impact of increasing local temperatures on agricultural drought in eastern Africa is limited and we recommend that any soil moisture analysis be supplemented by an analysis of precipitation deficit.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000462793","2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-12-17-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462793","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Impact of precipitation and increasing temperatures on drought trends in eastern Africa","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-01-15T05:07:54Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099015419","000606809600002",,"1","Earth System Dynamics","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Near-surface cold and warm temperature advection over the ocean in the context of extratropical cyclones additionally leads to important air–sea exchange. In this paper, we investigate the impact of these air–sea fluxes on the stable water isotope (SWI) composition of water vapour in the Southern Ocean's atmospheric boundary layer. SWIs serve as a tool to trace phase change processes involved in the atmospheric water cycle and, thus, provide important insight into moist atmospheric processes associated with extratropical cyclones. Here we combine a 3-month ship-based SWI measurement data set around Antarctica with a series of regional high-resolution numerical model simulations from the isotope-enabled numerical weather prediction model COSMOiso. We objectively identify atmospheric cold and warm temperature advection associated with the cold and warm sector of extratropical cyclones, respectively, based on the air–sea temperature difference applied to the measurement and the simulation data sets. A Lagrangian composite analysis of temperature advection based on the COSMOiso simulation data is compiled to identify the main processes affecting the observed variability of the isotopic signal in marine boundary layer water vapour in the region from 35 to 70∘ S. This analysis shows that the cold and warm sectors of extratropical cyclones are associated with contrasting SWI signals. Specifically, the measurements show that the median values of δ18O and δ2H in the atmospheric water vapour are 3.8 ‰ and 27.9 ‰ higher during warm than during cold advection. The median value of the second-order isotope variable deuterium excess d, which can be used as a measure of non-equilibrium processes during phase changes, is 6.4 ‰ lower during warm than during cold advection. These characteristic isotope signals during cold and warm advection reflect the opposite air–sea fluxes associated with these large-scale transport events. The trajectory-based analysis reveals that the SWI signals in the cold sector are mainly shaped by ocean evaporation. In the warm sector, the air masses experience a net loss of moisture due to dew deposition as they are advected over the relatively colder ocean, which leads to the observed low d. We show that additionally the formation of clouds and precipitation in moist adiabatically ascending warm air parcels can decrease d in boundary layer water vapour. These findings illustrate the highly variable isotopic composition in water vapour due to contrasting air–sea interactions during cold and warm advection, respectively, induced by the circulation associated with extratropical cyclones. SWIs can thus potentially be useful as tracers for meridional air advection and other characteristics associated with the dynamics of the storm tracks over interannual timescales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492347","2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-2-331-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492347","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The role of air–sea fluxes for the water vapour isotope signals in the cold and warm sectors of extratropical cyclones over the Southern Ocean","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-06-30T14:08:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Diabatic processes in North Atlantic weather systems: synoptic and mesoscale dynamics","165941","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,"Weather Clim.

They are the primary cloud and precipitation-producing flow in extratropical cyclones and can trigger extreme precipitation events. The diabatic processes during the WCB ascent influence the dynamics of extratropical cyclones, and WCBs can affect the downstream Rossby wave pattern. Thus, the correct representation of WCBs is essential for the quality of numerical weather prediction. Convection embedded in WCBs frequently occurs and modifies the precipitation pattern. In this thesis, the influence of model resolution and explicitly sim- ulating deep convection on the representation of WCBs is explored in global high-resolution simulations. We calculate and examine WCB trajectories over a set of simulations using the hy- drostatic Integrated Forecasting System with parameterized and explicit convection at horizontal grid spacings of 1.4km, 4.5km, and 9km. We present a global comparison of the simulations, three WCB case studies, and a systematic intercomparison of WCB trajectories over 10 days. We find that the simulations with explicit convection suffer, especially in the tropics, from model spin-up and produce too much precipitation during the first hours to days. In the three case studies, differences in WCB representation between the simulations become apparent after only a few hours lead time. These comprise distinct differences in the location and ascent rates of WCB air parcels and the ascent structure at the cold front. However, the simulations show a large case-to-case variability in their differences. For the case study with fast ascending trajecto- ries and partly convective characteristics, the differences in the WCB trajectory characteristics are more pronounced than for the other two case studies with a more gradual ascent. The statistical analyses of the WCB trajectory characteristics performed over the 10 days confirm the differences found in the three case studies. Overall, a larger number of WCB trajectories ascend in the simulations with explicit convection than in the simulation with parameterized convection. Furthermore, WCB trajectories in the simulations with explicit convection ascend higher and faster and, thus, reach their minimum pressure after a shorter time. Among the simulations with explicit convection, increasing resolution decreases the number of WCB tra- jectories, the total ascent, and the ascent speed. Even though the characteristics of the WCB trajectories differ in the simulations, no apparent effect on the dynamical impact of the WCB and on the downstream development could be identified in the investigated WCB case studies. This highlights the missing knowledge under which synoptic conditions WCBs largely influence the downstream development.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000482766",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/482766","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Warm conveyor belt||trajectories||Convection-resolving model","Effects of resolving convection in IFS simulations on the representation of warm conveyor belts","Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,,"2021-05-05T14:46:34Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

How aerosols interact with clouds contributes to one of the largest uncertainty within current climate projections. Ice nucleating particles (INPs) are a special subset of aerosols that can aid the phase transition of cloud droplets to ice crystals. As only a tiny fraction of all atmospheric particles have the ability to act as INPs, their study remains challenging. The causes for the atmospheric variability in INP number concentrations, the composition of INPs, and their atmospheric transport pathways remain insufficiently understood in part because of the limitations of the available instruments to autonomously sense atmospheric INP concentrations.  To address this bottleneck, we developed the automated Horizontal Ice Nucleation Chamber (HINC-Auto), a fully automated online INP counter, by modifying an existing instrument, the Horizontal Ice Nucleation Chamber. HINC-Auto was able to sample INPs for 14 consecutive months. To date, this is the longest data set of online INP measurements. Here, we introduce the technical setup for automation, present improvements to the experimental precision and sampling as well as the performance validation and verification of the instrument.  The long-term measurements took place at the High Altitude Research Station Jungfraujoch (JFJ, 3580 m a.s.l.) in the Swiss Alps, which is frequently located in the free troposphere (FT), but planetary boundary layer influence (BLI) can also occur due to convective or orographic lifting of the air masses. The INPs were sampled at a temperature of 243 K and at a saturation ratio with respect to liquid water (Sw) of 1.04, which ensures that conditions mimicking mixed phase clouds (MPCs) prevail in HINC-Auto. The long-term data set of INP concentrations at the JFJ allows a detailed temporal analysis, including the quantitative contribution of Saharan dust and important atmospheric constituent of clouds to the total INP concentration, the seasonal and diurnal variability of INP concentrations, and how the INP concentrations vary during and after precipitation.  Between Feb. 7 and Dec. 31, 2020, we detected 26 Saharan Dust Events (SDEs), which all together contributed to 17% of the total investigated time period. For detected  SDEs, the median INP concentrations varied two orders of magnitude, between 1.7 and 161 INP/std L. While 74.7 ± 0.2% of all INPs were measured during SDEs, we argue that mineral dust is also present outside of SDEs, indicated by satellite retrieved dust mass concentrations. We estimate 97.5 ± 0.3% of all INPs at the set sampling conditions (243 K, Sw = 1.04) to be mineral dust particles ice-active in the immersion mode. Furthermore, it was found that unpolarized ceilometer signals can be used as a proxy for INP concentrations.  The observed INP concentrations between Feb. 7 and Jan. 31., 2021, followed a leptokurtic log-normal frequency distribution, which is consistent with other studies and the theory. The median INP concentration over the analyzed 12 months was 1.4 INP/std L (incl. SDEs), and 1.2 INP/std L for non-SDE FT periods. After filtering for SDEs, a seasonal cycle of INPs was found with concentrations being highest in April, followed by summer, and lowest in fall. For days purely in the FT, a diurnal cycle was absent, while days with contributions of BLI showed a diurnal cycle. The seasonal and diurnal variability of INPs during non-SDE periods is significantly lower than the overall variability observed in INP concentrations of more than 3 orders of magnitude, which can be attributed to the presence of SDEs.  Analyzing severe precipitation events in Switzerland and their corresponding INP concentrations at the JFJ between Feb. 7, 2020, and Jan. 31, 2021, revealed that the distribution of INP concentrations was insignificantly different for periods with severe precipitation rates compared to the remaining periods. After the onset of precipitation, the median INP concentrations decreased by 43% within the first 24 hours and recovered by 8% within the first 24 hours after the end of precipitation. This is unlike ground-based observations at low altitudes, where an increase of INPs was reported during and after precipitation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493877",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493877","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Monitoring of Ice Nucleating Particles (INP) at the Jungfraujoch: Automation of the Horizontal Ice Nucleation Chamber for Continuous INP Monitoring","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,,"2021-07-10T07:17:29Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27761",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To understand the consequences of choices associated with different future emission pathways, as well as adaptation needs, targeted local-scale climate information accounting for major sources of climate change uncertainty is urgently needed. While Earth System Models (ESMs) are the most established tools to quantify the implications of changing greenhouse gas concentrations on the climate system, their computational cost implies that they can only sparsely explore regional climate change uncertainty. Computationally efficient ESM emulators are promising tools to fill the gap between the climate information that is needed and the climate information that can be provided by ESMs.  In this thesis, a framework for regional ESM emulation is presented and its first implementation, a Modular Earth System Model Emulator with spatially Resolved output called MESMER, is developed. In combination with a global mean temperature emulator, MESMER is able to account for all three major sources of climate change projection uncertainty at the local scale: (i)  internal variability uncertainty, i.e., unforced natural climate variability; (ii) forced climate response uncertainty, i.e., the Earth system's response to forced natural changes (solar and volcanic) and human influences (greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions, land use changes etc); and (iii) emission uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty in the emission pathway humans choose to follow. In four scientific studies, constituting individual chapters of this thesis, MESMER is introduced, extended, and applied in various contexts.  In Chapter 2, the MESMER framework is proposed and used to successfully approximate annual temperature change field time series for the highest emission scenario of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). MESMER is an ESM-specific emulator and, by being trained on each ESM individually, captures the different ESMs' unique characteristics. Thereby, only a single training simulation covering the historical period and the future scenario is required to calibrate MESMER for each ESM. This feature is of key importance to be able to emulate the full regional climate change uncertainty space spanned by the CMIP5 ensemble, since the majority of the CMIP5 ESMs only carried out a single simulation per emission scenario. By approximating the ESM-specific forced warming response as a direct function of forced global mean warming and by stochastically generating additional natural variability realizations for each CMIP5 ESM, an emulated multi-ESM initial-condition ensemble with thousands of members is created at a negligible computational cost.  In Chapter 3, MESMER is employed to derive regionally-optimized projections of the highest emission scenario of the newly available Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) ensemble. When evaluating individual ESMs' performance with respect to a global metric (global temperature trend) and a regional metric (regional response to global warming), it is revealed that there is no direct relationship between global and regional response performance. This motivates to ""crossbreed"" ESMs by recombining observationally-constrained global and local features of different ESMs. The resulting hybrid emulations thoroughly sample the observationally-consistent climate change projection uncertainty phase space. Differences between the emulated optimized projections and emulations of the original CMIP6 ensemble are spatially diverse but the highest warming projections are generally reduced.  In Chapter 4, MESMER is coupled to the emission-driven, global mean emulator MAGICC. This MAGICC-MESMER emulator chain is able to provide ESM-specific as well as constrained probabilistic temperature change field time series for any given emission scenario. Here, MESMER is trained on all CMIP6 simulations from all available scenarios for each ESM to obtain as robust parameter estimates as possible. The resulting parameters are scenario-independent and it is confirmed that global forced warming is the only predictor needed to successfully emulate annual forced warming for a broad range of emission scenarios for most ESMs and in most regions. The emulated MAGICC-MESMER ensemble can complement and extend the original CMIP6 ensemble in three key aspects. (i) The forced climate response and natural variability uncertainty can be sampled more thoroughly with millions of emulations readily available. (ii) The same uncertainty space can be covered for any emission scenario, which is especially important because in the CMIP6 ensemble some of the societally most relevant high mitigation scenarios have been run by considerably fewer ESMs than other scenarios. (iii) Other lines of evidence, such as observational constraints, can be integrated to refine future projections.  In Chapter 5, the MAGICC-MESMER emulator chain is used to assign responsibility for past and near-term future country-level warming and extreme hot years to single major emitters, a task which is too computationally expensive to be addressed with full ESM ensembles. Specifically, the contributions of the five largest historical emitters - China, the United States, the European Union, India, and Russia - are quantified in the context of their historical past and pledged future emissions until 2030. This is done both for actual emissions and for hypothetical per capita scenarios in which the whole globe's per capita emissions are set to follow each one of these emitters' per capita emissions. The results highlight the major emitters' relevance for regional-scale climate change and provide new angles for the climate policy discourse.  MESMER, when used in combination with a global emulator, is the first tool to rapidly provide targeted local-scale climate information accounting for all major sources of climate change projection uncertainty. MESMER's code has been made publicly available to increase its accessibility and to accelerate its uptake by a broader user community. This opens perspectives for unprecedented near-real-time assessments of regionally resolved climate consequences induced by different policy choices for diverse users.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000519631",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/519631","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","efficient Earth system modeling||Earth system model emulation||Earth system model emulator||MESMER||regional climate change||temperature projections||regionally optimized temperature projections||attribution||CMIP5||CMIP6","MESMER - A Modular Earth System Model Emulator with Spatially Resolved Output","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,,"2021-12-08T19:40:13Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27721",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The aim of these so-called subseasonal predictions is to push the limits of traditional weather forecasting and bridge the gap to seasonal predictions as forecast users from many sectors (including agriculture, health, humanitarian sector, energy trading, re-insurance) could strongly benefit from improved subseasonal forecasts. However, subseasonal prediction skill is generally low due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere. It is thus crucial to distinguish between situations for which the skill is enhanced and those for which subseasonal forecasts cannot provide useful information. Knowledge about the temporal and spatial variations of predictability is valuable for users of subseasonal predictions and can improve their confidence in the forecasts.  Despite a variety of suggested sources of predictability, subseasonal prediction skill is particularly poor over Europe. In this thesis, we analyze the variations of subseasonal European near-surface temperature predictability. We use operational and retrospective forecasts out to two months lead time that are generated with numerical prediction models, the main tool used for making subseasonal predictions. We show that when evaluating the skill of subseasonal forecasts, deviations from stationarity in the climatology, such as trends, have to be carefully accounted for. When neglecting long-term warming trends during the reference period, estimates of temperature skill tend to be inflated compared to the actual skill. Only when the non-stationary components of the climatology are correctly taken into account, it is possible to make inferences about the temporal variability of predictability. We then use these results in order to analyze the month-to-month variations in subseasonal forecast skill. Using 20 years of retrospective forecasts, we show that there is a distinct seasonal cycle in subseasonal forecast skill: At lead times between 10 and 20 days, European land temperatures in winter, especially in February and March, are predicted with smaller errors and higher certainty than in any other season. The situations that are predicted best during these months feature a large-scale atmospheric flow pattern of increased westerly flow over the North Atlantic and concurrent higher temperatures over Europe, central Asia and Siberia. This zonal flow is accompanied by distinct anomalies in the tropics and polar stratosphere during forecast initialization that can serve as predictors of forecast skill. Especially cold anomalies in the lower stratosphere during initialization are useful indicators of enhanced subseasonal forecast skill for European land temperatures in winter. While subseasonal forecast skill in summer is lower than in winter, it is also possible to distinguish between better and poorer forecasts in summer based on the type of forecast event. Particularly in central to eastern Europe, summer warm extremes are overall predicted better than cold extremes and average temperatures indicating an asymmetry in skill for temperatures in different parts of the climatological distribution. This has potential implications for prediction skill in a future warmer climate.  The results of this thesis can allow stakeholders to make more informed forecast-based decisions and can thus help to increase confidence in the products provided by forecasting centers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000512182",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/512182","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Subseasonal Prediction and Predictability of European Temperatures","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,,"2021-10-27T20:28:07Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27503",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Therefore, MPCs are thermodynamically unstable enabling the rapid growth of ice crystals in conditions where liquid drops evaporate. Consequently, precipitation formation in MPCs occurs faster than in liquid water clouds. The ice phase contributes up to 63% to surface precipitation globally and up to 50% in the continental mid-latitudes. At temperatures warmer than ~ −38 °C, primary ice production occurs through heterogeneous nucleation, which involves ice nucleating particles (INPs). However, aerial and ground-based observations show that the ice crystal number concentrations (ICNCs) in winter and summertime orographic MPCs are typically 1 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than the concentration of INPs. It was hypothesized that secondary ice production, specifically ice multiplication through rime splintering, could be the reason for this discrepancy. However, theoretical calculations and numerical simulations of rime splintering could not account for the high observed ICNCs. Also, the rapid glaciation of observed MPCs is suggested to occur faster than what can be achieved in laboratory experiments that considered rime splintering. The evidence is clear that other processes than the presence of INPs enhance ice formation in MPCs. Representing the ice phase correctly in models is crucial for simulating the lifetime of MPCs and precipitation formation accurately. Therefore, in this thesis, I explored processes involving secondary ice production (SIP) and the seeder-feeder process that could enhance ICNCs using the regional climate model COSMO.  Secondary ice production occurs through (1) the breakup of ice particles during ice-graupel collisions and (2) frozen droplet shattering upon freezing. To address the discrepancy, we conducted COSMO simulations based on data collected during the RACLETS campaign, in the Swiss Alps in February and March 2019. We hypothesized that the ICNCs could be enhanced through collisional breakup and droplet shattering which could explain the INPs vs ICNCs discrepancy. On 7 March 2019 near Davos, we simulated the passage of a cold front to assess the role of secondary ice production on wintertime MPCs. Surface measurements of ICNCs, using the HoloGondel platform, were between 9±3 and 19±4 per liter during the afternoon. Simulations of droplet shattering underestimated the surface ICNCs by at least 2 orders of magnitude because the cloud base temperatures were colder than what is needed for optimal conditions for droplet shattering. However, the simulated ICNCs as a result of collisional breakup were generally in agreement with the HoloGondel observations. The explosive breakup in the mid levels of the cloud caused a drastic decrease in the liquid water fraction favoring depositional growth of ice particles. Consequently, the microphysics predominantly controlled the reduction of precipitation in localized regions of high precipitation compared to the control simulation which did not include any SIP processes. SIP show promise in narrowing the gap between observed and simulated ICNCs.  Enhanced ICNCs compared to INP concentrations can also occur when ice particles sediment from an upper seeder cloud into a lower laying feeder cloud (external seeder-feeder) or when ice particles sediment from the cirrus region into warmer regions of the same cloud (internal seeder-feeder). We hypothesize that: (1) the external and internal seeder-feeder process could significantly enhance the ICNCs and (2) when the seeding particles are removed in the simulations, the surface precipitation will decrease significantly. On 18 May 2016 in the Swiss Alps, a high number of multi-layered clouds were observed by the DARDAR-CLOUD satellite. We simulated this case to elucidate the occurrence of seeder-feeder events and their impact on surface precipitation. The external seeder-feeder events occurred 10.3% of the time when multilayered clouds were observed. On average over the domain, ice particles seldom could survive a fall greater than 2.5 km. When they survived 58.3% of the ice particle mass was lost as a result of melting or sublimation. When we removed the seeding particles from the external and internal seeder-feeder processes, the depositional growth rate was reduced, corresponding to a slower glaciation of the clouds. The precipitation was reduced in the internal seeder-feeder process by up to 7.5% compared to the control simulation. The external seeder-feeder process was shown to impact surface precipitation significantly through the enhancement of ICNCs in the feeder cloud, however their infrequent occurrence can most likely not explain the frequently observed discrepancy (from literature) between ICNCs and INPs. However, the internal seeder-feeder processes enhances the ICNCs significantly in the lower cloud resulting in significant enhancements in surface precipitation.  Increasing the concentration of INPs can aid in the formation of more ice particles, but this does not address the discrepancy between ICNCs and INPs. However, we hypothesised that enhanced aerosols can be linked with enhanced homogeneous freezing of liquid droplets. Therefore, these homogeneously formed ice crystals can sediment into the cloud’s mixed-phase region, enhancing the ICNCs and consequently surface precipitation. In summer 2017, a flooding event occurred in Switzerland which coincided with a Saharan dust outbreak during which elevated aerosol concentrations were observed ahead of the cold front. We hypothesized that there was a link between the aerosols and the flooding event. A one-moment cloud microphysics scheme, similar to the one used by MeteoSwiss, unsuccessfully predicted the flooding event. We speculated that the two-moment scheme could have predicted the flooding event. We therefore compared an aerosol perturbed two-moment scheme to a control simulation using an unperturbed control two-moment cloud microphysics scheme. The choice of the microphysics scheme had the largest impact on surface precipitation. The simulations perturbed with higher cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) showed a shift towards the lee of the Alpine ridge, while the INP perturbations enhanced precipitation on the windward side. In the INP perturbations, the reduction in the total cloud liquid and increase in total cloud ice only caused a shift in the growth mechanism to depositional growth relating to a shift in precipitation, but not a significant change in the amount of precipitation. Therefore, the enhanced aerosols could not explain the flooding event.  In this thesis, we demonstrated the importance of both collisional breakup and the seeder-feeder mechanism in enhancing ICNCs in clouds, resulting in significant changes in growth regimes of ice particles yielding significant changes in surface precipitation. Employing SIP processes in models is a way forward in reducing the discrepancy between observed and modeled ICNCs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000511939",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/511939","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Mixed-phase clouds||Secondary ice production||Microphysics||Seeder-Feeder||Aerosols||Ice Nucleating Particles","The Impact of the Ice Phase on Orographic Mixed-phase Clouds and Surface Precipitation in the Swiss Alps","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,,"2021-10-26T19:03:58Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Exploiting orographic clouds for constraining the sources of ice crystals","175824","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT","27762",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We use two snow models, the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research Utrecht Firn Densification Model (IMAU-FDM) and SNOWPACK, and force these (partly) with mass and energy fluxes from the Regional Atmospheric Climate MOdel (RACMO2.3p2) to construct a 1979–2016 climatology of AP firn density, temperature, and liquid water content. An evaluation using 75 snow temperature observations at 10 m depth and density profiles from 11 firn cores shows that output of both snow models is sufficiently realistic to warrant further analysis of firn characteristics.  The models give comparable results: in 941 model grid points in either model, covering ∼28 000 km2, PFAs existed for at least 1 year in the simulated period, most notably in the western AP. At these locations, surface meltwater production typically exceeds 200 mmw.e.yr−1 , with accumulation for most locations >1000mmw.e.yr−1  .  Most persistent and extensive are PFAs modelled on and around Wilkins Ice Shelf. Here, both meltwater production and accumulation rates are sufficiently high to sustain a PFA on 49 % of the ice shelf area in (up to) 100 % (depending on the model) of the years in the 1979–2016 period. Although this PFA presence is confirmed by recent observations, its extent in the models appears underestimated. Other notable PFA locations are Wordie Ice Shelf, an ice shelf that has almost completely disappeared in recent decades, and the relatively warm north-western side of mountain ranges in Palmer Land, where accumulation rates can be extremely high, and PFAs are formed frequently. PFAs are not necessarily more frequent in areas with the largest melt and accumulation rates, but they do grow larger and retain more meltwater, which could increase the likelihood of ice shelf hydrofracturing.  We find that not only the magnitude of melt and accumulation is important but also the timing of precipitation events relative to melt events. Large accumulation events that occur in the months following an above-average summer melt event favour PFA formation in that year. Most PFAs are predicted near the grounding lines of the (former) Prince Gustav, Wilkins, and Wordie ice shelves. This highlights the need to further investigate how PFAs may impact ice shelf disintegration events through the process of hydrofracturing in a similar way as supraglacial lakes do.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000472070","1994-0416||1994-0424",,"10.5194/tc-15-695-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472070","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"An exploratory modelling study of perennial firn aquifers in the Antarctic Peninsula for the period 1979-2016","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-02-28T21:54:59Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85100891299","000619837600001",,"2","The Cryosphere","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the influence of land–atmosphere feedbacks on future P–E changes and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that soil moisture (SM) strongly impacts future P–E changes, especially in drylands, by regulating evapotranspiration and atmospheric moisture inflow. Using modelling and empirical approaches, we find a consistent negative SM feedback on P–E, which may offset ~60% of the decline in dryland P–E otherwise expected in the absence of SM feedbacks. The negative feedback is not caused by atmospheric thermodynamic responses to declining SM; rather, reduced SM, in addition to limiting evapotranspiration, regulates atmospheric circulation and vertical ascent to enhance moisture transport into drylands. This SM effect is a large source of uncertainty in projected dryland P–E changes, underscoring the need to better constrain future SM changes and improve the representation of SM–atmosphere processes in models.",,,"1758-6798",,"10.1038/s41558-020-00945-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/460884","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Soil moisture–atmosphere feedbacks mitigate declining water availability in drylands","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-01-10T03:41:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85098638982","000604840800003","Nat.

Factors such as the duration, timing, and intensity of extreme events influence the magnitude of impacts on ecosystem processes such as gross primary production (GPP), i.e., the ecosystem uptake of CO2. Preceding soil moisture depletion may exacerbate these impacts. However, some vegetation types may be more resilient to climate extremes than others. This effect is insufficiently understood at the global scale and is the focus of this study. Using a global upscaled product of GPP that scales up in situ land CO2 flux observations with global satellite remote sensing, we study the impact of climate extremes at the global scale. We find that GPP in grasslands and agricultural areas is generally reduced during heat and drought events. However, we also find that forests, if considered globally, appear in general to not be particularly sensitive to droughts and heat events that occurred during the analyzed period or even show increased GPP values during these events. On the one hand, normal-to-increased GPP values are in many cases plausible, e.g., when conditions prior to the event have been particularly positive. On the other hand, however, normal-to-increased GPP values in forests may also reflect a lack of sensitivity in current remote-sensing-derived GPP products to the effects of droughts and heatwaves. The overall picture calls for a differentiated consideration of different land cover types in the assessments of risks of climate extremes for ecosystem functioning.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000462796","1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-18-39-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462796","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Vegetation modulates the impact of climate extremes on gross primary production","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-01-15T05:07:54Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099069626","000606791900001",,"1","Biogeosciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Forests typically have higher evapotranspiration rates than grasslands in the tropics, but whether this is also the case in the midlatitudes is still debated. To explore this question and the underlying physical processes behind these varying evapotranspiration rates of forests and grasslands in more detail, a regional model study with idealized afforestation scenarios was performed for Europe. In the first experiment, Europe was maximally forested, and in the second one, all forests were turned into grassland.  The results of this modeling study exhibit the same contradicting evapotranspiration characteristics of forests and grasslands as documented in observational studies, but by means of an additional sensitivity simulation in which the surface roughness of the forest was reduced to grassland, the mechanisms behind these varying evapotranspiration rates could be revealed. Due to the higher surface roughness of a forest, solar radiation is more efficiently transformed into turbulent sensible heat fluxes, leading to lower surface temperatures (top of vegetation) than in grassland. The saturation deficit between the vegetation and the atmosphere, which depends on the surface temperature, is consequently reduced over forests. This reduced saturation deficit counteracts the transpiration-facilitating characteristics of a forest (deeper roots, a higher leaf area index, LAI, and lower albedo values than grassland). If the impact of the reduced saturation deficit exceeds the effects of the transpiration-facilitating characteristics of a forest, evapotranspiration is reduced compared to grassland. If not, evapotranspiration rates of forests are higher. The interplay of these two counteracting factors depends on the latitude and the prevailing forest type in a region.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474237","1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-18-1499-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474237","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"What determines the sign of the evapotranspiration response to afforestation in European summer?","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-03-13T04:33:43Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85102057502","000626292900001",,"4","Biogeosciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In particular, warming during the ‘global warming hiatus’ in the early twenty-first century appears overestimated in CMIP5 and CMIP6 multi-model means. We examine the role of equatorial Pacific variability in these divergences since 1950 by comparing 18 studies that quantify the Pacific contribution to the ‘hiatus’ and earlier periods and by investigating the reasons for differing results. During the ‘global warming hiatus’ from 1992 to 2012, the estimated contributions differ by a factor of five, with multiple linear regression approaches generally indicating a smaller contribution of Pacific variability to global temperature than climate model experiments where the simulated tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) or wind stress anomalies are nudged towards observations. These so-called pacemaker experiments suggest that the ‘hiatus’ is fully explained and possibly over-explained by Pacific variability. Most of the spread across the studies can be attributed to two factors: neglecting the forced signal in tropical Pacific SST, which is often the case in multiple regression studies but not in pacemaker experiments, underestimates the Pacific contribution to global temperature change by a factor of two during the ‘hiatus’; the sensitivity with which the global temperature responds to Pacific variability varies by a factor of two between models on a decadal time scale, questioning the robustness of single model pacemaker experiments. Once we have accounted for these factors, the CMIP5 mean warming adjusted for Pacific variability reproduces the observed annual global mean temperature closely, with a correlation coefficient of 0.985 from 1950 to 2018. The CMIP6 ensemble performs less favourably but improves if the models with the highest transient climate response are omitted from the ensemble mean.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000451277","0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-020-05493-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/451277","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CMIP5||CMIP6||Internal variability||Decadal variability||Global mean tempeature||ENSO","Pacific variability reconciles observed and modelled global mean temperature increase since 1950","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-11-13T13:44:14Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85094212994","000584852700001","Clim Dyn","1","Climate Dynamics","56","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Because INPs and INMs have spatial and temporal heterogeneity in source, number, and composition, predicting their concentration and distribution is a challenge requiring apt analytical instrumentation. Here, we present the development of our drop Freezing Ice Nuclei Counter (FINC) for the estimation of INP and INM concentrations in the immersion freezing mode. FINC's design builds upon previous droplet freezing techniques (DFTs) and uses an ethanol bath to cool sample aliquots while detecting freezing using a camera. Specifically, FINC uses 288 sample wells of 5–60 µL volume, has a limit of detection of −25.4 ± 0.2 ∘C with 5 µL, and has an instrument temperature uncertainty of ± 0.5 ∘C. We further conducted freezing control experiments to quantify the nonhomogeneous behavior of our developed DFT, including the consideration of eight different sources of contamination.  As part of the validation of FINC, an intercomparison campaign was conducted using an NX-illite suspension and an ambient aerosol sample from two other drop freezing instruments: ETH's DRoplet Ice Nuclei Counter Zurich (DRINCZ) and the University of Basel's LED-based Ice Nucleation Detection Apparatus (LINDA). We also tabulated an exhaustive list of peer-reviewed DFTs, to which we added our characterized and validated FINC.  In addition, we propose herein the use of a water-soluble biopolymer, lignin, as a suitable ice-nucleating standard. An ideal INM standard should be inexpensive, accessible, reproducible, unaffected by sample preparation, and consistent across techniques. First, we compared lignin's freezing temperature across different drop freezing instruments, including on DRINCZ and LINDA, and then determined an empirical fit parameter for future drop freezing validations. Subsequently, we showed that commercial lignin has consistent ice-nucleating activity across product batches and demonstrated that the ice-nucleating ability of aqueous lignin solutions is stable over time. With these findings, we present lignin as a good immersion freezing standard for future DFT intercomparisons in the research field of atmospheric ice nucleation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484246","1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-14-3131-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484246","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Development of the drop Freezing Ice Nuclei Counter (FINC), intercomparison of droplet freezing techniques, and use of soluble lignin as an atmospheric ice nucleation standard","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-05-17T02:43:26Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Organic aerosols’ impact on aerosol-cloud interactions in mixed-phase clouds","179703","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,"85105192734","000646430800003","Atmos. meas. tech.","4","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we present an approach to model urban temperature using the quantile regression forest algorithm and CWS, open government and remote sensing data. The analysis is based on data from 691 sensors in the city of Zurich (Switzerland) during a heat wave using data from for 25-30th June 2019. We trained the model using hourly data from for 25-29th June (n = 71,837) and evaluate the model using data from June 30th (n = 14,105). Based on the model, spatiotemporal temperature maps of 10 × 10 m resolution were produced. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately map urban heat at high spatial and temporal resolution without additional measurement infrastructure. We furthermore critically discuss and spatially map estimated prediction and extrapolation uncertainty. Our approach is able to inform highly localized urban policy and decision-making.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000457358","2212-0955",,"10.1016/j.uclim.2020.100739","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/457358","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Random forest||Urban heat||Low-cost sensors||Crowd-sensing||Machine learning","Mapping urban temperature using crowd-sensing data and machine learning","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2020-12-20T03:43:42Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Combining theory with Big Data?

These, however, are strongly affected by local weather conditions and their future potential might be influenced by climate change. Thus, it is essential for decision-makers in the energy sector to integrate information about climate change in their long-term strategic decisions. These types of decisions are, for instance, required for Switzerland’s upcoming concession renewals, i.e., contracts that regulate how hydropower companies are allowed to use the water owned by local government for power generation over decades. The high-level goal of this thesis is to integrate a specific tool from atmospheric science, so-called weather regimes (WRs), with the strategic decision-making of a stakeholder from Swiss hydropower industry. To this end, we engage directly with a Swiss hydropower company throughout the research process. Together we address three main topics. (1)We develop an understanding of the relationships between Swiss hydropower generation and the large-scale atmospheric flow represented by WRs. (2) Based on both an extensive literature review and our own experience gained in the present project, we propose an engagement framework and practical recommendations on how to implement a transdisciplinary (TD) collaboration with an industry partner. (3)We quantify the role that WRs play for weather parameters in a changing climate, and discuss potential implications of this analysis for the stakeholder’s decision making.   Chapter 2 is dedicated to improving our understanding of how WRs have affected surface weather in Switzerland and Europe and hence Swiss hydropower generation in recent years. We present exploratory analyses investigating (i) whether precipitation in Switzerland is similar in all WRs and at all times in a WR’s life cycle, (ii) how the seven North Atlantic European WRs modulate the spatial pattern of precipitation and wind in Switzerland and Europe, and (iii) whether Swiss hydropower generation systematically increases or decreases during specific WRs. Mean daily precipitation over Switzerland is not strongly linked to weather regime type and duration. However, the spatial distribution of precipitation across Switzerland and Europe exhibits a distinct WR-specific dependency, in particular in the cold season. Finally, we find that the link between Swiss hydropower generation and the active WR is only moderate. Reasons for this moderate link can be numerous other factors that influence Swiss hydropower generation; the large WR domain that captures less of the Switzerland-specific atmospheric flow variability; and the limited dataset used for the presented analyses. Nevertheless, these analyses provide an initial overview of the complexities of how weather and climate influence (future) hydropower generation, provoking new perspectives on how weather matters for Swiss hydropower.   Chapter 3 addresses the following question: How can climate scientists practically implement a transdisciplinary (TD) collaboration with an industry partner to reduce the gap between climate science and decision-making in industry? We propose a novel engagement framework that provides guidance to this question. The framework conceptualizes engagement through scientists and stakeholders overlapping spheres of interests, and it offers the opportunity to explore and widen their overlap as a common space of interests. We present a case study where we apply this framework to our collaboration with the Swiss hydropower company, again using the concept of weather regimes. This case study leads to four practical recommendations for using the proposed engagement framework effectively: (1) Secure an anchor person at management level of the decision-making entity; (2) Be prepared to invest time into triggering and maintaining active engagement by all collaborators; (3) From the start, communicate the open nature of insights and solutions from the engagement process; (4) Be aware that you are working in a field of tension due to a range of motivations, methods, and goals of the individuals involved in the TD collaboration. The engagement framework and the practical recommendations are particularly beneficial for climate scientists who are not yet familiar with TD collaborations.   Chapter 4 aims at improving our understanding of the representation of WRs in climate models and how they are affected by climate change. Using a seven-category all-season WR classification for the North Atlantic and European region as a means to represent important aspects of the variability of the large-scale atmospheric dynamics in this region, we present the first year-round evaluation of WRs in a climate model and associated changes due to climate change. We investigate (i) whether the frequency of occurrence of these regimes observed in reanalysis is captured by historical climate simulations, (ii) whether the frequency of occurrence is affected by climate change, (iii) whether precipitation associated with those WRs is affected by climate change, and (iv) to what degree changes in the frequency of WRs explain the overall climate change signal in precipitation. We use output from historical and end-of-the-century (RCP8.5) Community Earth System Model (CESM) large ensemble simulations to determine the frequency of occurrence of the seven WRs and their associated precipitation patterns in both historical and end-of-the-century climate conditions. As in the re-analysis data from the European Centre for Medium-RangeWeather Forecasts (ECMWF), ERA-Interim, the WRs in CESM explain approximately 80% of the year-round variability in geopotential height at 500 hPa in the considered North Atlantic and European region. Climate change causes an annual increase in the frequency of the Atlantic Trough (AT) and European Blocking (EuBL) regimes, and a decrease of the Greenland Blocking (GL) regime. The contribution of these WR frequency changes to the climate change signal of surface precipitation is however surprisingly small. These findings indicate that climate change imposes subtle changes on the large-scale flow over the North-Atlantic and Europe as revealed by the frequency changes of certain WRs. However, the precipitation patterns associated with the WRs are relatively similar and also affected by climate change in a similar fashion. Together, this implies that precipitation in Europe most likely changes in the future due to an overall warming (all WRs get wetter) and due to subtle changes in the WR frequencies, but not due to strongly altered precipitation dynamics in a given large-scale flow configuration nor due to a substantial increase or decrease in occurrence of a specific WR.   The TD engagement and WR analyses provide valuable insight for decision-makers and scientists alike. Active engagement with the Swiss hydropower company guided methodological choices and research questions while providing direct feedback and triggering reflection on scientific results. This in-depth TD engagement process allowed hydropower decision-makers to benefit from complex scientific expertise they would otherwise not have had access to. Additionally, it highlighted that in the long-term consideration around hydropower generation, climate change is one of the most projectable elements. Thus, decision-makers were encouraged to consider how much could be gained by integrating climate knowledge into their long-term strategic decisions. Future work is encouraged to investigate the role of atmospheric flow dynamics for the energy sector, with more renewable energy sources (solar, wind, and hydropower), integrating multiple energy stakeholders across multiple countries (including state-owned and private firms), and employing alternative statistical analyses and machine learning to analyze additional data that arises from the aforementioned suggestion of increasing included energy sources and stakeholders.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000497310",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/497310","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","climate change||weather regimes||decision making||Research-practice collaboration||transdiscipfinarity||hydropower||stakeholder engagement||CESM-LME","Assessing the potential to strengthen the resilience of the Swiss hydropower sector based on understanding the role of weather regimes in a changing climate","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,,"2021-07-23T08:43:41Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27765",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the risk of contamination from sublimating hydrometeors collected by the intake tube may render these measurements unusable, particularly after crossing low clouds containing supercooled droplets. A large set of (sub)tropical measurements during the 2016–2017 StratoClim balloon campaigns at the southern slopes of the Himalayas allows us to perform an in-depth analysis of this type of contamination. We investigate the efficiency of wall contact and freezing of supercooled droplets in the intake tube and the subsequent sublimation in the UTLS using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). We find that the airflow can enter the intake tube with impact angles up to 60∘, owing to the pendulum motion of the payload. Supercooled droplets with radii > 70 µm, as they frequently occur in mid-tropospheric clouds, typically undergo contact freezing when entering the intake tube, whereas only about 50 % of droplets with 10 µm radius freeze, and droplets < 5 µm radius mostly avoid contact. According to CFD, sublimation of water from an icy intake can account for the occasionally observed unrealistically high water vapour mixing ratios (χH2O > 100 ppmv) in the stratosphere. Furthermore, we use CFD to differentiate between stratospheric water vapour contamination by an icy intake tube and contamination caused by outgassing from the balloon and payload, revealing that the latter starts playing a role only during ascent at high altitudes (p < 20 hPa).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492325","1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-14-239-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492325","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Understanding balloon-borne frost point hygrometer measurements after contamination by mixed-phase clouds","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-06-30T12:50:28Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Investigation of midlatitude high clouds characteristics and processes","159950","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"000611014800001","Atmos. meas. tech.","1","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The aerosol–cloud interactions of soot and associated feedbacks remain uncertain, in part because a coherent understanding of the ice nucleation mechanism and activity of soot has not yet emerged. Here, we provide a new framework that predicts ice formation on soot particles via pore condensation and freezing (PCF) that, unlike previous approaches, considers soot particle properties, capturing their vastly different pore properties compared to other aerosol species such as mineral dust. During PCF, water is taken up into pores of the soot aggregates by capillary condensation. At cirrus temperatures, the pore water can freeze homogeneously and subsequently grow into a macroscopic ice crystal. In the soot-PCF framework presented here, the relative humidity conditions required for these steps are derived for different pore types as a function of temperature. The pore types considered here encompass n-membered ring pores that form between n individual spheres within the same layer of primary particles as well as pores in the form of inner cavities that form between two layers of primary particles. We treat soot primary particles as perfect spheres and use the contact angle between soot and water (θsw), the primary particle diameter (Dpp), and the degree of primary particle overlap (overlap coefficient, Cov) to characterize pore properties. We find that three-membered and four-membered ring pores are of the right size for PCF, assuming primary particle sizes typical of atmospheric soot particles. For these pore types, we derive equations that describe the conditions for all three steps of soot PCF, namely capillary condensation, ice nucleation, and ice growth. Since at typical cirrus conditions homogeneous ice nucleation can be considered immediate as soon as the water volume within the pore is large enough to host a critical ice embryo, soot PCF becomes limited by either capillary condensation or ice crystal growth. We use the soot-PCF framework to derive a new equation to parameterize ice formation on soot particles via PCF, based on soot properties that are routinely measured, including the primary particle size, overlap, and the fractal dimension. These properties, along with the number of primary particles making up an aggregate and the contact angle between water and soot, constrain the parameterization. Applying the new parameterization to previously reported laboratory data of ice formation on soot particles provides direct evidence that ice nucleation on soot aggregates takes place via PCF. We conclude that this new framework clarifies the ice formation mechanism on soot particles in cirrus conditions and provides a new perspective to represent ice formation on soot in climate models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488427","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-7791-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488427","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Soot PCF: Pore condensation and freezing framework for soot aggregates","Review Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-06-07T02:30:11Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85106899140","000655419500003","Atmos. chem. phys.","10","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Assessing this impact with the help of global climate models remains elusive and direct observations are lacking. Here we use a high-resolution cirrus column model to investigate how aircraft-emitted soot particles, released after ice crystals sublimate at the end of the lifetime of contrails and contrail cirrus, perturb the formation of cirrus. By allying cloud simulations with a measurement-based description of soot-induced ice formation, we find that only a small fraction (<1%) of the soot particles succeeds in forming cloud ice alongside homogeneous freezing of liquid aerosol droplets. Thus, soot-perturbed and homogeneously-formed cirrus fundamentally do not differ in optical depth. Our results imply that climate model estimates of global radiative forcing from interactions between aircraft soot and large-scale cirrus may be overestimates.

However, a broader retrospective analysis of available data for both natural and artificial AEFs and EMFs is hampered due to a lack of a semantic approach, preventing data sharing and advancing our understanding of its intrinsic links. Therefore, here we create an ontology (ENET_Ont) for existing (big) data on AEFs within the context of biological systems that is derived from different disciplines that are distributed over many databases.

The ionization rates for the considered period were acquired from the AIMOS (Atmospheric Ionization Module Osnabrück) dataset. For numerical experiments, we applied only the proton-induced ionization rates of that period, while all the other model input parameters, including the electron precipitations, corresponded to the quiet conditions. In January 2005, two major solar proton events with different energy spectra and proton fluxes occurred on January 17 and January 20. Since two geomagnetic storms and several sub-storms took place during the considered period, not only solar protons but also less energetic magnetospheric protons contributed to the calculated ionization rates. Despite the relative transparency of the thermosphere for high-energy protons, an ionospheric response to the SPE and proton precipitation from the magnetotail was obtained in numerical experiments. In the ionospheric E layer, the maximum increase in the electron concentration is localized at high latitudes, and at heights of the ionospheric F2 layer, the positive perturbations were formed in the near-equatorial region. An analysis of the model-derived results showed that changes in the ionospheric F2 layer were caused by a change in the neutral composition of the thermosphere. We found that in the recovery phase after both solar proton events and the enhancement of magnetospheric proton precipitations associated with geomagnetic disturbances, the TEC and electron density in the F region and in topside ionosphere/plasmasphere increase at low- and mid-latitudes due to an enhancement of atomic oxygen concentration. Our results demonstrate an important role of magnetospheric protons in the formation of negative F-region ionospheric storms. According to our results, the topside ionosphere/plasmasphere and bottom-side ionosphere can react to solar and magnetospheric protons both with the same sign of disturbances or in different way. The same statement is true for TEC and foF2 disturbances. Different disturbances of foF2 and TEC at high and low latitudes can be explained by topside electron temperature disturbances.",,,"0273-1177||1879-1948",,"10.1016/j.asr.2020.10.026","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458864","en","Elsevier",,,"Solar proton events||Proton precipitations||Ionosphere||Thermosphere||Whole atmosphere model","Ionospheric response to solar and magnetospheric protons during January 15–22, 2005: EAGLE whole atmosphere model results","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-01-03T03:38:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85096370577",,"Adv. space res.","1","Advances in Space Research","67","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The models are similar to CMIP6/AerChemMIP Earth System Models (ESMs) and provide a robust multi-model ensemble. Inter-model spread of aerosol species lifetimes and emissions appears to be similar to that of mass extinction coefficients (MECs), suggesting that aerosol optical depth (AOD) uncertainties are associated with a broad spectrum of parameterised aerosol processes.  Total AOD is approximately the same as in AeroCom phase I (AP1) simulations. However, we find a 50 % decrease in the optical depth (OD) of black carbon (BC), attributable to a combination of decreased emissions and lifetimes. Relative contributions from sea salt (SS) and dust (DU) have shifted from being approximately equal in AP1 to SS contributing about 2∕3 of the natural AOD in AP3. This shift is linked with a decrease in DU mass burden, a lower DU MEC, and a slight decrease in DU lifetime, suggesting coarser DU particle sizes in AP3 compared to AP1.  Relative to observations, the AP3 ensemble median and most of the participating models underestimate all aerosol optical properties investigated, that is, total AOD as well as fine and coarse AOD (AODf, AODc), Ångström exponent (AE), dry surface scattering (SCdry), and absorption (ACdry) coefficients. Compared to AERONET, the models underestimate total AOD by ca. 21 % ± 20 % (as inferred from the ensemble median and interquartile range). Against satellite data, the ensemble AOD biases range from −37 % (MODIS-Terra) to −16 % (MERGED-FMI, a multi-satellite AOD product), which we explain by differences between individual satellites and AERONET measurements themselves. Correlation coefficients (R) between model and observation AOD records are generally high (R>0.75), suggesting that the models are capable of capturing spatio-temporal variations in AOD. We find a much larger underestimate in coarse AODc (∼ −45 % ± 25 %) than in fine AODf (∼ −15 % ± 25 %) with slightly increased inter-model spread compared to total AOD. These results indicate problems in the modelling of DU and SS. The AODc bias is likely due to missing DU over continental land masses (particularly over the United States, SE Asia, and S. America), while marine AERONET sites and the AATSR SU satellite data suggest more moderate oceanic biases in AODc.  Column AEs are underestimated by about 10 % ± 16 %. For situations in which measurements show AE > 2, models underestimate AERONET AE by ca. 35 %. In contrast, all models (but one) exhibit large overestimates in AE when coarse aerosol dominates (bias ca. +140 % if observed AE < 0.5). Simulated AE does not span the observed AE variability. These results indicate that models overestimate particle size (or underestimate the fine-mode fraction) for fine-dominated aerosol and underestimate size (or overestimate the fine-mode fraction) for coarse-dominated aerosol. This must have implications for lifetime, water uptake, scattering enhancement, and the aerosol radiative effect, which we can not quantify at this moment.  Comparison against Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) in situ data results in mean bias and inter-model variations of −35 % ± 25 % and −20 % ± 18 % for SCdry and ACdry, respectively. The larger underestimate of SCdry than ACdry suggests the models will simulate an aerosol single scattering albedo that is too low. The larger underestimate of SCdry than ambient air AOD is consistent with recent findings that models overestimate scattering enhancement due to hygroscopic growth. The broadly consistent negative bias in AOD and surface scattering suggests an underestimate of aerosol radiative effects in current global aerosol models.  Considerable inter-model diversity in the simulated optical properties is often found in regions that are, unfortunately, not or only sparsely covered by ground-based observations. This includes, for instance, the Sahara, Amazonia, central Australia, and the South Pacific. This highlights the need for a better site coverage in the observations, which would enable us to better assess the models, but also the performance of satellite products in these regions.  Using fine-mode AOD as a proxy for present-day aerosol forcing estimates, our results suggest that models underestimate aerosol forcing by ca. −15 %, however, with a considerably large interquartile range, suggesting a spread between −35 % and +10 %.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000462794","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-87-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462794","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"AeroCom phase III multi-model evaluation of the aerosol life cycle and optical properties using ground- And space-based remote sensing as well as surface in situ observations","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-01-15T05:07:54Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85099066651","000606808300001","Atmos. chem. phys.","1","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we validate vertical profiles of aerosol backscatter coefficient (βaer) measured by two independent lidar systems using co-located balloon-borne measurements performed by Compact Optical Backscatter Aerosol Detector (COBALD) sondes. COBALD provides high-precision in situ measurements of βaer at two wavelengths (455 and 940 nm). The two analyzed lidar systems are the research Raman Lidar for Meteorological Observations (RALMO) and the commercial CHM15K ceilometer (Lufft, Germany). We consider in total 17 RALMO and 31 CHM15K profiles, co-located with simultaneous COBALD soundings performed throughout the years 2014–2019 at the MeteoSwiss observatory of Payerne (Switzerland). The RALMO (355 nm) and CHM15K (1064 nm) measurements are converted to 455 and 940 nm, respectively, using the Ångström exponent profiles retrieved from COBALD data. To account for the different receiver field-of-view (FOV) angles between the two lidars (0.01–0.02∘) and COBALD (6∘), we derive a custom-made correction using Mie-theory scattering simulations. Our analysis shows that both lidar instruments achieve on average a good agreement with COBALD measurements in the boundary layer and free troposphere, up to 6 km altitude. For medium-high-aerosol-content measurements at altitudes below 3 km, the mean ± standard deviation difference in βaer calculated from all considered soundings is −2 % ± 37 % (−0.018 ± 0.237 Mm−1 sr−1 at 455 nm) for RALMO−COBALD and +5 % ± 43 % (+0.009 ± 0.185 Mm−1 sr−1 at 940 mm) for CHM15K−COBALD. Above 3 km altitude, absolute deviations generally decrease, while relative deviations increase due to the prevalence of air masses with low aerosol content. Uncertainties related to the FOV correction and spatial- and temporal-variability effects (associated with the balloon's drift with altitude and different integration times) contribute to the large standard deviations observed at low altitudes. The lack of information on the aerosol size distribution and the high atmospheric variability prevent an accurate quantification of these effects. Nevertheless, the excellent agreement observed in individual profiles, including fine and complex structures in the βaer vertical distribution, shows that under optimal conditions, the discrepancies with the in situ measurements are typically comparable to the estimated statistical uncertainties in the remote-sensing measurements. Therefore, we conclude that βaer profiles measured by the RALMO and CHM15K lidar systems are in good agreement with in situ measurements by COBALD sondes up to 6 km altitude.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000472069","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-2267-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472069","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Validation of aerosol backscatter profiles from Raman lidar and ceilometer using balloon-borne measurements","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-02-28T21:54:59Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Investigation of midlatitude high clouds characteristics and processes","159950","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85100882552","000620254300002","Atmos. chem. phys.","3","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The tropopause-level jet structure modulates the frequency and character of intrusions, although the precise relationship between STT-PBL and jet variability has not been extensively investigated. In this study, we demonstrate how the North Pacific jet transition from winter to summer leads to the observed peak in STT-PBL. We show that the transition enhances STT-PBL through an increase in storm track activity which produces highly amplified Rossby waves and more frequent deep stratospheric intrusions over western North America. This dynamic transition coincides with the gradually deepening PBL, further facilitating STT-PBL in spring. We find that La Niña conditions in late winter are associated with an earlier jet transition and enhanced STT-PBL due to deeper and more frequent tropopause folds. An opposite response is found during El Niño conditions. El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions also influence STT-PBL in late spring or early summer, during which time La Niña conditions are associated with larger and more frequent tropopause folds than both El Niño and ENSO-neutral conditions. These results suggest that knowledge of ENSO state and the North Pacific jet structure in late winter could be leveraged for predicting the strength of STT-PBL in the following months.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474225","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-2781-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474225","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The spring transition of the North Pacific jet and its relation to deep stratosphere-to-troposphere mass transport over western North America","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-03-13T04:32:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101529470","000625312700004","Atmos. chem. phys.","4","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The instrument is sufficiently small (30×23×11 cm3) and lightweight (3.9 kg) to be carried by meteorological balloons and used for frequent soundings in the UTLS. The spectrometer is a fully independent system, operating autonomously for the duration of a balloon flight. To achieve the required robustness, while satisfying stringent mass limitations, the concepts for optics and electronics have been fundamentally reconsidered compared to laboratory-based spectrometers. A significant enhancement of the mechanical and optical stability is achieved by integrating a newly designed segmented circular multipass cell which allows for 6 m optical path length in a very compact fashion. The H2O volume mixing ratio is retrieved by calibration-free evaluation of the spectral data, i.e., only relying on SI-traceable measurements and absorption line parameters. The open-path design reduces the risk of contamination and allows for fast response and thus high vertical resolution. Laboratory-based characterization experiments show an agreement within 2 % of reference measurements and a precision of 0.1 % under conditions comparable to the UTLS. The instrument successfully performed two balloon-borne test flights up to 28 km altitude. In the troposphere, the retrieved spectroscopic data show an excellent agreement with the accompanying measurements by a frost point hygrometer (CFH). At higher altitude, the quality of the spectral data remained unchanged, but outgassed water vapor within the instrument enclosure was hindering an accurate measurement of the atmospheric water vapor. Despite this limitation, these test flights demonstrated the operation of a compact laser spectrometer in the UTLS aboard a low-volume meteorological balloon, opening the perspective for future highly resolved, accurate, and cost-efficient soundings.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474279","1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-14-1365-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474279","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Compact and lightweight mid-infrared laser spectrometer for balloon-borne water vapor measurements in the UTLS","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-03-14T05:19:10Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101543931","000621619800003","Atmos. meas. tech.","2","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The latter describes the removal of HNO3 from the stratosphere by sedimenting PSC particles, which hinders chlorine deactivation by the formation of reservoir species. Therefore, an accurate representation of PSCs in chemistry–climate models (CCMs) is of great importance to correctly simulate polar ozone concentrations. Here, we evaluate PSCs as simulated by the CCM SOCOLv3.1 for the Antarctic winters 2006, 2007 and 2010 by comparison with backscatter measurements by CALIOP on board the CALIPSO satellite. The year 2007 represents a typical Antarctic winter, while 2006 and 2010 are characterized by above- and below-average PSC occurrence. The model considers supercooled ternary solution (STS) droplets, nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) particles, water ice particles and mixtures thereof. PSCs are parameterized in terms of temperature and partial pressures of HNO3 and H2O, assuming equilibrium between the gas and particulate phase. The PSC scheme involves a set of prescribed microphysical parameters, namely ice number density, NAT particle radius and maximum NAT number density. In this study, we test and optimize the parameter settings through several sensitivity simulations. The choice of the value for the ice number density affects simulated optical properties and dehydration, while modifying the NAT parameters impacts stratospheric composition via HNO3 uptake and denitrification. Depending on the NAT parameters, reasonable denitrification can be modeled. However, its impact on ozone loss is minor. The best agreement with the CALIOP optical properties and observed denitrification was for this case study found with the ice number density increased from the hitherto used value of 0.01 to 0.05 cm−3 and the maximum NAT number density from 5×10−4 to 1×10−3 cm−3. The NAT radius was kept at the original value of 5 µm. The new parameterization reflects the higher importance attributed to heterogeneous nucleation of ice and NAT particles following recent new data evaluations of the state-of-the-art CALIOP measurements. A cold temperature bias in the polar lower stratosphere results in an overestimated PSC areal coverage in SOCOLv3.1 by up to 40 %. Offsetting this cold bias by +3 K delays the onset of ozone depletion by about 2 weeks, which improves the agreement with observations. Furthermore, the occurrence of mountain-wave-induced ice, as observed mainly over the Antarctic Peninsula, is continuously underestimated in the model due to the coarse model resolution (T42L39) and the fixed ice number density. Nevertheless, we find overall good temporal and spatial agreement between modeled and observed PSC occurrence and composition. This work confirms previous studies indicating that simplified PSC schemes, which avoid nucleation and growth calculations in sophisticated but time-consuming microphysical process models, may also achieve good approximations of the fundamental properties of PSCs needed in CCMs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474291","1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-14-935-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474291","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Evaluation of polar stratospheric clouds in the global chemistry–climate model SOCOLv3.1 by comparison with CALIPSO spaceborne lidar measurements","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-03-14T05:20:19Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85101466169","000619675000003","Geosci. model dev.","2","Geoscientific Model Development","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Secondary-ice production is thought to be responsible for the observed discrepancies between the ice crystal number concentration and the ice-nucleating particle concentration in clouds. The Hallett–Mossop process is active between −3 and −8 ∘C and has been implemented into several models, while all other secondary-ice processes are poorly constrained and lack a well-founded quantification. During 2 h of measurements taken on a mountain slope just above the melting layer at temperatures warmer than −3 ∘C, a continuously high concentration of small plates identified as secondary ice was observed. The presence of drizzle drops suggests droplet fragmentation upon freezing as the responsible secondary-ice mechanism. The constant supply of drizzle drops can be explained by a recirculation theory, suggesting that melted snowflakes, which sedimented through the melting layer, were reintroduced into the cloud as drizzle drops by orographically forced updrafts. Here we introduce a parametrization of droplet fragmentation at slightly sub-zero temperatures, where primary-ice nucleation is basically absent, and the first ice is initiated by the collision of drizzle drops with aged ice crystals sedimenting from higher altitudes. Based on previous measurements, we estimate that a droplet of 200 µm in diameter produces 18 secondary-ice crystals when it fragments upon freezing. The application of the parametrization to our measurements suggests that the actual number of splinters produced by a fragmenting droplet may be up to an order of magnitude higher.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000476676","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-3855-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/476676","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Continuous secondary-ice production initiated by updrafts through the melting layer in mountainous regions","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-03-28T21:53:43Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Exploiting orographic clouds for constraining the sources of ice crystals","175824","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85102784303","000630173500003","Atmos. chem. phys.","5","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we evaluate long-term changes in these species from the pre-industrial period (1850) to the end of the 21st century in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) models under a range of future emissions scenarios. There is good agreement between the CMIP multi-model mean and observations for total column ozone (TCO), although there is substantial variation between the individual CMIP6 models. For the CMIP6 multi-model mean, global mean TCO has increased from ∼ 300 DU in 1850 to ∼ 305 DU in 1960, before rapidly declining in the 1970s and 1980s following the use and emission of halogenated ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). TCO is projected to return to 1960s values by the middle of the 21st century under the SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP4-3.4, SSP4-6.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, and under the SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios TCO values are projected to be ∼ 10 DU higher than the 1960s values by 2100. However, under the SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-1.6 scenarios, TCO is not projected to return to the 1960s values despite reductions in halogenated ODSs due to decreases in tropospheric ozone mixing ratios. This global pattern is similar to regional patterns, except in the tropics where TCO under most scenarios is not projected to return to 1960s values, either through reductions in tropospheric ozone under SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, or through reductions in lower stratospheric ozone resulting from an acceleration of the Brewer–Dobson circulation under other Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). In contrast to TCO, there is poorer agreement between the CMIP6 multi-model mean and observed lower stratospheric water vapour mixing ratios, with the CMIP6 multi-model mean underestimating observed water vapour mixing ratios by ∼ 0.5 ppmv at 70 hPa. CMIP6 multi-model mean stratospheric water vapour mixing ratios in the tropical lower stratosphere have increased by ∼ 0.5 ppmv from the pre-industrial to the present-day period and are projected to increase further by the end of the 21st century. The largest increases (∼ 2 ppmv) are simulated under the future scenarios with the highest assumed forcing pathway (e.g. SSP5-8.5). Tropical lower stratospheric water vapour, and to a lesser extent TCO, shows large variations following explosive volcanic eruptions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478110","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-5015-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478110","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Evaluating stratospheric ozone and water vapour changes in CMIP6 models from 1850 to 2100","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-04-11T02:55:06Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The Overlooked Role of Stratospheric Ozone in forcing Northern Hemispheric climate (TORSO)","180043","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,"85103544867","000636626200002","Atmos. chem. phys.","6","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we investigate the influence of low-level blocking and shear-induced turbulence on the cloud microphysics and precipitation formation in a complex inner-Alpine valley. The analysis focuses on a mid-level cloud in a post-frontal environment and a low-level feeder cloud induced by an in-valley circulation. Observations were obtained from an extensive set of instruments including ground-based remote sensing instrumentation, in situ instrumentation on a tethered-balloon system and ground-based precipitation measurements.  During this event, the boundary layer was characterized by a blocked low-level flow and enhanced turbulence in the region of strong vertical wind shear at the boundary between the blocked layer in the valley and the stronger cross-barrier flow aloft. Cloud radar observations indicated changes in the microphysical cloud properties within the turbulent shear layer including enhanced linear depolarization ratio (i.e., change in particle shape or density) and increased radar reflectivity (i.e., enhanced ice growth). Based on the ice particle habits observed at the surface, we suggest that riming, aggregation and needle growth occurred within the turbulent layer. Collisions of fragile ice crystals (e.g., dendrites, needles) and the Hallett–Mossop process might have contributed to secondary ice production.  Additionally, in situ instrumentation on the tethered-balloon system observed the presence of a low-level feeder cloud above a small-scale topographic feature, which dissipated when the low-level flow turned from a blocked to an unblocked state. Our observations indicate that the low-level blocking (due to the downstream mountain barrier) created an in-valley circulation, which led to the production of local updrafts and the formation of a low-level feeder cloud. Although the feeder cloud did not enhance precipitation in this particular case (since the majority of the precipitation sublimated when falling through a subsaturated layer above), we propose that local flow effects such as low-level blocking can induce the formation of feeder clouds in mountain valleys and on the leeward slope of foothills upstream of the main mountain barrier, where they can act to enhance orographic precipitation through the seeder–feeder mechanism.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478129","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-5151-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478129","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Influence of low-level blocking and turbulence on the microphysics of a mixed-phase cloud in an inner-Alpine valley","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-04-11T02:57:22Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Exploiting orographic clouds for constraining the sources of ice crystals","175824","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85103592963","000636656300003","Atmos. chem. phys.","6","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Several potentially fruitful aspects of observation synergy were considered.  First, a set of passive and active ground-based observations collected during both day- and nighttime was inverted simultaneously under the assumption of temporal continuity of aerosol properties. Such an approach explores the complementarity of the information in different observations and results in a robust and consistent processing of all observations. For example, the interpretation of the nighttime active observations usually suffers from the lack of information about aerosol particles sizes, shapes and complex refractive index. In the realized synergy retrievals, the information propagating from the nearby Sun-photometric observations provides sufficient constraints for reliable interpretation of both day- and nighttime lidar observations.  Second, the synergetic processing of such complementary observations with enhanced information content allows for optimizing the aerosol model used in the retrieval. Specifically, the external mixture of several aerosol components with predetermined sizes, shapes and composition has been identified as an efficient approach for achieving reliable retrieval of aerosol properties in several situations. This approach allows for achieving consistent and accurate aerosol retrievals from processing stand-alone advanced lidar observations with reduced information content about aerosol columnar properties.  Third, the potential of synergy processing of the ground-based Sun-photometric and lidar observations, with the in situ backscatter sonde measurements was explored using the data from KAUST.15 and KAUST.16 field campaigns held at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in the August of 2015 and 2016. The inclusion of radiosonde data has been demonstrated to provide significant additional constraints to validate and improve the accuracy and scope of aerosol profiling.  The results of all retrieval setups used for processing both synergy and stand-alone observation data sets are discussed and intercompared.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478130","1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-14-2575-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478130","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Synergy processing of diverse ground-based remote sensing and in situ data using the GRASP algorithm: applications to radiometer, lidar and radiosonde observations","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-04-11T02:57:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103604753","000637563100002","Atmos. meas. tech.","3","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As the ice phase influences many key cloud properties and their lifetime, its formation needs to be better understood in order to improve climate and weather prediction models. Ice crystals sedimenting out of a cloud do not sublimate immediately but can survive certain distances and eventually fall into a cloud below. This natural cloud seeding can trigger glaciation and has been shown to enhance precipitation formation. However, to date, an estimate of its occurrence frequency is lacking. In this study, we estimate the occurrence frequency of natural cloud seeding over Switzerland from satellite data and sublimation calculations.  We use the DARDAR (radar lidar) satellite product between April 2006 and October 2017 to estimate the occurrence frequency of multi-layer cloud situations, where a cirrus cloud at T < −35 ∘C can provide seeds to a lower-lying feeder cloud. These situations are found to occur in 31 % of the observations. Of these, 42 % have a cirrus cloud above another cloud, separated, while in 58 % the cirrus is part of a thicker cloud, with a potential for in-cloud seeding. Vertical distances between the cirrus and the lower-lying cloud are distributed uniformly between 100 m and 10 km. They are found to not vary with topography. Seasonally, winter nights have the most multi-layer cloud occurrences, in 38 % of the measurements. Additionally, in situ and liquid origin cirrus cloud size modes can be identified according to the ice crystal mean effective radius in the DARDAR data. Using sublimation calculations, we show that in a significant number of cases the seeding ice crystals do not sublimate before reaching the lower-lying feeder cloud. Depending on whether bullet rosette, plate-like or spherical crystals were assumed, 10 %, 11 % or 20 % of the crystals, respectively, could provide seeds after sedimenting 2 km.  The high occurrence frequency of seeding situations and the survival of the ice crystals indicate that the seeder–feeder process and natural cloud seeding are widespread phenomena over Switzerland. This hints at a large potential for natural cloud seeding to influence cloud properties and thereby the Earth's radiative budget and water cycle, which should be studied globally. Further investigations of the magnitude of the seeding ice crystals' effect on lower-lying clouds are necessary to estimate the contribution of natural cloud seeding to precipitation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478123","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-5195-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478123","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"How frequent is natural cloud seeding from ice cloud layers ( < −35 °C) over Switzerland?","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-04-11T02:56:50Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103591625","000636656300005","Atmos. chem. phys.","6","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Tambora eruption (VolMIP-Tambora ISA ensemble). The pre-study provided the ancillary ability to assess intermodel diversity in the radiative forcing for a large stratospheric-injecting equatorial eruption when the volcanic aerosol cloud is simulated interactively. An initial analysis of the VolMIP-Tambora ISA ensemble showed large disparities between models in the stratospheric global mean aerosol optical depth (AOD). In this study, we now show that stratospheric global mean AOD differences among the participating models are primarily due to differences in aerosol size, which we track here by effective radius. We identify specific physical and chemical processes that are missing in some models and/or parameterized differently between models, which are together causing the differences in effective radius. In particular, our analysis indicates that interactively tracking hydroxyl radical (OH) chemistry following a large volcanic injection of sulfur dioxide (SO2) is an important factor in allowing for the timescale for sulfate formation to be properly simulated. In addition, depending on the timescale of sulfate formation, there can be a large difference in effective radius and subsequently AOD that results from whether the SO2 is injected in a single model grid cell near the location of the volcanic eruption, or whether it is injected as a longitudinally averaged band around the Earth.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474714","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-3317-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474714","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Model physics and chemistry causing intermodel disagreement within the VolMIP-Tambora Interactive Stratospheric Aerosol ensemble","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-03-16T03:54:57Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"SPARC International Project office","138017","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Forschungsinfrastrukturen",,,"85102185889","000626343100004","Atmos. chem. phys.","5","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study presents a case study that involves aircraft, lidar and radar observations in a WCB ascending from western Europe towards the Baltic Sea during the Hydrological Cycle in the Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX) and T-NAWDEX-Falcon in October 2012, a preparatory campaign for the THORPEX North Atlantic Waveguide and Downstream Impact Experiment (T-NAWDEX).  Trajectories were used to link different observations along the WCB, that is, to establish so-called Lagrangian matches between observations. To this aim, an ensemble of wind fields from the global analyses produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Ensemble of Data Assimilations (EDA) system were used, which allowed for a probabilistic quantification of the WCB occurrence and the Lagrangian matches. Despite severe air traffic limitations for performing research flights over Europe, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Falcon successfully sampled WCB air masses during different phases of the WCB ascent. The WCB trajectories revealed measurements in two distinct WCB branches: one branch ascended from the eastern North Atlantic over southwestern France, while the other had its inflow in the western Mediterranean. Both branches passed across the Alps, and for both branches Lagrangian matches coincidentally occurred between lidar water vapour measurements in the inflow of the WCB south of the Alps, radar measurements during the ascent at the Alps and in situ aircraft measurements by Falcon in the WCB outflow north of the Alps. An airborne release experiment with an inert tracer could confirm the long pathway of the WCB from the inflow in the Mediterranean boundary layer to the outflow in the upper troposphere near the Baltic Sea several hours later.  The comparison of observations and ensemble analyses reveals a moist bias in the analyses in parts of the WCB inflow but a good agreement of cloud water species in the WCB during ascent. In between these two observations, a precipitation radar measured strongly precipitating WCB air located directly above the melting layer while ascending at the southern slopes of the Alps. The trajectories illustrate the complexity of a continental and orographically influenced WCB, which leads to (i) WCB moisture sources from both the Atlantic and Mediterranean, (ii) different pathways of WCB ascent affected by orography, and (iii) locally steep WCB ascent with high radar reflectivity values that might result in enhanced precipitation where the WCB flows over the Alps. The linkage of observational data by ensemble-based WCB trajectory calculations, the confirmation of the WCB transport by an inert tracer and the model evaluation using the multi-platform observations are the central elements of this study and reveal important aspects of orographically modified WCBs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000479170","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-5477-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/479170","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Lagrangian matches between observations from aircraft, lidar and radar in a warm conveyor belt crossing orography","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-04-18T02:58:54Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85103939142","000638999600005","Atmos. chem. phys.","7","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Laboratory studies report ice-active particle number fractions (AFs) that are cumulative in s. Cloud models budget INP and ice crystal numbers to conserve total particle number during water phase transitions. Here, we show that ice formation from INPs with time-independent nucleation behavior is overpredicted when models budget particle numbers and at the same time derive ice crystal numbers from s-cumulative AFs. This causes a bias towards heterogeneous ice formation in situations where INPs compete with homogeneous droplet freezing during cloud formation. We resolve this issue by introducing differential AFs, thereby moving us one step closer to more robust simulations of aerosol-cloud interactions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000511388","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-15213-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/511388","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Aerosol–cloud interactions: the representation of heterogeneous ice activation in cloud models","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-10-25T02:51:11Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85117155426","000708949200001","Atmos. chem. phys.","19","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The new model was built by interactively coupling the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model version 1.2 (MPI-ESM1.2) (T63, L47) with the chemistry (99 species) and size-resolving (40 bins) sulfate aerosol microphysics modules from the aerosol-chemistry-climate model, SOCOL-AERv2. We evaluate its performance against reanalysis products and observations of atmospheric circulation, temperature, and trace gas distribution, with a focus on stratospheric processes. We show that SOCOLv4.0 captures the low- and midlatitude stratospheric ozone well in terms of the climatological state, variability and evolution. The model provides an accurate representation of climate change, showing a global surface warming trend consistent with observations as well as realistic cooling in the stratosphere caused by greenhouse gas emissions, although, as in previous model versions, a too-fast residual circulation and exaggerated mixing in the surf zone are still present. The stratospheric sulfur budget for moderate volcanic activity is well represented by the model, albeit with slightly underestimated aerosol lifetime after major eruptions. The presence of the interactive ocean and a successful representation of recent climate and ozone layer trends make SOCOLv4.0 ideal for studies devoted to future ozone evolution and effects of greenhouse gases and ozone-destroying substances, as well as the evaluation of potential solar geoengineering measures through sulfur injections. Potential further model improvements could be to increase the vertical resolution, which is expected to allow better meridional transport in the stratosphere, as well as to update the photolysis calculation module and budget of mesospheric odd nitrogen. In summary, this paper demonstrates that SOCOLv4.0 is well suited for applications related to the stratospheric ozone and sulfate aerosol evolution, including its participation in ongoing and future model intercomparison projects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505821","1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-14-5525-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505821","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Atmosphere–ocean–aerosol–chemistry–climate model SOCOLv4.0: description and evaluation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-09-17T04:35:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The Overlooked Role of Stratospheric Ozone in forcing Northern Hemispheric climate (TORSO)","180043","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,"85114703378","000695493300001","Geosci. model dev.","9","Geoscientific Model Development","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The main purpose was to contribute to the characterization and understanding of the dimming and brightening effects on solar global radiation in this part of South America. As observed in most of the previous studies worldwide, in this study, during the period between 1961 and the early 1980s, a negative trend in surface solar irradiation was detected in São Paulo, characterizing the occurrence of a dimming effect. Sunshine duration and the diurnal temperature range also presented negative trends, in opposition to the positive trend observed in the cloud cover fraction. However, a brightening effect, as observed in western industrialized countries in more recent years, was not observed. Instead, for surface downward irradiation, the negative trend persisted, with a trend of −0.13 MJ m−2 per decade, with a p value of 0.006, for the 56 years of data and in consonance with the cloud cover fraction increasing trend, but not statistically significant, of 0.3 % per decade (p value = 0.198). The trends for sunshine duration and the diurnal temperature range, by contrast, changed signal, as confirmed by a piecewise linear regression model. Some possible causes for the discrepancy are discussed, such as the frequency of fog occurrence, urban heat island effects, horizontal visibility (as a proxy for aerosol loading variability) and greenhouse gas concentration increase. Future studies on the aerosol effect are planned, particularly with higher temporal resolution, as well as modelling studies, to better analyse the contribution of each possible cause.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484727","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-6593-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484727","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Fifty-six years of surface solar radiation and sunshine duration over São Paulo, Brazil: 1961–2016","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-05-19T02:22:34Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: causes of decadal changes of solar radiation","188601","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85105365794","000647352500001","Atmos. chem. phys.","9","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the microphysical processes active in the seeder and feeder region are still being understood. In this paper, we investigate the seeder and feeder region of a mixed-phase cloud passing over the Swiss Alps, focusing on (1) fallstreaks of enhanced radar reflectivity originating from cloud top generating cells (seeder region) and (2) a persistent low-level feeder cloud produced by the boundary layer circulation (feeder region). Observations were obtained from a multi-dimensional set of instruments including ground-based remote sensing instrumentation (Ka-band polarimetric cloud radar, microwave radiometer, wind profiler), in situ instrumentation on a tethered balloon system, and ground-based aerosol and precipitation measurements.  The cloud radar observations suggest that ice formation and growth were enhanced within cloud top generating cells, which is consistent with previous observational studies. However, uncertainties exist regarding the dominant ice formation mechanism within these cells. Here we propose different mechanisms that potentially enhance ice nucleation and growth in cloud top generating cells (convective overshooting, radiative cooling, droplet shattering) and attempt to estimate their potential contribution from an ice nucleating particle perspective. Once ice formation and growth within the seeder region exceeded a threshold value, the mixed-phase cloud became fully glaciated.  Local flow effects on the lee side of the mountain barrier induced the formation of a persistent low-level feeder cloud over a small-scale topographic feature in the inner-Alpine valley. In situ measurements within the low-level feeder cloud observed the production of secondary ice particles likely due to the Hallett–Mossop process and ice particle fragmentation upon ice–ice collisions. Therefore, secondary ice production may have been partly responsible for the elevated ice crystal number concentrations that have been previously observed in feeder clouds at mountaintop observatories. Secondary ice production in feeder clouds can potentially enhance orographic precipitation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484726","1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-21-6681-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484726","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Microphysical investigation of the seeder and feeder region of an Alpine mixed-phase cloud","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-05-19T02:22:34Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Exploiting orographic clouds for constraining the sources of ice crystals","175824","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"85105466246","000648440400002","Atmos. chem. phys.","9","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","21","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The scheme is based on a reconstruction of the temperature inversion as a physical constraint for the cloud top. On the refined grid, the boundary layer and the free troposphere are separated and the cloud's layer is made thinner. The cloud cover is recalculated either by conserving the cloud volume (SC-VOLUME) or by using the Sundqvist cloud cover routine on the new grid representation (SC-SUND). In global climate simulations, we find that the SC-VOLUME approach is inadequate, as there is a mismatch, in most cases, between the layer of the inversion and the layer of the stratocumulus cloud, which prevents its application and is itself likely caused by an overly low vertical resolution. Additionally, we find that the occurrence frequency of stratocumulus clouds is underestimated in ECHAM-HAM, limiting a priori the potential benefits of a scheme like SC-VOLUME targeting only cloud amount when present. With the SC-SUND approach, the possibility for new clouds to be formed on the refined grid results in a large increase in mean total cloud cover in stratocumulus regions. In both cases, however, the changes exerted in the radiation routine are too weak to produce a significant improvement in the simulated stratocumulus cloud cover. We investigate and discuss the reasons behind this. The grid refinement scheme could be used more effectively for this purpose if implemented directly in the model's cloud microphysics and cloud cover routines, but other possible ways forward are also discussed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505309","1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-14-5413-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505309","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Vertical grid refinement for stratocumulus clouds in the radiation scheme of the global climate model ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3-P3","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-09-13T04:21:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85114399811","000692945300002","Geosci. model dev.","9","Geoscientific Model Development","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous studies quantified the dynamical relevance of selected diabatic processes by studying their influence on potential vorticity (PV) in individual cyclones. However, a more general assessment of the relevance of all PV-modifying processes in a larger ensemble of cyclones is currently missing. Based on a series of twelve 35 d model simulations using the Integrated Forecasting System of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, this study systematically quantifies the diabatic modification of positive and negative low-level PV anomalies along the cold front, warm front, and in the center of 288 rapidly intensifying extratropical cyclones. Diabatic PV modification is assessed by accumulating PV tendencies associated with each parametrized process along 15 h backward trajectories.  The primary processes that modify PV typically remain temporally consistent during cyclone intensification. However, a pronounced case-to-case variability is found when comparing the most important processes across individual cyclones. Along the cold front, PV is primarily generated by condensation in half of the investigated cyclones in the cold season (October to March). For most of the remaining cyclones, convection or long-wave radiative cooling is the most important process. Similar results are found in the warm season (April to September); however, the fraction of cyclones with PV generation by convection as the most important process is reduced. Negative PV west of the cold front is primarily produced by turbulent mixing of momentum, long-wave radiative heating, or turbulent mixing of temperature. The positive PV anomaly at the warm front is most often primarily generated by condensation in the cold season and by turbulent mixing of momentum in the warm season. Convection is the most important process only in a few cyclones. Negative PV along the warm front is primarily produced by long-wave radiative heating, turbulent mixing of temperature, or melting of snow in the cold season. Turbulent mixing of temperature becomes the primary process in the warm season, followed by melting of snow and turbulent mixing of momentum. The positive PV anomaly in the cyclone center is primarily produced by condensation in most cyclones, with only few cases primarily associated with turbulent mixing or convection.  A composite analysis further reveals that cyclones primarily associated with PV generation by convection exhibit a negative air–surface temperature difference in the warm sector, which promotes a heat flux directed into the atmosphere. These cyclones generally occur over warm ocean currents in the cold season. On the other hand, cyclones that occur in a significantly colder environment are often associated with a positive air–surface temperature difference in the warm sector, leading to PV generation by long-wave radiative cooling. Finally, long-wave radiative heating due to a negative air–surface temperature difference in the cold sector produces negative PV along the cold and warm front, in particular in the cold season.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000523853","2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-2-1073-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/523853","en","Copernicus GmbH","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Systematic assessment of the diabatic processes that modify low-level potential vorticity in extratropical cyclones","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2022-01-07T10:24:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Diabatic processes in North Atlantic weather systems: synoptic and mesoscale dynamics||An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","165941||787652","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC","H2020||Projekte MINT",,,,,"Weather Clim.

We perform three 20-year ensemble experiments to assess the validity of the modeled iodine and to quantify the effects of iodine on ozone. The iodine distributions obtained with SOCOL-AERv2-I agree well with AMAX-DOAS observations and with CAM-chem model simulations. For the present-day atmosphere, the model suggests that the iodine-induced chemistry leads to a 3 %–4 % reduction in the ozone column, which is greatest at high latitudes. The model indicates the strongest influence of iodine in the lower stratosphere with 30 ppbv less ozone at low latitudes and up to 100 ppbv less at high latitudes. In the troposphere, the account of the iodine chemistry reduces the tropospheric ozone concentration by 5 %–10 % depending on geographical location. In the lower troposphere, 75 % of the modeled ozone reduction originates from inorganic sources of iodine, 25 % from organic sources of iodine. At 50 hPa, the results show that the impacts of iodine from both sources are comparable. Finally, we determine the sensitivity of ozone to iodine by applying a 2-fold increase in iodine emissions, as it might be representative for iodine by the end of this century. This reduces the ozone column globally by an additional 1.5 %–2.5 %. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of atmospheric ozone to iodine chemistry for present and future conditions, but uncertainties remain high due to the paucity of observational data of iodine species.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000515490","1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-14-6623-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/515490","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Iodine chemistry in the chemistry-climate model SOCOL-AERv2-I","Journal Article","Open access",,,,,"2021-11-17T03:59:54Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85118715184",,"Geosci. model dev.","10","Geoscientific Model Development","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Moreover, the partitioning of available energy at the surface into turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes is highly sensitive to water availability, thus modulating the energy cycle. As our understanding of hydrological processes may not be formulated as a closed set of equations based on first principles, these processes have to be parameterized, involving the use of ad-hoc assumptions and poorly constrained free parameters in order to achieve acceptable model performance. Errors introduced by poor parameter choices or misrepresented processes often interact and compensate each other, both within the land-surface model as well as in the interaction with other parts of the NWP or climate model. It is therefore not sufficient to measure the quality of a land-surface model in the predictive capability of the coupled land-atmosphere model for standard meteorological variables, rather if one wants to truly advance a quantitative understanding of land-atmosphere interaction, model validation and development should be process-oriented. Kilometer-scale models pose substantial challenges and opportunities to state-of-the-art land surface models as individual watersheds are resolved both in terms of land surface properties as well as in terms of a more realistic, spatially distributed precipitation forcing. Thus, the more widespread use of kilometer-scale simulations in both NWP and climate modelling necessitates a careful reassessment of parameterizations within the land-surface model. In the first part of this thesis, we develop a validation framework based on catchment mass balances and apply the framework to four different versions of the TERRA ML land surface model on the kilometer-scale. Despite large observational uncertainties, the validation framework reveals a tight link between errors in catchment integrated runoff and errors in terrestrial water storage changes. The high sensitivity of runoff errors to different formulations of the infiltration process implies that the mathematical formulation of infiltration deserves more attention. As is the case for many land surface models, the governing equation for soil water propagation in TERRA ML is the one-dimensional Richards equation. A simple numerical convergence experiment in the second part of this thesis demonstrates a systematic and drastic decrease of infiltration capacity with increasing time step and decreasing vertical resolution. Grid setups of state-of-the art land surface models are found to be too coarse to achieve reasonable numerical convergence. The same is true for time steps longer than forty seconds, which is probably shorter than time steps chosen for many global models and for standalone applications of land-surface models. A second experiment with rainfall time series obtained from convection resolving and convection parameterized models puts the poor convergence found for typical model setups into context and shows the consequences for infiltration-runoff partitioning. The convergence problem aggravates for high-intensity precipitation events, which are more often found in highresolution convection-resolving numerical weather prediction and climate models. The observed difficulties in soil water modelling lead to the question as to what extent future projections of evapotranspiration are in accordance with fundamental mass and energy constraints as formulated in the Budyko hypothesis. The third part of this thesis thus makes use of the Budyko hypothesis as a physical consistency check for climate projections and shows that it is a helpful framework to disentangle model deficiencies in energy partitioning from model deficiencies in water partitioning. While the shift of hydrological states associated with climate change is mostly occurring aligned with the Budyko curve, high latitude river basins exhibit future evapotranspiration climatologies exceeding its energy limit. This may be explained by a net downward sensible heat flux on annual means which is contributing considerably to the surface energy balance. On the one hand, the sensible heat flux may be exaggerated in the climate projection and on the other hand, the energy limit of the Budyko hypothesis completely misses this contribution to the surface energy balance. In summary, this thesis highlights the importance of mathematical, numerical and physical accuracy for model performance on diurnal to inter-annual time scales and the added value of process-oriented validation strategies to pinpoint areas, where future development efforts should be focused.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000541630",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/541630","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Land surface modelling||Numerical weather prediction||Climate model","Water Transport in Land Surface Models: From the Richards Equation to Catchment Water Balances","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,,"2022-04-08T06:02:59Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27860",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The associated Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULCC) affects the local, regional, and global climate. The climate impact of LULCC comprises the release or sequestration of greenhouse gases, the biogeochemical effects, and the alteration of the local energy and water redistribution at the land surface, the biogeophysical effects. Observations and models often disagree on the size and even the sign of biogeophysical effects from LULCC, even though they indicate that those effects are relevant for the local and regional climate. Most scenarios that confine global warming levels to below 2 °C incorporate substantial alterations of human land use, often to sequester greenhouse gases. It is therefore crucial to obtain a thorough understanding of the biogeophysical effects of LULCC and reconcile them in models with observations. Clearing of natural forests for agricultural food production has been a widespread LULCC in the past. This trend is now reverted in some of the developed countries. In addition, re- or afforestation is frequently proposed as a tool to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This thesis therefore investigates the biogeophysical effects of re- or afforesting grassland and cropland, which is subsequently called forestation. To this aim, I employ both climate model simulations and analysis of observational data. In particular, I evaluate and undertake targeted improvements to reconcile the local biogeophysical effect of forestation in the Community Land Model (CLM) with observations. Further, I investigate whether forestation might affect precipitation in Europe employing observational data sets. In Chapter 2, I confront the local biogeophysical sensitivity of CLM to forestation with various observational constraints. It appears that CLM agrees reasonably with observations regarding the sensitivity of albedo, daily mean Land Surface Temperature (LST), and daily maximum LST. Nonetheless, the albedo decrease following forestation is more pronounced in CLM compared to remote sensing observations. The daily maximum LST is distinctly lower in forests than over grassland/cropland both in observations and in CLM with the exception of winters at higher latitudes. However, CLM exhibits a slight positive bias in the daily maximum LST difference of forest minus grassland/cropland. The latter bias appears to be linked to a pronounced underestimation of the increase in EvapoTranspiration (ET) following forestation compared to various observational constraints, which do however exhibit a substantial spread themselves. Subsequently, I propose various modifications of the model to improve its ET sensitivity to forestation, which also reduce the positive bias in the effect of forestation on daily maximum LST. The simulated daily minimum LST difference between forest and grassland/cropland by and large resembles the sensitivity of daily maximum LST, although somewhat weaker, while remote sensing observations indicate that the daily minimum LST of forests is often higher than the one of grassland/cropland. Overall, this study indicates that CLM can represent some aspects of the local biogeophysical sensitivity to forestation well, while further model development is required for other aspects to reconcile CLM with observations. In the next chapter, I investigate whether the lack of Biomass Heat Storage (BHS) in CLM is responsible for the identified biases in the sensitivity of daily maximum and minimum LST to forestation. The cooling of daily maximum temperatures is marginal, as most of the energy uptake by the vegetation biomass is compensated by a reduction of the turbulent heat fluxes. On the other hand, this process results in a pronounced warming of nighttime temperatures in forests, because the stable structure of the surface layer at night inhibits the compensation of the energy release from the vegetation by the sensible heat flux. The resultant nighttime warming frequently exceeds 2 °C in forests, while BHS appears negligible for grassland and cropland, due their comparably small amount of biomass. Given this diurnal asymmetry, BHS warms daily mean temperatures in forested regions. CLM overestimates the diurnal temperature range in forests compared to remote sensing observations, which is improved substantially after including BHS in the model. Finally, I show that the inclusion of BHS alleviates the apparent deficiency of CLM related to the impact of forestation on the daily minimum LST, which emerged in Chapter 2. In summary, BHS strongly modulates nighttime temperatures in forests and is also relevant for the daily mean temperature, while its impact on daytime temperatures is only marginal. In Chapter 4, I estimate alterations of precipitation from foresting agricultural land in Europe, a biogeophysical effect that has been largely disregarded in observational studies previously. This is done in two (almost independent) approaches: Firstly, I identify suitable site pairs in two rain gauge data collections that differ by at least 20 % in the agricultural land and forest fractions. Secondly, I model the climatology of a state-of-the-art spatially-continuous precipitation data set with Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to link precipitation to land cover. In both approaches, forestation is estimated to increase precipitation locally, in particular during the winter months. The structure of the GAMs further allows to estimate precipitation changes downwind of the forestation locations. During winter, downwind precipitation increases in the southern and western parts of Europe, while the signal is near-neutral to negative in central and northern Europe. During summer, I find a downwind increase in precipitation due to forestation. The combined local and downwind effect from a realistic reforestation scenario are estimated to compensate a substantial fraction of the reduction in summertime precipitation, which is expected under RCP4.5 by the end of this century in an ensemble of regional climate models. While this study implies that forestation results in relevant alterations of precipitation in Europe, I would also like to highlight that this study is novel to the field and therefore more uncertain than the previous ones. Forestation results in biogeophysical effects that are relevant for both the local and regional climate. Such effects should be considered before utilizing forestation as a tool to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, many aspects regarding the biogeophysical effects of LULCC in observations and models are still uncertain or unknown. In this thesis, I demonstrate that BHS is relevant for the local climate in forests and should consequently be included in the next generation of earth system models that are used to assess the climate impact of LULCC. Further, I provide observational evidence of changes in precipitation following forestation in Europe. LULCC induces therefore not only temperature alterations, but also relevant modifications of the hydrological cycle, which need to be considered when assessing the climatic consequences of LULCC.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484696",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484696","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biogeophysical effects of forestation||Land cover change||Land surface modeling||Biomass heat storage||Hydrology","On the Biogeophysical Consequences of Forestation","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,,"2021-05-18T14:13:34Z","2022-05-19",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"CLimate IMPacts of Utilizing Land in Switzerland and Europe (CLIMPULSE)","172715||172715","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT","27467",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The simulation was performed with explicit convection at a horizontal grid spacing of 0.125° (in rotated coordinates, corresponding to approximately 14 km) and with 60 hybrid levels in the vertical. Initial and lateral boundary conditions were provided every 6 hours by the isotope-enabled global climate model ECHAM5-wiso. The 1-hourly outputs of the COSMOiso simulation contain a variety of environmental parameters, including the isotopic composition of water vapour, rain water, cloud water, ice water and snow water, which allows for a detailed description of the subtropical atmospheric water cycle.","application/pdf||application/netcdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000506055",,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/506055","en","ETH Zurich, Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","numerical weather prediction||numerical weather prediction models||COSMOiso||stable water isotopes||atmospheric water cycle","Numerical weather simulation using COSMOiso over the eastern subtropical North Atlantic in July and August 2013","Dataset","Open access",,,,,"2021-09-20T07:32:32Z",,"indefinite","292278994-08-17T07:12:55Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,"MOisture Transport pathways and Isotopologues in water Vapour (MOTIV)","164721","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recent research has emphasized the critical role of moisture availability in regulating crop responses to heat and the importance of temperature–moisture couplings in driving concurrent heat and drought. Here, we demonstrate that the heat sensitivity of key global crops depends on the local strength of couplings between temperature and moisture in the climate system. Over 1970–2013, maize and soy yields dropped more during hotter growing seasons in places where decreased precipitation and evapotranspiration more strongly accompanied higher temperatures, suggestive of compound heat–drought impacts on crops. On the basis of this historical pattern and a suite of climate model projections, we show that changes in temperature–moisture couplings in response to warming could enhance the heat sensitivity of these crops as temperatures rise, worsening the impact of warming by −5% (−17 to 11% across climate models) on global average. However, these changes will benefit crops where couplings weaken, including much of Asia, and projected impacts are highly uncertain in some regions. Our results demonstrate that climate change will impact crops not only through warming but also through changing drivers of compound heat–moisture stresses, which may alter the sensitivity of crop yields to heat as warming proceeds. Robust adaptation of cropping systems will need to consider this underappreciated risk to food production from climate change.",,,"2662-1355",,"10.1038/s43016-021-00341-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/507699","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Stronger temperature–moisture couplings exacerbate the impact of climate warming on global crop yields","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,,"2021-09-30T02:40:38Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85115372868","000698443300016","Nat Food","9","Nature Food","2","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
