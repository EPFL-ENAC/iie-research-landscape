Bioturbation displaces microplastics (>1 μm) in soils and likely also nanoplastics (<1 μm), but empirical evidence is lacking. We used a combination of methods that allowed us to not only quantify but to also understand the mechanisms of biologically driven transport of nanoplastics in microcosms with the deep-burrowing earthworm Lumbricus terrestris. We hypothesized that ingestion and subsurface excretion drives deep vertical transport of nanoplastics that subsequently accumulate in the drilosphere, i.e., burrow walls. Significant vertical transport of palladium-doped polystyrene nanoplastics (diameter 256 nm), traceable using elemental analysis, was observed and increased over 4 weeks. Nanoplastics were detected in depurated earthworms confirming their uptake without any detectable negative impact. Nanoplastics were indeed enriched in the drilosphere where cast material was visibly incorporated, and the reuse of initial burrows could be monitored via X-ray computed tomography. Moreover, the speed of nanoplastics transport to the deeper soil profile could not be explained with a local mixing model. Earthworms thus repeatedly ingested and excreted nanoplastics in the drilosphere calling for a more explicit inclusion of bioturbation in nanoplastic fate modeling under consideration of the dominant mechanism. Further investigation is required to quantify nanoplastic re-entrainment, such as during events of preferential flow in burrows.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000521859",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.1c05614","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/521859","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Microplastic||transport||fate||exposure||X-ray computed tomography||earthworms","Nanoplastic Transport in Soil via Bioturbation by Lumbricus terrestris","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-22T03:50:12Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems||Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)","168105||186856","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Ambizione||Eccellenza",,"85121035511",,"000759471400016","Environ.

In contexts where environmental oversight agencies often lack financial and personal capacities to fulfill their role, community-based monitoring might be a valid alternative to monitor potential environmental impacts. In this study, we present the setup and the implementation of a citizen science project to monitor water quality parameters in a river downstream of a coal mining area in Hwange, Western Zimbabwe. In a joint effort over 1.5 years, community monitors and scientists took close to 800 water samples in the Deka River and effluent channels. The data allowed identifying sources of pollution and relating these to past and present mining activities. The primary source of acid mine drainage came from abandoned underground mine sites. Illegal mine water dumping from active mine sites accentuated the problem and resulted in fish kills and food risks for the local population. Concentrations of manganese, nickel and arsenic were exceeding national fresh water guidelines and international drinking water standards. Manganese concentrations exceeded guidelines by a factor of 70 resulting in a public health risk. In this study, we showed that community-based monitoring offers a promising approach to establish a high-quality dataset for assessing mining-related risks if the implementation of sampling protocols is followed tightly. The monitoring scheme significantly improves the collection and interpretation of water quality data in challenging contexts where governmental institutions and industrial players are not enforcing environmental standards.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000521436",,"2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2021.754540","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/521436","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Coal mining||Citizen science (CS)||Mental pollution||Acid mine drainage (AMD)||Mineral resources||Environmental governance||Water quality||Community-based monitoring","Community-Based Monitoring Detects Sources and Risks of Mining-Related Water Pollution in Zimbabwe","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-20T06:55:26Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85122021249",,"000745263400001","Front.

With ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation projected to increase for decades, extreme events, such as marine heatwaves, will intensify, occur more often, persist for longer periods of time and extend over larger regions. Nevertheless, our understanding of oceanic extreme events that are associated with warming, low oxygen concentrations or high acidity, as well as their impacts on marine ecosystems, remains limited. Compound events— that is, multiple extreme events that occur simultaneously or in close sequence—are of particular concern, as their individual effects may interact synergistically. Here we assess patterns and trends in open ocean extremes based on the existing literature as well as global and regional model simulations. Furthermore, we discuss the potential impacts of individual and compound extremes on marine organisms and ecosystems. We propose a pathway to improve the understanding of extreme events and the capacity of marine life to respond to them. The conditions exhibited by present extreme events may be a harbinger of what may become normal in the future. As a consequence, pursuing this research effort may also help us to better understand the responses of marine organisms and ecosystems to future climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000521508",,"0028-0836||1476-4687",,"10.1038/s41586-021-03981-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/521508","en","Springer","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Biogeochemical extremes and compound events in the ocean","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-20T13:05:29Z","2022-06-14",,,,,"yes",,,,,"X-EBUS: Extreme Ocean Weather Events and their Role for Ocean Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems||Our common future ocean – quantifying coupled cycles of carbon, oxygen, and nutrients for determining and achieving safe operating spaces with respect to tipping points","175787||820989||175787||820989","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC||SNF||EC","H2020||Projekte MINT||H2020",,"85121392345",,"000730754700020",,"7889","Nature","600","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Many of these phytotoxins have similar mobility, persistence, and toxicity properties in the environment as anthropogenic micropollutants, which increasingly contaminate surface waters. Although recent case studies have shown the aquatic relevance of phytotoxins, the overall exposure remains unknown. Therefore, we performed a detailed occurrence analysis covering 134 phytotoxins from 27 PSM classes. Water samples from seven small Swiss streams with catchment areas from 1.7 to 23 km2 and varying land uses were gathered over several months to investigate seasonal impacts. They were complemented with samples from different biogeographical regions to cover variations in vegetation. A broad SPE-LC-HRMS/MS method was applied with limits of detection below 5 ng/L for over 80% of the 134 included phytotoxins. In total, we confirmed 39 phytotoxins belonging to 13 PSM classes, which corresponds to almost 30% of all included phytotoxins. Several alkaloids were regularly detected in the low ng/L-range, with average detection frequencies of 21%. This is consistent with the previously estimated persistence and mobility properties that indicated a high contamination potential. Coumarins were previously predicted to be unstable, however, detection frequencies were around 89%, and maximal concentrations up to 90 ng/L were measured for fraxetin produced by various trees. Overall, rainy weather conditions at full vegetation led to the highest total phytotoxin concentrations, which might potentially be most critical for aquatic organisms.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000499574",,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149128","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499574","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Phytotoxins||poisonous plants||Surface water contamination||High resolution mass spectrometry screening||Persistence||mobility||Mobility||toxicity characterization","Aquatic occurrence of phytotoxins in small streams triggered by biogeography, vegetation growth stage, and precipitation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-05T03:16:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85111228234",,"000701750700002","Sci.

These two functions were separately demonstrated to play a role in biogeochemical iron cycling and methane formation. Yet, little is known about the coupled effect of both electron transfer mechanisms, even though naturally occurring electron transfer through biochar is expected to simultaneously rely on both geobattery and geoconductor mechanisms. Here, we incubated an anoxic paddy soil enrichment culture with acetate as the substrate to investigate how biochar's coupled electron transfer mechanisms influence the electron transfer pathways between microbes and Fe(III) minerals and how it impacts the soil microbial community composition. We found that biochar simultaneously stimulated microbial Fe(III) reduction and methanogenesis by 2.6 and 2.3 fold, but these processes were spatially decoupled. Small biochar particles (5–20 μm) caused higher Fe(III) reduction and methanogenesis rates than large particles (50–100 μm). The addition of biochar enriched a syntrophic acetate-oxidizing co-culture with dominating Fe(III)-reducing Geobacteraceae taxa and acetoclastic methanogenic Methanosarcina taxa. After acetoclastic methanogenesis stopped, the observed continuing methanogenesis was likely due to interspecies electron transfer caused by biochar functioning as a geoconductor transferring electrons from Geobacteraceae to Methanosarcina. In summary, the simultaneous occurrence of Fe(III) reduction and methanogenesis leads to the formation of a cell-biochar-mineral battery network and a cell-biochar-cell conductive network in an enrichment culture from a paddy soil.",,,,"0038-0717||1879-3428",,"10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108446","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510229","en","Elsevier",,,"Biochar||Dissimilatory iron reduction||Methanogenesis||Electron transfer pathways||Conductive-particle interspecies electron transfer","A coupled function of biochar as geobattery and geoconductor leads to stimulation of microbial Fe(III) reduction and methanogenesis in a paddy soil enrichment culture","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-10-18T04:01:26Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85116549667",,"000707329900003","Soil biol. biochem.",,"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","163","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Based on initial data from the UK and later data from other countries, this variant was estimated to have a transmission fitness advantage of around 40–80 % (Volz et al., 2021; Leung et al., 2021; Davies et al., 2021). Aim: This study aims to estimate the transmission fitness advantage and the effective reproductive number of B.1.1.7 through time based on data from Switzerland. Methods: We generated whole genome sequences from 11.8 % of all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Switzerland between 14 December 2020 and 11 March 2021. Based on these data, we determine the daily frequency of the B.1.1.7 variant and quantify the variant's transmission fitness advantage on a national and a regional scale. Results: We estimate B.1.1.7 had a transmission fitness advantage of 43–52 % compared to the other variants circulating in Switzerland during the study period. Further, we estimate B.1.1.7 had a reproductive number above 1 from 01 January 2021 until the end of the study period, compared to below 1 for the other variants. Specifically, we estimate the reproductive number for B.1.1.7 was 1.24 [1.07–1.41] from 01 January until 17 January 2021 and 1.18 [1.06–1.30] from 18 January until 01 March 2021 based on the whole genome sequencing data. From 10 March to 16 March 2021, once B.1.1.7 was dominant, we estimate the reproductive number was 1.14 [1.00–1.26] based on all confirmed cases. For reference, Switzerland applied more non-pharmaceutical interventions to combat SARS-CoV-2 on 18 January 2021 and lifted some measures again on 01 March 2021. Conclusion: The observed increase in B.1.1.7 frequency in Switzerland during the study period is as expected based on observations in the UK. In absolute numbers, B.1.1.7 increased exponentially with an estimated doubling time of around 2–3.5 weeks. To monitor the ongoing spread of B.1.1.7, our plots are available online.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505046",,"1878-0067||1755-4365",,"10.1016/j.epidem.2021.100480","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505046","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Pandemic||SARS-CoV-2||COVID-19||B.1.1.7||Transmission advantage","Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-10T03:31:57Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Real-time monitoring of COVID-19 transmission through phylodynamics||Large-scale testing and tracking of SARS-CoV-2 infection and evolution by deep sequencing","196267||196348","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Special Call on Coronaviruses||Special Call on Coronaviruses",,"85114190269",,"000703684000009",,,"Epidemics","37","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To investigate the effects of rapid nutrient fluctuations on bacterial growth, we couple custom microfluidics with single-cell microscopy to quantify the growth rate of E. coli experiencing 30 s to 60 min nutrient fluctuations. Compared to steady environments of equal average concentration, fluctuating environments reduce growth rate by up to 50%. However, measured reductions in growth rate are only 38% of the growth loss predicted from single nutrient shifts. This enhancement derives from the distinct growth response of cells grown in environments that fluctuate rather than shift once. We report an unexpected physiology adapted for growth in nutrient fluctuations and implicate nutrient timescale as a critical environmental parameter beyond nutrient identity and concentration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000491293",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-021-23439-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491293","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A distinct growth physiology enhances bacterial growth under rapid nutrient fluctuations","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-25T03:09:30Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"The effect of high-frequency nutrient fluctuations on bacterial growth","176189","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte Lebenswissenschaften",,"85108178725",,"000664863000005","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

Methane oxidizing bacteria in the water column act as a converter, oxidizing methane into carbon dioxide and biomass before it reaches the atmosphere. Current observations and estimates of this methane oxidation efficiency are diverging, especially for the lake overturn period. Here, we combine a model of turbulent mixing, gas exchange, and microbial growth with a comprehensive data set for autumn mixing to quantify the relevant physical and microbial processes for a 16 m deep, wind-sheltered Swiss lake. Scenario analysis suggests that the methane converter is efficient and robust under a large range of mixing velocities and only rare events of pronounced surface cooling can trigger substantial outgassing. This case study combines in situ observation and a deterministic physically based model and suggests that the frequency of storms may strongly impact methane emissions for similar temperate lakes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000509323",,"2378-2242",,"10.1002/lol2.10209","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/509323","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Microbial methane oxidation efficiency and robustness during lake overturn","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-12T20:32:30Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85116318860",,"000703462800001",,"6","Limnology and Oceanography Letters","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Herein, the pH dependence of the inhibitory effect of DOM and the underlying mechanisms were studied in more than 400 kinetic irradiation experiments over the pH range of 6–11. Experiments employed various combinations of one of three DOM isolates, one of two model photosensitizers, the model antioxidant phenol, and one of nine target compounds (TCs), comprising several aromatic amines, in particular anilines and sulfonamides, and 4-cyanophenol. Using model photosensitizers without antioxidants, the phototransformation of most TCs increased with increasing pH, even for TCs for which pH did not affect speciation. This trend was attributed to pH-dependent formation yields of TC-derived radicals and their re-formation to the parent TC. Analogous trends were observed with DOM as a photosensitizer. Comparison of model and DOM photosensitizer data sets showed increasing inhibitory effects of DOM on TC phototransformation kinetics with increasing pH. In systems with anilines as a TC and phenol as a model antioxidant, pH trends of the inhibitory effect could be rationalized based on the reduction potential difference (ΔEred) of phenoxyl/phenol and anilinyl/aniline couples. Our results indicate that the light-induced transformation of aromatic amines in the aquatic environment is governed by the pH-dependent inhibitory effects of antioxidant phenolic moieties of DOM and pH-dependent processes related to the formation of amine oxidation intermediates.",,,,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.1c03301","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/513967","en","American Chemical Society",,,"Excited triplet states||Radicals||Speciation||Reduction potential||Photolysis||Humic substances||Antibiotics","Effect of Solution pH on the Dual Role of Dissolved Organic Matter in Sensitized Pollutant Photooxidation","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-11-05T13:28:40Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85118772466",,"000721255600015","Environ.

Different soil amendments have been proposed to decrease Cd accumulation in rice grain by either decreasing soil Cd availability, introducing competitive ions on Cd uptake, or down-regulating the expression of transporters for Cd uptake. However, the effectiveness of soil amendments applied alone or in combinations needs to be tested under field conditions. Here, we present results of field trials with two rice cultivars differing in Cd accumulation grown at three field sites in southern China in two years, to investigate the effects of two Mn-containing soil amendments (MnO2, Mn-loaded biochar (MB)), Si fertilizer (Si), limestone, and K2SO4, as well as interactions among MnO2, Si, and limestone on decreasing Cd accumulation in rice grain. We found that single applications of MnO2 or MB to acidic soils low in Mn decreased grain Cd concentrations by 44–53 % or 78–82 %, respectively, over two years without decrease in performance. These effects were comparable to or greater than those induced by limestone liming alone (45–62 %). Strong interactions between MnO2 and limestone resulting from their influence on soil extractable Cd and Mn led to non-additive effects on lowering grain Cd. MB addition minimized grain Cd concentrations, primarily by increasing extractable and dissolved Mn concentrations, but also by decreasing Cd extractability in soil. In comparison, Si and K2SO4 amendments affected grain Cd levels only weakly. We conclude that the amendments that decrease labile Cd and increase labile Mn in soils are most effective at reducing Cd accumulation in rice grain, thus contributing to food safety.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000502303",,"0269-7491||1878-2450||1873-6424",,"10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117918","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502303","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Manganese||Liming||Biochar||Competition||Phytoavailability||Rice||Cadmium","Two-year and multi-site field trials to evaluate soil amendments for controlling cadmium accumulation in rice grain","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-26T10:53:28Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Reducing Cd and As uptake by rice in contaminated paddy soils: From biogeochemical processes to improved paddy management","170120","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Sino-Swiss Science and Technology Cooperation (SSSTC)",,"85113164302",,"000696803400001","Environ Pollut",,"Environmental Pollution","289","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we propose six urgent questions relevant to science, technology, and policy that must be tackled to address the “PFAS problem”: (1) What are the global production volumes of PFAS, and where are PFAS used? (2) Where are the unknown PFAS hotspots in the environment? (3) How can we make measuring PFAS globally accessible? (4) How can we safely manage PFAS-containing waste? (5) How do we understand and describe the health effects of PFAS exposure? (6) Who pays the costs of PFAS contamination? The importance of each question and barriers to progress are briefly described, and several potential paths forward are proposed. Given the diversity of PFAS and their uses, the extreme persistence of most PFAS, the striking ongoing lack of fundamental information, and the inequity of the health and environmental impacts from PFAS contamination, there is a need for scientific and regulatory communities to work together, with cooperation from PFAS-related industries, to fill in critical data gaps and protect human health and the environment.",,,,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.1c03386","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/511955","en","American Chemical Society",,,"PFAS||global||health||environment||policy||equity","Addressing Urgent Questions for PFAS in the 21st Century","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-10-27T03:03:39Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85116023046",,"000705995700002","Environ.

We agree with this view. However, we are concerned that their proposed two-level terminology specifying sampling environment and targeted taxa is overly simplistic and might hinder rather than improve clear communication about environmental DNA and its use in biomonitoring. This terminology is based on categories that are often difficult to assign and uninformative, and it overlooks a fundamental distinction within eDNA: the type of DNA (organismal or extra-organismal) from which ecological interpretations are derived.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000494923",,"0962-1083||1365-294X",,"10.1111/mec.15942","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/494923","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","clear terminology||ecology of eDNA||extra-organismal DNA||organismal DNA","Trade-offs between reducing complex terminology and producing accurate interpretations from environmental DNA: Comment on ""Environmental DNA: What's behind the term?"" by Pawlowski et al., (2020)","Other Journal Item","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T10:32:27Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Global measure of biodiversity by understanding biogeochemical cycling of environmental DNA in lakes","852621","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,"85106407350",,"000653966200001","Mol Ecol","19","Molecular Ecology","30","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, it is unclear if cells can adopt growth behaviors that allow individuals to optimally respond to differences in nutrient complexity. Here, we directly control nutrient complexity and use quantitative single-cell analysis to study the growth dynamics of individuals within populations of the aquatic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. We show that cells form clonal microcolonies when growing on the polysaccharide xylan, which is abundant in nature and degraded using extracellular cell-linked enzymes; and disperse to solitary growth modes when the corresponding monosaccharide xylose becomes available or nutrients are exhausted. We find that the cellular density required to achieve maximal growth rates is four-fold higher on xylan than on xylose, indicating that aggregating is advantageous on polysaccharides. When collectives on xylan are transitioned to xylose, cells start dispersing, indicating that colony formation is no longer beneficial and solitary behaviors might serve to reduce intercellular competition. Our study demonstrates that cells can dynamically tune their behaviors when nutrient complexity fluctuates, elucidates the quantitative advantages of distinct growth behaviors for individual cells and indicates why collective growth modes are prevalent in microbial populations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000487397",,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-021-00953-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/487397","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biofilms||Microbial ecology||Water microbiology","Nutrient complexity triggers transitions between solitary and colonial growth in bacterial populations","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-28T15:34:55Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"A microscale analysis of the causes and consequences of the spatial arrangement of biological functions in microbial consortia","169978","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,"85102993992",,"000629883000001","ISME J","9","The ISME Journal","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

In both locations, Archaea dominate at temperatures >45 °C and Bacteria at temperatures <10 °C. Yet, at the phylum level and below, there are clear differences. Hot seep sites have high proportions of typical hydrothermal vent and hot spring taxa. By contrast, high-temperature sites without seepage harbor mainly novel taxa belonging to phyla that are widespread in cold subseafloor sediment.

Anthropogenic reductions in underwater light availability are thus a serious threat to coastal habitats. The flux of light-absorbing coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from land to sea may have increased world-wide, but how this has altered the availability and spectral quality of light in shelf seas remains poorly known. We present time-series data from the Sunda Shelf in Southeast Asia, where the monsoon-driven reversal in ocean currents supplies water enriched in CDOM from tropical peatlands for part of the year, resulting in 5- to 10-fold seasonal variation in light absorption by CDOM. We show that this terrigenous CDOM can dominate underwater light absorption at wavelengths up to 500 nm, and shift the underwater irradiance spectrum towards longer wavelengths. The seasonal presence of terrigenous CDOM also reduces the 10% light penetration depth by 1-5 m, or 10-45%. We estimate that on average 0.6 m, or 25%, of this terrigenous CDOM-mediated shoaling might be attributable to the enhanced input of dissolved organic matter following peatland disturbance. The seasonal change in the light environment is correlated with changes in phytoplankton absorption spectra that suggest a photo-acclimation response, and we infer that terrigenous CDOM likely contributes to limiting the depth distribution of photosynthetic corals. The results reveal an ecologically important but largely overlooked impact of human modifications to carbon fluxes that is likely increasingly important in coastal seas.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504639",,,,"10.3354/meps13776","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504639","en","Inter-Research","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Coral reefs||Optical water quality||Underwater light attenuation||Coloured dissolved organic matter||Dissolved organic carbon||Tropical peatlands","Dissolved organic matter from tropical peatlands reduces shelf sea light availability in the Singapore Strait, Southeast Asia","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-08T02:34:24Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"000691315800007",,,"Marine Ecology Progress Series","672","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, the redox properties of pyDOM remain poorly characterized. This work provides a systematic assessment of the quantity and redox properties of pyDOM released at circumneutral pH from a total of 14 chars pyrolyzed from wood and grass feedstocks from 200 to 700 degrees C. The amount of released pyDOM decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature of chars, reflecting the increasing degree of condensation and decreasing char polarity. Using flow-injection analysis coupled to electrochemical detection, we demonstrated that electron-donating capacities (EDCpyDom; up to 6.5 mmol(e-)center dot g(c)(-1)) were higher than electron-accepting capacities (EAC(pyDom); up to 1.2 mmol(e-)center dot g(c)(-1)) for all pyDOM specimens. The optical properties and low metal contents of the pyDOM implicate phenols and quinones as the major redox-active moieties. Oxidation of a selected pyDOM by the oxidative enzyme laccase resulted in a 1.57 mmol(e-).g(c)(-1) decrease in EDCpyDom and a 0.25 mmol(e-.)g(c)(-1) increase in EAC(pyDom), demonstrating a largely irreversible oxidation of presumably phenolic moieties. Non-mediated electrochemical reduction of the same pyDOM resulted in a 0.17 mmol(e-).g(c)(-1) increase in EDCpyDom and a 0.24 mmol(e-).g(c)(-1) decrease in EDCpyDom consistent with the largely reversible reduction of quinone moieties. Our results imply that pyDOM is an important dissolved redox-active phase in the environment and requires consideration in assessing and modeling biogeochemical redox processes and pollutant redox transformations, particularly in char-rich environments.",,,,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.1c02429","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/503339","en","American Chemical Society",,,"electron-accepting and -donating capacities||electron transfer||flow-injection analysis||electrochemistry||phenols||quinones","Redox Properties of Pyrogenic Dissolved Organic Matter (pyDOM) from Biomass-Derived Chars","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-09-01T02:41:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Dissolved phenols in ombrotrophic bogs: occurrence and enzymatic transformations","159692","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85112704719",,"000687063400054","Environ.

In Lake Cadagno, purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) are responsible for high N2 fixation rates, to our knowledge providing the first direct evidence for PSB in situ N2 fixation. Surprisingly, no alternative nitrogenases are detectable, and N2 fixation is exclusively catalyzed by molybdenum-nitrogenase.

The latter services are partly governed by variations in plankton community composition and the expression of traits such as body size at community-level. While community assembly has been thoroughly studied for the smaller end of the plankton size spectrum, the larger end comprises ectotherms that are often studied at the species, or group-level, rather than as communities. The body size of marine ectotherms decreases with temperature, but controls on community-level traits remain elusive, hindering the predictability of marine services provision. Here, we leverage Tara Oceans datasets to determine how zooplankton community composition and size structure varies with latitude, temperature and productivity-related covariates in the global surface ocean. Zooplankton abundance and median size decreased towards warmer and less productive environments, as a result of changes in copepod composition. However, some clades displayed the opposite relationships, which may be ascribed to alternative feeding strategies. Given that climate models predict increasingly warmed and stratified oceans, our findings suggest that zooplankton communities will shift towards smaller organisms which might weaken their contribution to the biological carbon pump.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000501714",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-021-94615-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/501714","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Ecology||Ocean sciences","Macroscale patterns of oceanic zooplankton composition and size structure","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-22T02:49:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85112647126",,"000684192100009","Sci Rep","1","Scientific Reports","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02030 - Dep.

However, only a subset of Salmonella cells in a population express these genes, suggesting short-chain fatty acids could decrease T3SS-1 population-level expression by acting on per-cell expression or the proportion of expressing cells. Here, we combine single-cell, theoretical, and molecular approaches to address the effect of short-chain fatty acids on T3SS-1 expression. Our in vitro results show short-chain fatty acids do not repress T3SS-1 expression by individual cells. Rather, these compounds act to selectively slow the growth of T3SS-1-expressing cells, ultimately decreasing their frequency in the population. Further experiments indicate slowed growth arises from short-chain fatty acid-mediated depletion of the proton motive force. By influencing the T3SS-1 cell-type proportions, our findings imply gut microbial metabolites act on cooperation between the two cell types and ultimately influence Salmonella's capacity to establish within a host.",,,,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2103027118","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500797","en","National Academy of Sciences",,,"Salmonella||Single cell||Pathogenesis","Microbiota-derived metabolites inhibit Salmonella virulent subpopulation development by acting on single-cell behaviors","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-08-13T04:10:10Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Systems-level view of Salmonella pathogenicity||A microscale analysis of the causes and consequences of the spatial arrangement of biological functions in microbial consortia","SEED-23 19-2||169978","10.13039/501100003006||10.13039/501100001711","ETHZ||SNF","ETH Seeds||Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,"85111797024",,"000685040600004","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","31","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","118","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02030 - Dep.

We herein determined the rate and extent of microbial reduction of ferrihydrite (Fh) with either adsorbed or coprecipitated OM by Geobacter sulfurreducens. We focused on OM-mediated effects on electron uptake and alterations in Fh crystallinity. The OM was obtained from anoxic soil columns (effluent OM, efOM) and included—unlike water-extractable OM—compounds released by microbial activity under anoxic conditions. We found that organic molecules in efOM had generally no or only very low electron-accepting capacity and were incorporated into the Fh aggregates when coprecipitated with Fh. Compared to OM-free Fh, adsorption of efOM to Fh decelerated the microbial Fe(III) reduction by passivating the Fh surface toward electron uptake. In contrast, coprecipitation of Fh with efOM accelerated the microbial reduction, likely because efOM disrupted the Fh structure, as noted by Mössbauer spectroscopy. Additionally, the adsorbed and coprecipitated efOM resulted in a more sustained Fe(III) reduction, potentially because efOM could have effectively scavenged biogenic Fe(II) and prevented the passivation of the Fh surface by the adsorbed Fe(II). Fe(III)–OM coprecipitates forming at anoxic–oxic interfaces are thus likely readily reducible by Fe(III)-reducing bacteria in redoximorphic soils.",,,,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.1c01183","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499178","en","American Chemical Society",,,"Mössbauer spectroscopy||Mediated electrochemical reduction||Electron-accepting capacity||Ferrihydrite||Iron oxide||Dissolved organic matter||DOM","Organic Matter from Redoximorphic Soils Accelerates and Sustains Microbial Fe(III) Reduction","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-08-03T11:12:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85112361905",,"000683363600060","Environ.

However, the redox properties of peat POM and an assessment of its redox state in situ remain missing, mainly due to the lack of an accurate analytical approach to quantify the number of electrons that are transferred to/from POM. Here, we first developed a new spectrophotometric method to quantify the number of electrons that are transferable to peat POM—denoted hereafter as electron accepting capacity (EAC)—by reacting POM with the reduced species of the probe compound 4,4’-bipyridinium-1,1'bis(2-ethylsulfonate). Second, we used this analytical approach to quantify the EAC of an oxidized reference POM material (0.38 ± 0.039 mmol e−/g POM) and of redox-preserved POM from three ombrotrophic bogs in Värmland, Sweden (0.17–0.24 mmol e−/g POM). These EAC values are substantially higher than previous estimates, likely reflecting kinetic artifacts in previous analytical methods. We further established reversible electron transfer to the oxic reference POM over a cycle of electrochemical reduction and O2 re-oxidation. Finally, we determined that the EAC of two of the three bog POM samples that were collected anoxically (i.e., redox state-preserved POM) increased by ∼0.09 mmol e−/g POM upon exposure to air for 8 days, demonstrating that the POM was indeed reduced in situ. Collectively, our results strongly support that POM acts as a sustainable TEA in northern peatlands, which may lower methane release from these systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504115",,"0148-0227||2169-8953||2169-8961",,"10.1029/2021JG006329","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504115","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","redox||particulate organic matter||electron accepting capacity||northern peatlands||terminal electron acceptor||methane","Redox Properties of Peat Particulate Organic Matter: Quantification of Electron Accepting Capacities and Assessment of Electron Transfer Reversibility","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-04T17:11:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Electron transfer to and from peat particulate organic matter in ombrotrophic bogs: characterization and impact on carbon dioxide and methane concentrations","182645","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85113431782",,"000688734500015","J. geophys. res.

Yet, the exact role played by phytoplankton and its community composition in this gatekeeping has not been well established. Here, we investigate this role using a high-resolution model of the Southern Ocean (ROMS-BEC) with an explicit parametrization of silicifying diatoms and calcifying coccolithophores. Consistent with expectations, diatoms are very efficient in consuming the upwelled Si (Formula presented.) south of the Antarctic Polar Front, and exporting it to depth at a rate of 91 Tmol Si (Formula presented.). This leads to Si (Formula presented.) being trapped in the Southern Ocean, preventing it from leaking laterally into the Subantarctic. Model experiments reveal that this trapping is driven by both high Si-to-N diatom uptake ratios and the relatively slow dissolution of the exported opal, with the latter being the dominant mechanism. The low (Formula presented.) consumption resulting from this high uptake ratio allows a good fraction of the upwelled (Formula presented.) to reach the Subantarctic where it fuels the growth of a mixed community including coccolithophores. Coccolithophore production and export of calcite at a rate of 0.16 Pg C (Formula presented.) facilitates an efficient transfer of the exported organic matter to depth, thereby further modifying the laterally exported nutrient levels and stoichiometry. Our results thus demonstrate a key role of phytoplankton community structure in controlling the Southern Ocean biogeochemical gate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000504117",,"0886-6236||1944-9224",,"10.1029/2021GB006991","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504117","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Southern Ocean||silicic acid||nitrate||phytoplankton||diatoms||coccolithophores","Southern Ocean Phytoplankton Community Structure as a Gatekeeper for Global Nutrient Biogeochemistry","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-04T17:11:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"SOGate: Phytoplankton ecosystem control of the Southern Ocean biogeochemical gate","153452","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,"85113395128",,"000690773700007","Glob. biogeochem. cycles","8","Global Biogeochemical Cycles","35","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Gruber, Philip W. Boyd, Thomas L. Frölicher, and Meike Vogt. The data provided here show the distribution in space and time of a number of ocean biogeochemical extremes as simulated by two models, i.e, the global GFDL Earth System Model and the regional ROMS-BEC model.  The abstract of the publication:  ""The ocean is warming, losing oxygen, and it is being acidified, primarily as a result of anthropogenic carbon emissions(Breitburg et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2017; Gattuso et al., 2015; Gruber, 2011). With ocean warming, acidification, and deoxygenation projected to increase for decades(Bopp et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020), extreme events, such as marine heatwaves(Oliver et al., 2021), are likely to intensify, occur more often, persist for longer, and extend over larger regions(Benedetti-Cecchi, 2021; Thomas Lukas Frölicher et al., 2018; Oliver et al., 2018, 2019). Nevertheless, our understanding of oceanic extreme events, associated with warming, low oxygen concentrations or high acidity, and their impacts on marine ecosystems remains limited(Burger et al., 2020; Hauri et al., 2013; Oliver et al., 2019, 2021; Smale et al., 2019; Wernberg et al., 2012). Of particular concern are compound events, multiple extreme events that occur simultaneously or in close sequence, because their individual effects may interact synergistically(Seneviratne et al., 2012). Here we assess patterns and trends in open ocean extremes based on the existing literature and global and regional model simulations. Furthermore, we discuss the potential impacts of individual and compound extremes on marine organisms and ecosystems. We propose a pathway towards an improved understanding of extreme events and the capacity of marine life to respond to them. The absolute conditions exhibited by today’s extreme events may be a harbinger of what may become “normal” in the future(Oliver et al., 2019). In consequence, pursuing this research effort may also help better understand the responses of marine organisms and ecosystems to future climate change.""","application/zip||application/netcdf, application/x-netcdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000501082",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/501082","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Ocean extremes, ocean warming, ocean acidification, ocean deoxygenation","Data supporting publication ""OCEAN BIOGEOCHEMICAL EXTREMES AND COMPOUND EVENTS""","Data Collection","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2021-08-16T11:37:57Z",,"indefinite","292278994-08-17T07:12:55Z","Model simulation results:  Part I: global model results from the GFDL Earth System Model The global extreme event analysis was conducted with simulation results from the fully coupled Earth system model ESM2M developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(Dunne et al., 2013). The atmosphere has a horizontal resolution of 2° latitude x 2.5° longitude and the ocean has a nominal horizontal resolution of 1° latitude and 1° longitude, increasing toward the Equator to up to 0.3°. Ocean biogeochemistry is simulated by the Tracers Of Phytoplankton with Allometric Zooplankton version 2.0 (TOPAZ2). It represents 30 prognostic tracers, includes three phytoplankton functional groups and implicitly simulated zooplankton activity. The GFDL ESM2M captures the observed large-scale biogeochemical patterns and variability. We use a 500-yr preindustrial control simulation with prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 286 ppm, as well as a historical simulation over the 1861-2005 period followed by a high (RCP8.5; RCP: Representative concentration pathway) simulation over the 2006-2100 period with prescribed atmospheric CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse and natural forcing (Burger et al., 2020). The RCP8.5 scenario is a high emission scenario without effective climate policies, leading to continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions.   Part II: regional model results from ROMS-BEC: The 2013-2015 “Blob” event was analyzed using hindcast simulations of the telescopic North Pacific setup of ROMS-BEC by ref((Frischknecht et al., 2017)). Briefly, the model system consists of the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS)(Shchepetkin & McWilliams, 2005) coupled to an updated version of the Biogeochemical/Ecological Model (BEC)(Moore et al., 2002). BEC explicitly resolves the cycling of four nutrient elements, which limit the growth of three phytoplankton functional groups, which are being kept under control by the grazing of a single zooplankton functional group. The model domain covers the entire Pacific, but has a strong resolution refinement toward the U.S. West Coast, with most of the area of interest having a resolution of 10 kilometers or better. The model was initialized from observations, and then run through the period 1970 to 2016 using daily fields of wind stress, solar short-wave radiation, and fluxes of heat and freshwater from ERA Interim(D.

This suggests that this boreal species does not fulfill its life cycle in Adventfjorden. In contrast, young specimens of L. helicina were present during the entire study. Veligers hatched in late summer/autumn and measured 0.14 mm on average. They grew with rates of 0.0006 mm day−1 over the 10–11 months of development. Only thereafter, growth accelerated by one order of magnitude and maximal rates were reached in autumn (0.0077 mm day−1). Our results indicate that L. helicina reaches a size of 1 mm after approximately 1.5 years in Adventfjorden. We therefore suggest that L. helicina overwinters the first year as a small juvenile and that it needs at least 2 years to reach an adult size of 5 mm in Adventfjorden. This reveals an complex and delicate aspect of the life-cycle of L. helicina and further research is needed to determine if it makes the population especially vulnerable towards climate changes.",,,,"1432-2056||0722-4060",,"10.1007/s00300-021-02904-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493177","en","Springer",,,"Thecosome pteropods||Veligers and juveniles||Distribution||Growth rate||Svalbard||Polar conditions","Year-round population dynamics of Limacina spp. early stages in a high-Arctic fjord (Adventfjorden, Svalbard)","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-07-06T04:03:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85108868767",,"000664821900001","Polar Biol","8","Polar Biology","44","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, values of [1O2]SS are often determined for the near-surface of a lake, and these values typically do not represent the average over the epilimnia of lakes. In this work, the environmental and physical factors that have the largest impact on [1O2]SS within lake epilimnia were identified. It was found that the depth of the epilimnion has the largest impact on depth-averaged [1O2]SS, with a factor of 8.8 decrease in [1O2]SS when epilimnion depth increases from 2 m to 20 m. The next most important factors are the wavelength-dependent singlet oxygen quantum yield relationship and the latitude of the lake, causing variations in [1O2]SS by factors of 3.2 and 2.5 respectively, over ranges of representative values. For a set of representative parameters, the depth-averaged value of [1O2]SS within an average epilimnion depth of 9.0 m was found to be 5.8 × 10−16 M and the near-surface value of [1O2]SS was found to be 1.9 × 10−14 M. We recommend a range of 6 × 10−17 to 5 × 10−15 M as being more representative of [1O2]SS values within the epilimnia of lakes globally and potentially more useful for estimating pollutant lifetimes than those calculated using [1O2]SS values that correspond to near-surface, summer midday values. This work advances our understanding of [1O2]SS inter-lake variability in the environment, and provides estimates of [1O2]SS for practitioners and researchers to assess environmental half-lives of pollutants due to reaction with singlet oxygen.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493921",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/d1em00062d","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493921","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/",,"Factors affecting the mixed-layer concentrations of singlet oxygen in sunlit lakes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-12T04:59:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Reactivity-based characterization of photoexcited natural organic matter","188565","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85113380865",,"000670228900001","Environ Sci Process Impacts","8","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This concept is a novel approach to chemicals management that determines whether using substances of concern, such as PFAS, is truly essential for a given functionality. To assess the essentiality of a particular use case, three considerations need to be addressed: (1) the function (chemical, end use and service) that the chemical provides in the use case, (2) whether the function is necessary for health and safety and critical for the functioning of society and (3) if the function is necessary, whether there are viable alternatives for the chemical for this particular use. A few illustrative examples of the three-step process are provided for use cases of PFAS. The essential-use concept takes chemicals management away from a substance-by-substance approach to a group approach. For PFAS and other substances of concern, it offers a more rapid pathway toward effective management or phase-out. Parts of the concept of essential use have already been widely applied in global treaties and international regulations and it has also been recently used by product manufacturers and retailers to phase out substances of concern from supply chains.

Millions of tonnes of plastics are produced every year and a significant amount of this plastic enters the marine environment, either as macro- or microplastics. In this article, an overview is given of the presence of marine plastic debris globally and its potential to reach remote locations in combination with an analysis of the oceanic long-range transport potential of organic additives present in plastic debris. The information gathered shows that leaching of hydrophobic substances from plastic is slow in the ocean, whereas more polar substances leach faster but mostly from the surface layers of the particle. Their high content used in plastic of several percent by weight allows also these chemicals to be transported over long distances without being completely depleted along the way. It is therefore likely that various types of additives reach remote locations with plastic debris. As a consequence, birds or other wildlife that ingest plastic debris are exposed to these substances, as leaching is accelerated in warm-blooded organisms and in hydrophobic fluids such as stomach oil, compared to leaching in water. Our estimates show that approximately 8′100–18′900 t of various organic additives are transported with buoyant plastic matrices globally with a significant portion also transported to the Arctic. For many of these chemicals, long-range transport (LRT) by plastic as a carrier is their only means of travelling over long distances without degrading, resulting in plastic debris enabling the LRT of chemicals which otherwise would not reach polar environments with unknown consequences. The transport of organic additives via plastic debris is an additional long-range transport route that should also be considered under the Stockholm Convention.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000499580",,"2190-4715||2190-4707",,"10.1186/s12302-021-00522-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499580","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Plastic additives||Long-range transport||Leaching||Floating plastic||Plastic debris||Arctic||LRTP||Chemicals","Oceanic long-range transport of organic additives present in plastic products: an overview","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-05T03:16:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85111003416",,"000678606400001","Environ Sci Eur","1","Environmental Sciences Europe","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The reduction of sulfur may induce processes that decrease As solubility, but its impact on rice grain As species remains unresolved. Herein, we investigated the influence of sulfur (S)-containing materials, including chicken manure and elemental sulfur powder on As accumulation and speciation in rice grain as well as the dynamics of the porewater chemistry and solid-phase As solubility throughout the entire growth stage under continuous flooding and intermittent flooding conditions in pot experiments. The S amendments (200 mg S kg−1) to the soil significantly decreased inorganic As in rice grain under continuous flooding (~65% decrease) as well as under intermittent flooding (~70% decrease). The chicken manure amendment promoted sulfur reduction and enhanced dissolvable Mn, Fe, and As at an earlier growth stage. The sequential extraction results corroborated a decrease in the soluble and exchangeable As (F1) and an increase in residual As (F5) fractions in the S-amended treatments. Solubility data suggested that As adsorption onto Fe oxides was the primary mechanism controlling As solubility rather than the formation of Assingle bondFe sulfides. Porewater As, considered to represent the most bioavailable As fraction, failed to explain the grain As accumulation. The time-averaged concentration of oxalate-extractable As explained grain arsenite best, suggesting that poorly crystalline Fe oxides may be the primary dissolvable reactive phases that control As bioavailability in the soil-rice system. Our results suggest that the application of S-containing soil amendments can effectively decrease inorganic As accumulation in rice grains grown under the flooded conditions, which are most widely applied in paddy rice production.",,,,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146352","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/476699","en","Elsevier",,,"Arsenite||Biogeochemistry||Iron sulfides||Paddy soil||Sequential extraction","Sulfur amendments to soil decrease inorganic arsenic accumulation in rice grain under flooded and nonflooded conditions: Insights from temporal dynamics of porewater chemistry and solid-phase arsenic solubility","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-03-28T21:56:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85102806992",,"000655683800011","Sci.

Mitigation measures are often hindered by high heterogeneities in As concentrations, the cause(s) of which are elusive. Here we used a comprehensive suite of stable isotope analyses and hydrogeochemical parameters to shed light on the mechanisms in a typical high-As Holocene aquifer near Hanoi where groundwater is advected to a low-As Pleistocene aquifer. Carbon isotope signatures (δ13C-CH4, δ13C-DOC, δ13C-DIC) provided evidence that fermentation, methanogenesis and methanotrophy are actively contributing to the As heterogeneity. Methanogenesis occurred concurrently where As levels are high (>200 µg/L) and DOC-enriched aquitard pore water infiltrates into the aquifer. Along the flowpath to the Holocene/Pleistocene aquifer transition, methane oxidation causes a strong shift in δ13C-CH4 from -87‰ to +47‰, indicating high reactivity. These findings demonstrate a previously overlooked role of methane cycling and DOC infiltration in high-As aquifers.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000489283",,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2021.117300","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/489283","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Groundwater quality||Drinking water||Geogenic As contamination||Heterogeneity||Organic matter||Carbon isotope δ13C","Carbon and methane cycling in arsenic-contaminated aquifers","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-13T02:21:42Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85107348284",,"000664768300011","Water Res.",,"Water Research","200","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To efficiently target cell surface receptors, exploration of the parameters that modulate cellular accessibility of these nanostructures is essential. In this study, we systematically investigate tunable design parameters of antibody-functionalized DNA nanostructures binding to therapeutically relevant receptors, including the programmed cell death protein 1, the epidermal growth factor receptor, and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. We show that, although the native affinity of antibody-functionalized DNA nanostructures remains unaltered, the absolute number of bound surface receptors is lower compared to soluble antibodies due to receptor accessibility by the nanostructure. We explore structural determinants of this phenomenon to improve efficiency, revealing that receptor binding is mainly governed by nanostructure size and DNA handle location. The obtained results provide key insights in the ability of ligand-functionalized DNA nanostructures to bind surface receptors and yields design rules for optimal cellular targeting.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000498818",,"0002-7863||1520-5126",,"10.1021/jacs.1c02298","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/498818","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Determinants of Ligand-Functionalized DNA Nanostructure-Cell Interactions","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-01T19:51:38Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85110265230",,"000674321800014","J.

It provides an engaging environmental context for students to develop knowledge of reaction kinetics and photochemistry as well as skill in using analytical instrumentation. This versatile experiment consists of two basic modules, three optional advanced modules, and additional add-ons that may be performed in various combinations to meet the unique learning objectives of general, analytical, physical, and environmental chemistry courses and science outreach activities. It may be performed as a traditional lab experiment or as an entirely remote exercise with an increased focus on data analysis and interpretation using provided example data sets. All of the photolysis experiments are carried out by preparing solutions of ranitidine or cimetidine in various matrices, irradiating the samples, and periodically removing subsamples for HPLC analysis of the compound of interest. Pseudo-first order kinetic plots are then generated to determine rate constants that are used to draw conclusions about photolysis pathways or to calculate additional kinetic parameters. In the two basic modules, cimetidine is found to degrade appreciably only when irradiated in the presence natural organic matter (NOM), indicating an indirect, photosensitized degradation pathway. In contrast, ranitidine degrades in pure buffer and in the presence of NOM with comparable rate constants, highlighting the predominant role of direct photolysis. In the advanced modules, students calculate ranitidine direct photolysis quantum yields and examine the significance of singlet oxygen as a photochemically produced reactive intermediate. The two basic modules may be completed in two 3 hour lab periods, while the advanced modules require additional time. This experiment requires only an HPLC instrument, inexpensive chemicals, and common glassware and lab equipment if performed in person and a personal computer if performed remotely.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000498261",,"0021-9584||1938-1328",,"10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c01398","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/498261","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","First-Year Undergraduate/General||Second-Year Undergraduate||Upper-Division Undergraduate||Analytical Chemistry||Environmental Chemistry||Laboratory Instruction||Physical Chemistry||Distance Learning/Self Instruction||Drugs/Pharmaceuticals||Kinetics||Photochemistry","Kinetics and Pathways of the Aqueous Photolysis of Pharmaceutical Pollutants: A Versatile Laboratory or Remote Learning Investigation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-29T03:19:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Reactivity-based characterization of photoexcited natural organic matter","188565","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85110943175",,"000674270800034","J.

Biotransformation, i.e., transformation by microbes, is well understood for a number of priority pollutants, but a similar level of understanding is lacking for many emerging contaminants encountered at low concentrations and in complex mixtures across natural and engineered systems. Any advanced approaches aiming to reduce environmental exposure to such contaminants (e.g., novel engineered biological water treatment systems, design of readily degradable chemicals, or improved regulatory assessment strategies to determine contaminant persistence a priori) will depend on understanding the causal links among contaminant removal, the key driving agents of biotransformation at low concentrations (i.e., relevant microbes and their metabolic activities), and how their presence and activity depend on environmental conditions. In this Perspective, we present the current understanding and recent methodological advances that can help to identify such links, even in complex environmental microbiomes and for contaminants present at low concentrations in complex chemical mixtures. We discuss the ensuing insights into contaminant biotransformation across varying environments and conditions and ask how much closer we have come to designing improved approaches to reducing environmental exposure to contaminants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000499235",,"2690-0637",,"10.1021/acsestwater.1c00025","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/499235","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Methodological Advances to Study Contaminant Biotransformation: New Prospects for Understanding and Reducing Environmental Persistence?","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-04T00:03:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"000672741600001","ACS EST Water","7","ACS ES&T Water","1","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In contrast, the nonlinearity and large spatial variability of identified controls stress the importance of the interplay among soil, vegetation and climate parameters in controlling warming responses. Global models might predict current soil respiration but not future rates because they neglect the controls exerted by soil development.

Assays targeting eDNA released by individual species are typically validated with no predefined criteria to answer specific research questions in one ecosystem. Hence, the general applicability of assays, as well as associated uncertainties and limitations, often remain undetermined. The absence of clear guidelines for assay validation prevents targeted eDNA assays from being incorporated into species monitoring and policy; thus, their establishment is essential for realizing the potential of eDNA-based surveys. We describe the measures and tests necessary for successful validation of targeted eDNA assays and the associated pitfalls to form the basis of guidelines. A list of 122 variables was compiled, consolidated into 14 thematic blocks (e.g., “in silico analysis”), and arranged on a 5-level validation scale from “incomplete” to “operational” with defined minimum validation criteria for each level. These variables were evaluated for 546 published single-species assays. The resulting dataset was used to provide an overview of current validation practices and test the applicability of the validation scale for future assay rating. Of the 122 variables, 20% to 76% were reported; the majority (30%) of investigated assays were classified as Level 1 (incomplete), and 15% did not achieve this first level. These assays were characterized by minimal in silico and in vitro testing, but their share in annually published eDNA assays has declined since 2014. The meta-analysis demonstrates the suitability of the 5-level validation scale for assessing targeted eDNA assays. It is a user-friendly tool to evaluate previously published assays for future research and routine monitoring, while also enabling the appropriate interpretation of results. Finally, it provides guidance on validation and reporting standards for newly developed assays.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000496734",,"2637-4943","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/496734||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502262","10.1002/edn3.189","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/504209","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","digital PCR||eDNA||endpoint PCR||https://edna-validation.com||quantitative PCR||species detection||species-specific","A validation scale to determine the readiness of environmental DNA assays for routine species monitoring","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-21T08:17:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85106997612",,,,"4","Environmental DNA","3","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Hence, understanding the processes for such high organic carbon burial in lacustrine systems is essential. We applied proxies typically used for marine environments including amino acid (AA) content and their nitrogen stable isotope composition to the water columns and sediments of three lakes that differ in their trophic states and depositions rates of sedimentary terrestrial organic matter. Additionally, we used carbon isotope fingerprinting of AAs to characterise their sources and fates. We show that this set of proxies tracks sources and degradation processes in eutrophic lakes with high sedimentary total organic carbon and nitrogen content. Those lakes also have a high total hydrolysable amino acid (THAA) content as well as higher pigment concentrations. While the Chlorin degradation Index (CI) showed increasing values with depth, the patterns were less consistent for the Degradation Index (DI). In general, all parameters failed to describe degradation in the most oligotrophic lake due to the very low organic carbon and nitrogen content in the sediment. We show that AAs are mostly of autochthonous origin and that AA contribute 5–45% to the organic material in plankton, POM, and sediment. Proxies based on AA for bacterial reworking (ΣV) or trophic level (TL) showed increasing values in the water column but relatively stable values in the sediments. Furthermore, we show that methanotrophic bacteria led to increased values for the bacterial reworking proxy (ΣV) and extraordinarily low δ13C AA values (−30 to −60‰).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488137",,"0016-7037||1872-9533",,"10.1016/j.gca.2021.04.006","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488137","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Lakes||Water column||Sediment||Organic matter degradation||Amino acid concentration||Nitrogen and carbon isotopes of amino acids||Degradation indices","Amino acid and chlorin based degradation indicators in freshwater systems","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-03T00:28:39Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85106339921",,"000655500800012","Geochim.

Foundation species, namely those that play a central role in the structuring of communities and functioning of ecosystems, are likely important for the resilience of aquatic ecosystems in the face of disturbance. However, little is known about how interactions among such species influence ecosystem responses to nutrient perturbation. Here, using an array (N = 20) of outdoor experimental pond ecosystems (15,000 L), we manipulated the presence of two foundation species, the macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum and the mussel Dreissena polymorpha, and quantified ecosystem responses to multiple nutrient disturbances, spread over two years. In the first year, we added five nutrient pulses, ramping up from 10 to 50 μg P/L over a 10-week period from mid-July to mid-October, and in the second year, we added a single large pulse of 50 μg P/L in mid-October. We used automated sondes to measure multiple ecosystems properties at high frequency (15-minute intervals), including phytoplankton and dissolved organic matter fluorescence, and to model whole-ecosystem metabolism. Overall, both foundation species strongly affected the ecosystem responses to nutrient perturbation, and, as expected, initially suppressed the increase in phytoplankton abundance following nutrient additions. However, when both species were present, phytoplankton biomass increased substantially relative to other treatment combinations: non-additivity was evident for multiple ecosystem metrics following the nutrient perturbations in both years but was diminished in the intervening months between our perturbations. Overall, these results demonstrate how interactions between foundation species can cause surprisingly strong deviations from the expected responses of aquatic ecosystems to perturbations such as nutrient additions.",,,,"0012-9658||1939-9170",,"10.1002/ecy.3371","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493939","en","Wiley",,,"aquatic ecosystems||chlorophyll||eutrophication||foundation species||high-frequency time series||metabolism||non-additive effects||perturbation","Non-additive effects of foundation species determine the response of aquatic ecosystems to nutrient perturbation","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-07-12T05:15:41Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85107563933",,"000658533600001","Ecol.","7","Ecology","102","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Although sources driving these increases are not well constrained, one potential contribution comes from wetlands, which are usually intertwined with rivers, channels and lakes, creating a considerable need to acquire higher-resolution data to facilitate modelling and predictions. Here we took a fully contained sensor set-up to obtain measurements of CH4, O2 and auxiliary parameters, installed on a houseboat for accessibility, to assess and analyse surface water concentrations within the Danube Delta, Romania. During three expeditions in different seasons, we transected a 400km route with concentration mapping and two additional stations for monitoring diel cycles. Overall, the delta was a source for CH4 throughout all seasons, with concentrations ranging between 0.113-15.6μmolL-1. Calculated diffusive CH4 fluxes for the overall delta yielded an average of 49±61μmolm-2h-1, corresponding to an extrapolated annual flux of 0.43±0.53molm-2yr-1. The dataset was split into three different subsystems-lakes, rivers and channels-with channels showing the highest variability. We found overlapping CH4 concentrations throughout each subsystem, with large inflows coming from reed beds and channels into the lakes. Seasonal variability and water flow direction also influenced the overall dynamics in each region. We found large to extreme diel cycles in both the lakes and channels, with concentrations varying by an order of magnitude between these two systems. The lake diel cycle showed a clear linear trend with an O2:CH4 molar ratio of-50:1 during the phase of nocturnal convection, with the two water stratified bodies mixing during the night, suggesting daily vertical stratification allowing for macrophytes to create a temporal oxycline due to a lack of light and movement between the stems as previously suggested, and potentially incurring an uncertainty range of a factor of 4.5. Our data illustrate the importance of high-resolution spatiooral data collection throughout the entire delta and the increased need for diel cycles in different habitats to improve the concentration and emission estimates from wetland systems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493898",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-18-3961-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493898","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Methane in the Danube Delta: The importance of spatial patterns and diel cycles for atmospheric emission estimates","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-11T02:44:23Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85109105408",,"000670555200002",,"12","Biogeosciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

During this seasonal transition, diazotrophic cyanobacteria exploit the abundant phosphate and fix nitrogen after other phytoplankton taxa have consumed the available nitrate. However, it remains less clear, which mechanisms favour diazotrophic cyanobacteria under more heavily stratified conditions with lower levels of excess phosphate and persistent nitrate-depletion. Here, we collected profiles of physicochemical parameters, nutrients and photo-pigments, as well as the medium- to large-sized phytoplankton community during two lake-wide cruises to elucidate to what extent the abundance of diazotrophic cyanobacteria in Lake Tanganyika may be controlled by the nitrate resupply through the thermocline into the euphotic zone. At stations where nitrate was depleted, but phosphate remained available near the surface, high densities of diazotrophic cyanobacteria were associated with a low nitrate supply to surface waters. Our data provide first support for two conceptual scenarios, where the relative position of the thermocline and the euphotic depth may create a functional niche for diazotrophic cyanobacteria: when the upward transport of nitrate into the euphotic zone is reduced by a subjacent thermocline, diazotrophic cyanobacteria, comprising Dolichospermum and Anabaenopsis, are key players in the medium-to large-sized phytoplankton community. By contrast, a thermocline located within the euphotic zone allows for a rapid vertical transport of nitrate for a thriving nitrate-assimilating phytoplankton community that evidently outcompetes diazotrophic cyanobacteria. This study highlights that, under nitrogen-depleted conditions, diazotrophic cyanobacteria can also grow in response to a reduced nutrient resupply to the productive surface waters.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000500781",,"2296-665X",,"10.3389/fenvs.2021.716765","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500781",,"Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","cyanobacterial blooms||stratification||oligotrophic||dolichospermum||diazotrophs||phycocyanin||phycoerythrin","Diazotrophic Cyanobacteria are Associated With a Low Nitrate Resupply to Surface Waters in Lake Tanganyika","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-08-13T04:00:03Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85112591590",,"000681654000001","Front.

Agricultural intensification, urbanization and future development of hydropower dams will likely lead to a degradation of surface water quality, but there have been few formal assessments of where, how and why these changes impact specific water quality parameters based on in situ data spanning a large region. We sampled a large suite of biogeochemical water quality parameters at 14 locations in four field campaigns in central and southern Zambia in 2018 and 2019 to characterize seasonal changes in water quality in response to large hydropower dams and human landscape transformations. We find that the major rivers (Zambezi and Kafue) are very clean with extremely low concentrations of solutes, but suffer from thermal changes, hypoxia and loss of suspended sediment below dams. Smaller tributaries with a relatively large anthropogenic landcover footprint in their catchments show signs of pollution in the form of higher concentrations of nutrients and dissolved ions. We find significant relationships between crop and urban land cover metrics and selected water quality metrics (i.e. conductivity, phosphorus and nitrogen) across our data set. These results reflect a very high-quality waterscape exhibiting some hotspots of degradation associated with specific human activities. We anticipate that as agricultural intensification, urbanization and future hydropower development continue to accelerate in the basin, the number and extent of these hotspots of water quality degradation will grow in response. There is an opportunity for governments, managers and industry to mitigate water quality degradation via investment in sustainable infrastructure and practice, such as wastewater treatment, environmental dam operations, or riparian protection zones.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492107",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/d1em00006c","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492107","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Anthropogenic influences on Zambian water quality: hydropower and land-use change","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-29T12:48:45Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,"85111138375",,"000654957800001","Environ Sci Process Impacts","7","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We found that carbon dioxide (CO2) emission downstream of Kariba Dam (southern Africa) varied widely over different timescales and that accounting for downstream emissions and their fluctuations is critically important to the reservoir carbon budget. Seasonal variation was driven by reservoir stratification and the accumulation of CO2 in hypolimnetic waters, while subdaily variation was driven by hydropeaking events caused by dam operation in response to daily electricity demand. This “carbopeaking” resulted in hourly variations of CO2 emission up to 200% during stratification. Failing to account for seasonal or subdaily variations in downstream carbon emissions could lead to errors of up to 90% when estimating the reservoir’s annual emissions. These results demonstrate the critical need to include both limnological seasonality and dam operation at subdaily time steps in the assessment of carbon budgeting of reservoirs and carbon cycling along the aquatic continuum.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000490799",,"0027-8424||1091-6490","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/490799||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/498796","10.1073/pnas.2026004118","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505561","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Carbon emissions||Hydropower dams||River damming||Reservoir carbon budget","Unaccounted CO2 leaks downstream of a large tropical hydroelectric reservoir","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-23T03:10:59Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,"85107945302",,"000675808200004","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","25","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","118","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, the dynamics and mechanisms of eDNA persistence are largely unknown especially when considering different eDNA states. This is decisive in advancing eDNA data interpretation since each one of these states can potentially have a different decay rate leading to a different persistence time in the environment. We experimentally evaluated degradation of plant and animal eDNA from cells, organelles and in its dissolved form under precisely controlled conditions with and without bacteria. We hypothesize that eDNA decay depends on its state and that dissolved DNA degrades faster than organelle or cellular DNA. Moreover, we expect increased eDNA degradation in presence of bacteria using nucleic acid as nutrient source. First results show clear effects from presence of bacteria on the experimental conditions. Bacterial presence leads to a decrease in pH overtime in replicates containing cells, organelles and when all states were mixed, but not for dissolved DNA alone, suggesting increased metabolic activity when other cellular components are also available affecting eDNA decay.",,,,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/490711","en",,,,"eDNA||decay||factors affecting stability","Stability and fate of environmental DNA","Presentation","Metadata only",,,,"2021-06-22T09:13:20Z",,,,,,"yes","Invited Talk at University Tübingen","June 17, 2021","Tübingen, Germany",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Whereas the release of microplastics during washing of textiles is already well studied, much less is known about the release during abrasion processes. The abrasion of textiles may induce fibrillation of fibers and therefore result in the formation of much finer fiber fragments. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of abrasion of synthetic textiles on the formation of microplastic fibers and fibrils. Fleece and interlock textile swatches made of polyester were abraded using abrasion tests with a Martindale tester. The microplastic fibers and fibrils formed during abrasion were extracted from the textiles and characterized in terms of number, length, and diameter. The microplastic fibers demonstrated the same diameter than the fibers found in the textiles (fleece: 12.3 μm; interlock: 12.7 μm), while fibrils with a much smaller diameter (fleece: 2.4 μm; interlock: 4.9 μm) were also found. The number of fibrils formed during abrasion in both textiles was higher than the number of microplastic fibers. The majority of the extracted microplastic fibers had a length between 200 and 800 μm, while most fibrils were between 30 and 150 μm, forming two distinct fiber fragment morphologies. The number of microplastic fibers formed during abrasion was 5 to 30 times higher than the number of microplastic fibers that could be extracted from non-abraded samples. The number of fibrils increased after abrasion by more than a factor of 200 for both fabric types. The fibrils formed during abrasion have diameters that fall within the inhalable size for airborne particles. The potential release of fibrils into air during wear of textiles thus raises questions about the human exposure to these materials. Since the Martindale tester can simulate a daily application scenario of textiles over a prolonged period only in a limited way, future studies are needed to establish the correlation between the test results with a real-world scenario.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000491546",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.1c00650","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491546","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","microplastic||textiles||release||fibers||fibrils||fragmentation","Formation of Fiber Fragments during Abrasion of Polyester Textiles","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-27T03:33:06Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems||Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)","168105||186856","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Ambizione||Eccellenza",,"85108303025",,"000663939900025","Environ.

To disentangle the different mechanisms driving these modifications, we conduct a series of modeling experiments with a high-resolution regional ocean model (ROMS) coupled to a biogeochemical/ecological model (BEC) that we augmented to include Diatom-Diazotroph-Assemblages (DDAs). In our model, the Amazon River increases net primary production (NPP) in the WTA by almost 10%, exceeding the stimulation expected from the supplied inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus by a factor of two. This amplification is fueled by new nitrogen stemming from DDA-driven N2 fixation in the plume region, supported, in part, by the consumption of riverine dissolved organic phosphorus. The vertical export of organic carbon is enhanced by a shift of the phytoplankton community toward diatoms induced by the large amount of Si(OH)4 delivered by the Amazon. These changes in NPP and export production induce a strong uptake of atmospheric CO2. In contrast, the remineralization of the river-delivered terrestrial organic matter leads to a release of CO2 over the WTA, which is partially offset by a net uptake induced by the riverine dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity. Overall, the Amazon reduces the strong outgassing of the WTA in our simulations by more than 50%. Our study demonstrates how rivers modify the marine biological pump and the air-sea CO2 fluxes in the downstream ocean through a myriad of cascading effects, highlighting the need to fully consider the land-ocean aquatic continuum in the modeling of the Earth System.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000492845",,"0886-6236||1944-9224",,"10.1029/2020GB006818","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/492845","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"The Impact of the Amazon on the Biological Pump and the Air-Sea CO2 Balance of the Western Tropical Atlantic","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-03T00:55:55Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85108666851",,"000667032800012","Glob. biogeochem. cycles","6","Global Biogeochemical Cycles","35","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the present study, the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex were exposed to palladium (Pd)-doped NP via natural sediment at six spiking concentrations (0, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 g plastic per kg of sediment dry weight) with the aim of assessing their uptake and chronic effects using 28 days standardized single species toxicity tests. NP concentrations were quantified based on Pd concentrations measured by ICP-MS on digests of the exposed organisms and faecal pellets excreted during a post-exposure 24 hour depuration period. Additionally, NP concentrations were measured in sediments and water to demonstrate accuracy of NP dosing and to quantify the resuspension of NP from the sediment caused by the organisms. A significant positive linear relationship between the uptake of NP by G. pulex and the concentration of NP in the sediments was observed, yet no statistically significant effects were found on the survival or growth of G. pulex. A biodynamic model fitted well to the data and suggested bioaccumulation would occur in two kinetic compartments, the major one being reversible with rapid depuration to clean medium. Model fitting yielded a mass based trophic transfer factor (TTF), conceptually similar to the traditional biota sediment accumulation factor, for NP in the gut of 0.031. This value is close to a TTF value of 0.025 that was obtained for much larger microplastic particles in a similar experiment performed previously. Mechanistically, this suggests that ingestion of plastic is limited by the total volume of ingested particles. We demonstrated that using metal-doped plastics provides opportunities for precise quantification of NP accumulation and exposure in fate and effect studies, which can be a clear benefit for NP risk assessment.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000491285",,"2051-8153||2051-8161",,"10.1039/d1en00068c","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/491285","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Metal-doping of nanoplastics enables accurate assessment of uptake and effects on Gammarus pulex","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-25T03:08:14Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems","168105","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,"85108159270",,"000654361700001","Environ.

The main centers of pre-colonial metallurgy are well-known from archeological artifacts, but temporal gaps inherent in this record handicap a finer understanding of the modalities of ore exploitation by succeeding civilizations. A continuous record over time of trace metals emitted during ore smelting operations make lake sediments excellent candidates to fill those gaps. Two millennia of metallurgy were reconstructed from atmospherically derived metals together with lead (Pb) isotope ratios in two dated sediment cores from Lake Titicaca. The first evidence for metallurgy is found during the apogee of the Tiwanaku state (AD 800–1150), with a higher copper (Cu) accumulation that can be attributed to the smelting of local Cu ores, based on Pb isotopic fingerprinting. During the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1150–1450), recorded peaks in metal deposition that persisted for ∼ twenty years show that mining activities were intensive but discontinuous. Pb isotope ratios suggest diversified extractive activities, mainly located in the southern part of the central Altiplano. Finally, the most intense mining epoch began during the Inca Empire (ca. AD 1500) and lasted until the end of the Colonial Period (AD 1830), with unprecedented metal deposition over this interval. Pb isotope fingerprinting shows that mining operations occurred mainly in the Lake Titicaca and Potosi areas and were responsible for metal emissions recorded in the entire Altiplano, as evidenced by other studies.",,,,"2213-3054",,"10.1016/j.ancene.2021.100288","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478381","en","Elsevier",,,"Central Andes mining||Lake Titicaca sediment||Copper||Silver||Lead isotopes","Reconstructing two millennia of copper and silver metallurgy in the Lake Titicaca region (Bolivia/Peru) using trace metals and lead isotopic composition","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-04-13T03:09:47Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85103733079",,"000661266000001",,,"Anthropocene","34","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Reviewing the copious HBM data reported in these studies is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of pollution management efforts, for example by evaluating time-trends. Nevertheless, guidance to systematically evaluate time trends in published HBM data has never been developed. In this study, we therefore present a proposal for guidelines to conduct “time-trend reviews” (TTRs) that examine time trends in published large HBM datasets of chemical pollutant concentrations. We also demonstrate the applicability of these guidelines through a case study that assesses time-trends in global and regional HBM data on mercury. The recommended TTR guidelines in this study are divided into seven steps: formulating the objective of the TTR, setting up of eligibility criteria, defining search strategy and screening of literature, screening results of search, extracting data, analysing data, and assessing certainty, including the potential for bias in the evidence base. The TTR guidelines proposed in this study are straightforward and less complex than those for conducting systematic reviews assessing datasets on potential human health effects of exposure to pollutants or medical interventions. These proposed guidelines are intended to enable the credible, transparent, and reproducible conduct of TTRs.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000472846",,"0160-4120||1873-6750",,"10.1016/j.envint.2021.106437","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472846","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Time trend reviews||Systematic reviews||Human biomonitoring||Pollutants||Guidelines||Research methods","Towards guidelines for time-trend reviews examining temporal variability in human biomonitoring data of pollutants","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-04T04:25:00Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85101391366",,"000632312100005","Environ.

Contemporary ocean biomes have been constructed based on various approaches. These included the biogeographic patterns of higher trophic level organisms, physical and biogeochemical properties, or bulk biological properties such as chlorophyll-a, but none considered the biogeographic patterns of the first trophic level explicitly, i.e. phytoplankton biogeography. A global description of marine biomes based on phytoplankton and defined in analogy to terrestrial vegetation biomes is still lacking. A bioregionalization based on phytoplankton appears particularly timely, as phytoplankton have a high sensitivity to climatic changes and fuel marine productivity. Here, we partition the global ocean into biomes by using self-organizing maps and hierarchical clustering, drawing on the biogeographic patterns of 536 phytoplankton species predicted from empirical evidence. Our approach reveals eight different biomes at the seasonal scale, and seven at the annual scale. The biomes host characteristic phytoplankton species compositions, and differ in their prevailing environmental conditions. The largest differences in phytoplankton composition are found between a Pacific equatorial biome and other tropical biomes, and between subtropical and high latitude biomes. The Pacific equatorial biome is characterized by species with narrower ecological niches, the tropical and subtropical biomes by cosmopolitan generalists, and the high latitudes by species with a heterogeneous biogeography. The strongest differences between biomes are found along gradients of temperature and macronutrient availability, associated with latitude. We test whether our biomes can be reproduced based on indicator species, or potential co-occurrence networks of species determined from the predicted species distributions that are wide-spread in some but rare in other biomes. We find that our biomes can be reproduced by the 51 species identified, which together form significant species co-occurrences. This suggests that species co-occurrences, rather than individual indicator species drive oceanic biome partitioning at the first trophic level. Our biome partitioning may be especially useful for comparative analyses on the functional implications of phytoplankton organization, and impacts on zoogeographical partitionings. Furthermore, it provides a framework for predicting large-scale changes in phytoplankton community structure due to anthropogenic climate and environmental change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000479179",,"0079-6611",,"10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102530","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/479179","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biomes||Phytoplankton||Self-organizing map||Indicator species||Species network||Species distribution models","Biome partitioning of the global ocean based on phytoplankton biogeography","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-18T03:00:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85103950536",,"000653103000002","Prog.

This proxy is based on the deficits of 210Po typically observed in the upper water column due to the preferential removal of 210Po relative to 210Pb by sinking particles. Yet, a number of studies have reported unexpected large 210Po deficits in the deep ocean indicating scavenging of 210Po despite its radioactive mean life of ∼ 200 days. Two precipitation methods, Fe(OH)3 and Co-APDC, are typically used to concentrate Pb and Po from seawater samples, and deep 210Po deficits raise the question whether this feature is biogeochemically consistent or there is a methodological issue. Here, we present a compilation of 210Pb and 210Po studies that suggests that 210Po deficits at depths >300 m are more often observed in studies where Fe(OH)3 is used to precipitate Pb and Po from seawater, than in those using Co-APDC (in 68 versus 33% of the profiles analyzed for each method, respectively). In order to test whether 210Po/210Pb disequilibrium can be partly related to a methodological artifact, we directly compared the total activities of 210Pb and 210Po in four duplicate ocean depth-profiles determined by using Fe(OH)3 and Co-APDC on unfiltered seawater samples. While both methods produced the same 210Pb activities, results from the Co-APDC method showed equilibrium between 210Pb and 210Po below 100 m, whereas the Fe(OH)3 method resulted in activities of 210Po significantly lower than 210Pb throughout the entire water column. These results show that 210Po deficits in deep waters, but also in the upper ocean, may be greater when calculated using a commonly used Fe(OH)3 protocol. This finding has potential implications for the use of the 210Po/210Pb pair as a tracer of particle export in the oceans because 210Po (and thus POC) fluxes calculated using Fe(OH)3 on unfiltered seawater samples may be overestimated. Recommendations for future research are provided based on the possible reasons for the discrepancy in 210Po activities between both analytical methods.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000493887",,"2296-7745",,"10.3389/fmars.2021.684484","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/493887","en","Frontiers Media","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","marine chemistry||radiochemistry||polonium isotopes||precipitation methods||Co-APDC||Fe(OH)(3)||Po-210/Pb-210 disequilibrium||particle export","Quantifying 210Po/210Pb Disequilibrium in Seawater: A Comparison of Two Precipitation Methods With Differing Results","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-11T02:30:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85109359952",,"000669040600001",,,"Frontiers in Marine Science","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we use a sulfate radiotracer-based method to quantify microbial sulfate reduction rates in serpentinization fluids recovered from boreholes in the Samail Ophiolite, Oman and the California Coast Range Ophiolite, USA. We find that low levels of sulfate reduction occur at pH up to 12.3. These low levels could not be stimulated by addition of hydrogen, methane or small organic acids, which indicates that this metabolism is limited by factors other than substrate availability.

Nanoplastics have recently emerged in the discussions of scientists, regulators and the public, as the weathering of macroplastics may lead to a substantial burden of nanoplastics in various ecosystems. While nanoplastics particles themselves have not (yet) been extensively measured in the environment, there is increased concern that this size fraction of plastic may be more extensively distributed and hazardous that larger-sized particles. This assessment may emanate from an unease with the term ‘nano’, which may elicit a negative response over uncertainties of the pervasiveness of nanoplastics specifically, or from the lessons learned by many years of intensive environmental health and safety research of engineered nanomaterials. Ultimately, the different physical and chemical characteristics of the different size classes of plastic pollution (macroplastics, microplastics and nanoplastics) will result in divergent fate and hazards. As nanoscientists specializing in understanding the fate, transport and interactions of nanoparticles in human and environmental systems, in this Perspective, we try to place nanoplastics in the context of global plastic pollution by assessing its sources and risks, and by assessing commonalities nanoplastics may share with other nanosized objects in environmental systems, such as engineered nanomaterials and natural colloids.",,,,"1748-3387||1748-3395",,"10.1038/s41565-021-00888-2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/487449","en","Nature",,,,"Placing nanoplastics in the context of global plastic pollution","Review Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-05-31T02:29:49Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)","186856||186856||186856||186856","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","Eccellenza||Eccellenza||Eccellenza||Eccellenza",,"85105397848",,"000645495900002","Nat.

However, to date, the contribution of industrial sources to the loads of individual REEs in wastewater streams have not been quantified. Here, we determine the REE contents in sludge collected from 63 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Switzerland. To quantify the industrial fraction of individual REEs in the sewage sludge, we develop two complementary approaches, based on REE ratios and REE pattern fitting. Unspecific (background) inputs, with REE patterns similar to the averaged REE pattern of soils collected across Switzerland, dominate the REE budget of most WWTPs. A few WWTPs receive significant REE inputs from specific industrial sources. Based on population equivalents of Switzerland, we estimate a total annual load of 4200 kg Cerium (Ce, 0.5 g Ce year-1 capita-1), with an industrial contribution of 2000 kg year-1. The latter agrees with estimates of probabilistic mass flow models for engineered nanoscale CeO2 particles discharged to the sewer network. About 7 kg year-1 of Samarium (Sm,total for Switzerland: 184 kg year-1 or 0.02 g Sm year-1 capita-1) and 3 kg year-1 of Europium (Eu,total for Switzerland: 44 kg year-1 or 0.005 g Eu year-1 capita-1) are assigned to industrial inputs from single WWTPs. Gadolinium (Gd) is used in the form of a stable complex as contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging. Assuming 10% removal of Gd during wastewater treatment, we calculate an annual discharge of 90 kg of Gd from one individual WWTP to surface waters. WWTPs with exceptionally high industrial inputs of specific REEs warrant detailed investigations to identify the respective sources and to assess whether REE concentrations in effluents are elevated to the same degree.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474259",,"2589-9147",,"10.1016/j.wroa.2021.100092","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474259","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Sewage sludge||Rare earth elements||Industry||Wastewater||Soil","Quantification of individual Rare Earth Elements from industrial sources in sewage sludge","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-13T04:36:28Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85101762120",,"000647799000012",,,"Water Research X","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This allows coastal areas to act as a filter for P that is transported from land to sea. Recent work suggests that vivianite-type ferrous iron (Fe(II))-P minerals may be more important as a sink for P in coastal sediments than previously thought. Here, we investigate the occurrence of such vivianite-type minerals in sediments of three eutrophic coastal sites with contrasting dynamics with respect to iron (Fe) and sulfur (S), covering a salinity range of 0 to 7. We only find authigenic vivianite-type minerals at the low and intermediate salinity sites, where Fe is available in excess over sulfide production. Sequential extractions combined with SEM-EDS and μXRF analysis point towards substitution of Fe in vivianite-type minerals by other transition metal cations such as magnesium and manganese, suggesting potentially different formation pathways modulated by metal cation availability. Our results suggest that vivianite-type minerals may act as a key sink for P in sediments of many other brackish coastal systems. Climate change-driven modulations of coastal bottom water salinity, and hence, Fe versus S availability in the sediment, may alter the role of vivianite-type minerals as a P burial sink over the coming decades. Model projections for the Baltic Sea point towards increased river input and freshening of coastal waters, which could enhance P burial. In contrast, sea level rise in the Chesapeake Bay area is expected to lead to an increase in bottom water salinity and this could lower rates of P burial or even liberate currently buried P, thereby enhancing eutrophication.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000472328",,"1872-7581||0304-4203",,"10.1016/j.marchem.2021.103948","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472328","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Phosphorus cycle||Vivianite||Iron||Sediments","Phosphorus burial in vivianite-type minerals in methane-rich coastal sediments","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-02T03:55:23Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85101164675",,"000640108900008","Mar. chem.",,"Marine Chemistry","231","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, HOBr is also known to react with reactive moieties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) such as phenolic compounds to form bromoform (CHBr3) and other brominated compounds. The reaction between HOBr and DMS may thus compete with the reaction between HOBr and DOM. To study this potential competition, kinetic batch and diffusion-reactor experiments with DMS, HOBr, and DOM were performed. Based on the reaction kinetics, we modeled concentrations of DMS, HOBr, and CHBr3 during typical algal bloom fluxes of DMS and HOBr (10-13 to 10-9 M s-1). For an intermediate to high HOBr flux (≥10-11 M s-1) and a DMS flux ≤10-11 M s-1, the model shows that the DMS degradation by HOBr was higher than for photochemical oxidation, biological consumption, and sea-air gas exchange combined. For HOBr fluxes ≤10-11 M s-1 and a DMS flux of 10-11 M s-1, our model shows that CHBr3 decreases by 86% compared to a lower DMS flux of 10-12 M s-1. Therefore, the reaction between HOBr and DMS likely not only presents a sink for DMS but also may lead to suppressed CHBr3 formation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000487444",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.0c08189","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/487444","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","bromine||dissolved organic matter||kinetics||diffusion||degradation","Reaction of DMS and HOBr as a Sink for Marine DMS and an Inhibitor of Bromoform Formation","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-31T02:28:43Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85105084530",,"000643546400131","Environ.

Signal molecules are thought to broadly diffuse in space; however, they often regulate traits such as conjugative transfer that strictly depend on the local community composition. This raises the question how nearby cells within the community can be detected. Here, we compare the range of communication of different quorum-sensing systems. While some systems support long-range communication, we show that others support a form of highly localized communication. In these systems, signal molecules propagate no more than a few microns away from signaling cells, due to the irreversible uptake of the signal molecules from the environment. This enables cells to accurately detect micron scale changes in the community composition. Several mobile genetic elements, including conjugative elements and phages, employ short-range communication to assess the fraction of susceptible host cells in their vicinity and adaptively trigger horizontal gene transfer in response. Our results underscore the complex spatial biology of bacteria, which can communicate and interact at widely different spatial scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000481854",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-021-22649-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/481854","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Bacteria||Microbial communities","Short-range quorum sensing controls horizontal gene transfer at micron scale in bacterial communities","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-01T05:21:06Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"A microscale analysis of the causes and consequences of the spatial arrangement of biological functions in microbial consortia","169978","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,"85104533566",,"000641850200015","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the co-precipitation samples showed uptake of a small portion of Fe(II) by calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H) in the interlayer indicated by an increase in the interlayer spacing.

This work includes samples collected from three full-depth water columns in two areas: i) the Arctic Ocean, where Atlantic waters carry the signal of Sellafield (United Kingdom) and La Hague (France) nuclear reprocessing facilities; and ii) the western Mediterranean Sea, directly impacted by Marcoule reprocessing plant (France). This work is complemented by the study of the particle-reactive Pu isotopes as an additional fingerprint of the source region. In the Canada Basin, Atlantic waters showed the highest concentrations and 237Np/236U ratios in agreement with the estimated values for North Atlantic waters entering the Arctic Ocean and tagged with the signal of European Nuclear Reprocessing Plants. These results may reflect the impact of the documented releases for the 1990s. In the Mediterranean Sea, an excess of 236U presumably caused by Marcoule is reflected in the lower 237Np/236U ratios compared to the Global Fallout signal in all the studied samples. On the contrary, the 239,240Pu profiles were mainly governed by the Global Fallout. The impact of Marcoule as a local source is further corroborated when comparing the temporal evolution of these ratios between 2001 and 2013. The lowest 237Np/236U ratios observed in 2001 at the surface reflect a previous local input that is no longer observed in 2013 as it had been homogenized through the whole water column. This work presents the use of 237Np as a new ocean tracer. A more accurate characterization of the main sources is still needed to optimize the use of 236U-237Np as a new tool to understand transient oceanographic processes. © 2020 Elsevier",,,,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142741","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/469369","en","Elsevier",,,"Uranium-236||Neptunium-237||Plutonium||AMS||Seawater||Conservative tracers","236U, 237Np and 239,240Pu as complementary fingerprints of radioactiveeffluents in the western Mediterranean Sea and in the Canada Basin (Arctic Ocean)","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-02-15T05:50:50Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85092651660",,"000616232300001","Sci.

However, the lack of reproducibility across research groups and publications remains a challenge that significantly limits the usability of literature data. In the first part of this review, we critically evaluate the experimental techniques that have been used to determine ΦΔ values of natural organic matter, we identify and quantify sources of errors that potentially explain the large variability in the literature, and we provide general experimental recommendations for future studies. In the second part, we provide a qualitative overview of known ΦΔ trends as a function of organic matter type, isolation and extraction procedures, bulk water chemistry parameters, molecular and spectroscopic organic matter features, chemical treatments, wavelength, season, and location. This review is supplemented with a comprehensive database of ΦΔ values of environmental samples.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478666",,"0009-2665||1520-6890",,"10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00781","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478666","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Singlet Oxygen Quantum Yields in Environmental Waters","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-14T09:22:28Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Reactivity-based characterization of photoexcited natural organic matter","188565","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85103445173",,"000641154800009","Chem.

Knowledge of organic matter mineralization in such sediment, however, remains mostly conceptual, as modern ferruginous analogs are largely unstudied. Here we show that in sediment of ferruginous Lake Towuti, Indonesia, methanogenesis dominates organic matter mineralization despite highly abundant reactive ferric iron phases like goethite that persist throughout the sediment. Ferric iron can thus be buried over geologic timescales even in the presence of labile organic carbon. Coexistence of ferric iron with millimolar concentrations of methane further demonstrates lack of iron-dependent methane oxidation. With negligible methane oxidation, methane diffuses from the sediment into overlying waters where it can be oxidized with oxygen or escape to the atmosphere. In low-oxygen ferruginous Archaean and Proterozoic oceans, therefore, sedimentary methane production was likely favored with strong potential to influence Earth’s early climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000478637",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-021-22453-0","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/478637","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Early Earth||Methanogenesis||Lake sediments||ICDP","Organic matter mineralization in modern and ancient ferruginous sediments","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-04-14T08:31:19Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85104316745",,"000640638900006","Nat Commun",,"Nature Communications","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Habitat-forming and ecologically dominant mytilid mussels exhibit decreasing growth when salinity < 11; however, the mechanisms underlying reduced calcification rates in dilute seawater are not fully understood. Both [HCO−3] and [Ca2+] also decrease with salinity, challenging calcifying organisms through CaCO3 undersaturation (Ω≤1) and unfavourable ratios of calcification substrates ([Ca2+] and [HCO−3]) to the inhibitor (H+), expressed as the extended substrate–inhibitor ratio (ESIR). This study combined in situ monitoring of three southwest Baltic mussel reefs with two laboratory experiments to assess how various environmental conditions and isolated abiotic factors (salinity, [Ca2+], [HCO−3] and pH) impact calcification in mytilid mussels along the Baltic salinity gradient. Laboratory experiments rearing juvenile Baltic Mytilus at a range of salinities (6, 11 and 16), HCO−3 concentrations (300–2100 µmol kg−1) and Ca2+ concentrations (0.5–4 mmol kg−1) reveal that as individual factors, low [HCO−3], pH and salinity cannot explain low calcification rates in the Baltic Sea. Calcification rates are impeded when Ωaragonite ≤ 1 or ESIR ≤ 0.7 primarily due to [Ca2+] limitation which becomes relevant at a salinity of ca. 11 in the Baltic Sea. Field monitoring of carbonate chemistry and calcification rates suggest increased food availability may be able to mask the negative impacts of periodic sub-optimal carbonate chemistry, but not when seawater conditions are permanently adverse, as observed in two Baltic reefs at salinities < 11. Regional climate models predict a rapid desalination of the southwest and central Baltic over the next century and potentially a reduction in [Ca2+] which may shift the distribution of marine calcifiers westward. It is therefore vital to understand the mechanisms by which the ionic composition of seawater impacts bivalve calcification for better predicting the future of benthic Baltic ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000482462",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-18-2573-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/482462","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Decoupling salinity and carbonate chemistry: low calcium ion concentration rather than salinity limits calcification in Baltic Sea mussels","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-05T04:03:41Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85104756609",,"000644250600005",,"8","Biogeosciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

There, the respiration of this Corg substantially modifies net community production (NCP). While this transport and the resulting coupling of the biogeochemistry between the coastal and open ocean has been well studied in the annual mean, the temporal variability, and especially its seasonality, has not yet been investigated. Here, we determine the seasonal variability of the offshore transport of Corg, its mesoscale component, latitudinal differences, and the underlying physical and biological drivers. To this end, we employ the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) coupled to a nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton–detritus (NPZD) ecosystem model. Our results reveal the importance of the mesoscale fluxes and of the upwelling processes (coastal upwelling and Ekman pumping) in modulating the seasonal variation of the offshore Corg transport. We find that the region surrounding Cape Blanc (21∘ N) hosts the most intense Corg offshore flux in every season, linked to the persistent, and far reaching Cape Blanc filament and its interaction with the Cape Verde Front. Coastal upwelling filaments dominate the seasonality of the total offshore flux up to 100 km from the coast, contributing in every season at least 80 % to the total flux. The seasonality of the upwelling modulates the offshore Corg seasonality hundreds of kilometers from the CanUS coast via lateral redistribution of nearshore production. North of 24.5∘ N, the sharp summer–fall peak of coastal upwelling results in an export of more than 30 % of the coastal Corg at 100 km offshore due to a combination of intensified nearshore production and offshore fluxes. To the south, the less pronounced upwelling seasonality regulates an overall larger but farther-reaching and less seasonally varying lateral flux, which exports between 60 % and 90 % of the coastal production more than 100 km offshore. Overall, we show that the temporal variability of nearshore processes modulates the variability of Corg and NCP hundreds of kilometers offshore from the CanUS coast via the offshore transport of the nearshore production.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000481835",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-18-2429-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/481835","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Drivers and impact of the seasonal variability of the organic carbon offshore transport in the Canary upwelling system","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-01T05:18:48Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"CALNEX: Quantifying the exchange of carbon and nutrients between the coastal and open seas: A comparative modeling study of the California and Canary Current Systems","149384","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,"85104560108",,"000641964900001",,"8","Biogeosciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

For large scale applications, Ksat is often estimated from pedotransfer functions (PTFs) based on easy‐to‐measure soil properties like soil texture and bulk density. The reliance of PTFs on data from uniform arable lands and the omission of soil structure limits the applicability of texture‐based predictions of Ksat in vegetated lands. To include effects of terrain, climate, and vegetation in the derivation of a new global Ksat map at 1 km resolution, we harness technological advances in machine learning and availability of remotely sensed surrogate information. For model training and testing, a global compilation of 6,814 geo‐referenced Ksat measurements from the literature was used. The accuracy assessment based on spatial cross‐validation shows a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.16 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.18 for log10 Ksat values in cm/day (CCC = 0.79 and RMSE = 0.72 for non‐spatial cross‐validation). The generated maps of Ksat represent spatial patterns of soil formation processes more distinctly than previous global maps of Ksat based on easy‐to‐measure soil properties. The validation of the model indicates that Ksat could be modeled without bias using Covariate‐based GeoTransfer Functions (CoGTFs) that harness spatially distributed surface and climate attributes, compared to soil information based PTFs. The relatively poor performance of all models in the validation (low CCC and high RMSE) highlights the need for the collection of additional Ksat values to train the model for regions with sparse data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000483182",,"1942-2466",,"10.1029/2020MS002242","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/483182","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Global Prediction of Soil Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Using Random Forest in a Covariate‐Based GeoTransfer Function (CoGTF) Framework","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-10T02:54:29Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85104950878",,"000645031400008",,"4","Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The ongoing boom of dam construction for hydropower is one of the drivers for this change. In particular, the stratification in tropical reservoirs induces oxygen deficits in their deep waters and warmer surface water temperatures, which often translate into altered thermal and oxygen regimes of downstream river systems, with cascading consequences for the entire aquatic ecosystem. Operation rules of reservoirs, involving water intakes at different levels, could mitigate the consequences for downstream water quality. However, optimized water management of deep reservoirs relies on predictive models for water quality, but such predictive capability is often lacking for tropical dams. Here we focus on the Zambezi River Basin (southern Africa) to address this gap. Using the one-dimensional General Lake Model, we reproduced the internal dynamics of the transboundary Lake Kariba, the world’s largest artificial lake by volume, created by damming the Zambezi River at the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. Through this modeling approach, we assessed and quantified the thermal and oxygen alteration in the Zambezi River downstream of the reservoir. Results suggest that these alterations depend directly on Kariba’s stratification dynamics, its water level and the transboundary policies for water withdrawal from the reservoir. Scenario calculations indicate a large potential for mitigating downstream water quality alterations by implementing a hypothetical selective withdrawal technology. However, we show that a different and cooperative management of the existing infrastructure of Kariba Dam has the potential to mitigate most of the actual water quality alterations.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000482475",,"0043-1397||1944-7973",,"10.1029/2020WR027465","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/482475","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","dam management||General Lake Model||lake modeling||tropical dam||water quality alterations","Lake Modeling Reveals Management Opportunities for Improving Water Quality Downstream of Transboundary Tropical Dams","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-05T04:04:48Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Use of a Decision-Analytic Framework to explore the water-energy-food NExus in complex and trans-boundary water resources systems of fast growing developing countries.","690268","10.13039/501100007352","SBFI","H2020",,"85104856688",,"000644063800001","Water Resour.

Ecological risk assessment (ERA) of RNAi crops requires a heretofore-missing detailed understanding of dsRNA adsorption in soils, a key fate process. Herein, we systematically study the adsorption of a model dsRNA molecule and of two double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules of varying lengths to three soil iron (oxyhydr-)oxides – goethite, lepidocrocite, and hematite – over a range of solution pH (4.5–10), ionic strength (I = 10–100 mM NaCl) and composition (0.5, 1, and 3 mM MgCl2) and in the absence and presence of phosphate (0.05–5 mM) as co-adsorbate. We hypothesized comparable adsorption characteristics of dsRNA and DNA based on their structural similarities. Consistently, the three nucleic acids (NAs) showed high adsorption affinities to the iron (oxyhydr-)oxides with decreasing adsorption in the order goethite, lepidocrocite, and hematite, likely reflecting a decrease in the hydroxyl group density and positive charges of the oxide surfaces in the same order. NA adsorption also decreased with increasing solution pH, consistent with weakening of NA electrostatic attraction to and inner–sphere complex formation with the iron (oxyhydr-)oxides surfaces as pH increased. Adsorbed NA concentrations increased with increasing I and in the presence of Mg2+, consistent with adsorbed NA molecules adopting more compact conformations. Strong NA–phosphate adsorption competition demonstrates that co-adsorbates need consideration in assessing dsRNA fate in soils. Comparable adsorption characteristics of dsRNA and DNA molecules to iron (oxyhydr-)oxides imply that information on DNA adsorption to soil particle surfaces can inform dsRNA ERA.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484255",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/d1em00010a","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484255","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Adsorption of double-stranded ribonucleic acids (dsRNA) to iron (oxyhydr-)oxide surfaces: comparative analysis of model dsRNA molecules and deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA)","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-17T02:43:59Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85105207767",,"000644971900007","Environ Sci Process Impacts","4","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","23","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet, no long-term, global observation-based data set exists that allows us to study changes in ocean acidification for all carbonate system parameters over the last few decades. Here, we fill this gap and present a methodologically consistent global data set of all relevant surface ocean parameters, i.e., dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), pH, and the saturation state with respect to mineral CaCO3 (Ω) at a monthly resolution over the period 1985 through 2018 at a spatial resolution of 1° × 1°. This data set, named OceanSODA-ETHZ, was created by extrapolating in time and space the surface ocean observations of pCO2 (from the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas, SOCAT) and total alkalinity (TA; from the Global Ocean Data Analysis Project, GLODAP) using the newly developed Geospatial Random Cluster Ensemble Regression (GRaCER) method (code available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4455354, Gregor, 2021). This method is based on a two-step (cluster-regression) approach but extends it by considering an ensemble of such cluster regressions, leading to improved robustness. Surface ocean DIC, pH, and Ω were then computed from the globally mapped pCO2 and TA using the thermodynamic equations of the carbonate system. For the open ocean, the cluster-regression method estimates pCO2 and TA with global near-zero biases and root mean squared errors of 12 μatm and 13 μmol kg-1, respectively. Taking into account also the measurement and representation errors, the total uncertainty increases to 14 μatm and 21 μmol kg-1, respectively. We assess the fidelity of the computed parameters by comparing them to direct observations from GLODAP, finding surface ocean pH and DIC global biases of near zero, as well as root mean squared errors of 0.023 and 16 μmol kg-1, respectively. These uncertainties are very comparable to those expected by propagating the total uncertainty from pCO2 and TA through the thermodynamic computations, indicating a robust and conservative assessment of the uncertainties. We illustrate the potential of this new data set by analyzing the climatological mean seasonal cycles of the different parameters of the surface ocean carbonate system, highlighting their commonalities and differences. Further, this data set provides a novel constraint on the global- and basin-scale trends in ocean acidification for all parameters. Concretely, we find for the period 1990 through 2018 global mean trends of 8.6±0.1 μmol kg-1 per decade for DIC, -0.016±0.000 per decade for pH, 16.5±0.1 μatm per decade for pCO2, and -0.07±0.00 per decade for Ω.

The identification and monitoring of such changes, which also includes tipping points, is an ongoing and emerging research effort. Prevention of negative impacts requires mitigation efforts based on feasible research-based pathways. Climate-induced tipping points are traditionally associated with singular catastrophic events (relative to natural variations) of dramatic negative impact. High-probability high-impact ocean tipping points due to warming, ocean acidification, and deoxygenation may be more fragmented both regionally and in time but add up to global dimensions. These tipping points in combination with gradual changes need to be addressed as seriously as singular catastrophic events in order to prevent the cumulative and often compounding negative societal and Earth system impacts.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000473482",,"0027-8424||1091-6490",,"10.1073/pnas.2008478118","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473482","en","National Academy of Sciences","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ocean||biogeochemistry||climate change||tipping points||regime shifts","The quiet crossing of ocean tipping points","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-08T16:50:39Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85101643896",,"000625304300004","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","9","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","118","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In aquatic and terrestrial systems, Hg can be reduced to elemental Hg (Hg0) and escape to the atmosphere or converted to methylmercury (MeHg), a potent neurotoxin that accumulates in food webs. FeII-bearing minerals such as magnetite, green rusts, siderite, and mackinawite are recognized HgII reducers. Another potentially Hg-reducing mineral, which commonly occurs in Fe- and organic/P-rich sediments and soils, is the ferrous iron phosphate mineral vivianite (FeII3(PO4)2·8H2O), but its reaction with HgII has not been studied to date. Here, nanoparticulate vivianite (particle size ∼ 50 nm; FeII content > 98%) was chemically synthesized and characterized by a combination of chemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic analyses. Its ability to reduce HgII was investigated at circumneutral pH under anoxic conditions over a range of FeII/HgII ratios (0.1–1000). For FeII/HgII ratios ≥1, which are representative of natural environments, HgII was very quickly and efficiently reduced to Hg0. The ability of vivianite to reduce HgII was found to be similar to those of carbonate green rust and siderite, two of the most effective Hg-reducing minerals. Our results suggest that vivianite may be involved in abiotic HgII reduction in Fe and organic/P-rich soils and sediments, potentially contributing to Hg evasion while also limiting MeHg formation in these ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000481834",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.0c05203","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/481834","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Mercury Reduction by Nanoparticulate Vivianite","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-01T05:18:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Iron mineral dynamics in redox-affected soils and sediments: Pushing the frontier toward in-situ studies","788009","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,"85101580159",,"000626270400070","Environ.

Its release into marine systems causes concerns over persistence and toxicity. However, the environmental fate of medetomidine has not been fully investigated. In this study, the photodegradation of medetomidine under natural sunlight conditions was investigated using collected coastal and sea waters. In addition, the phototransformation of medetomidine with reactive species (i.e., singlet oxygen, excited triplet state organic matter, and hydroxyl radicals) under UVA light was examined. Photoproducts were isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), identified by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (qTOF), and reaction mechanisms were proposed. The results show that medetomidine is a neutral base (pKa of protonated form = 7.2) that leads to two different protonation states in the aquatic environment. Photodegradation of neutral medetomidine was dominated by reaction with singlet oxygen, while protonated medetomidine was relatively photostable. The contribution of reactive species to the overall photodegradation of neutral medetomidine was calculated to provide an assessment of phototransformation of medetomidine. The half-live of medetomidine was < 1.5 days in natural waters (pHcoastal = 8.3; pHsea = 8.1) under sunlit near-surface conditions, suggesting that it is not persistent in the aquatic environment. Because medetomidine has a relatively short half-life in sunlit aquatic ecosystems, a number of products, such as 2-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)propanamide, can be formed by photochemical reactions of medetomidine, with unknown consequences for marine and coastal waters.",,,,"0043-1354||1879-2448",,"10.1016/j.watres.2020.116791","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462348","en","Elsevier",,,"Antifouling biocides||Indirect photolysis||Singlet oxygen||Photoproducts||Cycloaddition","Photochemical fate of medetomidine in coastal and marine environments","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-14T03:47:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85098985059",,"000615940000001","Water Res.",,"Water Research","191","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A common framework, including freshwater, marine, benthic, and pelagic ecologists, is needed to bridge communication gaps and foster knowledge sharing. This framework should transcend local specificities and taxonomy in order to provide a common ground and shareable tools to address common scientific challenges. Here, we advocate the use of functional trait-based approaches (FTBAs) for aquatic ecologists and propose concrete paths to go forward. Firstly, we propose to unify existing definitions in FTBAs to adopt a common language. Secondly, we list the numerous databases referencing functional traits for aquatic organisms. Thirdly, we present a synthesis on traditional as well as recent promising methods for the study of aquatic functional traits, including imaging and genomics. Finally, we conclude with a highlight on scientific challenges and promising venues for which FTBAs should foster opportunities for future research. By offering practical tools, our framework provides a clear path forward to the adoption of trait-based approaches in aquatic ecology.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000458312",,"0024-3590||1939-5590",,"10.1002/lno.11655","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458312","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Functional trait-based approaches as a common framework for aquatic ecologists","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-23T08:36:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85097446300",,"000596887900001","Limnol. oceanogr.","3","Limnology and Oceanography","66","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the relative contributions of factors that underlie the spread of plasmids and their roles in conjugation in vivo are unclear. To address this, we investigated the spread of clinical Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producing plasmids in the absence of antibiotics in vitro and in the mouse intestine. We hypothesised that plasmid properties would be the primary determinants of plasmid spread and that bacterial strain identity would also contribute. We found clinical Escherichia coli strains natively associated with ESBL-plasmids conjugated to three distinct E. coli strains and one Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain. Final transconjugant frequencies varied across plasmid, donor, and recipient combinations, with qualitative consistency when comparing transfer in vitro and in vivo in mice. In both environments, transconjugant frequencies for these natural strains and plasmids covaried with the presence/absence of transfer genes on ESBL-plasmids and were affected by plasmid incompatibility. By moving ESBL-plasmids out of their native hosts, we showed that donor and recipient strains also modulated transconjugant frequencies. This suggests that plasmid spread in the complex gut environment of animals and humans can be predicted based on in vitro testing and genetic data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000451923",,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-020-00819-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/451923","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Antibiotics||Microbial ecology||Phylogenomics","Plasmid- and strain-specific factors drive variation in ESBL-plasmid spread in vitro and in vivo","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-19T03:49:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Towards quantification of the contribution of plasmids to the spread of antibiotic resistance","167121||167121","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","NFP 70: Gesuch",,"85094965605",,"000585771000001","ISME J","3","The ISME Journal","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02030 - Dep.

Proteins and lipids are abundant components of necromass, yet the taxonomic identities of microorganisms that actively degrade them remain poorly resolved. Here, we revealed identities, trophic interactions, and genomic features of bacteria that degraded 13C-labeled proteins and lipids in cold anoxic microcosms containing sulfidic subarctic marine sediment. Supplemented proteins and lipids were rapidly fermented to various volatile fatty acids within 5 days. DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) suggested Psychrilyobacter atlanticus was an important primary degrader of proteins, and Psychromonas members were important primary degraders of both proteins and lipids. Closely related Psychromonas populations, as represented by distinct 16S rRNA gene variants, differentially utilized either proteins or lipids. DNA-SIP also showed 13C-labeling of various Deltaproteobacteria within 10 days, indicating trophic transfer of carbon to putative sulfate-reducers. Metagenome-assembled genomes revealed the primary hydrolyzers encoded secreted peptidases or lipases, and enzymes for catabolism of protein or lipid degradation products. Psychromonas species are prevalent in diverse marine sediments, suggesting they are important players in organic carbon processing in situ. Together, this study provides new insights into the identities, functions, and genomes of bacteria that actively degrade abundant necromass macromolecules in the seafloor.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000446773",,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-020-00817-6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446773","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Anaerobic bacterial degradation of protein and lipid macromolecules in subarctic marine sediment","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-20T08:30:47Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85096238074",,"000591023200001","ISME J","3","The ISME Journal","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

During the 1990s, increased discharges of 129I from European nuclear fuel reprocessing plants produced a large, tracer spike whose passage through the Arctic Ocean has been followed by 129I time series measurements over the past 25 years. Elevated 129I levels measured over the Lomonosov and Alpha‐Mendeleyev Ridges in 2015 were associated with tracer labeled, Atlantic‐origin water bathymetrically steered by the ridge systems through the central Arctic while lower 129I levels were evident in the more poorly ventilated basin interiors. 129I levels of 200–400 × 107 at/l measured in intermediate waters had increased by a factor of 10 in 2015 compared to 1994–1996 owing to the circulation of the 1990s, 129I input spike. Comparisons of 129I distributions between the mid‐1990s and 2015 delineate large scale circulation changes that occurred during the shift from a positive Arctic Oscillation and a cyclonic circulation regime in the mid‐1990s to anticyclonic circulation in 2015. The latter is characterized by a broadened Beaufort Gyre in the upper ocean, a weakened boundary current and partial mid‐depth, AW flow reversal in the southern Canada Basin. Tracer 129I simulations using the applied circulation model, NAOSIM, agree with both historical 129I results and recent GEOTRACES data sets, thereby supporting the present interpretation of the relationship of changes in arctic circulation to shifts in climate indices revealed by tracer 129I distributions. © 2021 American Geophysical Union",,,,"0148-0227||2169-9275",,"10.1029/2020JC016740","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/477409","en","American Geophysical Union",,,,"A Changing Arctic Ocean: How Measured and Modeled 129I Distributions Indicate Fundamental Shifts in Circulation Between 1994 and 2015","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-04-04T07:14:27Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"A new multitracer approach in Oceanography: combining U-236 with conventional anthropogenic radionuclides in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans","154805||154805","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Ambizione||Ambizione",,"85103286778",,"000636285300014","J. geophys. res.

Deep blooms of photosynthetic bacteria, which form the suboxic/anoxic chlorophyll maximum (ACM), widespread in aquatic ecosystems, may also contribute to the local input of organic matter. Yet, the influence of the ACM on nitrogen and carbon cycling remains poorly understood. Using a suite of stable isotope tracer experiments, we examined the transformation of nitrogen and carbon under an ACM (comprising of Chlorobiaceae and Synechococcales) and a non-ACM scenario in the anoxic zone of Lake Tanganyika. We find that the ACM hosts a tight coupling of photo/litho-autotrophic and heterotrophic processes. In particular, the ACM was a hotspot of organic matter remineralization that controlled an important supply of ammonium driving a nitrification-anammox coupling, and thereby played a key role in regulating nitrogen loss in the oxygen-deficient zone.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000470658",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-021-21115-5","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/470658","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Biogeochemistry||Carbon cycle||Climate change||Element cycles||Limnology","Anoxic chlorophyll maximum enhances local organic matter remineralization and nitrogen loss in Lake Tanganyika","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-20T04:45:49Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85100566985",,"000617500200003","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The drainage of paddy soils during the grain filling period leads to the remobilization of Cd in soils, resulting in most of the Cd accumulated in rice grain. The rate of Cd remobilization during drainage differs markedly among soils, but the mechanisms underlying these differences remain largely unknown. Using microcosm soil incubation, electrochemical experiments, isotope labeling, and microscopic and spectroscopic analyses, here, we discover the voltaic effect as a novel mechanism controlling the remobilization of Cd during soil drainage. During soil flooding, microbial sulfate reduction results in the formation of various metal sulfides. When the soils are subsequently drained, the various metal sulfides can form within sulfide voltaic cells. The metal sulfides with a lower electrochemical potential act as anodes and are prone to oxidative dissolution, whereas the metal sulfides with a higher potential act as cathodes and are protected from oxidation. This voltaic effect explains why the presence of ZnS (with a low potential) suppresses the oxidative dissolution of Cd sulfides, whereas the presence of CuS (with a high potential) promotes the oxidative dissolution of Cd sulfides. The voltaic effect is applicable to all chalcophile trace metals coupled with the sulfur redox cycle in periodically anoxic–oxic environments, thus playing an important role in the biogeochemistry of trace metals. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,,,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.0c06561","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472644","en","American Chemical Society",,,,"The Voltaic Effect as a Novel Mechanism Controlling the Remobilization of Cadmium in Paddy Soils during Drainage","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-03-03T08:33:56Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85100746388",,"000618083600038","Environ.

Under anoxic conditions, clay minerals were shown to increase Cd retention by favoring the precipitation of Mn(II) phases. In this study, we investigated the influence of aeration on anoxically formed Mn solid phases and its impact on Cd retention in the presence of two clay minerals with low Fe contents, a natural kaolinite (KGa-1b) and a synthetic montmorillonite (Syn-1). Ca-saturated KGa-1b and Syn-1 were pre-equilibrated with Mn2+ and Cd2+ under anoxic conditions for 1 or 30 days and subsequently exposed to air for 1 or 30 days. The analysis with synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that extended anoxic pre-equilibration (30 days) partially prevented the oxidation of sorbed Mn(II) (MnSiO3 and Mn(II)Al-LDH). Extended exposure to ambient air and short anoxic pre-equilibration favored the formation of feitknechtite (β-MnOOH) and birnessite (Î-MnO2). Aeration resulted in a decrease of pH and a net release of Cd2+ into the solution, indicating that Cd re-sorption by Mn(III/IV)-phases was insufficient to compensate for the release of Cd2+ due to dissolution of Mn(II)-containing phases and the decrease in pH. Our results demonstrate the significance of clay minerals in the (trans)formation of Mn-containing phases and their impact on trace metal retention in environments undergoing fluctuating redox conditions. ©","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000472322",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.0c05875","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/472322","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"The Effect of Aeration on Mn(II) Sorbed to Clay Minerals and Its Impact on Cd Retention","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-02T03:54:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Mobility of trace metals in periodically flooded soils: Influence of reduced iron, manganese, and sulfur","156392","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,"85099803931",,"000618083600028","Environ.

Novel, rapid and cost-effective DNA-based approaches are valuable to improve understanding of the biological communities and for biomonitoring in remote areas. Here, we evaluate the potential of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding for assessing the structure and distribution of fish communities by analysing water and sediment from 11 locations along the Jequitinhonha River catchment (Brazil). Each site was sampled twice, before and after a major rain event in a five-week period and fish diversity was estimated using high-throughput sequencing of 12S rRNA amplicons. In total, 252 Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) and 34 fish species were recovered, including endemic, introduced, and previously unrecorded species for this basin. Spatio-temporal variation of eDNA from fish assemblages was observed and species richness was nearly twice as high before the major rain event compared to afterwards. Yet, peaks of diversity were primarily associated with only four of the locations. No correlation between β-diversity and longitudinal distance or presence of dams was detected, but low species richness observed at sites located near dams might that these anthropogenic barriers may have an impact on local fish diversity. Unexpectedly high α-diversity levels recorded at the river mouth suggest that these sections should be further evaluated as putative “eDNA reservoirs” for rapid monitoring. By uncovering spatio-temporal changes, unrecorded biodiversity components, and putative anthropogenic impacts on fish assemblages, we further strengthen the potential of eDNA metabarcoding as a biomonitoring tool, especially in regions often neglected or difficult to access.",,,,"0048-9697||1879-1026",,"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142096","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/502265","en","Elsevier",,,"eDNA||Biodiversity assessment||Fish||Freshwater||Brazil||River","Space-time dynamics in monitoring neotropical fish communities using eDNA metabarcoding","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-08-26T09:33:23Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sci.

Given their importance, it is crucial to understand the stability of positive interactions over evolutionary timescales, in both constant and fluctuating environments; e.g., environments interrupted with periods of competition. We addressed this question using a two-species microbial system in which we modulated interactions according to the nutrient provided. We evolved in parallel four experimental replicates of species growing in isolation or together in consortia for 200 generations in both a constant and fluctuating environment with daily changes between commensalism and competition. We sequenced full genomes of single clones isolated at different time points during the experiment. We found that the two species coexisted over 200 generations in the constant commensal environment. In contrast, in the fluctuating environment, coexistence broke down when one of the species went extinct in two out of four cases. We showed that extinction was highly deterministic: when we replayed the evolution experiment from an intermediate time point we repeatably reproduced species extinction. We further show that these dynamics were driven by adaptive mutations in a small set of genes. In conclusion, in a fluctuating environment, rapid evolution destabilizes the long-term stability of positive pairwise interactions.",,,,"1751-7362||1751-7370",,"10.1038/s41396-020-00787-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446712","en","Nature",,,"Bacterial genetics||Microbial ecology||Population genetics","Rapid evolution destabilizes species interactions in a fluctuating environment","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-10-20T04:49:27Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"A microscale analysis of the causes and consequences of the spatial arrangement of biological functions in microbial consortia","169978","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,"85092086675",,"000575722900001","ISME J","2","The ISME Journal","15","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the impact of different types of organic matter (OM) on microbial As/Fe transformation in As-bearing Fh-organic associations remains unclear. In our study, we therefore exposed arsenate-adsorbed ferrihydrite, ferrihydrite-PGA (polygalacturonic acid), and ferrihydrite-HA (humic acid) complexes to two typical Fe(III)- and As(V)-reducing bacteria, and followed the fate of Fe and As in the solid and aqueous phases. Results show that PGA and HA promoted the reductive dissolution of Fh, resulting in 0.7–1.6 and 0.8–1.9 times more As release than in the OM-free Fh, respectively. This was achieved by higher cell numbers in the presence of PGA, and through Fe-reduction via electron-shuttling facilitated by HA. Arsenic-XAS results showed that the solid-phase arsenite fraction in Fh-PGA and Fh-HA was 15–19% and 27–28% higher than in pure Fh, respectively. The solid-associated arsenite fraction likely increased because PGA promoted cell growth and As(V) reduction, while HA provided electron shuttling compounds for direct microbial As(V)-reduction. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that As speciation and partitioning during microbial reduction of Fh-organic associations are strongly influenced by PGA and HA, as well as the strains’ abilities to utilize electron-shuttling compounds. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.0c05329","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461881","en","American Chemical Society",,,,"Impact of Organic Matter on Microbially-Mediated Reduction and Mobilization of Arsenic and Iron in Arsenic(V)-Bearing Ferrihydrite","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-13T07:32:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85100125793",,"000612354700052","Environ.

In this article, we investigate the occurrence of PAs in the aquatic environment of small Swiss streams combining two different approaches. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are toxic secondary metabolites produced by numerous plant species. Although they were classified as persistent and mobile and found to be emitted into the environment, their occurrence in surface waters is largely unknown. Therefore, we performed a retrospective data analysis of two extensive HRMS campaigns each covering five small streams in Switzerland over the growing season. All sites were contaminated with up to 12 individual PAs and temporal detection frequencies between 36 and 87%. Individual PAs were in the low ng/L range, but rain-induced maximal total PA concentrations reached almost 100 ng/L in late spring and summer. Through PA patterns in water and plants, several species were tentatively identified as the source of contamination, with Senecio spp. and Echium vulgare being the most important. Additionally, two streams were monitored, and PAs were quantified with a newly developed, faster, and more sensitive LC–MS/MS method to distinguish different plant-based and indirect human PA sources. A distinctly different PA fingerprint in aqueous plant extracts pointed to invasive Senecio inaequidens as the main source of the surface water contamination at these sites. Results indicate that PA loads may increase if invasive species are sufficiently abundant.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000469363",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.0c06411","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/469363","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Retrospective HRMS Screening and Dedicated Target Analysis Reveal a Wide Exposure to Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids in Small Streams","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-02-15T05:49:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85099093972",,"000612354700025","Environ.

Yet many details of the fate and circulation of these waters within the Arctic remain unclear. Here, we use the two long-lived anthropogenic radionuclides 129I and 236U together with two age models to constrain the pathways and circulation times of Atlantic Water in the surface (10-35 m depth) and in the mid-depth Atlantic layer (250-800 m depth). We thereby benefit from the unique time-dependent tagging of Atlantic Water by these two isotopes. In the surface layer, a binary mixing model yields tracer ages of Atlantic Water between 9-16 years in the Amundsen Basin, 12-17 years in the Fram Strait (East Greenland Current), and up to 20 years in the Canada Basin, reflecting the pathways of Atlantic Water through the Arctic and their exiting through the Fram Strait. In the mid-depth Atlantic layer (250-800 m), the transit time distribution (TTD) model yields mean ages in the central Arctic ranging between 15 and 55 years, while the mode ages representing the most probable ages of the TTD range between 3 and 30 years. The estimated mean ages are overall in good agreement with previous studies using artificial radionuclides or ventilation tracers. Although we find the overall flow to be dominated by advection, the shift in the mode age towards a younger age compared to the mean age also reflects the presence of a substantial amount of lateral mixing. For applications interested in how fast signals are transported into the Arctic's interior, the mode age appears to be a suitable measure. The short mode ages obtained in this study suggest that changes in the properties of Atlantic Water will quickly spread through the Arctic Ocean and can lead to relatively rapid changes throughout the upper water column in future years. © Author(s) 2021.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000466504",,"1812-0784||1812-0792",,"10.5194/os-17-111-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/466504","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Circulation timescales of Atlantic Water in the Arctic Ocean determined from anthropogenic radionuclides","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-28T21:38:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"A new multitracer approach in Oceanography: combining U-236 with conventional anthropogenic radionuclides in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans||Our common future ocean – quantifying coupled cycles of carbon, oxygen, and nutrients for determining and achieving safe operating spaces with respect to tipping points","154805||820989||154805||820989","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||EC||SNF||EC","Ambizione||H2020||Ambizione||H2020",,"85099544947",,"000611525600001","Ocean sci.","1","Ocean Science","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is also an important but not well quantified source of nitrogen to the adjacent oligotrophic subtropical gyre of the North Atlantic. Here, we use a Lagrangian modeling approach to quantify this offshore transport and investigate its timescales, reach and contribution to the fueling of productivity in the offshore regions. In our Lagrangian model, we release nearly 10 million particles off the northwestern African coast and then track all those that enter the nearshore region and upwell along the coast between 14 and 35g N. We then follow them as they are transported offshore, also tracking the biogeochemical transformations, permitting us to construct biogeochemical budgets along the offshore moving particles. The three-dimensional velocity field as well as the biogeochemical tracers and fluxes are taken from an eddy-resolving configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). Our Lagrangian model analysis reveals a very intense offshore transport of nitrogen, with about 20 %-40 % in the form of organic nitrogen. The transport varies greatly along the coast. Even though the central CanCS (21-28g N) transports the largest amount of water offshore, its offshore transport of nitrogen is somewhat smaller than that in the southern CanCS (14-21g N), primarily because of the higher nitrogen content of the upwelling waters there. Around one-third of the total offshore transport of water occurs around major capes along the CanCS. The persistent filaments associated with these capes are responsible for an up to 4-fold enhancement of the offshore transport of water and nitrogen in the first 400 km. Much of this water and nitrogen stems from upwelling at quite some distance from the capes, confirming the capes' role in collecting water from along the coast. North of Cape Blanc and within the first 500 km from the coast, water recirculation is a dominant feature of offshore transport. This process, likely associated with mesoscale eddies, tends to reduce the efficiency of offshore transport. The Canary upwelling is modeled to supply around 44 and 7 mmol N m-2 yr-1 to the North Atlantic Tropical Gyral (NATR) and the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyral East (NASE) Longhurst provinces, respectively. In the NATR, this represents nearly half (53 ± 26 %) of the estimated total new production, while in the NASE, this fraction is small (4 ± 2 %). Our results highlight the importance of the CanCS upwelling as a key source of nitrogen to the open North Atlantic and stress the need for improving the representation of EBUS in global coarse-resolution models. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Because the toxicity of As is dependent on the redox state, understanding As biogeochemistry, particularly in reducing environments, is critical to addressing the environmental risk that As poses. Sorption of As to Fe(III)-(oxyhydr)oxides is an important mechanism for As removal from solution under anoxic conditions. However, dissolved ferrous Fe (Fe(II)) also occurs under anoxic conditions, and the impact that Fe(II)-catalyzed recrystallization of crystalline Fe minerals has on As sorption mechanisms is not clear. Our research investigates the potential for non-stoichiometric magnetite, a commonly occurring mixed-valence Fe oxide in anoxic aquifers, to adsorb and/or incorporate inorganic As species during Fe(II)-catalyzed recrystallization at neutral pH, with particular focus on the impact of mineral stoichiometry (Fe(II):Fe(III) = 0.23 and 0.0) and varying Fe(II) concentrations. By following aqueous As concentrations and speciation over time coupled with As K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy, our results demonstrate that the presence of Fe(II) substantially enhanced As removal from solution. In addition, we highlight a Fe(II)-induced mechanism through which highly mobile, toxic As(III) species are oxidized on the mineral surface to form As(V). Furthermore, the presence of Fe(II) promotes the structural incorporation of As(V) into the non-stoichiometric magnetite and maghemite structures. These results highlight the potential of Fe(II)-reacted non-stoichiometric magnetite or maghemite as pathways for long-term As sequestration in anoxic environments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000445404",,"0304-3894||1873-3336","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/445404||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462785","10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123425","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/463122","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Redox cycling||Iron oxides||Fe(II)-catalyzed recrystallization||Arsenic||EXAFS spectroscopy","Ferrous iron enhances arsenic sorption and oxidation by non-stoichiometric magnetite and maghemite","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-10T02:55:13Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85088636914",,"000593833400009",,,"Journal of Hazardous Materials","402","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

SOM has numerous functional capabilities, of which the capacity to engage in reduction–oxidation reactions (or redox capacity) affects nearly all soil biogeochemical processes. How warming-induced microbial decomposition affects the redox capacity of SOM and its functional role in biogeochemical processes is largely unknown. We examined the impact of 15 years of in situ soil warming on the redox capacities of water-extractable organic matter (WEOM). Combining mediated electrochemical analysis with high-resolution mass spectrometry, we assessed the molecular basis for changes in the redox capacities of WEOM within heated (5°C above ambient) and non-heated organic and mineral temperate forest soils. Chronic soil warming significantly decreased both concentrations and inherent electron-accepting and -donating capacities of WEOM, particularly in the mineral soil. This decline was best explained by decreases in the relative abundance of aromatic and phenolic compounds, suggesting that enhanced microbial decomposition of redox-active moieties caused the decrease in redox capacity. Our findings suggest that global warming not only diminishes the size of the soil carbon reservoir but might also negatively alter the ability of SOM to participate in critical redox processes such as microbial respiration, nutrient cycling, or contaminant degradation. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,,"2328-8930",,"10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00748","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461741","en","American Chemical Society",,,,"Long-Term Warming Decreases Redox Capacity of Soil Organic Matter","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-12T14:08:05Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85097904832",,"000610994000015","Env Sci Tech Lett","1","Environmental Science & Technology Letters","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, by upscaling observations from the six largest rivers and using measured coastal erosion rates, we construct a pan-Arctic, spatio-temporally resolved estimate of the land input of carbon and nutrients to the Arctic Ocean. Using an ocean-biogeochemical model, we estimate that this input fuels 28–51% of the current annual Arctic Ocean NPP. This strong enhancement of NPP is a consequence of efficient recycling of the land-derived nutrients on the vast Arctic shelves. Our results thus suggest that nutrient input from the land is a key process that will affect the future evolution of Arctic Ocean NPP.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000462352",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-020-20470-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462352","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Element cycles||Marine biology||Marine chemistry","Around one third of current Arctic Ocean primary production sustained by rivers and coastal erosion","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-14T03:48:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach||Climate-Carbon Interactions in the Coming Century","641816||821003","10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100000780","SBFI||EC","H2020||H2020",,"85098970819",,"000626605200005","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The first setup is designed to mimic the growth dynamics of bacteria in spatially structured populations (e.g., biofilms) and can be used to study how spatial gradients in nutrient availability, created by the collective metabolic activity of a population, increase antibiotic tolerance. The second setup captures the dynamics of feast-and-famine cycles that bacteria recurrently encounter in nature, and can be used to study how phenotypic heterogeneity in growth resumption after starvation increases survival of clonal bacterial populations. In both setups, the growth rates and metabolic activity of bacteria can be measured at the single-cell level. This is useful to build a mechanistic understanding of how spatiotemporal variation in nutrient availability triggers bacteria to enter phenotypic states that increase their tolerance to antibiotics.",,,,"1064-3745||1940-6029",,"10.1007/978-1-0716-1621-5_8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528138","en","Humana",,,"Antibiotic tolerance||Antibiotic persistence||Nutrient limitation||Single-cell measurements||Microfluidics||Biofilms||Feast-and-famine dynamics||Phenotypic heterogeneity","Microfluidics for single-cell study of antibiotic tolerance and persistence induced by nutrient limitation","Book Chapter","Metadata only","Bacterial Persistence",,,"2022-01-25T06:01:11Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"A microscale analysis of the causes and consequences of the spatial arrangement of biological functions in microbial consortia","169978","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Biologie und Medizin (Abteilung III)",,,,,"Methods Mol Biol",,"Methods in Molecular Biology","2357","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, we use 8 years of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) observations from SOOP Finnmaid to study the influence of upwelling on trace gas dynamics in the Baltic Sea. Between spring and autumn, coastal upwelling transports water masses enriched with CO2 and CH4 to the surface of the Baltic Sea. We study the seasonality, regional distribution, relaxation, and interannual variability in this process. We use reanalysed wind and modelled sea surface temperature (SST) data in a newly established statistical upwelling detection method to identify major upwelling areas and time periods. Large upwelling-induced SST decrease and trace gas concentration increase are most frequently detected around August after a long period of thermal stratification, i.e. limited exchange between surface and underlying waters. We found that these upwelling events with large SST excursions shape local trace gas dynamics and often lead to near-linear relationships between increasing trace gas levels and decreasing temperature. Upwelling relaxation is mainly driven by mixing, modulated by air–sea gas exchange, and possibly primary production. Subsequent warming through air–sea heat exchange has the potential to enhance trace gas saturation. In 2015, quasi-continuous upwelling over several months led to weak summer stratification, which directly impacted the observed trace gas and SST dynamics in several upwelling-prone areas. Trend analysis is still prevented by the observed high variability, uncertainties from data coverage, and long water residence times of 10–30 years. We introduce an extrapolation method based on trace gas–SST relationships that allows us to estimate upwelling-induced trace gas fluxes in upwelling-affected regions. In general, the surface water reverses from CO2 sink to source, and CH4 outgassing is intensified as a consequence of upwelling. We conclude that SOOP data, especially when combined with other data sets, enable flux quantification and process studies addressing the process of upwelling on large spatial and temporal scales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000525376",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-18-2679-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/525376","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Upwelling-induced trace gas dynamics in the Baltic Sea inferred from 8 years of autonomous measurements on a ship of opportunity","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2022-01-13T15:44:10Z",,,,,,"no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"8","Biogeosciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Typically, observations of pCO2 at the sea surface are carried out by using research vessels and ships of opportunity, which usually do not resolve the diurnal cycle of pCO2 at a given location. This study evaluates the magnitude and driving processes of the diurnal cycle of pCO2 in a coastal region of the Baltic Sea. We present pCO2 data from July 2018 to June 2019 measured in the vicinity of the island of Utö at the outer edge of the Archipelago Sea, and quantify the relevant physical, biological, and chemical processes controlling pCO2. The highest monthly median of diurnal pCO2 variability (31 µatm) was observed in August and predominantly driven by biological processes. Biological fixation and mineralization of carbon led to sinusoidal diurnal pCO2 variations, with a maximum in the morning and a minimum in the afternoon. Compared with the biological carbon transformations, the impacts of air–sea fluxes and temperature changes on pCO2 were small, with their contributions to the monthly medians of diurnal pCO2 variability being up to 12 and 5 µatm, respectively. During upwelling events, short-term pCO2 variability (up to 500 µatm within a day) largely exceeded the usual diurnal cycle. If the net annual air–sea flux of carbon dioxide at our study site and for the sampled period is calculated based on a data subset that consists of only one regular measurement per day, the bias in the net exchange depends on the sampling time and can amount up to ±12 %. This finding highlights the importance of continuous surface pCO2 measurements at fixed locations for the assessment of the short-term variability of the carbonate system and the correct determination of air–sea CO2 fluxes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000518899",,"1812-0784||1812-0792",,"10.5194/os-17-1657-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/518899","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The diurnal cycle of pCO2 in the coastal region of the Baltic Sea","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-12-06T17:28:43Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85119996061",,"000720947200001","Ocean sci.","6","Ocean Science","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we investigate this competition using a regional physical–biogeochemical–ecological model (ROMS-BEC) configured at eddy-permitting resolution for the Southern Ocean south of 35∘ S. We improved ROMS-BEC by adding an explicit parameterization of Phaeocystis colonies so that the model, together with the previous addition of an explicit coccolithophore type, now includes all biogeochemically relevant Southern Ocean phytoplankton types. We find that Phaeocystis contribute 46±21 % (1σ in space) and 40±20 % to annual net primary production (NPP) and particulate organic carbon (POC) export south of 60∘ S, respectively, making them an important contributor to high-latitude carbon cycling. In our simulation, the relative importance of Phaeocystis and diatoms is mainly controlled by spatiotemporal variability in temperature and iron availability. In addition, in more coastal areas, such as the Ross Sea, the higher light sensitivity of Phaeocystis at low irradiances promotes the succession from Phaeocystis to diatoms. Differences in the biomass loss rates, such as aggregation or grazing by zooplankton, need to be considered to explain the simulated seasonal biomass evolution and carbon export fluxes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000495300",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-18-251-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495300","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Factors controlling the competition between Phaeocystis and diatoms in the Southern Ocean and implications for carbon export fluxes","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-07-15T11:02:35Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"SOGate: Phytoplankton ecosystem control of the Southern Ocean biogeochemical gate","153452","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,"000611015900003",,"1","Biogeosciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) measurements carried out on Ships of Opportunity (SOOP) since 2003 have proven to be a powerful tool to resolve the carbon dynamics of the blooms in space and time. However, SOOP measurements lack the possibility to directly constrain depth-integrated net community production (NCP) in moles of carbon per surface area due to their restriction to the sea surface. This study tackles the knowledge gap through (1) providing an NCP best guess for an individual cyanobacteria bloom based on repeated profiling measurements of pCO2 and (2) establishing an algorithm to accurately reconstruct depth-integrated NCP from surface pCO2 observations in combination with modelled temperature profiles.  Goal (1) was achieved by deploying state-of-the-art sensor technology from a small-scale sailing vessel. The low-cost and flexible platform enabled observations covering an entire bloom event that occurred in July–August 2018 in the Eastern Gotland Sea. For the biogeochemical interpretation, recorded pCO2 profiles were converted to C∗T , which is the dissolved inorganic carbon concentration normalised to alkalinity. We found that the investigated bloom event was dominated by Nodularia and had many biogeochemical characteristics in common with blooms in previous years. In particular, it lasted for about 3 weeks, caused a C∗T drawdown of 90 µmol kg−1, and was accompanied by a sea surface temperature increase of 10 ∘C. The novel finding of this study is the vertical extension of the C∗T drawdown up to the compensation depth located at around 12 m. Integration of the C∗T  drawdown across this depth and correction for vertical fluxes leads to an NCP best guess of ∼1.2 mol m−2 over the productive period.  Addressing goal (2), we combined modelled hydrographical profiles with surface pCO2 observations recorded by SOOP Finnmaid within the study area. Introducing the temperature penetration depth (TPD) as a new parameter to integrate SOOP observations across depth, we achieve an NCP reconstruction that agrees to the best guess within 10 %, which is considerably better than the reconstruction based on a classical mixed-layer depth constraint.  Applying the TPD approach to almost 2 decades of surface pCO2 observations available for the Baltic Sea bears the potential to provide new insights into the control and long-term trends of cyanobacteria NCP. This understanding is key for an effective design and monitoring of conservation measures aiming at a Good Environmental Status of the Baltic Sea.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505822",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-18-4889-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505822","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Cyanobacteria net community production in the Baltic Sea as inferred from profiling pCO2 measurements","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-17T04:35:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85114698536",,"000695404000001",,"17","Biogeosciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The most common release pathway to the environment investigated are domestic textile laundering, transport through and retention in municipal wastewater treatment plants and subsequent application of processed sludge onto agricultural fields as soil amendment. A less-studied but potentially equally relevant source is releases further upstream in the textile production chain such as industrial wastewater effluents from textile processing mills. In this context, industrial wastewater from a typical textile wet-processing mill in China was sampled to estimate MPF release. Effluent was sampled and MPF fibre number and length were quantified by stereomicroscope. An average of 361.6 ± 24.5 MPFs L−1 was identified in the mill effluent. MPF length was highly variable, yet 92 % of all fibres were shorter than 1000 µm. Additionally, the sampling strategy was used to identify the optimal volume necessary to adequately subsample the effluent. We found that total fibre counts were linearly correlated with sample volumes between 1 and 10 L, but a sampling volume of 5 L is suggested for good reproducibility, low standard deviation and ease of working volume. The significant abundance of MPFs in the industrial wastewater effluent emphasises that not only should attention be placed on domestic releases, but the production stage of textiles can also be responsible for MPF pollution. The ability to target and treat industrial effluents may significantly reduce a potentially major point source.",,,,"1448-2517||1449-8979",,"10.1071/EN20143","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505666","en","CSIRO Publishing",,,"industrial wastewater||microfibres||microplastic||microplastic fibres||microplastic fibres release||microplastic pollution||textile wet processing||wastewater treatment","Microplastic fibre releases from industrial wastewater effluent: a textile wet-processing mill in China","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-09-16T02:42:54Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"The path of microplastics to the environment: fate and transport in waste water treatment systems||Synthesis and utility of metal-doped plastic particles and fibers: from analytical standardization to systematic understanding of fate in the environment (SUrPASS)","168105||186856||168105||186856","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","Ambizione||Eccellenza||Ambizione||Eccellenza",,"85099536718",,,,"3","Environmental Chemistry","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here, we use an ensemble of species distribution models for a total of 336 phytoplankton and 524 zooplankton species to determine their present and future habitat suitability patterns. For the end of this century, under a high emission scenario, we find an overall increase in plankton species richness driven by ocean warming, and a poleward shift of the species’ distributions at a median speed of 35 km/decade. Phytoplankton species richness is projected to increase by more than 16% over most regions except for the Arctic Ocean. In contrast, zooplankton richness is projected to slightly decline in the tropics, but to increase strongly in temperate to subpolar latitudes. In these latitudes, nearly 40% of the phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages are replaced by poleward shifting species. This implies that climate change threatens the contribution of plankton communities to plankton-mediated ecosystem services such as biological carbon sequestration.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000505048",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-021-25385-x","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/505048","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Major restructuring of marine plankton assemblages under global warming","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-09-10T03:32:04Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85114121104",,"000692406100008","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As a consequence, a broad spectrum of pesticides is found in surface waters. Together with their transformation products (TP), they can elicit adverse effects on aquatic organisms. Threats due to pesticide contamination to aquatic organisms is an especially concerning issue in tropical regions in Low- and Middle-Income Countries. These countries represent the most intensively used agricultural areas of the world and heavy rainfalls are expected to favor the transport of pesticides from the fields into surface water. Additionally, owing to the low level of economic development, environmental monitoring, risk assessment and implementation of risk mitigation strategies receive little attention. One country illustrating this situation is Costa Rica. This thesis set out to 1) monitor agricultural-driven pesticide pollution in tropical Costa Rican streams in order to describe the occurrence, concentrations and distribution of pesticides and pesticide transformation products (PPTP); 2) assess the risks by these PPTP to aquatic biota; and 3) identify relevant pathways of PPTP-transport from the field into the streams as a basis to propose mitigation options to reduce pesticide inputs. 1) The Tapezco river catchment was selected as study site. It is an area with intensive agriculture, characterized by horticultural fields cultivated partially on steep slopes, to grow a variety of different crops. This catchment is located in the central highland plateau in the province of Alajuela and an essential production area for vegetables. Five sites were sampled over a period of two and a half months in 2015 and eight were sampled over a period of four and a half months in 2016. For obtaining PPTP concentration data, three passive samplers were employed. Two were well-known sorbent-based passive samplers, namely styrene-divinylebenzene reverse phase sulfonated (SDB) disks and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheets, yielding biweekly time-integrated averaged concentrations. The third passive sampler was a water level proportional sampling system (WLPSS), yielding biweekly water level-weighted concentrations. After collecting the samplers in the fields, they were extracted in the laboratory. The SDB disk and the WLPSS water sample extracts were analyzed via high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and screened for 258 polar and semi-polar PPTP, including herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and some of their TP. The PDMS sheet extracts were analyzed for 18 non-polar insecticides via atmospheric pressure chemical ionization gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. With the SDB disks and the WLPSS, a broad PPTP spectrum was detected throughout the catchment. Despite the different sampling principles, the majority of the PPTP were detected with both sampler types,chemicals that had the highest median water concentrations were identified as such with both the SDB disks and the WLPSS. However, for seven of the pesticides, the concentrations determined with the WLPSS exceeded those of the SDB disks. This finding points to the WLPSS to collect pesticide peaks during heavy rainfall events, linked with water level rises, in a more pronounced fashion than the SDB disks. However, the majority of the WLPSS samplers employed did not sample in the optimal range, i.e. they were completely filled prior to sample collection, calling for a need to further optimize sampler operation. The PDMS approach allowed detection of additional, non-polar pesticides. Based on the reliability and the high share of retrieved samples, chemical concentrations determined from extracts of the SDB disks and PDMS sheets were further processed as measured environmental concentrations (MEC) for a risk assessment. 2) Two MEC-based approaches were used for risk assessment, allowing for identification of risks for both single PPTP as well as PPTP mixtures. The first approach compares the MEC to chemical-specific Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) for primary producers, invertebrates and vertebrates while the second uses the MEC to calculate so-called Toxic Units (TU),focusing on the chemicals’ toxicity to invertebrates. Three indices that rely on macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance in the streams were additionally applied to investigate the state of water quality: the Species at Risk (SPEARpesticide), the Costa Rican Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP-CR) and the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Tricoptera (EPT)-taxa richness indices. With the EQS and the TU approaches, the quality of the water was indicated as poor at all sites and sampling periods and only few of the PPTP explained the overall risk. Invertebrates were the most affected, without any time window to recover from pesticide stress. The SPEARpesticide, BMWP-CR and the EPT indices indicated that, despite the continuous pesticide pollution stress, the water quality appeared to improve at the most downstream sites, which maybe due to a large river stretch upstream with a high share of natural forest. 3) To identify potential risk mitigation measures, an analysis of the most important pathways for PPTP transport from the fields into the streams was performed within the Tapezco river catchment. Analysis focused on the pesticides that dominated the aquatic biota health risks in addition to three of their TP and three pesticides with high application rates. The first pathway encompassed direct inputs via handling at four headwater sub-catchments, identified by concentration peaks unrelated to water level increases. Such direct inputs were indicated for several pesticides. The second type of pesticide transport was related to surface run-off, leading to concentrations being positively correlated with water level increases and potentially influenced by hydrological and topographical variables. Linear regression modelling with data from all eight sampling sites revealed that for a selection of insecticides (particularly for acephate, cyhalothrin, and thiamethoxam) the flux increased at sites with fields with high average slopes while for other PPTP (2,6 dichlorbenzamide, boscalid, carbofuran, diazinon,diuron TP, linuron and prometryn + terbutryn) flux decreased in areas with a high share of forested buffer zones. These trends, however, did not hold true for all pesticides. Different input patterns were, e.g. observed for the fungicide carbendazim. The third pathway of PPTP transport considered was via exfiltration of contaminated groundwater through the river bank,which was likely to lead to constant inputs, showing an inverse relationship with water levels due to dilution. Such inputs were principally possible for several PPTP based on their detection in groundwater samples, even though their contribution would be expected to be much lower,compared to the other pathways. Though the data set was limited and more research would be needed to more precisely delineate the input pathways, several mitigation strategies could be proposed: offering workshops about improved pesticide handling; avoid cultivation of those crops that demand high use of herbicides and insecticides on fields with steep slopes; and installation of stream buffer zones with natural forest.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000510188",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/510188","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry||Gas chromatography||Pyrethroids||Passive sampling||Environmental quality||EPT taxa||SPEAR||tropics","Pesticides in a tropical Costa Rican stream catchment: from monitoring and risk assessment to the identification of possible mitigation options","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-10-16T18:38:39Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"27434",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This is partly due to a disconnect that occurs when these factors or processes are elucidated in simplified experimental systems and then applied to predict ENM behavior in significantly more complex real-world systems. To aid the translation of findings between these two extremes, we have outlined and demonstrated the use of a Framework for Relevance And Methods Evaluation (FRAME) based on three components or pillars that collectively define the “environmental realism” of a given experimental design. The three pillars include (1) the properties of the ENMs, (2) the experimental conditions, and (3) the exposure scenario and endpoints that are assessed. FRAME provides researchers with an approach for assessing the environmental relevance of alternative experimental designs. It also provides a basis for reporting how an individual study fits within the broader body of scientific knowledge and for identifying areas where additional research is needed. The proposed framework is intended to be used throughout the scientific process, from the initial conception of the experimental design and continuing through to the interpretation of experimental results. Committing to a more complete assessment of environmental realism has the potential to prevent the overgeneralization of results determined in simplified experimental systems and move the field forward more quickly through the identification of critical knowledge gaps.  © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021",,,,"2051-8153||2051-8161",,"10.1039/d1en00162k","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/500196","en","Royal Society of Chemistry",,,,"What is ""Environmentally Relevant""?

A common approach to estimate this net flux of CO2 across the air–sea interface is the use of surface ocean CO2 observations and the computation of the flux through a bulk parameterization approach. Yet, the details for how this is done in order to arrive at a global ocean CO2 uptake estimate vary greatly, enhancing the spread of estimates. Here we introduce the ensemble data product, SeaFlux (Gregor and Fay, 2021, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5482547, https://github.com/luke-gregor/pySeaFlux, last access: 9 September 2021); this resource enables users to harmonize an ensemble of products that interpolate surface ocean CO2 observations to near-global coverage with a common methodology to fill in missing areas in the products. Further, the dataset provides the inputs to calculate fluxes in a consistent manner. Utilizing six global observation-based mapping products (CMEMS-FFNN, CSIR-ML6, JENA-MLS, JMA-MLR, MPI-SOMFFN, NIES-FNN), the SeaFlux ensemble approach adjusts for methodological inconsistencies in flux calculations. We address differences in spatial coverage of the surface ocean CO2 between the mapping products, which ultimately yields an increase in CO2 uptake of up to 17 % for some products. Fluxes are calculated using three wind products (CCMPv2, ERA5, and JRA55). Application of a scaled gas exchange coefficient has a greater impact on the resulting flux than solely the choice of wind product. With these adjustments, we present an ensemble of global surface ocean pCO2 and air–sea carbon flux estimates. This work aims to support the community effort to perform model–data intercomparisons which will help to identify missing fluxes as we strive to close the global carbon budget.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000511976",,"1866-3516||1866-3508",,"10.5194/essd-13-4693-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/511976","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"SeaFlux: harmonization of air–sea CO2 fluxes from surface pCO2 data products using a standardized approach","Review Article","Open access",,,,"2021-10-27T03:16:30Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85117376299",,"000709204100001","Earth syst. sci. data","10","Earth System Science Data","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Because INPs and INMs have spatial and temporal heterogeneity in source, number, and composition, predicting their concentration and distribution is a challenge requiring apt analytical instrumentation. Here, we present the development of our drop Freezing Ice Nuclei Counter (FINC) for the estimation of INP and INM concentrations in the immersion freezing mode. FINC's design builds upon previous droplet freezing techniques (DFTs) and uses an ethanol bath to cool sample aliquots while detecting freezing using a camera. Specifically, FINC uses 288 sample wells of 5–60 µL volume, has a limit of detection of −25.4 ± 0.2 ∘C with 5 µL, and has an instrument temperature uncertainty of ± 0.5 ∘C. We further conducted freezing control experiments to quantify the nonhomogeneous behavior of our developed DFT, including the consideration of eight different sources of contamination.  As part of the validation of FINC, an intercomparison campaign was conducted using an NX-illite suspension and an ambient aerosol sample from two other drop freezing instruments: ETH's DRoplet Ice Nuclei Counter Zurich (DRINCZ) and the University of Basel's LED-based Ice Nucleation Detection Apparatus (LINDA). We also tabulated an exhaustive list of peer-reviewed DFTs, to which we added our characterized and validated FINC.  In addition, we propose herein the use of a water-soluble biopolymer, lignin, as a suitable ice-nucleating standard. An ideal INM standard should be inexpensive, accessible, reproducible, unaffected by sample preparation, and consistent across techniques. First, we compared lignin's freezing temperature across different drop freezing instruments, including on DRINCZ and LINDA, and then determined an empirical fit parameter for future drop freezing validations. Subsequently, we showed that commercial lignin has consistent ice-nucleating activity across product batches and demonstrated that the ice-nucleating ability of aqueous lignin solutions is stable over time. With these findings, we present lignin as a good immersion freezing standard for future DFT intercomparisons in the research field of atmospheric ice nucleation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000484246",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-14-3131-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/484246","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Development of the drop Freezing Ice Nuclei Counter (FINC), intercomparison of droplet freezing techniques, and use of soluble lignin as an atmospheric ice nucleation standard","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-05-17T02:43:26Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,"Organic aerosols’ impact on aerosol-cloud interactions in mixed-phase clouds","179703","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,"85105192734",,"000646430800003","Atmos. meas. tech.","4","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While the threats posed by these long-term changes to marine organisms and ecosystems are well recognized, only more recently has the community realized that these threats might be much more imminent owing to extreme events. This is the result of these extremes exposing vulnerable ecosystems already today to conditions that lie in the far future when considering only the changes in the mean conditions. Of particular concern are so-called compound events, i.e., conditions when both temperatures are extremely hot and the saturation states extremely low, as this compounding might be particularly threatening for marine ecosystems, especially for warm water coral reefs.  Here we use satellite records of sea surface temperature (SST) and satellite ΩAR to map globally the occurrence of marine heat waves (MHW) and low saturation state extreme events and their compounding for the period 1985 and 2018. We use SSTs from the OSTIA product, while we take ΩAR from the newly developed OceanSODA-ETHZ (monthly 1°x1°) observation-based product that extrapolates ship observations with satellite data. Our study focuses on the Pacific Ocean between 25°S and 25°N, a region with more than 1000 identified coral reefs. We define extremes using the approach of Hobday et al. (2018) with a fixed baseline determined from the entire record (1985-2018) and where extremes are below/above the 10th/90th percentiles for Ω/SST respectively.  The majority of the compound extreme events (too hot and too low saturation state) occur in the western tropical Pacific, with 757 of the 1206 reefs in the Pacific experiencing at least three months of compound extreme events over the entire period. The average duration of these compound extremes was 3.6 months, and the average area was 247 600 km2 (roughly the size of the United Kingdom). The compound events had an average intensity of –0.13 for ΩAR and 0.71°C, where the intensity is the anomaly from the climatology. The largest and longest lasting extreme event started in 2016 and lasted nearly three years, coinciding with the El Niño event over the same period, covering an area equivalent to Australia. These findings suggest that more than 60% of coral reefs in the Pacific Ocean are located in regions where heating events may have been compounded by decreased potential for calcification. Given the continuing increase in atmospheric CO2, the severity of this type of compound events is bound to increase in the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528061",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-15096","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528061","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The growing exposure of Pacific coral reefs to compound extremes caused by marine heatwaves coalescing with low saturation state extremes","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2022-01-24T16:57:47Z",,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19-30, 2021","Online",,"Our common future ocean – quantifying coupled cycles of carbon, oxygen, and nutrients for determining and achieving safe operating spaces with respect to tipping points","820989","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the most recent global and observation-based estimate of the accumulation of Cant in the ocean interior by Gruber et al. (2019) does not extend beyond 2007, preventing an independent assessment of this increase in the magnitude of the sink.  Here, we exploit about 50,000 additional observations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and other relevant biogeochemical parameters, to extend the Gruber et al. analysis based on the eMLR(C*) method to the 2010s. These data were collected from all major ocean basins over the past decade by GO-SHIP and associated programs, and assembled through GLODAPv2.2020 into an internally consistent data product. We refine the eMLR(C*) method in three ways to achieve the updated storage estimates: (1) the uncertainty assessment is improved, based on a coupled analysis of observations and synthetic data generated from an ocean biogeochemical model, (2) the robustness of the multiple linear regression models is increased, using more stringent predictor and model selection procedures, and (3) the mapping of the Cant fields relies on a MLR ensemble approach that takes into account co-occurring temporal changes of the predictor variables salinity, temperature and oxygen.   Initial results show that the ocean has continued to act as a strong Cant sink with an average uptake rate of 2.8 ± 0.3 Pg C yr-1 between the reference years 2007 and 2015. This represents a small increase in rate compared to 2.6 ± 0.3 Pg C yr-1 determined for the 1994 through 2007 period. This increase is slightly smaller than expected on the basis of the growth of atmospheric CO2 over the period, but associated uncertainties are too large to make a conclusive statement about whether the ocean carbon sink is slowing down. Initial analyses of the synthetic data indicate that variable ocean circulation and limited sampling, especially the small number of cruises in the Indian Ocean, represent the biggest sources of uncertainty for the eMLR(C*)-based estimate. However, our preliminary sink estimate is in good agreement with recent air-sea CO2 flux-based uptake estimates, based on an ensemble of surface pCO2 interpolation techniques once these fluxes are adjusted for the river carbon input driven outgassing of natural CO2.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528076",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-10161","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528076","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The continued accumulation of anthropogenic carbon in the global ocean during the 2010s","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2022-01-24T17:38:54Z",,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19-30, 2021","Online",,"Climate-Carbon Interactions in the Coming Century","821003","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Lake Lovojärvi is a eutrophic lake in southern Finland with bottom water CH4 concentrations up to 2 mM. However, the surface water concentration, and thus the diffusive emission potential, was low (< 0.5 µM). We studied the biogeochemical processes involved in CH4 removal by chemical profiling and through incubation experiments. δ13C-CH4 profiling of the water column revealed a methane-oxidation hotspot just below the oxycline and zones of CH4 oxidation within the anoxic water column. In incubation experiments involving the addition of light and/or oxygen, CH4 oxidation rates in the anoxic hypolimnion were enhanced 3-fold, suggesting a major role for photosynthetically fueled aerobic CH4 oxidation. We observed a distinct peak in CH4 concentration at the chlorophyll-a maximum, caused by either in situ CH4 production or other CH4 inputs such as lateral transport from the littoral zone. In the dark anoxic water column at 7 m depth, nitrite seemed to be the key electron acceptor involved in CH4 oxidation, yet additions of Fe(III), anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate and humic substances also stimulated anoxic CH4 oxidation. Surprisingly, nitrite seemed to inhibit CH4 oxidation at all other depths. Overall, this study shows that photosynthetically fueled CH4 oxidation can be a key process in CH4 removal in the water column of humic, turbid lakes, thereby limiting diffusive CH4 emissions from boreal lakes. Yet, it also highlights the potential importance of a whole suite of alternative electron acceptors, including humics, in these freshwater environments in the absence of light and oxygen.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000488121",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-18-3087-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/488121","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Methane oxidation in the waters of a humic-rich boreal lake stimulated by photosynthesis, nitrite, Fe(III) and humics","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-06-03T00:27:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85106439772",,"000654907700004",,"10","Biogeosciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This response is heterogeneous in space and its spatial distribution is primarily influenced by lake bathymetry and latitude. Such heterogeneity is not captured by one-dimensional water temperature models, which can accurately predict only the average LSWT. We performed a spatially distributed application of the hybrid physically based/data-driven model air2water to predict the LSWT variability in the 5 Laurentian Great Lakes and to deepen our understanding of the role of local depth and latitude in shaping this heterogeneous response. Daily remotely sensed LSWT data were used to calibrate and validate the model during 1995–2018, and additional simulations considering a synthetic warmer climate scenario in which air temperature was increased by 2 °C were run to assess the inter- and intra-lake differences in LSWT warming rates. The model reproduces the observed spatial distribution of LSWT with an average root mean squared error of 1.2 °C and suggests that, under the warmer scenario, the LSWT of the 5 lakes could increase heterogeneously, with the deepest zones showing the maximum warming rates. Summer stratification lengthening is expected to increase with higher local depth; this behaviour attenuates with increasing latitude, whereas the LSWT warming is essentially dependent on the local depth, irrespective of latitude. We highlight the importance of accounting for LSWT spatial heterogeneity to adequately assess the thermal response of the Great Lakes to a warming climate.",,,,"2044-205X||2044-2041",,"10.1080/20442041.2021.1873698","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/495115","en","Taylor & Francis",,,"air2water||climate change||lake surface water temperature||limnology||reanalysis||remote sensing","On the role of local depth and latitude on surface warming heterogeneity in the Laurentian Great Lakes","Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-07-15T10:46:45Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,"000635396300001",,"2","Inland Waters","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Soil mineralogy and soil P forms from six sites along the climatic gradient were analyzed with bulk (X-ray diffraction and P K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure) and microscale (X-ray fluorescence, P K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure, and Raman) analysis methods. In the wettest soils, apatite grains ranging from 5 to 30 µm in size were co-located at the micro-scale with quartz, a known continental dust indicator suggesting recent atmospheric deposition. In addition to co-location with quartz, further evidence of dust-derived P included backward trajectory modeling indicating that dust particles could be brought to Hawaii from the major global dust-loading areas in central Asia and northern Africa. Although it is not certain whether the individual observed apatite grains were derived from long-distance transport of dust, or from local dust sources such as volcanic ash or windblown fertilizer, these observations offer direct evidence that P-containing minerals have reached surface layers of highly-weathered grassland soils through atmospheric deposition.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438668",,"0016-7061||1872-6259",,"10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114681","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438668","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Phosphorus transformations||Soil development||Aeolian dust inputs||P K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy||micro-Raman spectroscopy","Microspectroscopy reveals dust-derived apatite grains in acidic, highly-weathered Hawaiian soils","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-04T20:23:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85089832577",,"000582381600020","Geoderma",,"Geoderma","381","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Floating plant coverage correlates with expanding urban land cover in catchments, implicating urban nutrient sources as plausible drivers. Floating vegetation invasions have undeniable societal costs, but also provide benefits. Water hyacinths efficiently absorb nutrients from eutrophic waters, mitigating nutrient pollution problems.

It is well-known for its huge reservoir of dissolved carbon dioxide and methane in the permanently stratified deep waters. The reason for this unusual gas reservoir is the intrusion of warm, saline, gas-rich and dense groundwater into the deep water of Lake Kivu. Besides providing carbon dioxide, the deep inflow of dense groundwater also maintains a strong density stratification, which prevents turbulent mixing. Consequently, the diffusive upward transport of carbon dioxide and methane, which is at least partially of biogenic origin, is very weak. For the surrounding population and their countries, the gas reservoir is a potential risk and a natural resource at the same time. Although the gases in the lake are currently still far away from saturation (below 55 %), an extreme mixing event could potentially bring deep water to the surface, where it would outgas and asphyxiate animals and humans in the surroundings. In contrast to the potential risk, the methane in Lake Kivu also represents a valuable energy resource for both Rwanda and the DRC. In 2003, gas measurements indicated an increase of methane concentrations in the deep water of Lake Kivu by around 15 % within 30 years. This is a very fast increase for a lake whose deep water has a residence time of 800 – 1000 years, and therefore, these concerning findings greatly influenced the topics of this dissertation. Firstly, in spite of the increase in methane concen-trations, there had been a lack of reliable gas measurements since 2003. Secondly, the one-dimensional lake model, which had previously been used to assess changes in gas concen-trations and stratification, largely relied on a steady-state assumption. The model was therefore not adequate for the long-term transient simulation of scenarios with fast changing methane concentrations due to natural increase or large-scale gas extraction.  In the first part of this dissertation, we developed a measurement system for dissolved gases in Lake Kivu, involving a mobile mass spectrometer, which is designed to prevent gas loss during the sampling process. We successfully used the measurement system to assess carbon dioxide and methane concentrations in Lake Kivu as part of an intercomparison study with two other research groups. The results of this study indicate that methane concentrations have been close to a steady-state since at least 1974 and thus suggest that there is no increasing risk of a spontaneous gas eruption. In addition to measuring carbon dioxide and methane, we adjusted an existing measurement technique for dissolved noble gases to collect gas samples in the gas-rich waters of Lake Kivu. The analysis of these measurements shows that atmospheric noble gases neon and krypton, and the light argon isotope 36Ar are depleted by 50 – 70 % in the stratified deep waters. We argue that this depletion is most probably not caused by ebullition from the lake, but rather by the inflow of noble gas depleted groundwater. Furthermore, elevated noble gas ratios 3He/4He and 40Ar/36Ar corroborate the influence of magmatic gases on Lake Kivu. In the second part of the dissertation, we developed and calibrated a one-dimensional lake model for Lake Kivu. In contrast to the previous model, the new model dynamically calculates mixing and the stratification depth of inflowing groundwater. It is therefore appropriate for the simulation of a changing lake over much longer timescales than before. The main finding of our simulation results is the fact that the currently observed density stratification and gas profiles are compatible with a simulation, which is initiated with a completely homogeneous and gas-free lake around 2000 years ago. This result confirms that the groundwater sources are the main driver of today’s stratification and gas profiles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000470628",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/470628","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Lake Kivu||Lake modelling||Gas measurements||Noble gases","Managing Lake Kivu: moving from a steady-state to a dynamic modelling approach","Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-02-19T17:19:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,"27276",,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

There is increasing evidence for the important role of riparian wetlands in the transformation and emission of terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere. The considerable spatial heterogeneity of river deltas, however, forms a major obstacle for quantifying carbon emissions and their seasonality. The water chemistry in the river reaches is defined by the upstream catchment, whereas delta lakes and channels are dominated by local processes such as aquatic primary production, respiration or lateral exchange with the wetlands. In order to quantify carbon turnover and emissions in the complex mosaic of the Danube Delta, we conducted monthly field campaigns over 2 years at 19 sites spanning river reaches, channels and lakes. Here we report on the greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2 and CH4) from the freshwater systems of the Danube Delta and present the first seasonally resolved estimates of its freshwater carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Furthermore, we quantify the lateral carbon transport of the Danube River to the Black Sea.  We estimate the delta's CO2 and CH4 emissions to be 65 GgC yr−1 (30–120 GgC yr−1, a range calculated using 25 to 75 percentiles of observed fluxes), of which about 8 % are released as CH4. The median CO2 fluxes from river branches, channels and lakes are 25, 93 and 5.8 mmol m−2 d−1, respectively. Median total CH4 fluxes amount to 0.42, 2.0 and 1.5 mmol m−2 d−1. While lakes do have the potential to act as CO2 sinks in summer, they are generally the largest emitters of CH4. Small channels showed the largest range in emissions, including a CO2 and CH4 hot spot sustained by adjacent wetlands. Thereby, the channels contribute disproportionately to the delta's emissions, considering their limited surface area. In terms of lateral export, we estimate the net total export (the sum of dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC, dissolved organic carbon, DOC, and particulate organic carbon, POC) from the Danube Delta to the Black Sea to be about 160 ± 280 GgC yr−1, which only marginally increases the carbon load from the upstream river catchment (8490 ± 240 GgC yr−1) by about 2 %. While this contribution from the delta seems small, deltaic carbon yield (45.6 gC m−2 yr−1; net export load/surface area) is about 4 times higher than the riverine carbon yield from the catchment (10.6 gC m−2 yr−1).","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000474224",,"1726-4170||1726-4170",,"10.5194/bg-18-1417-2021","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/474224","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Spatio-temporal variations in lateral and atmospheric carbon fluxes from the Danube Delta","Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-03-13T04:32:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,"85101504074",,"000624347100002",,"4","Biogeosciences","18","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Often, mineral transformation studies employ slurries or coatings on inert materials, but transformation is rarely studied in soils due to experimental challenges. Here, we introduced synthetic ferrihydrite to soil microcosms in permeable polyethylene terephthalate fabric sachets (sachet dimension approximately 30 mm  12 mm  3 mm with 52 µm pore size). The microcosms contained five contrasting rice paddy soils from Bangladesh, China and Thailand, which were flooded to simulate conditions at the start of a rice growing season. Mineral transformations and pore water chemistry were measured after one, two, six and twelve weeks. The mineral composition inside the sachets was measured using X-ray diffraction (bulk, all time points) and micro-Raman spectroscopy (micrometre scale resolution, two weeks only). Bulk analysis showed that lepidocrocite and goethite gradually replaced ferrihydrite in the sachets that were buried in redox-active soils. The transformation rate of ferrihydrite and the product composition varied between soils and within sachets, reflecting variations in concentrations of key species in pore water. Higher Fe2+ and SO42- concentrations in solution were not only associated with faster bulk transformation rates, but also higher bulk ratios of lepidocrocite to goethite. At the sub-millimetre scale, transformation rates were different to bulk transformation rates, as observed in the colour distribution (Figure 1) and micro-Raman spectroscopy maps across mineral sachet cross-sections. Ferrihydrite was observed at the soil-mineral interface, suggesting that chemical species in the porewater inhibited transformation of the outer mineral layer. Ferrihydrite was also observed in the interior, where Fe2+ was less able to diffuse from the soil. At the micrometre scale, transformed regions were made up of inhomogeneous clusters of ferrihydrite, goethite and lepidocrocite. The distribution of minerals in the sachets demonstrates that local environmental conditions and global soil properties have measurable impacts on the rate and pathway of ferrihydrite transformation.

Still, an increasing number of smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries are using expensive pesticide products to increase their yield. Due to their low socio-economic status and educational level, smallholder farmers are particularly vulnerable to the negative impacts of yield losses, but also of those from pesticides. When confronted with pests, smallholder farmers develop a need for information and seek out appropriate sources. However, little is known about how smallholders go about this process, whether this process differs for organic and conventional pest management strategies and if farmers also focus on risks of pest management practices. Agro-input dealer are supposed to provide information on pesticide risks, but they often focus more on selling products than services. There is a knowledge gap in literature on how agro-input dealers give advice, what products they sell, whether they follow laws and recommendations on best practice, and whether their practices and shop organization prevent pesticide risk situations. This in turn leads to farmers not knowing about risks, or not considering them to be relevant. While farmers have been assessed regarding their pesticide knowledge, attitudes and practices, rarely these insights are compared across contexts, identifying differences and commonalities. This, together with a lack in pesticide training, results in farmers not always following good agricultural practices, thereby affecting their own health, their communities’ and ecosystems. These issues are not resolved in disciplinary silos, but only through cross-sectoral and participatory research and interventions. This idea of a transdisciplinary, border-crossing research project named ‘Comparative appraisal of pesticide use in tropical settings: exposure pathways, health effects and institutional determinants’ laid the foundation for this dissertation.  The two study sites of the above research project were a market-oriented farming system in Zarcero County, Costa Rica and a subsistence-based farming system in Wakiso District, Uganda. In two cross-sectional surveys, this dissertation complemented a pesticide exposure and health assessment of farmers in both countries (Costa Rica in 2016, n=300 and Uganda in 2017, n =302), enrolling both farmers applying synthetic pesticides and such who follow other pest management practices. We found the majority of pesticides used in both case studies to be classified as highly hazardous by the World Health Organization. While a high awareness of negative health effects was identified, the use of personal protective equipment was rare, and hygiene and other safe use practices were not adopted by all farmers. Organic farmers were more likely to have been trained on safe pesticide use practices compared to users of synthetic pesticides. Pesticide use did not appear to drive household income.  In a qualitative study in parallel to the cross-sectional survey in Uganda, we investigated pest-management information behavior from the perspective of smallholder farmers. Using an ethnographic approach, we conducted 46 semi-structured interviews and 15 on-farm observations in Wakiso District in 2017. The results indicated that farmers develop information needs when adopting new farming practices, or when presented with disruptive information (e.g. when new pests emerged), prompting farmers to seek information actively or be attentive to receiving information passively. Whether farmers used the new information depended on successful trial of the new pest management strategy, and on the credibility of the source. Furthermore, our results suggested that sources of information for conventional pesticides were well integrated into farmers’ daily lives, whereas information on organic strategies was provided through external sources (e.g. NGOs), but was not available at all times.  To share the above results with the respective stakeholders in Uganda, we conducted a participatory workshop using the design thinking method. While assessing the knowledge gaps between academic and non-academic stakeholders, we found recommendations from non-academic stakeholders applying an inherently interdisciplinary and thus broader point of view, accounting for the roles of more different stakeholders in pesticide management, for example agro-input dealers and policy-makers. The non-academic knowledge was more ﬁne-grained and detailed, exemplifying how a knowledge integration is essential to avoid a gap between what researchers investigate and what practitioners need.  Following new insights from this workshop, we conducted an agro-input dealer study in Central and Western Uganda in 2019. We selected a mixed methods approach, using structured questionnaires and observations to study their knowledge, attitude and practices on pesticides (n=402), shop organization (n=392) and sales interaction (n=236). Actual behavior of agro-input dealers when selling pesticides was revealed through mystery shopping with local farmers buying pesticides (n=94). The findings revealed that most dealers saw advising customers as a responsibility, while only around a quarter of mystery shoppers received unsolicited advice when buying pesticides. Observations of sales interactions showed that the focus of discussion was on product choice and price, neglecting aspects of safe use. Most shops were lacking safety equipment and a quarter of shops sold repackaged products. Agro-input dealer showed limited understanding of pesticide safety labels and active ingredients. Around half the agro-input dealers held a certificate of competency, while only a minority was able to provide a government-approved up-to-date license.  In conclusion, we found that the responsibility of why pesticides are not managed, handled and applied as intended is shared throughout actor levels. Crucial information does not reach the end-user, and where it does, the appropriate tools and equipment to follow the corresponding guidelines are missing. Meanwhile, a lack of awareness from farmers as well as conflicting interests prevent agro-input dealers from providing much needed advice. We recommend to make information on safe use, as well as alternatives to pesticides more continuously available in farmers’ daily lives, by leveraging the established information channels – the agro-input dealers and agricultural extension. Professionalization of both pesticide sellers and users allows to manage the negative effects of pesticides over the entire product life cycle, from purchase, via storage and application to residual and waste management. Bridging gaps and improving coordination and collaboration between stakeholders is crucial to align practice, research and policy in their quest for reaching a transition towards sustainable agriculture.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000483119",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/483119","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Information behavior||Information seeking||Organic pest management||Pesticide||Smallholder farming||Uganda||UGANDA (EAST AFRICA).

Releases of the long-lived anthropogenic radionuclides 129I and 236U from European nuclear reprocessing plants label Atlantic Water entering the Arctic Ocean with a distinct signal that can be used to track pathways and timescales of Atlantic Water circulation in the Arctic Ocean and Fram Strait. Apart from their application as transient tracers, the difference in anthropogenic radionuclide concentrations between Atlantic- and Pacific-origin water provides an instrument to distinguish the interface between both water masses. In contrast to classically used water mass tracers such as nitrate-phosphate (N:P) ratios, the two radionuclides are considered to behave conservatively in seawater and are not affected by biogeochemical processes occurring in particular in the broad shelf regions of the Arctic Ocean.  Here we present a time-series of 129I and 236U data across the Fram Strait, collected in 2016 (as part of the GEOTRACES program) and in 2018 and 2019 (by the Norwegian Polar Institute). While the overall spatial distribution of both radionuclides was similar among the three sampling years, significant differences were observed in the upper water column of the EGC, especially between 2016 and 2018. This study is the first attempt to investigate the potential of 129I and 236U as water mass composition tracers in the East Greenland Current (EGC). We discuss how the 129I - 236U tracer pair can be applied to estimate fractions of Atlantic and Pacific Water, especially considering their time-dependent input into the Arctic Ocean.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000528054",,,,"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-8662","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/528054","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Annual variability of the long-lived anthropogenic radionuclides 129I and 236U in the Fram Strait and their use as water mass composition tracers","Other Conference Item","Open access",,,,"2022-01-24T16:37:39Z",,,,,,"yes","EGU General Assembly 2021","April 19-30, 2021","Online",,,,,,,,,,,,,"EGUsphere",,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
