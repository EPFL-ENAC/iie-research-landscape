This uncertainty is partly due to a lack of observations in the pre-satellite era, making the observations we do have before 1990 additionally valuable. Aerosols suspended in the atmosphere scatter and absorb incoming solar radiation and thereby alter the Earth's surface energy balance. Previous studies show that Earth system models (ESMs) do not adequately represent surface energy fluxes over the historical era. We investigated global and regional aerosol effects over the time period 1961-2014 by looking at surface downwelling shortwave radiation (SDSR). We used observations from ground stations as well as multiple experiments from eight ESMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Version 6 (CMIP6). Our results show that this subset of models reproduces the observed transient SDSR well in Europe but poorly in China. We suggest that this may be attributed to missing emissions of sulfur dioxide in China, sulfur dioxide being a precursor to sulfate, which is a highly reflective aerosol and responsible for more reflective clouds. The emissions of sulfur dioxide used in the models do not show a temporal pattern that could explain observed SDSR evolution over China. The results from various aerosol emission perturbation experiments from DAMIP, RFMIP and AerChemMIP show that only simulations containing anthropogenic aerosol emissions show dimming, even if the dimming is underestimated. Simulated clear-sky and all-sky SDSR do not differ greatly, suggesting that cloud cover changes are not a dominant cause of the biased SDSR evolution in the simulations. Therefore we suggest that the discrepancy between modeled and observed SDSR evolution is partly caused by erroneous aerosol and aerosol precursor emission inventories. This is an important finding as it may help interpret whether ESMs reproduce the historical climate evolution for the right or wrong reason. © Author(s) 2020.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000458832",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-16023-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458832","en","European Geosciences Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Bias in CMIP6 models as compared to observed regional dimming and brightening",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-03T03:34:59Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: causes of decadal changes of solar radiation","188601","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85098106500",,,"000602759100004","Atmos. chem. phys.","24","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using a droplet–freezing approach to assess immersion freezing–ice nucleating (IN) activity, we investigate the effects of simulated atmospheric processing on IN ability in aqueous suspensions for SPPs exposed to (A) light arising from artificial solar radiation and 310 nm UV radiation, (B) acidic water conditions, and (C) oxidation by hydrogen peroxide and a hydroxyl radical. The most studied IN–active SPP, gray alder, loses IN activity upon exposure to all processing modes, with less active IN sites more deactivated relative to their more active counterparts. The two other investigated SPPs, silver birch and red mulberry, are less responsive to atmospheric aging. The most significant impact arose from simulated solar radiation, where a 24 h exposure lowered the IN-activation temperature of gray alder SPPs by up to 5 °C. Similar changes observed after 4 h of exposure to 310 nm light indicate that UV radiation is the most important aging pathway for active-site deactivation. Additionally, we found that water acidity (pH 4–3) negatively impacts the IN activity of all SPPs. Oxidation induced by hydrogen peroxide at high concentrations of 10–500 mM reduced IN activity, consistent with chemical processing altering a specific active-site configuration. Changes in IN activity via aqueous OH radical oxidation were not observable above the effects arising from hydrogen peroxide when present as the OH precursor. Overall, these results imply that the role SPPs play in cloud ice formation may be reduced with longer atmospheric processing times.",,,,"2472-3452",,"10.1021/acsearthspacechem.0c00218","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/462636","en","American Chemical Society",,,"primary biological aerosol particles||Subpollen particles||Ice nucleation||atmospheric aging||Photochemical aging","Ice Nucleation Ability of Tree Pollen Altered by Atmospheric Processing",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2021-01-14T14:33:02Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097881715",,,"000607072700010","ACS earth space chem.","12","ACS Earth and Space Chemistry","4","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Using hurricane tracking, aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, and meteorological analyses, we analyze the interaction of the SAL with 52 named TCs that formed over the east and central Atlantic south of the Cape Verde islands between 2004 and 2017. Following the categorization of negative SAL influences on TC intensification by Dunion and Velden, only 21% of the investigated storms can be classified (28% of all storms that encountered the SAL), and 21% of the storms continue to intensify despite the presence of the SAL. We show that among TCs that encounter the SAL, there is evidence supporting a weak negative correlation between the magnitude of TC intensification and the ambient AOD. However, above-average Saharan dust abundance in the vicinity of TCs is not a good independent indicator for storm nonintensification. To better understand the specific processes involved, a composite study is carried out, contrasting storms that intensify in the presence of the SAL against those that do not. We find that sheared air masses on the north side and drier air from the northeast of the storm early on during its lifetime, in addition to higher AOD, are associated with TC nonintensification in proximity to the SAL. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,,,"0894-8755||1520-0442",,"10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0854.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458485","en","American Meteorological Society",,,"Tropics||Wind shear||Dust or dust storms||Tropical cyclones||Humidity","When Does the Saharan Air Layer Impede the Intensification of Tropical Cyclones?",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-12-24T03:40:45Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097783080",,,"000615175200014","J. climate","24","Journal of Climate","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This evidence includes feedback process understanding, the historical climate record, and the paleoclimate record. An S value lower than 2 K is difficult to reconcile with any of the three lines of evidence. The amount of cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum provides strong evidence against values of S greater than 4.5 K. Other lines of evidence in combination also show that this is relatively unlikely. We use a Bayesian approach to produce a probability density (PDF) for S given all the evidence, including tests of robustness to difficult‐to‐quantify uncertainties and different priors. The 66% range is 2.6‐3.9 K for our Baseline calculation, and remains within 2.3‐4.5 K under the robustness tests; corresponding 5‐95% ranges are 2.3‐4.7 K, bounded by 2.0‐5.7 K (although such high‐confidence ranges should be regarded more cautiously). This indicates a stronger constraint on S than reported in past assessments, by lifting the low end of the range. This narrowing occurs because the three lines of evidence agree and are judged to be largely independent, and because of greater confidence in understanding feedback processes and in combining evidence. We identify promising avenues for further narrowing the range in S, in particular using comprehensive models and process understanding to address limitations in the traditional forcing‐feedback paradigm for interpreting past changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000439837",,"8755-1209||0096-1043||1944-9208",,"10.1029/2019rg000678","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/439837","en","American Geophysical Union","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Climate||climate sensitivity||global warming||Bayesian methods","An assessment of Earth's climate sensitivity using multiple lines of evidence",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-10T14:29:04Z","2021-01-23",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constraining uncertainty of multi decadal climate projections","820829","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85091834697",,,,"Rev.

Here, we develop a framework to assess the fitness of a climate model for providing understanding. The framework is based on three dimensions: representational accuracy, representational depth, and graspability. We show that this framework does justice to the intuition that classical process-based climate models give understanding of phenomena. While simple climate models are characterized by a larger graspability, state-of-the-art models have a higher representational accuracy and representational depth. We then compare the fitness-for-providing understanding of process-based to data-driven models that are built with machine learning. We show that at first glance, data-driven models seem either unnecessary or inadequate for understanding. However, a case study from atmospheric research demonstrates that this is a false dilemma. Data-driven models can be useful tools for understanding, specifically for phenomena for which scientists can argue from the coherence of the models with background knowledge to their representational accuracy and for which the model complexity can be reduced such that they are graspable to a satisfactory extent.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000441066",,"0039-3681",,"10.1016/j.shpsa.2020.08.003","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/441066","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Understanding||Climate models||Machine learning||Data-driven models||Representation||Grasping","Understanding climate phenomena with data-driven models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-17T15:00:42Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Combining theory with Big Data?

Remaining carbon budget estimates range widely, however, and this uncertainty can be used to either trivialize the most ambitious mitigation targets by characterizing them as impossible, or to argue that there is ample time to allow for a gradual transition to a low-carbon economy. Neither of these extremes is consistent with our best understanding of the policy implications of remaining carbon budgets. Understanding the scientific and socio-economic uncertainties affecting the size of the remaining carbon budgets, as well as the methodological choices and assumptions that underlie their calculation, is essential before applying them as a policy tool. Here we provide recommendations on how to calculate remaining carbon budgets in a traceable and transparent way, and discuss their uncertainties and implications for both international and national climate policies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000454127",,"1752-0908||1752-0894",,"10.1038/s41561-020-00663-3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454127","en","Nature Publishing Group","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Opportunities and challenges in using remaining carbon budgets to guide climate policy",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-02T08:07:20Z","2021-05-31",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constraining uncertainty of multi decadal climate projections||Climate-Carbon Interactions in the Coming Century||Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach","820829||821003||641816||820829||821003||641816","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100007352","EC||EC||SBFI||EC||EC||SBFI","H2020||H2020||H2020||H2020||H2020||H2020",,,,"85096988475",,,"000594838900003","Nat.

The drought was linked to the development of a quasi-stationary anticyclone in the South Atlantic in early 2014 that affected local precipitation patterns over South-East Brazil. Previous studies have suggested that the unusual blocking was triggered by tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and, more recently, by convection over the Indian Ocean related to the Madden–Julian Oscillation. Further investigation of the proposed teleconnections appears crucial for anticipating future economic impacts. In this study, we use numerical experiments with an idealized atmospheric general circulation model forced with the observed 2013/2014 SST anomalies in different ocean basins to understand the dominant mechanism that initiated the 2014 South Atlantic anticyclonic anomaly. We show that a forcing with global 2013/2014 SST anomalies enhances the chance for the occurrence of positive geopotential height anomalies in the South Atlantic. However, further sensitivity experiments with SST forcings in separate ocean basins suggest that neither the Indian Ocean nor tropical Pacific SST anomalies alone have contributed significantly to the anomalous atmospheric circulation that led to the 2014 South-East Brazil drought. The model study rather points to an important role of remote forcing from the South Pacific, local South Atlantic SSTs, and internal atmospheric variability in driving the persistent blocking over the South Atlantic.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438402",,"0930-7575||1432-0894","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438402||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/463755","10.1007/s00382-020-05442-9","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/470960","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Brazil 2014 drought||Teleconnections||ENSO||Blocking||MJO","Revisiting remote drivers of the 2014 drought in South-Eastern Brazil",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-04T06:49:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application","170523","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,"85090228008",,,"000565860000001","Clim Dyn","11","Climate Dynamics","55","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While early warning systems are frequently used to predict the magnitude, location, and timing of potentially damaging events, these systems rarely provide impact estimates, such as the expected amount and distribution of physical damage, human consequences, disruption of services, or financial loss. Complementing early warning systems with impact forecasts has a twofold advantage: It would provide decision makers with richer information to take informed decisions about emergency measures and focus the attention of different disciplines on a common target. This would allow capitalizing on synergies between different disciplines and boosting the development of multihazard early warning systems. This review discusses the state of the art in impact forecasting for a wide range of natural hazards. We outline the added value of impact‐based warnings compared to hazard forecasting for the emergency phase, indicate challenges and pitfalls, and synthesize the review results across hazard types most relevant for Europe.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000450154",,"8755-1209||0096-1043||1944-9208",,"10.1029/2020rg000704","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/450154","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Impact Forecasting to Support Emergency Management of Natural Hazards",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-07T13:23:21Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097976344",,,"000603664800002","Rev.

Our results indicate that global warming has already more than doubled both the global land area and the global population annually exposed to all six categories of extreme events considered: river floods, tropical cyclones, crop failure, wildfires, droughts, and heatwaves. Global warming of 2°C relative to preindustrial conditions is projected to lead to a more than fivefold increase in cross‐category aggregate exposure globally. Changes in exposure are unevenly distributed, with tropical and subtropical regions facing larger increases than higher latitudes. The largest increases in overall exposure are projected for the population of South Asia.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000458719",,"2328-4277",,"10.1029/2020EF001616","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458719","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Projecting Exposure to Extreme Climate Impact Events Across Six Event Categories and Three Spatial Scales",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-30T03:52:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097993623",,,"000603662300006",,"12","Earth's Future","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

These models can provide decision-relevant predictions, but confident decision-making requires that the involved uncertainties are understood. We argue that existing frameworks for characterizing uncertainties are not appropriate for data-driven models because of their focus on distinct locations of uncertainty. We propose a framework for uncertainty assessment that uses argument analysis to assess the justification of the assumption that the model is fit for the predictive purpose at hand. Its flexibility makes the framework applicable to data-driven models. The framework is illustrated using a case study from environmental science. We show that data-driven models can be subject to substantial second-order uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty in the assessment of the predictive uncertainty, because they are often applied to ill-understood problems. We close by discussing the implications of the predictive uncertainties of data-driven models for decision-making.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000440519",,"1364-8152||1873-6726",,"10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104754","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/440519","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Argument-based assessment of predictive uncertainty of data-driven environmental models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-15T03:53:16Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Combining theory with Big Data?

The scenarios build upon the regional climate model projections for Europe produced through the internationally coordinated downscaling effort EURO-CORDEX. The simulations from EURO-CORDEX consist of simulations at two spatial horizontal resolutions, several global climate models, and three different emission scenarios. Even with this unique dataset of regional climate scenarios, a number of practical challenges regarding a consistent interpretation of the model ensemble arise. Here we present the methodological chain employed in CH2018 in order to generate a multi-model ensemble that is consistent across scenarios and is used as a basis for deriving the CH2018 products. The different steps involve a thorough evaluation of the full EURO-CORDEX model ensemble, the removal of doubtful and potentially erroneous simulations, a time-shift approach to account for an equal number of simulations for each emission scenario, and the multi-model combination of simulations with different spatial resolutions. Each component of this cascade of processing steps is associated with an uncertainty that eventually contributes to the overall scientific uncertainty of the derived scenario products. We present a comparison and an assessment of the uncertainties from these individual effects and relate them to probabilistic projections. It is shown that the CH2018 scenarios are generally supported by the results from other sources. Thus, the CH2018 scenarios currently provide the best available dataset of future climate change estimates in Switzerland.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000453512",,"2405-8807",,"10.1016/j.cliser.2020.100196","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453512","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Regional climate change scenarios||Climate services||CORDEX||Ensembles of opportunities||Switzerland","CH2018 - National climate scenarios for Switzerland: How to construct consistent multi-model projections from ensembles of opportunity",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-27T14:03:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85085953379",,,"000600201200004",,,"Climate Services","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, two questions have remained unanswered to the foehn community over the last years. First, while accurate forecasts are viable at the timescale of numerical weather prediction, the long-term evolution of monthly foehn occurrence is still open to debate. Second, while many studies cited the importance of foehn winds on forest fires in single case studies, a definite quantitative link between foehn winds and forest fires prevailed missing. Hence, the scientific contribution of this work is divided into two parts. In the first part, we explored the possibilities of employing machine learning algorithms to predict foehn within Switzerland from its synoptic fingerprint in climate simulations. Here, we used variables from the ERA-Interim reanalysis and the CESM simulation as inputs for our models. We trained on ERA-Interim data to recognize foehn, then verified the results on a CESM simulation of present-day climate, and finally, predicted foehn on a future warming climate CESM simulation. The best generalization between ERAI and CESM was obtained by including the present-day simulation in the training procedure and simultaneously optimizing two objective functions, namely the negative log loss and squared mean loss, on both datasets, respectively. The model verification showed validity of our approach for most of the months. Finally, we found that south foehn in Altdorf is expected to become more common during spring, while north foehn in Lugano is expected to become more common during two summer months. In the second part, we analyzed forest fires of the past 40 years and linked them with foehn occurrence from a climatological perspective. We found that foehn duration and foehn strength substantially increase both the number and the severity of forest fires. In detail, we observed that if a day showed foehn presence, it was associated with a 3.4-fold increase in numbers of fires in contrast to a day without foehn presence. Furthermore, if a foehn wind set in during the six hours after fire ignition, it increased the median burned area of such fires by a significant factor of three compared to fires without foehn occurrence. While we developed and tested both methodologies within Switzerland due to the vast availability of foehn and forest fire data, we extensively documented our approaches. Therefore, we encourage other researchers to apply these frameworks also to foehn winds in other regions of the world.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000594509",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/594509","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Downslope winds||Foehn||Climate prediction||Machine learning||Forest fires","Evaluating foehn development in a changing climate using machine learning and investigating the impact of foehn on forest fire occurrence and severity",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2023-01-24T13:24:52Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Combustion aerosols have strong anthropogenic sources, and if these aerosol types were to nucleate ice in clouds, they might exert a climate forcing. Here, we quantified the atmospheric ice‐nucleating particle (INP) concentrations during the United Kingdom's annual Bonfire Night celebrations, which are characterized by large amounts of combustion aerosol from bonfires and fireworks. We used three immersion mode techniques covering more than 6 orders of magnitude in INP concentration over the temperature range from −10°C to homogeneous freezing. We found no observable systematic change in the INP concentration on three separate nights, despite more than a factor of 10 increase in aerosol number concentrations, up to a factor of 10 increase in PM10 concentration, and more than a factor of 100 increase in black carbon (BC) mass concentration relative to pre‐event levels. This implies that BC and other combustion aerosol such as ash did not compete with the INPs present in the background air. Furthermore, the upper limit of the ice‐active site surface density, ns(T), of BC generated in these events was shown to be consistent with several other recent laboratory studies, showing a very low ice‐nucleating activity of BC. We conclude that combustion aerosol particles similar to those emitted on Bonfire Night are at most of secondary importance for the INP population relevant for mixed‐phase clouds in typical midlatitude terrestrial locations. © 2020 American Geophysical Union.",,,,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2020JD032938","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453627","en","Wiley",,,,"A Major Combustion Aerosol Event Had a Negligible Impact on the Atmospheric Ice-Nucleating Particle Population",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-11-29T03:51:34Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding","603445","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,"85096500918",,,"000595725700019","J. geophys. res., Atmos.","22","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","125","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To extract reliable estimates of future warming and related uncertainties from these models, the spread in their projections is often translated into probabilistic estimates such as the mean and likely range. Here, we use a model weighting approach, which accounts for the models' historical performance based on several diagnostics as well as model interdependence within the CMIP6 ensemble, to calculate constrained distributions of global mean temperature change. We investigate the skill of our approach in a perfect model test, where we use previous-generation CMIP5 models as pseudo-observations in the historical period. The performance of the distribution weighted in the abovementioned manner with respect to matching the pseudo-observations in the future is then evaluated, and we find a mean increase in skill of about 17 % compared with the unweighted distribution. In addition, we show that our independence metric correctly clusters models known to be similar based on a CMIP6 “family tree”, which enables the application of a weighting based on the degree of inter-model dependence. We then apply the weighting approach, based on two observational estimates (the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Retrospective Analysis – ERA5, and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 – MERRA-2), to constrain CMIP6 projections under weak (SSP1-2.6) and strong (SSP5-8.5) climate change scenarios (SSP refers to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways). Our results show a reduction in the projected mean warming for both scenarios because some CMIP6 models with high future warming receive systematically lower performance weights. The mean of end-of-century warming (2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014) for SSP5-8.5 with weighting is 3.7 ∘C, compared with 4.1 ∘C without weighting; the likely (66%) uncertainty range is 3.1 to 4.6 ∘C, which equates to a 13 % decrease in spread. For SSP1-2.6, the weighted end-of-century warming is 1 ∘C (0.7 to 1.4 ∘C), which results in a reduction of −0.1 ∘C in the mean and −24 % in the likely range compared with the unweighted case.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000451757",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-11-995-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/451757","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Reduced global warming from CMIP6 projections when weighting models by performance and independence",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-17T15:14:48Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"European Climate Prediction System||Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach||Constraining dynamic and thermodynamic drivers of mid-term regional climate change projections for Northern mid-latitudes","776613||641816||174128","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SBFI||SNF","H2020||H2020||Ambizione",,,,"85096243571",,,"000589409700001",,"4","Earth System Dynamics","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study presents a multiparameter analysis of aerosol trends over the last 2 decades at regional and global scales. Regional time series have been computed for a set of nine optical, chemical-composition and mass aerosol properties by using the observations from several ground-based networks. From these regional time series the aerosol trends have been derived for the different regions of the world. Most of the properties related to aerosol loading exhibit negative trends, both at the surface and in the total atmospheric column. Significant decreases in aerosol optical depth (AOD) are found in Europe, North America, South America, North Africa and Asia, ranging from −1.2 % yr−1 to −3.1 % yr−1. An error and representativity analysis of the spatially and temporally limited observational data has been performed using model data subsets in order to investigate how much the observed trends represent the actual trends happening in the regions over the full study period from 2000 to 2014. This analysis reveals that significant uncertainty is associated with some of the regional trends due to time and space sampling deficiencies. The set of observed regional trends has then been used for the evaluation of 10 models (6 AeroCom phase III models and 4 CMIP6 models) and the CAMS reanalysis dataset and of their skills in reproducing the aerosol trends. Model performance is found to vary depending on the parameters and the regions of the world. The models tend to capture trends in AOD, the column Ångström exponent, sulfate and particulate matter well (except in North Africa), but they show larger discrepancies for coarse-mode AOD. The rather good agreement of the trends, across different aerosol parameters between models and observations, when co-locating them in time and space, implies that global model trends, including those in poorly monitored regions, are likely correct. The models can help to provide a global picture of the aerosol trends by filling the gaps in regions not covered by observations. The calculation of aerosol trends at a global scale reveals a different picture from that depicted by solely relying on ground-based observations. Using a model with complete diagnostics (NorESM2), we find a global increase in AOD of about 0.2 % yr−1 between 2000 and 2014, primarily caused by an increase in the loads of organic aerosols, sulfate and black carbon.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000452316",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-13355-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/452316","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Evaluation of climate model aerosol trends with ground-based observations over the last 2 decades - an AeroCom and CMIP6 analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-22T10:11:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constrained aerosol forcing for improved climate projections||Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach","821205||641816","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100007352","EC||SBFI","H2020||H2020",,,,"85089441112",,,"000588284300003","Atmos. chem. phys.","21","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

With this RCM ensemble, two idealized experiments are performed for Europe, one with a continent with maximized forest cover, and one in which all forests are turned into grassland. First, an in-depth analysis of one ensemble member (“CCLM-VEG3D”) is carried out, to reveal the complex process chain caused by such land use changes (LUCs). From these findings, the whole ensemble is analyzed and principal biophysical effects of re/afforestation are derived. Results show that the diurnal temperature range is reduced at the surface (top of the vegetation) with re/afforestation. Most RCMs simulate colder surface temperatures Tsurf during the day and warmer Tsurf during the night. Thus, for the first time, the principal temperature interrelations found in observation-based studies in the midlatitudes could be reproduced within a model intercomparison study. On the contrary, the diurnal temperature range in the lowest atmospheric model level (Tair) is increased with re/afforestation. This opposing temperature response is mainly caused by the higher surface roughness of forest, enhancing the turbulent heat exchange. Furthermore, these opposing temperature responses demonstrate that the use of the diagnostic 2-m temperature (weighted interpolation between Tsurf and Tair) has a limited potential to assess the effects of re/afforestation. Thus, studies about the biophysical impacts of LUCs should investigate the whole near-surface temperature profile.",,,,"0894-8755||1520-0442",,"10.1175/jcli-d-19-0624.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/443190","en","American Meteorological Society",,,"Europe||Vegetation-atmosphere interactions||Surface temperature||Land surface model||Regional models||Land use","The Opposing Effects of Reforestation and Afforestation on the Diurnal Temperature Cycle at the Surface and in the Lowest Atmospheric Model Level in the European Summer",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-09-28T12:41:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"80364556","85092576052",,,"000589811900006","J. climate","21","Journal of Climate","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Successful extended-range NAO predictions would equate to improved predictions of precipitation and temperature in these regions. It has become clear that the NAO is influenced by the stratosphere, but as this downward coupling is not fully reproduced by all forecast models, the potential for improved NAO forecasts has not been fully realized. Here, an analysis of 21 winters of subseasonal forecast data from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) monthly forecasting system is presented. By dividing the forecasts into clusters according to their errors in North Atlantic sea level pressure 15–30 days into the forecasts, we identify relationships between these errors and the state of the stratospheric polar vortex when the forecasts were initialized. A key finding is that the model overestimates the persistence of both the negative NAO response following a weak polar vortex and the positive NAO response following a strong polar vortex. A case in point is the sudden stratospheric warming in early 2019, which was followed by five consecutive weeks of an overestimation of the negative NAO regime. A consequence on the ground was too cold temperature predictions for northern Europe. Another important finding is that the model appears to misrepresent the gradual downward impact of stratospheric vortex anomalies. This suggests that an improved representation and prediction of stratosphere–troposphere coupling in models might yield substantial benefits for extended-range weather forecasting in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes.",,,,"0894-8755||1520-0442",,"10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0270.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/430689","en","American Meteorological Society",,,"North Atlantic Oscillation||Stratosphere-troposphere coupling||Climate prediction||Seasonal forecasting","Tracing North Atlantic Oscillation forecast errors to stratospheric origins",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-08-07T20:35:38Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application","170523||170523","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,"85092560012",,,"000589811900005","J. climate","21","Journal of Climate","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This Arctic amplification has partially been attributed to poleward atmospheric heat transport in the form of airmass intrusions. Locally, such airmass intrusions can introduce moisture and temperature perturbations. The effect of airmass perturbations on boundary layer and cloud changes and their impact on the surface radiative balance has received increased attention, especially over sea ice with regard to sea ice melt. Utilizing cloud-resolving model simulations, this study addresses the impact of airmass perturbations occurring at different altitudes on stratocumulus clouds for open-ocean conditions. It is shown that warm and moist airmass perturbations substantially affect the boundary layer and cloud properties, even for the relatively moist environmental conditions over the open ocean. The cloud response is driven by temperature inversion adjustments and strongly depends on the perturbation height. Boundary layer perturbations weaken and raise the inversion, which destabilizes the lower troposphere and involves a transition from stratocumulus to cumulus clouds. In contrast, perturbations occurring in the lower free troposphere lead to a lowering but strengthening of the temperature inversion, with no impact on cloud fraction. In simulations where free-tropospheric specific humidity is further increased, multilayer mixed-phase clouds form. Regarding energy balance changes, substantial surface longwave cooling arises out of the stratocumulus break-up simulated for boundary layer perturbations. Meanwhile, the net surface longwave warming increases resulting from thicker clouds for airmass perturbations occurring in the lower free troposphere. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,,,"0894-8755||1520-0442",,"10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0163.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/447206","en","American Meteorological Society",,,"Arctic||Inversions||Cloud radiative effects||Clouds||Cloud resolving models","The impact of warm and moist airmass perturbations on arctic mixed-phase stratocumulus",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-10-22T08:52:44Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85092548268",,,"000589812200007","J. climate","22","Journal of Climate","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The analysis uses hourly output of a COSMO (Consortium for Small-scale Modeling) model simulation with 2.2 km grid spacing and resolved deep convection. Cyclones and fronts are identified as two-dimensional features in 850 hPa geopotential, equivalent potential temperature, and wind fields and subsequently tracked over time based on feature overlap and size. Thermal heat lows and local thermal fronts are removed based on track properties. This dataset then serves to define seven mutually exclusive precipitation components: cyclonic (near cyclone center), cold-frontal, warm-frontal, collocated (e.g., occlusion area), far-frontal, high-pressure (e.g., summer convection), and residual. The approach is illustrated with two case studies with contrasting precipitation characteristics. The climatological analysis for the 9-year period shows that frontal precipitation peaks in winter and fall over the eastern North Atlantic and the Alps (> 70 % in winter), where cold frontal precipitation is also crucial year-round; cyclonic precipitation is largest over the North Atlantic (especially in summer with > 40 %) and in the northern Mediterranean (widespread > 40 %); high-pressure precipitation occurs almost exclusively over land and primarily in summer (widespread 30 %–60 %, locally >80 %); and the residual contributions uniformly amount to about 20 % in all seasons. Considering heavy precipitation events (defined based on the local 99.9th all-hour percentile) reveals that high-pressure precipitation dominates in summer over the continent (50 %–70 %, locally >80 %); cold fronts produce much more heavy precipitation than warm fronts; and cyclones contribute substantially (50 %–70 %), especially in the Mediterranean in fall through spring and in northern Europe in summer.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456728",,"2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-1-675-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456728","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Attribution of precipitation to cyclones and fronts over Europe in a kilometer-scale regional climate simulation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-16T16:41:38Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Cloud-resolving climate modeling on future supercomputing platform","154486","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Sinergia",,,,,,,,"Weather Clim.

These events were comparable in magnitude but varied in their geographical distribution and biomes affected. In this study, we perform a comparative analysis of the impact of the DH events on ecosystem CO2 fluxes over Europe based on an ensemble of 11 dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), and the observation-based FLUXCOM product. We find that all DH events were associated with decreases in net ecosystem productivity (NEP), but the gross summer flux anomalies differ between DGVMs and FLUXCOM. At the annual scale, FLUXCOM and DGVMs indicate close to neutral or above-average land CO2 uptake in DH2003 and DH2018, due to increased productivity in spring and reduced respiration in autumn and winter compensating for less photosynthetic uptake in summer. Most DGVMs estimate lower gross primary production (GPP) sensitivity to soil moisture during extreme summers than FLUXCOM. Finally, we show that the different impacts of the DH events at continental-scale GPP are in part related to differences in vegetation composition of the regions affected and to regional compensating or offsetting effects from climate anomalies beyond the DH centres.

But understanding of how this linkage affects the medium-range forecast uncertainty of Mediterranean cyclones is limited, as previous predictability studies have mainly focused on the relatively rare cases of Mediterranean cyclogenesis preceded by upstream extratropical transition of tropical cyclones. This study exploits a European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational ensemble forecast with an uncertain potential vorticity (PV) streamer position over the Mediterranean that, 3 d after initialization, resulted in an uncertain development of the Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone (Medicane) Zorbas in September 2018. Later initializations showed substantially lower forecast uncertainties over the Mediterranean. An ad hoc clustering of the ensemble members according to the PV streamer position in the Mediterranean is used to study the upstream evolution of the synoptic to mesoscale forecast uncertainties. Cluster differences show that forecast uncertainties were amplified on the stratospheric side of a jet streak over the North Atlantic during the first day of the ensemble prediction. Subsequently, they propagated downstream and were further amplified within a short-wave perturbation along the wave guide, superimposed onto the large-scale Rossby wave pattern. After 3 d, the uncertainties reached the Mediterranean, where they resulted in a large spread in the position of the PV streamer. These uncertainties further translated into uncertainties in the position and thermal structure of the Mediterranean cyclone. In particular, the eastward displacement of the PV streamer in more than a third of the ensemble members resulted in a very different cyclone scenario. In this scenario, cyclogenesis occurred earlier than in the other members in connection to a pre-existing surface trough over the Levantine Sea. These cyclones did not develop the deep warm core typical of medicanes. It is proposed that the eastward-shifted cyclogenesis resulted in reduced values of low-level equivalent potential temperature in the cyclogenesis area. As a result, latent heating was not intense and deep enough to erode the upper-level PV anomaly and allow the formation of a deep warm core. The westward displacement led to surface cyclones that were too weak, and a medicane formed in only half of the members. The central, i.e. correct, PV streamer position resulted in the most accurate forecasts with a strong medicane in most members. This study is the first that explicitly investigates the impact of PV streamer position uncertainty for medicane development. Overall, results extend current knowledge of the role of upstream uncertainties in the medium-range predictability and unsteady forecast behavior of Mediterranean cyclones including medicanes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456727",,"2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-1-597-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456727","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"How an uncertain short-wave perturbation on the North Atlantic wave guide affects the forecast of an intense Mediterranean cyclone (Medicane Zorbas)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-16T16:31:33Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The role of PV cutoff reabsorption for atmospheric predictability","ETH-07 16-2","10.13039/501100003006","ETHZ","ETH Grants",,,,,,,,"Weather Clim.

They can also substantially influence the dynamics of cyclones and the upper-level flow. So far, most of the knowledge about WCBs is based on model data from analyses, reanalyses and forecast data with only a few observational studies available. The aim of this work is to gain a detailed observational perspective on the vertical cloud and precipitation structure of WCBs during their inflow, ascent and outflow and to evaluate their representation in the new ERA5 reanalysis dataset. To this end, satellite observations from the CloudSat radar and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) lidar are combined with an ERA5-based WCB climatology for nine Northern Hemisphere winters. Based on a case study and a composite analysis, the main findings can be summarized as follows. (i) WCB air masses are part of deep, strongly precipitating clouds, with cloud-top heights at 9–10 km during their ascent and an about 2–3 km deep layer with supercooled liquid water co-existing with ice above the melting layer. The maximum surface precipitation occurs when the WCB is at about 2–4 km height. (ii) Convective clouds can be observed above the inflow and during the ascent. (iii) At upper levels, the WCB outflow is typically located near the top of a 3 km deep cirrus layer. (iv) There is a large variability between WCBs in terms of cloud structure, peak reflectivity and associated surface precipitation. (v) The WCB trajectories with the highest radar reflectivities are mainly located over the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and – apart from the inflow – they occur at relatively low latitudes. They are associated with particularly deep and strongly precipitating clouds that occur not only during the ascent but also in the inflow and outflow regions. (vi) ERA5 represents the WCB clouds remarkably well in terms of position, thermodynamic phase and frozen hydrometeor distribution, although it underestimates the high ice and snow values in the mixed-phase clouds near the melting layer. (vii) In the lower troposphere, high potential vorticity is diabatically produced along the WCB in areas with high reflectivities and hydrometeor contents, and at upper levels, low potential vorticity prevails in the cirrus layer in the WCB outflow. The study provides important observational insight into the internal cloud structure of WCBs and emphasizes the ability of ERA5 to essentially capture the observed pattern but also reveals many small- and mesoscale structures observed by the remote sensing instruments but not captured by ERA5.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456089",,"2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-1-577-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456089","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Vertical cloud structure of warm conveyor belts – a comparison and evaluation of ERA5 reanalysis, CloudSat and CALIPSO data",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-11T16:18:04Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Diabatic processes in North Atlantic weather systems: dynamics and impact on forecast errors||Understanding the influence of warm conveyor belts in extratropical cyclones on tropopause dynamics: analysis with observations, reanalyses and global climate simulations||An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","146834||185049||787652","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","SNF||SNF||EC","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||H2020||Projekte MINT",,,,,,,,"Weather Clim.

MCAOs are associated with a range of severe weather phenomena, such as polar lows, strong surface winds and intense cooling of the ocean surface. Given these extreme impacts, the identification of precursors of MCAOs is crucial for improved long-range prediction of associated impacts on Arctic infrastructure and human lives. MCAO frequency has been linked to the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex, but the study of connections to the occurrence of extreme stratospheric events, known as sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs), has been limited to cold extremes over land. Here, the influence of SSW events on MCAOs over the North Atlantic ocean is studied using reanalysis datasets. Overall, SSW events are found to be associated with more frequent MCAOs in the Barents Sea and the Norwegian Sea compared to climatology and less frequent MCAOs in the Labrador Sea. In particular, SSW events project onto an anomalous dipole pattern of geopotential height 500 hPa, which consists of a ridge anomaly over Greenland and a trough anomaly over Scandinavia. By affecting the variability of the large-scale circulation patterns in the North Atlantic, SSW events contribute to the strong northerly flow over the Barents and Norwegian seas and thereby increase the likelihood of MCAOs in these regions. In contrast, the positive geopotential height anomaly over Greenland reduces the probability of MCAOs in the Labrador Sea after SSW events. As SSW events tend to have a long-term influence on surface weather, these results are expected to benefit the predictability of MCAOs in the Nordic Seas for winters with SSW events.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000446455",,"2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-1-541-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/446455","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Stratospheric influence on North Atlantic marine cold air  outbreaks following sudden stratospheric warming events",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-17T15:02:13Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Artic Impact on Weather and Climate||Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application","727852||170523||727852||170523","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","EC||SNF||EC||SNF","H2020||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2||H2020||SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,,,,,"Weather Clim.

To provide these estimates, different approaches to constrain, filter, or weight climate model projections into probabilistic distributions have been proposed. However, an assessment of multiple such methods to, for example, expose cases of agreement or disagreement, is often hindered by a lack of coordination, with methods focusing on a variety of variables, time periods, regions, or model pools. Here, a consistent framework is developed to allow a quantitative comparison of eight different methods; focus is given to summer temperature and precipitation change in three spatial regimes in Europe in 2041–60 relative to 1995–2014. The analysis draws on projections from several large ensembles, the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble, and perturbed physics ensembles, all using the high-emission scenario RCP8.5. The methods’ key features are summarized, assumptions are discussed, and resulting constrained distributions are presented. Method agreement is found to be dependent on the investigated region but is generally higher for median changes than for the uncertainty ranges. This study, therefore, highlights the importance of providing clear context about how different methods affect the assessed uncertainty—in particular, the upper and lower percentiles that are of interest to risk-averse stakeholders. The comparison also exposes cases in which diverse lines of evidence lead to diverging constraints; additional work is needed to understand how the underlying differences between methods lead to such disagreements and to provide clear guidance to users.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000445849",,"0894-8755||1520-0442",,"10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0953.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/445849","en","American Meteorological Society","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Comparing Methods to Constrain Future European Climate Projections Using a Consistent Framework",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-14T04:21:48Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"European Climate Prediction System","776613","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85091522575",,,"000589810600004","J. climate","20","Journal of Climate","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the underlying mechanism and relative contributions of radiation dimming and decreasing water clarity to the underwater light environment on a national or global scale remains largely unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive dataset of unprecedented scale in China's lakes to address the combined effects of radiation dimming and decreasing water clarity on underwater darkening. Long-term total radiation and sunshine duration showed 5.8% and 7.9% decreases, respectively, after 2000 compared to 1961–1970, resulting in net radiation dimming. An in situ Secchi disk depth (SDD) dataset in 170 lakes showed that the mean SDD significantly decreased from 1.80 ± 2.19 m before 1995 to 1.28 ± 1.82 m after 2005. SDD remote sensing estimations for 641 lakes with areas ≥ 10 km2 showed that SDD markedly decreased from 1.26 ± 0.62 m during 1985–1990 to 1.14 ± 0.66 m during 2005–2010. Radiation dimming and decreasing water clarity jointly caused an approximately 10% decrease in the average available photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the euphotic layer. Our results revealed a more important role of decreasing water clarity in underwater darkening than radiation dimming. A meta-analysis of long-term SDD observation data from 61 various waters further elucidated a global extensive underwater darkening. Underwater darkening implies a decrease in water quality for potable water supplies, recession in macrophytes and benthic algae, and decreases in benthic primary production, fishery production, and biodiversity. © 2020 Science China Press",,,,"2095-9273",,"10.1016/j.scib.2020.06.016","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432834","en","Elsevier",,,"Radiation dimming||Underwater darkening||Secchi disk depth||Remote sensing||Aquatic ecosystems","Radiation dimming and decreasing water clarity fuel underwater darkening in lakes",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-08-27T03:14:05Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85087480347",,,,"Sci.

Between 2012 and 2015, we performed tritium analyses on daily precipitation samples from north-western Switzerland to better constrain the tritium variability. We also collected waters dripping inside Milandre Cave (Jura Mountains) with a 4–6 months’ resolution in order to estimate the age of the drip water, which is mandatory to interpret the high-resolution speleothem (cave carbonate deposits) records. Over the monitoring period, the mean tritium concentration in the daily precipitation samples was approximately 8.7 ± 4.7 TU with distinct seasonality showing higher values in spring and summer (from April–May to August–September). The similarity in trends with the other cosmogenic radionuclide beryllium-7 (7Be) suggests that, for the study site, tritium in precipitation essentially originates from stratospheric input in spring. In winter, precipitation dynamics with increasing moisture originating from the Atlantic and diluted during transport contribute to low values close to the Atlantic background. In cave drip water, the depleted activity level of tritium indicates a relatively long percolation time from the surface to the cave of several years. A residual superimposed short tritium variability provides evidence for the occurrence of fast flowing water paths. The contribution from both components were quantified based on a two-component lumped parameter-mixing model. Finally, we show that tritium concentrations in cave drip water are linked to the moisture origin and atmospheric transport pathways.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000428493",,"0265-931X||1879-1700",,"10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.106346","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/428493","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Origin and percolation times of Milandre Cave drip water determined by tritium time series and beryllium-7 data from Switzerland",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-25T22:36:41Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85088149013",,,"000568995000001","J. environ. radioact.",,"Journal of Environmental Radioactivity","222","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In the context of the Paris Agreement, global warming is usually interpreted as the externally-forced response to anthropogenic activities and emissions, but it excludes the natural fluctuations of the climate system known as internal variability. A remaining carbon budget can be calculated from an estimate of the anthropogenic warming to date, and either (i) the ratio of CO2-induced warming to cumulative emissions, known as the Transient Climate Response to Emissions (TCRE), in addition to information on the temperature response to the future evolution of non-CO2 emissions; or (ii) climate model scenario simulations that reach a given temperature threshold. Here we quantify the impact of internal variability on the carbon budgets consistent with the Paris Agreement derived using either approach, and on the TCRE diagnosed from individual models. Our results show that internal variability contributes approximately ±0.09 °C to the overall uncertainty range of the human-induced warming to-date, leading to a spread in the remaining carbon budgets as large as ±50 PgC, when using approach (i). Differences in diagnosed TCRE due to internal variability in individual models can be as large as ±0.1 °C/1000 PgC (5-95% range). Alternatively, spread in the remaining carbon budgets calculated from (ii) using future concentration-driven simulations of large ensembles of CMIP6 and CMIP5 models is estimated at ± 30 PgC and ± 40 PgC (5-95% range). These results are important for model evaluation and imply that caution is needed when interpreting small remaining budgets in policy discussions. We do not question the validity of a carbon budget approach in determining mitigation requirements. However, due to intrinsic uncertainty arising from internal variability, it may only be possible to determine the exact year when a budget is exceeded in hindsight, highlighting the importance of a precautionary approach.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000439838",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/abaf1b","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/439838","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","internal variability||carbon budget||TCRE||Paris Agreement||anthropogenic warming||temperature target||CMIP6||large ensembles","Uncertainty in carbon budget estimates due to internal climate variability",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-10T14:31:37Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Constraining dynamic and thermodynamic drivers of mid-term regional climate change projections for Northern mid-latitudes","174128","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,"85093066171",,,"000575687000001","Environ.

How the link between the SPV and the large‐scale tropospheric flow translates into forecast skill for surface weather in individual countries – a spatial scale that is particularly relevant for the energy industry – remains an open question. Here we quantify the effect of anomalously strong and weak SPV states at forecast initial time on the probabilistic extended‐range reforecast skill of the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in predicting country‐ and month‐ahead‐averaged anomalies of 2 m temperature, 10 m wind speed, and precipitation. After anomalous SPV states, specific surface weather anomalies emerge, which resemble the opposing phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation. We find that forecast skill is, to first order, only enhanced for countries that are entirely affected by these anomalies. However, the model has a flow‐dependent bias for 2 m temperature (T2M): it predicts the warm conditions in Western, Central and Southern Europe following strong SPV states well, but is overconfident with respect to the warm anomaly in Scandinavia. Vice versa, it predicts the cold anomaly in Scandinavia following weak SPV states well, but struggles to capture the strongly varying extent of the cold air masses into Central and Southern Europe. This tends to reduce skill (in some cases significantly) for Scandinavian countries following strong SPV states, and most pronounced, for many Central, Southern European, and Balkan countries following weak SPV states. As most of the weak SPV states are associated with sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs), our study thus advices particular caution when interpreting sub‐seasonal regional T2M forecasts following SSWs. In contrast, it suggests that the model benefits from enhanced predictability for a considerable part of Europe following strong SPV states.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000441324",,"0035-9009||1477-870X",,"10.1002/qj.3866","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/441324","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","energy||European countries||polar vortex||stratosphere||sub-seasonal forecast skill||sudden stratospheric warming||surface weather","Stratospheric influence on ECMWF sub‐seasonal forecast skill for energy‐industry‐relevant surface weather in European countries",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-20T04:16:42Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85090310619",,,"000566562900001","Q.

However, the sensitivity of tropical cyclone precipitation and moisture budget to changes in resolution has received less attention. In this study, we use the five-model ensemble from project PRIMAVERA/HighResMIP to investigate the systematic changes of the water budget of tropical cyclones in a range of horizontal resolutions from 1° to 0.25°. Our results show that, despite a large change in the distribution of TC intensity with resolution, the distribution of precipitation per TC (i.e., averaged in a 5° radial cap) does not change significantly. This result is explained by the fact that low- and high-resolution models represent equally well the large-scale balance that characterizes the moisture budget of TCs, with the radius of the moisture source extending to ~15° from the center of the TC (i.e. well beyond the TC edge). The wind profile is found to converge in the low and high resolutions for radii > 5°, resulting in a moisture flux convergence into the TC of similar magnitude at low and high resolutions. In contrast to precipitation per TC, TC intensity does increase at higher resolution and this is explained by the larger surface latent heat flux near the center of the storm, which leads to an increase in equivalent potential temperature and warmer core anomalies, although this extra latent heat represents a negligible contribution to the overall moisture budget. We discuss the complication arising from the choice of the tracking algorithm when assessing the impact of model resolution. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,,,"0894-8755||1520-0442",,"10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0999.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/451395","en","American Meteorological Society",,,,"The Moisture Budget of Tropical Cyclones in HighResMIP Models: Large-Scale Environmental Balance and Sensitivity to Horizontal Resolution",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-11-15T03:55:14Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85095775553",,,"000589983000016","J. climate","19","Journal of Climate","33","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Here we present global climate simulations of past and future effects of both ozone-aged soot particles acting as cloud condensation nuclei and sulfuric acid-aged soot particles acting as ice-nucleating particles on the structure and radiative effects of clouds. Under pre-industrial conditions, soot aging led to an increase in thick, low-level clouds that reduced negative shortwave effective radiative forcing by 0.2 to 0.3 W m−2. In the simulations of a future, warmer climate under double pre-industrial atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, soot aging and compensating cloud adjustments led to a reduction in low-level clouds and enhanced high-altitude cirrus cloud thickness, which influenced the longwave radiative balance and exacerbated the global mean surface warming by 0.4 to 0.5 K.

These burning embers use colour transitions to show changes in the assessed level of risk to humans and ecosystems as a function of global mean temperature. In this Review, we outline the history and evolution of the burning embers and associated reasons for concern framework, focusing on the methodological approaches and advances.

Surface solar radiation is one particularly relevant variable, with implications on policy decisions (e.g. performance of solar panels) and fundamental questions in climate science (e.g. regarding the energy budget). While all current twentieth century reanalyses provide surface solar radiation, we demonstrate that most of them fail to capture multidecadal surface radiation variability in Europe. To this end, we systematically compare the reanalyses 20CRv2c, 20CRv3, ERA20C and CERA20C and the free model run ERA20CM. We show that only CERA20C captures dimming (1949-1979) and brightening (1979-2009) in line with station observations, satellite-era reanalyses and established theory. The lack of multidecadal surface radiation variability in 20CRv2c/v3 is plausible given the use of constant aerosols. In contrast, ERA20CM, ERA20C and CERA20C are forced with time-varying aerosols. Despite this common forcing, ERA20CM and ERA20C surprisingly show no trends in clear-sky fluxes over the dimming and brightening periods while CERA20C shows significant trends. We discuss different potential explanations for this discrepancy (model versions, ocean coupling and ensemble size) and conclude that none of them provides a convincing explanation. Our results therefore imply that only CERA20C is suitable for assessments of surface solar radiation variability on multi-decadal timescales. This particularly applies to impact studies, for example, on long-term potentials of solar power generation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000445823",,"1748-9326||1748-9318","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461616||http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/445823","10.1088/1748-9326/aba7e6","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473957","en","IOP Publishing","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Solar||radiation||dimming||brightening||20th century reanalysis||CERA20C||photovoltaics","European multidecadal solar variability badly captured in all centennial reanalyses except CERA20C",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-14T04:06:19Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85092612570",,,"000574295300001","Environ.

Whereas the transition occurred abruptly in 2003, it was gradual in 2018 with a 12‐day period of concurrent heatwaves in both regions. This study contrasts these two events in the context of a heatwave climatology to elucidate the dynamics of both concurrent and sequential heatwaves. Central European and, in particular, concurrent heatwaves are climatologically associated with weak pressure gradient (WPG) events over Central Europe, which indicate the absence of synoptic activity over this region. One synoptic pattern associated with such events is Scandinavian blocking. This pattern is at the same time conducive to heatwaves in Scandinavia, thereby providing a mechanism by which Scandinavian and Central European heatwaves can co‐occur. Further, the association of WPG events with Scandinavian blocking constitutes a mechanism that allows heatwaves to grow beyond the perimeter of the synoptic system from which they emanated. A trajectory analysis of the source regions of the low‐level air incorporated in the heatwaves indicates rapidly changing air mass sources throughout the heatwaves in both regions, but no recycling of heat from one heatwave to the other. This finding is line with a composite analysis indicating that transitions between Scandinavian and Central European heatwaves are merely a random coincidence of heatwave onset and decay.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000422251",,"0035-9009||1477-870X",,"10.1002/qj.3822","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/422251","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","block||Central Europe||heatwave||Scandinavia||weak pressure gradient","Dynamics of concurrent and sequential Central European and Scandinavian heatwaves",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-24T21:59:14Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","787652||787652||787652","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780","EC||EC||EC","H2020||H2020||H2020",,,,"85095597042",,,"000540234600001","Q.

For that purpose, we compute 8 d kinematic backward trajectories from the lowermost ∼500 m above the GrIS during these events. The key synoptic feature accompanying the melt events is an upper-tropospheric ridge southeast of the GrIS associated with a surface high-pressure system. This circulation pattern is favorable to induce rapid poleward transport (up to 40∘ latitude) of warm (∼15 K warmer than climatological air masses arriving on the GrIS) and moist air masses from the lower troposphere to the western GrIS and subsequently to distribute them in the anticyclonic flow over north and east Greenland. During transport to the GrIS, the melt event air masses cool by ∼15 K due to ascent and radiation, which keeps them just above the critical threshold to induce melting. The thermodynamic analyses reveal that the final warm anomaly of the air masses is primarily owed to anomalous horizontal transport from a climatologically warm region of origin. However, before being transported to the GrIS, i.e., in their region of origin, these air masses were not anomalously warm. Latent heating from condensation of water vapor, occurring as the airstreams are forced to ascend orographically or dynamically, is of secondary importance. These characteristics were particularly pronounced during the most extensive melt event in early July 2012, where, importantly, the warm anomaly was not preserved from anomalously warm source regions such as North America experiencing a record heat wave. The mechanisms identified here are in contrast to melt events in the low-elevation high Arctic and to midlatitude heat waves, where adiabatic warming by large-scale subsidence is essential. Considering the impact of moisture on the surface energy balance, we find that radiative effects are closely linked to the air mass trajectories and enhance melt over the entire GrIS accumulation zone due to (i) enhanced downward longwave radiation related to poleward moisture transport and a shift in the cloud phase from ice to liquid primarily west of the ice divide and (ii) increased shortwave radiation in clear-sky regions east of the ice divide. Given the ongoing increase in the frequency and the melt extent of large-scale melt events, the understanding of upper-tropospheric ridges over the North Atlantic, i.e., also Greenland blocking, and its representation in climate models is crucial in determining future GrIS accumulation zone melt and thus global sea level rise.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456721",,"2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-1-497-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456721","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A Lagrangian analysis of the dynamical and thermodynamic drivers of large-scale Greenland melt events during 1979–2017",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-16T15:37:25Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","787652","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,,,"Weather Clim.

The frostpoint hygrometer detected layers of reduced water vapor by up to 2 ppmv from 18.5 to 23 km. Beneath, a 1‐km‐deep layer of increased water vapor was identified. An aerosol backscatter sonde measured the presence of stratospheric ice clouds. According to meteorological analysis the PSCs were formed upstream above the east coast of Greenland due to mountain wave‐induced cooling. The inertia‐gravity waves generated a large and persistent stratospheric wake far downstream of Greenland and led to the observed dehydration. Comparing the most recent ERA5 data with operational analyses from 2005, we find an improved representation of mesoscale internal gravity waves, dehydration and PSC formation for this particular event.

Here, we clarify the configurations leading to extreme wintertime events of zonal-mean net and total (sum of absolute values of poleward and equatorward) moisture transports by comparing feature-based weather system diagnostics with zonal-wavenumber decomposition of moisture transport in reanalysis data. Results show that extreme Arctic moisture transport events are attributable to individual weather systems, where cyclones favor net transport and blocks favor total transport. Zonal-wavenumber decomposition reveals that net moisture transport is dominated by planetary scales (zonal-wavenumbers k ≤ 3). Comparison between the two diagnostics suggests that blocks account for planetary scale contributions to net transport by interacting with cyclones rather than driving the transport themselves. Finally, net and total moisture transport events result in Arctic surface warming via different underlying processes related to cyclones and blocks, respectively. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

This rapid AA response—which occurs before any significant loss of Arctic sea ice—is produced by a positive lapse rate feedback over the Arctic. Sea ice loss is therefore not needed to produce polar‐amplified warming, although it contributes significantly to this warming after the first few months.

Understanding the link between ice nucleating particles and ice crystal number concentrations is crucial for filling this knowledge gap and will ultimately lead to better climate and weather predictions. Remote sensing instruments have emerged as promising tools to continuously measure ice crystal related parameters. In this thesis, the link between ice nucleating particle concentrations and ice crystal number concentrations in orographic mixed-phase clouds was studied by combining remote-sensing and in-situ measurements. Data was used from the RACLETS field campaign, conducted in February and March 2019 in Davos, Switzerland. It was found that LIDAR derived ice nucleating particle concentrations were in good accordance with in-situ measurements for dust events, and matched slightly less good for non-dust cases. Remotely retrieved ice crystal number concentrations were available for six periods only, and were subject to large uncertainties. Therefore, no assessment of primary ice was possible and primary ice concentrations were assumed to be equal to ice nucleating particle concentrations. No quantitative assessment of secondary ice production was possible; however, all events showed secondary ice production on a qualitative scale. Further, it was shown that secondary ice processes have complex relations to meteorological conditions and an individual treatment of each cloud case was needed to establish a link between individual parameters. By comparing remote sensing and in-situ measured variables, this thesis points out current limitations of remote sensing retrieval techniques of ice crystal parameters. However, the results also show the large potential of using remote sensing instrumentation for analysing secondary ice formation in mixed-phase clouds.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000566861",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/566861","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","aerosol; INP; ice nucleation; Alps; orographic clouds; mixed-phase clouds; snowfall; precipitation; secondary ice formation; primary ice formation; ice multiplication; remote sensing; in situ observations; field measurements","Investigating the link from ice nucleating particles via primary ice nucleation to secondary ice production in orographic mixed-phase clouds",,"Master Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2022-08-26T13:18:43Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In Germany, extremely hot temperatures were accompanied by extremely low precipitation, compounding the impacts. Here we investigate spring to autumn temperature and precipitation in Germany over the historical period. We show that since measurements started in 1881, Germany has never experienced as hot and dry conditions during March to November as in 2018. We analyse the rarity of the event and illustrate that estimates of return periods for such compound extreme events are extremely high but very uncertain and strongly depend on the way they are estimated. We further investigate output from an ensemble of climate model simulations (CMIP5). Most climate models represent the distributions of temperature and precipitation in Germany and their dependence relatively well. Statistical projections of the bivariate temperature-precipitation distribution suggests that a growing season such as 2018 will become less likely at warmer global mean temperatures due to slight increases in precipitation. In contrast, climate models project an increasing likelihood of a 2018-like event and much larger uncertainties both for temperature and precipitation at different warming levels. Both observation-based scaling and climate model estimates consistently project that the compound hot and dry conditions in peak summer June–August become more likely. Overall, our results highlight the challenges associated with estimating the rarity of very extreme multivariate events and illustrate how consistent future changes in multivariate extremes can be estimated from observations only.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438624",,"2212-0947",,"10.1016/j.wace.2020.100270","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438624","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Compound events||Germany||Drought||Heat||Copula||Climate extremes","The record-breaking compound hot and dry 2018 growing season in Germany",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-04T20:17:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85088593971",,,"000564637100004",,,"Weather and Climate Extremes","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The abrupt change affected the entire European continent and coincided regionally with abrupt hydroclimatic changes such as a widespread reduction in snow days in Switzerland. However, the drivers and causes of the event are not well understood. Using a dynamical adjustment method based on statistical learning, we find that the continental-scale late 1980s abrupt winter warming and regional decreases in snow days can be attributed to cold conditions in the mid-1980s followed by a few exceptionally warm seasons. Both are caused by random atmospheric circulation variability superimposed upon a long-term and relatively homogenous warming trend, and do not require an external cause or change of the underlying dynamics of the system. This explanation is consistent with simulations from a 21-member regional climate model ensemble, in which four members display comparable abrupt temperature increases regionally driven by circulation and a long-term externally forced response. Overall, our analysis provides an observation-based interpretation of abrupt temperature change at the continental scale, associated hydroclimatic changes regionally, and its drivers. Furthermore, our method might contribute to improved mechanistic understanding of different observed climate phenomena in many regions of the world that experience high variability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000442869",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab86f2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/442869","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate variability||abrupt climate change||dynamical adjustment||climate change","Late 1980s abrupt cold season temperature change in Europe consistent with circulation variability and long-term warming",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-26T19:40:05Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85092312692",,,"000568318800001","Environ.

The extent to which human influence has played a role in the occurrence of these events has been of large interest to scientists, media and decision makers. However, the outstanding nature of these events poses challenges for physical and statistical modeling. Using an unprecedented number of climate model ensembles and statistical extreme value modeling, we demonstrate that these short and intense events would have had extremely small odds in the absence of human-induced climate change, and equivalently frequent events would have been 1.5 °C to 3 °C colder. For instance, in France and in The Netherlands, the July 3-day heatwave has a 50–150-year return period in the current climate and a return period of more than 1000 years without human forcing. The increase in the intensities is larger than the global warming by a factor 2 to 3. Finally, we note that the observed trends are much larger than those in current climate models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000444050",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/aba3d4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444050","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate change||heat wave||extreme event attribution","Human contribution to the record-breaking June and July 2019 heatwaves in Western Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-02T02:47:40Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85092301618",,,"000570701400001","Environ.

Changes in 'extreme extremes', i.e. events with only 1% probability of occurrence in the current climate are analysed, first as univariate extremes, and then when co-occurring with other types of extremes (i.e. events clusters) within the same week, month or year. The projections are analysed for present-day climate (+1 degrees C) and different levels of additional global warming (+1.5 degrees C, +2 degrees C, +3 degrees C). The results reveal substantial risk of occurrence of extreme events' clusters of different types across the globe at higher global warming levels. Hotspot regions for hot and dry clusters are mainly found in Brazil, i.e. in the Northeast and the Amazon rain forest, the Mediterranean region, and Southern Africa. Hotspot regions for wet and hot clusters are found in tropical Africa but also in the Sahel region, Indonesia, and in mountainous regions such as the Andes and the Himalaya.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000440127",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab90a7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/440127","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate extremes||CMIP6||compound events||events’ clusters||climate projections","Projected changes in hot, dry and wet extreme events' clusters in CMIP6 multi-model ensemble",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-12T02:52:27Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85094929796",,,"000563498700001","Environ.

The results reveal close similarity between both ensembles in the regional climate sensitivity of the projected multimodel mean changes in climate extremes, that is, their projected changes as a function of global warming. This stands in contrast to widely reported divergences in global (transient and equilibrium) climate sensitivity in the two multimodel ensembles. Some exceptions include higher warming in the South America monsoon region, lower warming in Southern Asia and Central Africa, and higher increases in heavy precipitation in Western Africa and the Sahel region in the CMIP6 ensemble. The multimodel spread in regional climate sensitivity is found to be large in both ensembles. In particular, it contributes more to intermodel spread in projected regional climate extremes compared with the intermodel spread in global climate sensitivity in CMIP6. Our results highlight the need to consider regional climate sensitivity as a distinct feature of Earth system models and a key determinant of projected regional impacts, which is largely independent of the models' response in global climate sensitivity.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000443824",,"2328-4277",,"10.1029/2019EF001474","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/443824","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","CMIP6||CMIP5||regional climate sensitivity||climate extremes||climate models||climate projections","Regional Climate Sensitivity of Climate Extremes in CMIP6 Versus CMIP5 Multimodel Ensembles",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-01T07:24:54Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate||Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach","617518||641816","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100007352","EC||SBFI","FP7||H2020",,,,"85091423950",,,"000576405800001",,"9","Earth's Future","8","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Maxima of long-term (1901–2013) daily precipitation records from a densely sampled Central European station network, spanning Austria, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands, are scaled with Northern Hemispheric and regional temperature anomalies. Scaling coefficients are estimated at station level and aggregated to infer a robust regional extreme precipitation – temperature relationship. Across Central Europe, an overall intensification and a positive scaling signal with Northern Hemispheric temperature is detected in annual, summer, and winter single-day to monthly maximum precipitation. Generally, the estimates are consistent also when only considering data after 1950, and the scaling of annual maxima is also significant for all individual countries but Austria. However, scaling magnitudes are found to vary considerably between seasons and subregions. Also, scaling with regional temperature is non-significant, except for winter extreme precipitation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000420798",,"2212-0947",,"10.1016/j.wace.2020.100266","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/420798","en","Elsevier","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Extreme precipitation||Climate change signal||Observational data||Extreme value statistics||Central Europe||Clausius-Clapeyron scaling","Observed extreme precipitation trends and scaling in Central Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-17T06:10:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Understanding and quantifying the occurrence of  very rare climate extremes in a changing climate","178778","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85088036148",,,"000566896900006",,,"Weather and Climate Extremes","29","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, datasets only represent selected aspects of the real world, so when they are used for a specific purpose they can be a source of uncertainty. Here, we present a framework for understanding this uncertainty of observational datasets which distinguishes three general sources of uncertainty: (1) uncertainty that arises during the generation of the dataset; (2) uncertainty due to biased samples; and (3) uncertainty that arises due to the choice of abstract properties, such as resolution and metric. Based on this framework, we identify four different types of dataset ensembles—parametric, structural, resampling, and property ensembles—as tools to understand and assess uncertainties arising from the use of datasets for a specific purpose. We advocate for a more systematic generation of dataset ensembles by using these sorts of tools. Finally, we discuss the use of dataset ensembles in climate model evaluation. We argue that a more systematic understanding and assessment of dataset uncertainty is needed to allow for a more reliable uncertainty assessment in the context of model evaluation. The more systematic use of such a framework would be beneficial for both scientific reasoning and scientific policy advice based on climate datasets.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000420193",,"1757-7780||1757-7799",,"10.1002/wcc.654","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/420193","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","climate datasets||dataset ensembles||framework||model evaluation||uncertainty","Understanding and assessing uncertainty of observational climate datasets for model evaluation using ensembles",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-13T05:18:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Combining theory with Big Data?

The majority of studies investigating potential climate benefits from forests have focused on forest area changes, while changes to forest management, in particular those affecting species composition, have received much less attention. Using a statistical model based on remote sensing observations over Europe, we show that broad-leaved tree species locally reduce land surface temperatures in summer compared to needle-leaved species. The summer mean cooling effect related to an increase in broad-leaved tree fraction of 80% is relatively modest (~ 0.3–0.75 K), but is amplified during exceptionally warm periods. The reduction of daily maximum temperatures during the hottest days reaches up to 1.8 K in the Atlantic region and up to 1.5 K in Continental and Mediterranean regions. Hot temperature extremes adversely affect humans and ecosystems and are expected to become more frequent in a future climate. Thus, forest management strategies aiming to increase the fraction of broad-leaved species could help to reduce some of the adverse local impacts caused by hot temperature extremes. However, the overall benefits and trade-offs related to an increase in the broad-leaved tree fraction in European forests needs to be further investigated and assessed carefully when adapting forest management strategies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000432984",,"2045-2322",,"10.1038/s41598-020-71055-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/432984","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Increasing the broad-leaved tree fraction in European forests mitigates hot temperature extremes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-08-27T17:47:37Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"CLimate IMPacts of Utilizing Land in Switzerland and Europe (CLIMPULSE)","172715","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,"79457327","85089817727",,,"000567058100006","Sci Rep",,"Scientific Reports","10","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the effect of latent heating on blocking formation and maintenance has not yet been fully elucidated. To explicitly study this cause-and-effect relationship, we perform sensitivity simulations of five selected blocking events with the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) global weather prediction model in which we artificially eliminate latent heating in clouds upstream of the blocking anticyclones. This elimination has substantial effects on the upper-tropospheric circulation in all case studies, but there is also significant case-to-case variability: some blocking systems do not develop at all without upstream latent heating, while for others the amplitude, size, and lifetime of the blocking anticyclones are merely reduced. This strong influence of latent heating on the midlatitude flow is due to the injection of air masses with low potential vorticity (PV) into the upper troposphere in strongly ascending “warm conveyor belt” airstreams and the interaction of the associated divergent outflow with the upper-level PV structure. The important influence of diabatic heating demonstrated with these experiments suggests that the accurate representation of moist processes in ascending airstreams in weather prediction and climate models is crucial for blocking dynamics.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456732",,"2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-1-405-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456732","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The sensitivity of atmospheric blocking to upstream latent heating – numerical experiments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-16T16:57:10Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Effects of latent heat release on atmospheric blocking: process understanding, model evaluation and potential impacts of climate change||Diabatic processes in North Atlantic weather systems: synoptic and mesoscale dynamics||An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","ETH-09 15-2||165941||787652","10.13039/501100003006||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780","ETHZ||SNF||EC","ETH Grants||H2020||Projekte MINT",,,,,,,,"Weather Clim.

The integrated assessment community has quantified anthropogenic emissions for the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios, each of which represents a different future socio-economic projection and political environment. Here, we provide the greenhouse gas concentrations for these SSP scenarios - using the reduced-complexity climate-carbon-cycle model MAGICC7.0. We extend historical, observationally based concentration data with SSP con- centration projections from 2015 to 2500 for 43 greenhouse gases with monthly and latitudinal resolution. CO2 concentrations by 2100 range from 393 to 1135 ppm for the lowest (SSP1-1.9) and highest (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios, respectively. We also provide the concentration extensions beyond 2100 based on assumptions regarding the trajectories of fossil fuels and land use change emissions, net negative emissions, and the fraction of non-CO2 emissions. By 2150, CO2 concentrations in the lowest emission scenario are approximately 350 ppm and approximately plateau at that level until 2500, whereas the highest fossil-fuel-driven scenario projects CO2 concentrations of 1737 ppm and reaches concentrations beyond 2000 ppm by 2250. We estimate that the share of CO2 in the total radiative forcing contribution of all considered 43 long-lived greenhouse gases increases from 66 % for the present day to roughly 68 % to 85 % by the time of maximum forcing in the 21st century. For this estimation, we updated simple radiative forcing parameterizations that reflect the Oslo Line-By-Line model results. In comparison to the representative concentration pathways (RCPs), the five main SSPs (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) are more evenly spaced and extend to lower 2100 radiative forcing and temperatures. Performing two pairs of six-member historical ensembles with CESM1.2.2, we estimate the effect on surface air temperatures of applying latitudinally and seasonally resolved GHG concentrations. We find that the ensemble differences in the March-April-May (MAM) season provide a regional warming in higher northern latitudes of up to 0.4 K over the historical period, latitudinally averaged of about 0.1 K, which we estimate to be comparable to the upper bound (similar to 5 % level) of natural variability. In comparison to the comparatively straight line of the last 2000 years, the greenhouse gas concentrations since the onset of the industrial period and this studies' projections over the next 100 to 500 years unequivocally depict a ""hockey-stick"" upwards shape. The SSP concentration time series derived in this study provide a harmonized set of input assumptions for long-term climate science analysis; they also provide an indication of the wide set of futures that societal developments and policy implementations can lead to - ranging from multiple degrees of future warming on the one side to approximately 1.5 degrees C warming on the other.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438998",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-13-3571-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438998","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) greenhouse gas concentrations and their extensions to 2500",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-08T03:24:15Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85092552445",,,"000562157100001","Geosci. model dev.","8","Geoscientific Model Development","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

PCF is defined as the condensation of liquid water in narrow capillaries below water saturation due to the inverse Kelvin effect, followed by either heterogeneous or homogeneous nucleation depending on the temperature regime and presence of an ice-nucleating active site. By using sol-gel synthesized silica with well-defined pore diameters, morphology and distinct chemical surface-functionalization, the role of the water-silica contact angle and pore width on PCF is investigated. We find that for the pore diameters (2.2-9.2 nm) and water contact angles (15-78 degrees) covered in this study, our results reveal that the water contact angle plays an important role in predicting the humidity required for pore filling, while the pore diameter determines the ability of pore water to freeze. For T > 235 K and below water saturation, pore diameters and water contact angles were not able to predict the freezing ability of the particles, suggesting an absence of active sites; thus ice nucleation did not proceed via a PCF mechanism. Rather, the ice-nucleating ability of the particles depended solely on chemical functionalization. Therefore, parameterizations for the ice-nucleating abilities of particles in cirrus conditions should differ from parameterizations at mixed-phase clouds conditions. Our results support PCF as the atmospherically relevant ice nucleation mechanism below water saturation when porous surfaces are encountered in the troposphere.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438995",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-9419-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438995","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The role of contact angle and pore width on pore condensation and freezing",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-08T03:23:29Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Elucidating Ice Nucleation Mechanisms Relevant to the Atmosphere: Is deposition nucleation really immersion freezing in pores?","156581","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85090533941",,,"000562139800001","Atmos. chem. phys.","15","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While the stratospheric forcing often projects onto the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the tropospheric response to SSW events, if any, is highly variable, and what determines the existence, location, timing, and strength of the downward impact remains an open question. We here explore how the variable tropospheric response to SSW events in the NAE region can be characterized in terms of a refined set of seven weather regimes and if the tropospheric flow in the North Atlantic region around the onset of SSW events is an indicator of the subsequent downward impact. The weather regime analysis reveals the Greenland blocking (GL) and Atlantic trough (AT) regimes as the most frequent large-scale patterns in the weeks following an SSW. While the GL regime is dominated by high pressure over Greenland, AT is dominated by a southeastward-shifted storm track in the North Atlantic. The flow evolution associated with GL and the associated cold conditions over Europe in the weeks following an SSW occur most frequently if a blocking situation over western Europe and the North Sea (European blocking) prevailed around the SSW onset. In contrast, an AT regime associated with mild conditions over Europe is more likely following the SSW event if GL occurs already around SSW onset. For the remaining tropospheric flow regimes during SSW onset we cannot identify a dominant flow evolution. Although it remains unclear what causes these relationships, the results suggest that specific tropospheric states in the days around the onset of the SSW are an indicator of the subsequent tropospheric flow evolution in the aftermath of an SSW, which could provide crucial guidance for subseasonal prediction.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000430990",,"2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-1-373-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/430990","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The role of North Atlantic–European weather regimes in the surface impact of sudden stratospheric warming events",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-08-11T07:31:10Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application","170523","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,,,,,"Weather Clim.

In this study, we analyse atmospheric dynamical drivers of anomalous poleward latent heat transport in the Arctic. Besides, we study the influence of anomalous moisture transport on surface temperature, cloud cover and precipitation. The correlation between weekly zonal mean poleward heat transport and temperature anomalies at 70°N shows a strong seasonal variation with moderate correlation between November and March and only very little correlation during summer. Analysing the relation between anomalous latent heat transport and synoptic weather features, we observed that from November till March the 10% most positive daily zonal mean latent heat transport at 70°N are linked to strong positive cyclone anomalies over the Greenlandic east coast as well as positive blocking anomalies to the west of Scandinavia. These anomalous transports further lead to increased surface temperatures in the Barents and Kara Seas and strongly influence cloud cover, precipitation and atmospheric water vapor content in the Arctic (≥ 70°N).  In a second part of the study we investigate the formation of anomalous moisture transport into the Arctic by analysing a large ensemble of 8-day backward trajectories which contributed to an anomalous positive moisture transport at 70°N. We found that the largest contribution to the poleward moisture flux at 70°N originates from the Atlantic sector. Furthermore, moisture is predominantly taken up north of 45°N – more than 83% of the moisture contributing to (moisture) transport at 70°N originates from the latitude segment between 45 - 70°N.  Moreover, we analysed the thermodynamic evolution of air masses from the start of the moisture uptake until reaching 70°N by classifying the air masses according to their absolute change in temperature and potential temperature. Approximately one third of the air masses experience net diabatic cooling with no significant vertical motion. These air masses typically originate from a climatologically warmer region and are transported northward into a colder area (leading to an intense warm anomaly at roughly 800 hPa). Another 30% of the trajectories experience intense diabatic heating in combination with a strong ascending motion. These trajectories reach the Arctic at 70°N at a median height of 700 hPa with a potential temperature anomaly of almost 10 K. The remaining fraction of trajectories shows a net temperature increase caused by subsidence-induced adiabatic heating.

Here I investigate the representation of the global energy balance in 40 state-of-the-art global climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). In the CMIP6 multi-model mean, the magnitudes of the energy balance components are often in better agreement with recent reference estimates compared to earlier model generations on a global mean basis. However, the inter-model spread in the representation of many of the components remains substantial, often on the order of 10–20 Wm−2 globally, except for aspects of the shortwave clear-sky budgets, which are now more consistently simulated by the CMIP6 models. The substantial inter-model spread in the simulated global mean latent heat fluxes in the CMIP6 models, exceeding 20% (18 Wm−2), further implies also large discrepancies in their representation of the global water balance. From a historic perspective of model development over the past decades, the largest adjustments in the magnitudes of the simulated present-day global mean energy balance components occurred in the shortwave atmospheric clear-sky absorption and the surface downward longwave radiation. Both components were gradually adjusted upwards over several model generations, on the order of 10 Wm−2, to reach 73 and 344 Wm−2, respectively in the CMIP6 multi-model means. Thereby, CMIP6 has become the first model generation that largely remediates long-standing model deficiencies related to an overestimation in surface downward shortwave and compensational underestimation in downward longwave radiation in its multi-model mean.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000418579",,"0930-7575||1432-0894",,"10.1007/s00382-020-05282-7","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/418579","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The global energy balance as represented in CMIP6 climate models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-05T13:31:32Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: absorption of solar radiation||Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: temporal variation of solar radiation in the climate system||Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: causes of decadal changes of solar radiation","135395||159938||188601","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||Projekte MINT||Projekte MINT",,,,"85085524563",,,"000535379300001","Clim Dyn","3","Climate Dynamics","55","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Regional landslide early warning systems (LEWS) have proven to be a cost-efficient tool to inform the public about the imminent landslide danger. While most operational LEWS are based on rainfall exceedance thresholds only, recent studies have demonstrated an improvement of the forecast quality after the inclusion of soil hydrological information. In this study, the potential of in situ soil moisture measurements for regional landslide early warning is assessed. For the first time, a comprehensive soil moisture measurement database was compiled for Switzerland and compared with a national landslide database (Swiss flood and landslide damage database, WSL). The time series were homogenized and normalized to represent saturation values. From ensembles of sensors, the mean and standard deviation saturation were calculated and infiltration events were delimited, characterized, and classified as landslide-triggering or non-triggering based on the occurrence of landslides within a specified forecast distance. A logistic regression function was applied to model the landslide activity based on the infiltration event characteristics and several models were analysed and compared with receiver operating characteristics (ROC). A strong distance dependence becomes apparent showing a forecast goodness decrease with increasing distance between water content measurement site and landslide, and a better forecast goodness for long-lasting as opposed to short-duration precipitation events. While most variability can be explained by the two event properties antecedent saturation and change of saturation during an infiltration event, event properties that describe antecedent conditions are more important for long-lasting as opposed to short-duration precipitation events that can be better explained by properties describing event dynamics. Overall, the analysis demonstrated that in situ soil moisture data effectively contains specific information useful for landslide early warning.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000412170",,"1612-510X",,"10.1007/s10346-020-01400-y","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/412170","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Landslide early warning||Shallow landslides||Soil moisture monitoring||Hydrological thresholds||Temporal soil moisture variability","Assessing the potential of soil moisture measurements for regional landslide early warning",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-04-29T03:03:33Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85083794103",,,"000526197200001",,,"Landslides","17","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Stratiform clouds form by convective detrainment, turbulent vertical diffusion, and large‐scale ascent. For each process, the corresponding cloud fraction is calculated, and the individual updraft velocities are used to determine cloud droplet/ice crystal number concentrations. Further, convective condensate is always detrained as supercooled cloud droplets at mixed‐phase temperatures (between 235 and 273 K), and convectively detrained ice crystal number concentrations are calculated based on the updraft velocity. Finally, the new scheme explicitly calculates condensation/evaporation and deposition/sublimation rates for phase‐change calculations. The new cloud scheme simulates a reasonable present‐day climate, reduces the previously overestimated cirrus cloud fraction, and in general improves the simulation of ice clouds. The model simulates the observed in‐cloud supersaturation for cirrus clouds, and it allows for a better representation of the tropical to extra‐tropical ratio of the longwave cloud radiative effect. Further, the ice water path, the ice crystal number concentrations, and the supercooled liquid fractions in mixed‐phase clouds agree better with observations in the new model than in the reference model. Ice crystal formation is dominated by the liquid‐origin processes of convective detrainment and homogeneous freezing of cloud droplets. The simulated ice clouds strongly depend on model tuning choices, in particular, the enhancement of the aggregation rate of ice crystals.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438610",,"1942-2466",,"10.1029/2019MS001824","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438610","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","clouds||climate model||cloud cover||ice clouds||cloud microphysics","Developing a Cloud Scheme With Prognostic Cloud Fraction and Two Moment Microphysics for ECHAM‐HAM",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-04T20:15:20Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Climate Engineering by Arctic Winter Cirrus Thinning: Risks and Feasibility (AWiCiT)","166726","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85089832060",,,"000566209200012",,"8","Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the long-term ground-based and satellite ozone profile trends reported in the literature show a high variability. There are multiple reasons for variability in the reported long-term trends such as the measurement timing and the dataset quality.  The Payerne Switzerland microwave radiometer (MWR) ozone trends are significantly positive at 2 % to 3 % per decade in the upper stratosphere (5–1 hPa, 35–48 km), with a high variation with altitude. This is in accordance with the Northern Hemisphere (NH) trends reported by other ground-based instruments in the SPARC LOTUS project. In order to determine what part of the variability between different datasets comes from measurement timing, Payerne MWR and SOCOL v3.0 chemistry–climate model (CCM) trends were estimated for each hour of the day with a multiple linear regression model. Trends were quantified as a function of local solar time (LST). In the middle and upper stratosphere, differences as a function of LST are reported for both the MWR and simulated trends for the post-2000 period. However, these differences are not significant at the 95 % confidence level. In the lower mesosphere (1–0.1 hPa, 48–65 km), the 2010–2018 day- and nighttime trends have been considered. Here again, the variation in the trend with LST is not significant at the 95 % confidence level. Based on these results we conclude that significant trend differences between instruments cannot be attributed to a systematic temporal sampling effect.  The dataset quality is of primary importance in a reliable trend derivation, and multi-instrument comparison analyses can be used to assess the long-term stability of data records by estimating the drift and bias of instruments. The Payerne MWR dataset has been homogenized to ensure a stable measurement contribution to the ozone profiles and to take into account the effects of three major instrument upgrades. At each instrument upgrade, a correction offset has been calculated using parallel measurements or simultaneous measurements by an independent instrument. At pressure levels smaller than 0.59 hPa (above ∼50 km), the homogenization corrections to be applied to the Payerne MWR ozone profiles are dependent on LST. Due to the lack of reference measurements with a comparable measurement contribution at a high time resolution, a comprehensive homogenization of the sub-daily ozone profiles was possible only for pressure levels larger than 0.59 hPa.  The ozone profile dataset from the Payerne MWR, Switzerland, was compared with profiles from the GROMOS MWR in Bern, Switzerland, satellite instruments (MLS, MIPAS, HALOE, SCHIAMACHY, GOMOS), and profiles simulated by the SOCOL v3.0 CCM. The long-term stability and mean biases of the time series were estimated as a function of the measurement time (day- and nighttime). The homogenized Payerne MWR ozone dataset agrees within ±5 % with the MLS dataset over the 30 to 65 km altitude range and within ±10 % of the HARMonized dataset of OZone profiles (HARMOZ, limb and occultation measurements from ENVISAT) over the 30 to 65 km altitude range. In the upper stratosphere, there is a large nighttime difference between Payerne MWR and other datasets, which is likely a result of the mesospheric signal aliasing with lower levels in the stratosphere due to a lower vertical resolution at that altitude. Hence, the induced bias at 55 km is considered an instrumental artifact and is not further analyzed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000430438",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-8453-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/430438","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Study of the dependence of long-term stratospheric ozone trends on local solar time",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-08-07T02:51:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85092518852",,,"000552228600002||000552228600002","Atmos. chem. phys.","14","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study examines the conditions and processes that made this particular thunderstorm episode exceptional, with a particular focus on the interaction of processes across scales.  During the episode, a blocking situation persisted over northern Europe. Initially, the southwesterly flow on the western flank of the blocking anticyclone induced the advection of warm, moist, and unstably stratified air masses. Due to the low-pressure gradient associated with the blocking anticyclone, these air masses were trapped in western and central Europe, remained almost stationary, and prevented a significant air mass exchange. In addition, the weak geopotential height gradients led to predominantly weak flow conditions in the mid-troposphere and thus to low vertical wind shear that prevented thunderstorms from developing into severe organized systems. Due to a weak propagation speed in combination with high rain rates, several thunderstorms were able to accumulate enormous amounts of precipitation that affected local-scale areas and triggered several torrential flash floods.  Atmospheric blocking also increased the upper-level cut-off low frequency on its upstream regions, which was up to 10 times higher than the climatological mean. Together with filaments of positive potential vorticity (PV), the cut-offs provided the mesoscale setting for the development of a large number of thunderstorms. During the 22 d study period, more than 50 % of lightning strikes can be linked to a nearby cut-off low or PV filament. The exceptionally persistent low stability over 3 weeks combined with a weak wind speed in the mid-troposphere has not been observed during the past 30 years.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456724",,"2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-1-325-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456724","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The role of large-scale dynamics in an exceptional sequence of severe thunderstorms in Europe May–June 2018",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-16T16:12:33Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Weather Clim.

This event set was further combined with eyewitness reports, environmental conditions, and synoptic-scale fronts based on the ERA-Interim (ECMWF Reanalysis) reanalysis. Our analyses reveal that on average about a quarter of all severe thunderstorms in the investigation area were associated with a front. Over complex terrains, such as in southern Germany, the proportion of frontal convective storms is around 10 %–15 %, while over flat terrain half of the events require a front to trigger convection.  Frontal storm tracks associated with hail on average produce larger hailstones and have a longer track. These events usually develop in a high-shear environment. Using composites of environmental conditions centered around the hailstorm tracks, we found that dynamical proxies such as deep-layer shear or storm-relative helicity become important when separating hail diameters and, in particular, their lengths; 0–3 km helicity as a dynamical proxy performs better compared to wind shear for the separation. In contrast, thermodynamical proxies such as the lifted index or lapse rate show only small differences between the different intensity classes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000424108",,"1561-8633||1684-9981",,"10.5194/nhess-20-1867-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424108","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Ambient conditions prevailing during hail events in central Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-01T15:11:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85087622651",,,"000546064100001","Nat. hazards earth syst. sci.","6","Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, previous assessments of observed warming-induced changes in dryness have not excluded natural climate variability and show conflicting results due to uncertainties in our understanding of the response of evapotranspiration. Here we employ data-driven and land-surface models to produce observation-based global reconstructions of water availability from 1902 to 2014, a period during which our planet experienced a global warming of approximately 1 °C. Our analysis reveals a spatial pattern of changes in average water availability during the driest month of the year over the past three decades compared with the first half of the twentieth century, with some regions experiencing increased and some decreased water availability. The global pattern is consistent with climate model estimates that account for anthropogenic effects, and it is not expected from natural climate variability, supporting human-induced climate change as the cause. There is regional evidence of drier dry seasons predominantly in extratropical latitudes and including Europe, western North America, northern Asia, southern South America, Australia and eastern Africa. We also find that the intensification of the dry season is generally a consequence of increasing evapotranspiration rather than decreasing precipitation.",,,,"1752-0908||1752-0894",,"10.1038/s41561-020-0594-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/425674","en","Nature Publishing Group",,,,"Observed changes in dry-season water availability attributed to human-induced climate change",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-07-10T03:03:33Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85087362907",,,"000544997400008","Nat.

Therefore, processes related to near-surface turbulence and wave breaking, such as sea spray emission and air-sea gas exchange, are often parameterised with wind speed. Thus, shipborne wind speed measurements provide highly relevant observations. They can, however, be compromised by flow distortion due to the ship's structure and objects near the anemometer that modify the airflow, leading to a deflection of the apparent wind direction and positive or negative acceleration of the apparent wind speed. The resulting errors in the estimated true wind speed can be greatly magnified at low wind speeds. For some research ships, correction factors have been derived from computational fluid dynamic models or through direct comparison with wind speed measurements from buoys. These correction factors can, however, lose their validity due to changes in the structures near the anemometer and, thus, require frequent re-evaluation, which is costly in either computational power or ship time. Here, we evaluate if global atmospheric reanalysis data can be used to quantify the flow distortion bias in shipborne wind speed measurements. The method is tested on data from the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition onboard the R/V Akademik Tryoshnikov, which are compared to ERA-5 reanalysis wind speeds. We find that, depending on the relative wind direction, the relative wind speed and direction measurements are biased by -37 % to +22 % and -17 degrees to +11 degrees respectively. The resulting error in the true wind speed is +11.5 % on average but ranges from -4 % to +41 % (5th and 95th percentile). After applying the bias correction, the uncertainty in the true wind speed is reduced to +/- 5 % and depends mainly on the average accuracy of the ERA-5 data over the period of the experiment. The obvious drawback of this approach is the potential intrusion of model biases in the correction factors. We show that this problem can be somewhat mitigated when the error propagation in the true wind correction is accounted for and used to weight the observations. We discuss the potential caveats and limitations of this approach and conclude that it can be used to quantify flow distortion bias for ships that operate on a global scale. The method can also be valuable to verify computational fluid dynamic studies of airflow distortion on research vessels.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000426914",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-13-3487-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/426914","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Using global reanalysis data to quantify and correct airflow distortion bias in shipborne wind speed measurements",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-19T02:34:46Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic UnderStanding","603445","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7",,,,"85088494230",,,"000545953600002","Atmos. meas. tech.","6","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Despite the importance of this heat budget, heat uptake by inland waters has so far not been quantified. Here we use a unique combination of global‐scale lake models, global hydrological models and Earth system models to quantify global heat uptake by natural lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. The total net heat uptake by inland waters amounts to 2.6 ± 3.2 ×1020 J over the period 1900–2020, corresponding to 3.6% of the energy stored on land. The overall uptake is dominated by natural lakes (111.7%), followed by reservoir warming (2.3%). Rivers contribute negatively (‐14%) due to a decreasing water volume. The thermal energy of water stored in artificial reservoirs exceeds inland water heat uptake by a factor ∼10.4. This first quantification underlines that the heat uptake by inland waters is relatively small, but non‐negligible.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000423688",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2020GL087867","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/423688","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","heat uptake||inland waters||lakes||rivers||reservoirs","Global Heat Uptake by Inland Waters",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-30T03:33:33Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85086801800",,,"000551464800012","Geophys.

We found that J(z) is enhanced (by more than 3.5 pA/m(2)) in radon source and polar regions. Contribution of Rn-222 is essential at middle and low latitudes/altitudes where GCR-induced air conductivity is reduced. The model results are in good agreement with the available observations.

The INP sources at these latitudes are very poorly defined, but it is known that there are substantial dust sources across the high latitudes, such as Iceland. Here, we show that Icelandic dust emissions are sporadically an important source of INPs at mid to high latitudes by combining ice-nucleating active site density measurements of aircraft-collected Icelandic dust samples with a global aerosol model. Because Iceland is only one of many high-latitude dust sources, we anticipate that the combined effect of all these sources may strongly contribute to the INP population in the mid- and high-latitude northern hemisphere. This is important because these emissions are directly relevant for the cloud-phase climate feedback and because high-latitude dust emissions are expected to increase in a warmer climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000425958",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.aba8137","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/425958","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Iceland is an episodic source of atmospheric ice-nucleating particles relevant for mixed-phase clouds",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-12T04:09:13Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85087486281",,,"000543504100032","Sci Adv","26","Science Advances","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Scaling results are presented, which were performed on the fastest supercomputer in Europe, Piz Daint (Top 500, November 2018). Important choices for the model configuration at this unprecedented resolution for the IFS are discussed such as the use of hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic equations or the time resolution of physical phenomena which is defined by the length of the time step.

Despite conflicting evidence, immersion freezing by BC particles is included in several cloud models. Here we show that fossil fuel soot and commercially available hydrocarbon BC is inactive as immersion freezing nuclei for atmospherically relevant particle sizes and surface areas. Instead, temperatures <235 K are necessary for freezing droplets with immersed soot particles, implying homogeneous freezing, rather than immersion freezing by soot. A comparison of the results to previous studies using larger soot aggregates and dust reveals the ineffectiveness of soot as immersion ice nucleating particles. We conclude that soot particles with properties like those investigated here can be neglected for simulating ice nucleation in mixed‐phase clouds.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000421473",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2019GL086764","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/421473","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Black Carbon Particles Do Not Matter for Immersion Mode Ice Nucleation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-21T02:58:38Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Laboratory studies on the ice nucleation properties of fresh  and aged mineral dust aerosols","150169","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)",,,,"85086446134",,,"000543387400018","Geophys.

However, estimates of global atmospheric Se fluxes are highly uncertain. To constrain these uncertainties, we use a global model of atmospheric Se cycling and a database of more than 600 sites where Se in aerosol has been measured. Applying Bayesian inference techniques, we determine the probability distributions of global Se emissions from the four major sources: anthropogenic activities, volcanoes, marine biosphere, and terrestrial biosphere. Between 29 and 36 Gg of Se are emitted to the atmosphere every year, doubling previous estimates of emissions. Using emission parameters optimized by aerosol network measurements, our model shows good agreement with the aerosol Se observations (R2 = 0.66), as well as with independent aerosol (0.59) and wet deposition measurements (0.57). Both model and measurements show a decline in Se over North America in the last two decades because of changes in technology and energy policy. Our results highlight the role of the ocean as a net atmospheric Se sink, with around 7 Gg yr–1 of Se transferred from land through the atmosphere. The constrained Se emissions represent a substantial step forward in understanding the global Se cycle.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000422273",,"0013-936X||1520-5851",,"10.1021/acs.est.0c01408","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/422273","en","American Chemical Society","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Constraining Atmospheric Selenium Emissions Using Observations, Global Modeling, and Bayesian Inference",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-24T22:16:49Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85086524637",,,"000542229600014","Environ.

Measurements with the Portable Ice Nucleation Chamber (PINC) were conducted at 242 K and 105 % relative humidity with respect to water. The median INP number concentration [INP] during a 6-week measurement period was 13 L−1. The [INP] spanned 3 orders of magnitude and showed a general increase from mid-February until early April. No single dominant local or regional sources of INPs in the boreal environment of southern Finland could be identified. Rather, it is hypothesised that the INPs detected at SMEAR II are a result of long-range transport and dilution of INPs sourced far from the measurement site. Despite high variability, the measured [INP] values fall within the range expected for the [INP] measured elsewhere under similar thermodynamic conditions. The [INP] did not correlate with any of the examined parameters during the entire field campaign, indicating that no one single parameter can be used to predict the [INP] at the measurement location during the examined time period. The absence of a correlation across the entire field campaign also suggests that a variety of particles act as INPs at different times, although it was indirectly determined that ambient INPs are most likely within the size range of 0.1–0.5 µm in diameter on average. On shorter timescales, several particle species correlated well with the [INP]. Depending on the meteorological conditions, black carbon (BC), supermicron biological particles and sub-0.1 µm particles, most likely nanoscale biological fragments such as ice-nucleating macromolecules (INMs), correlated with the INP signal. However, an increase in the concentration of any of these particle species may not necessarily lead to the increase in the [INP]; the reasons for this remain unknown. Limitations of the instrumental set-up and the necessity for future field INP studies are addressed.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000422258",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-6687-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/422258","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Condensation/immersion mode ice-nucleating particles in a boreal environment",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-24T22:00:32Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Quantifying atmospheric ice nucleating particle (INP) concentrations via advances in measurement techniques and field studies of ice nucleation","751470","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85086762467",,,"000538775000002","Atmos. chem. phys.","11","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Besides refining the representation of the atmospheric dynamics and enabling the use of explicit convection, this will also provide higher resolution in the representation of orography. This study investigates the influence of these resolution increments on the simulation of orographic moist convection. Nine days of fair-weather thermally driven flow over the Alps are analyzed. Two sets of simulations with the COSMO model are compared, each consisting of three runs at Dx of 4.4, 2.2, and 1.1 km: one set using a fixed representation of orography at a resolution of 8.8 km, and one with varying representation at the resolution of the computational mesh. The spatial distribution of precipitation during daytime is only marginally affected by the orographic details, but nighttime convection to the south of the Alps-triggered by cold-air outflow from the valleys-is very sensitive to orography and precipitation is enhanced if more detailed orography is provided. During daytime, the onset of precipitation is delayed. The amplitude of the diurnal cycle of precipitation is reduced, even though more moisture converges toward the Alpine region during the afternoon. The hereby accumulated moisture sustains precipitation during the evening and nighttime over the surrounding plains. For these differences, the effects of changes in orographic detail are more important than changes in grid spacing. In addition, the individual convective cells are weaker, but their number increases with higher resolved orography. © 2020 American Meteorological Society",,,,"1520-0493||0027-0644",,"10.1175/MWR-D-19-0247.1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/428698","en","American Meteorological Society",,,,"The influence of the resolution of orography on the simulation of orographic moist convection",,"Journal Article","Metadata only",,,,"2020-07-28T02:56:53Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Cloud-resolving climate modeling on future supercomputing platform","154486","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Sinergia",,,,"85088225164",,,"000612527200009","Mon.

The simulated domain is large enough, urn:x-wiley:jame:media:jame21100:jame21100-math-0001 km2), to develop typical mesoscale cellular convective structures. We find that a maximum friction induced by momentum transport (MT) locates in the cloud layer for an increase of geostrophic wind with height (forward shear, FW) and near the surface for a decrease of wind with height (backward shear, BW). Although the total MT always acts as a friction, the interaction of friction‐induced cross‐isobaric flow with the Coriolis force can develop supergeostrophic winds near the surface (FW) or in the cloud layer (BW). The contribution of convection to MT is evaluated by decomposing the momentum flux by column water vapor and eddy size, revealing that CMT acts to accelerate subcloud layer winds under FW shear and that mesoscale circulations contribute significantly to MT for this horizontal resolution (250 m), even if small‐scale eddies are nonnegligible and likely more important as resolution increases. Under FW shear, a deeper boundary layer and faster cloud transition are simulated, because MT acts to increase surface fluxes and wind shear enhances turbulent mixing across cloud tops. Our results show that the coupling between winds and convection is crucial for a range of problems, from CAO lifetime and cloud transitions to ocean heat loss and near‐surface wind variability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000424127",,"1942-2466",,"10.1029/2019MS001991","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424127","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The Influence of Convective Momentum Transport and Vertical Wind Shear on the Evolution of a Cold Air Outbreak",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-02T02:50:34Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85086838452",,,"000545694700004",,"6","Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems","12","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

There is a gap, spanning 1–2 orders of magnitude, in the strength of events between directly observed and reconstructed ones. Here, we study the proxy method sensitivity to identify extreme solar particle events (SPEs). First, the strongest directly observed SPE (23 February 1956), used as a reference for proxy‐based reconstructions, was revisited using the newly developed method. Next, sensitivity of the cosmogenic‐isotope method to detect a reference SPE was assessed against the precision and number of individual isotopic records, showing that it is too weak by a factor ≈30 to be reliably identified in a single record. Uncertainties of 10Be and 14C data are shown to be dominated by local/regional patterns and measurement errors, respectively. By combining several proxy records, a SPE 4–5 times stronger than the reference one can be potentially detected, increasing the present‐day sensitivity by an order of magnitude. This will allow filling the observational gap in SPE strength distribution, thus enriching statistics of extreme events from 3–4 presently known ones to several tens. This will provide a solid basis for research in the field of extreme events, both for fundamental science, namely solar and stellar physics, and practical applications, such as the risk assessments of severe space‐based hazards for modern technological society.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000424393",,"0148-0227||2169-9380||2169-9402",,"10.1029/2020JA027921","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424393","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","solar energetic particles||extreme events||cosmogenic isotopes","Revisited Reference Solar Proton Event of 23 February 1956: Assessment of the Cosmogenic-Isotope Method Sensitivity to Extreme Solar Events",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-04T03:01:43Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85087057210",,,"000545696000012","J. geophys. res.

Here, we quantify changes in the frequency and persistence of the Central European large‐scale circulation types using various climate models. Independent of the circulation type, the models project warmer and drier future summer conditions in Central Europe, but no consistent shift to a more persistent summer or winter circulation. Most of the frequency and persistence changes are small and either within the internal variability or inconsistent across models. The model projections in this study do not support the claim of more persistent weather over Central Europe. Reconciling the results of different approaches and classifications is therefore critical to understand and predict changes in extreme weather over Europe.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000415872",,"0094-8276||1944-8007",,"10.1029/2019GL086132","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/415872","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","Frequency||Persistence||Atmosphere||Circulation||Central||Europe","Lack of Change in the Projected Frequency and Persistence of Atmospheric Circulation Types Over Central Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-05-20T02:58:35Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85084424292",,,"000536639500043","Geophys.

Often, severe impacts relate to the joint spatial and temporal extent of the heatwaves, but most research so far focuses either on spatial or temporal attributes of heatwaves. Furthermore, sensitivity of heatwaves characteristics to the choice of the heatwave thresholds in a warming climate are rarely discussed. Here, we analyze the largest spatiotemporal moderate heatwaves—that is, three‐dimensional (space‐time) clusters of hot days—in simulations of global climate models. We use three different hazard thresholds to define a hot day: fixed thresholds (time‐invariant climatological thresholds), seasonally moving thresholds based on changes in the summer means, and fully moving thresholds (hot days defined relative to the future climatology). We find a substantial increase of spatiotemporally contiguous moderate heatwaves with global warming using fixed thresholds, whereas changes for the other two hazard thresholds are much less pronounced. In particular, no or very little changes in the overall magnitude, spatial extent, and duration are detected when heatwaves are defined relative to the future climatology using a temporally fully moving threshold. This suggests a dominant contribution of thermodynamic compared to dynamic effects in global climate model simulations. The similarity between seasonally moving and fully moving thresholds indicates that seasonal mean warming alone can explain large parts of the warming of extremes. The strong sensitivity of simulated future heatwaves to hazard thresholds should be considered in the projections of potential future heat‐related impacts. Plain Language Summary  Heatwaves, such as the worldwide events that occurred in 2018 and 2019, can be associated with substantial impacts on humans, ecosystems, and the economy. These impacts are often caused by the joint temporal and spatial dimensions of the events. However, these properties of the heatwaves are rarely studied jointly. Furthermore, heatwaves are often defined based on exceedance above a fixed threshold, which might overestimate future heatwave impacts in a warming climate. Therefore, we compute here moderate heatwaves considering their true time‐space structure based on three hazard thresholds. We then investigate future changes of these moderate heatwaves for different warming levels. We detect a strong increase in the overall magnitude, spatial extent, and duration of heatwaves if we use fixed hazard thresholds. In the case with seasonally and fully moving hazard thresholds, we find no or only little changes of heatwave characteristics. This strong threshold sensitivity should be considered when estimating impacts associated with future heatwaves in a warming climate.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000415871",,,,"10.1029/2019JD032070","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/415871","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","heatwave||adaptation||temperature extremes||climate projections||CMIP5","Development of Future Heatwaves for Different Hazard Thresholds",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-05-20T02:58:35Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85084466042",,,"000536605500024",,"9","Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","125","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Our interest lies in classifying these particles in order to compute the statistics needed for understanding clouds. Given the large volume of collected data, this raises the need for an automated classification approach. Traditional classification methods that require extracting features manually (e.g., decision trees and support vector machines) show reasonable performance when trained and tested on data coming from a unique dataset. However, they often have difficulties in generalizing to test sets coming from other datasets where the distribution of the features might be significantly different. In practice, we found that for holographic imagers each new dataset requires labeling a huge amount of data by hand using those methods. Convolutional neural networks have the potential to overcome this problem due to their ability to learn complex nonlinear models directly from the images instead of pre-engineered features, as well as by relying on powerful regularization techniques. We show empirically that a convolutional neural network trained on cloud particles from holographic imagers generalizes well to unseen datasets. Moreover, fine tuning the same network with a small number (256) of training images improves the classification accuracy. Thus, the automated classification with a convolutional neural network not only reduces the hand-labeling effort for new datasets but is also no longer the main error source for the classification of small particles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000415087",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-13-2219-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/415087","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","neural network||holography","A convolutional neural network for classifying cloud particles recorded by imaging probes",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-05-15T10:27:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Exploiting orographic clouds for constraining the sources of ice crystals","175824","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85084733836",,,"000535175300001","Atmos. meas. tech.","5","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Previous studies that analyzed modifications of cirrus clouds by seeding of ice nucleating particles showed large uncertainties in both cloud and surface climate responses, ranging from no effect or even a small warming to a globally averaged cooling of about 2.5 °C. We use two general circulation models that showed very different responses in previous studies, ECHAM6-HAM and CESM-CAM5, to determine which radiative and climatic responses to cirrus cloud seeding in a 1.5 × CO2 world are common and which are not. Seeding reduces the net cirrus radiative effect for −1.8 W m−2 in CESM compared with only −0.8 W m−2 in ECHAM. Accordingly, the surface temperature decrease is larger in CESM, counteracting about 70% of the global mean temperature increase due to CO2 and only 30% in ECHAM. While seeding impacts on mean precipitation were addressed in past studies, we are the first to analyze extreme precipitation responses to cirrus seeding. Seeding decreases the frequency of the most extreme precipitation globally. However, the extreme precipitation events occur more frequently in the Sahel and Central America, following the mean precipitation increase due to a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. In addition, we use a quadratic climate damage metric to evaluate the amount of CO2-induced damage cirrus seeding can counteract. Seeding decreases the damage by about 50% in ECHAM, and by 85% in CESM over the 21 selected land regions. Climate damage due to CO2 increase is significantly reduced as a result of seeding in all of the considered land regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000414980",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab71a3","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/414980","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Geoengineering||Cirrus clouds||Cirrus cloud seeding||Cirrus cloud thinning||Climate damage||Precipitation extremes||Climate modeling","To what extent can cirrus cloud seeding counteract global warming?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-05-15T07:48:22Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85085271614",,,"000529890300001","Environ.

This tests CMIP5 models' ability to describe the radiative energy partitioning, which is fundamental to our understanding of the current climate and its future changes. We use 15 years of the monthly Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF) product, alongside other satellite, reanalysis, and surface station products. We find that the CMIP5 multimodel mean is generally within the reference product range, with annual mean CMIP5 multimodel mean—EBAF of −0.5 W m−2 for top‐of‐the‐atmosphere reflected shortwave radiation, and 4.6 W m−2 in outgoing longwave radiation over West Africa. However, the range in annual mean of the model seasonal cycles is large (37.2 and 34.0 W m−2 for reflected shortwave radiation and outgoing longwave radiation, respectively). We use seasonal and regional contrasts in all‐sky fluxes to infer that the representation of the West African monsoon in numerical models affects radiative energy partitioning. Using clear‐sky surface fluxes, we find that the models tend to have more downwelling shortwave and less downwelling longwave radiation than EBAF, consistent with past research. We find models that are drier and have lower aerosol loading tend to show the largest differences. We find evidence that aerosol variability has a larger effect in modulating downwelling shortwave radiation than water vapor in EBAF, while the opposite effect is seen in the majority of CMIP5 models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000418039",,"2333-5084",,"10.1029/2019EA001017","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/418039","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","TOA radiation flux||CMIP5||West African monsoon||water vapor||aerosols","Observed and CMIP5‐Simulated Radiative Flux Variability Over West Africa",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-04T02:37:42Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85085497925",,,"000537134000016",,"5","Earth and Space Science","7","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In order to elucidate the formation of these anticyclones and the role of diabatic processes, we trace air parcels backwards from the upper-tropospheric anticyclones and quantify the diabatic heating in these air parcels. Around 25 %–45 % of the air parcels are diabatically heated during the last 3 d prior to their arrival in the upper-tropospheric anticyclones, and this amount increases to 35 %–50 % for the last 7 d. The influence of diabatic heating is larger for heat-wave-related anticyclones in northern Europe and western Russia and smaller in southern Europe. Interestingly, the diabatic heating occurs in two geographically separated air streams; 3 d prior to arrival, one heating branch (remote branch) is located above the western North Atlantic, and the other heating branch (nearby branch) is located over northwestern Africa and Europe to the southwest of the target upper-tropospheric anticyclone. The diabatic heating in the remote branch is related to warm conveyor belts in North Atlantic cyclones upstream of the evolving upper-level ridge. In contrast, the nearby branch is diabatically heated by convection, as indicated by elevated mixed-layer convective available potential energy along the western side of the matured upper-level ridge. Most European regions are influenced by both branches, whereas western Russia is predominantly affected by the nearby branch. The remote branch predominantly affects the formation of the upper-tropospheric anticyclone, and therefore of the heat wave, whereas the nearby branch is more active during its maintenance. For long-lasting heat waves, the remote branch regenerates. The results from this study show that the dynamical processes leading to heat waves may be sensitive to small-scale microphysical and convective processes, whose accurate representation in models is thus supposed to be crucial for heat wave predictions on weather and climate timescales.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456733",,"2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-1-191-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456733","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A Lagrangian analysis of upper-tropospheric anticyclones associated with heat waves in Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-16T17:23:07Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Weather Clim.

It can be measured with different techniques; weighable lysimeters can provide very accurate measurements, and some very long‐term time series exist. However, these lysimeter time series are affected by data gaps that must be filled to estimate actual ET totals and long‐term trends. In this paper, we explore four different gap‐filling methods: the potential ET‐method, the ratio method, the FAO‐based water balance method, and HYDRUS modeling. These gap‐filling methods were evaluated for three time series of actual ET measured by lysimeters and meteorological data of three European sites. Separate evaluations were made for the five driest and five wettest April–October periods to investigate whether the performance of the gap‐filling methods was affected by hydrological conditions. Series of random gaps were artificially created for the three time series, including gaps of four different lengths. Actual ET was estimated for these gaps with the gap‐filling methods, which were evaluated based on RMSE and mean bias error. The results show that the ratio method outperformed other methods for gap filling of lysimeter data for Basel (Switzerland), whereas the HYDRUS method outperformed other methods for Rheindahlen (Germany). For Rietholzbach (Switzerland), the different methods performed very similarly, except that the FAO method gives slightly larger RMSEs. The gap‐filling methods do not perform very differently for dry and wet conditions. The ratio method is recommended for filling smaller gaps, and the HYDRUS method is recommended for longer gaps of 30 d.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000428260",,"1539-1663",,"10.1002/vzj2.20020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/428260","en","Soil Science Society of America","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Evaluation of different methods for gap filling of long‐term actual evapotranspiration time series measured by lysimeters",,"Other Journal Item","Open access",,,,"2020-07-23T13:12:50Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"000618773300020","Vadose Zone J.","1","Vadose Zone Journal","19","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They can influence large-scale flow evolution by modifying the potential vorticity (PV) distribution during their cross-isentropic ascent. Although WCBs are typically described as slantwise-ascending and stratiform-cloud-producing airstreams, recent studies identified convective activity embedded within the large-scale WCB cloud band. However, the impacts of this WCB-embedded convection have not been investigated in detail. In this study, we systematically analyze the influence of embedded convection in an eastern North Atlantic WCB on the cloud and precipitation structure, on the PV distribution, and on larger-scale flow. For this reason, we apply online trajectories in a high-resolution convection-permitting simulation and perform a composite analysis to compare quasi-vertically ascending convective WCB trajectories with typical slantwise-ascending WCB trajectories. We find that the convective WCB ascent leads to substantially stronger surface precipitation and the formation of graupel in the middle to upper troposphere, which is absent for the slantwise WCB category, indicating the key role of WCB-embedded convection for precipitation extremes. Compared to the slantwise WCB trajectories, the initial equivalent potential temperature of the convective WCB trajectories is higher, and the convective WCB trajectories originate from a region of larger potential instability, which gives rise to more intense cloud diabatic heating and stronger cross-isentropic ascent. Moreover, the signature of embedded convection is distinctly imprinted in the PV structure. The diabatically generated low-level positive PV anomalies, associated with a cyclonic circulation anomaly, are substantially stronger for the convective WCB trajectories. The slantwise WCB trajectories lead to the formation of a widespread region of low-PV air (that still have weakly positive PV values) in the upper troposphere, in agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the convective WCB trajectories form mesoscale horizontal PV dipoles at upper levels, with one pole reaching negative PV values. On a larger scale, these individual mesoscale PV anomalies can aggregate to elongated PV dipole bands extending from the convective updraft region, which are associated with coherent larger-scale circulation anomalies. An illustrative example of such a convectively generated PV dipole band shows that within around 10 h the negative PV pole is advected closer to the upper-level waveguide, where it strengthens the isentropic PV gradient and contributes to the formation of a jet streak. This suggests that the mesoscale PV anomalies produced by embedded convection upstream organize and persist for several hours and therefore can influence the synoptic-scale circulation. They thus can be dynamically relevant, influence the jet stream and (potentially) the downstream flow evolution, which are highly relevant aspects for medium-range weather forecast. Finally, our results imply that a distinction between slantwise and convective WCB trajectories is meaningful because the convective WCB trajectories are characterized by distinct properties.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000456726",,"2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-1-127-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456726","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Potential vorticity structure of embedded convection in a warm conveyor belt and its relevance for large-scale dynamics",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-16T16:19:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Diabatic processes in North Atlantic weather systems: synoptic and mesoscale dynamics","165941","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,,,,,"Weather Clim.

A footprint analysis indicated that BC and MD deposited on the glaciers originated mainly from the Middle East, Central Asia, North China and South Asia during the study period.

Here, we assessed the climatic impacts of low-end, 1.5 °C, and 2.0 °C global temperature increases above pre-industrial levels, on the warming of terrestrial ecosystems in northern high latitudes (NHL, above 60 °N including pan-Arctic tundra and boreal forests) under the framework of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project phase 2b protocol. We analyzed the simulated changes of net primary productivity, vegetation biomass, and soil carbon stocks of eight ecosystem models that were forced by the projections of four global climate models and two atmospheric greenhouse gas pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP6.0). Our results showed that considerable impacts on ecosystem carbon budgets, particularly primary productivity and vegetation biomass, are very likely to occur in the NHL areas. The models agreed on increases in primary productivity and biomass accumulation, despite considerable inter-model and inter-scenario differences in the magnitudes of the responses. The inter-model variability highlighted the inadequacies of the present models, which fail to consider important components such as permafrost and wildfire. The simulated impacts were attributable primarily to the rapid temperature increases in the NHL and the greater sensitivity of northern vegetation to warming, which contrasted with the less pronounced responses of soil carbon stocks. The simulated increases of vegetation biomass by 30–60 Pg C in this century have implications for climate policy such as the Paris Agreement. Comparison between the results at two warming levels showed the effectiveness of emission reductions in ameliorating the impacts and revealed unavoidable impacts for which adaptation options are urgently needed in the NHL ecosystems.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000409092",,"1748-9326||1748-9318",,"10.1088/1748-9326/ab702b","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/409092","en","Institute of Physics","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","biome sector||ISIMIP2b||northern high latitudes||Paris agreement||climatic impacts","Pronounced and unavoidable impacts of low-end global warming on northern high-latitude land ecosystems",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-04-09T02:52:35Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85083580950",,,"000521459800001","Environ.

At present little is known on how particle chemical composition and hydrophilicity change upon atmospheric aging and associated uncertainties governing the ice cloud formation potential of soot. Here we sampled two propane flame soots referred to as brown and black soot, characterized as organic carbon rich and poor, respectively. We investigated how the ice nucleation activity of these particles changed through aging in water and aqueous acidic solutions, using a continuous flow diffusion chamber operated at cirrus cloud temperatures (T ≤ 233 K). Single aggregates of both unaged and aged soot were chemically characterized by scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (STXM/NEXAFS) measurements. Particle wettability was determined through water sorption measurements. Unaged black and brown soot particles exhibited significantly different ice nucleation activities. Our experiments revealed significantly enhanced ice nucleation activity of the aged soot particles compared to the fresh samples, lowering the required relative humidities at which ice formation can take place at T = 218 K by up to 15% with respect to water (ΔRHi ≈ 25%). We observed an enhanced water uptake capacity for the aged compared to the unaged samples, which was more pronounced for the black soot. From these measurements we concluded that there is a change in ice nucleation mechanism when aging brown soot. Comparison of the NEXAFS spectra of unaged soot samples revealed a unique spectral feature around 287.5 eV in the case of black soot that was absent for the brown soot, indicative of carbon with hydroxyl functionalities. Comparison of the NEXAFS spectra of unaged and aged soot particles indicates changes in organic functional groups, and the aged spectra were found to be largely similar across soot types, with the exception of the water aged brown soot. Overall, we conclude that atmospheric aging is important to representatively assess the ice cloud formation activity of soot particles.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000415007",,"2050-7887||2050-7895",,"10.1039/c9em00525k","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/415007","en","Royal Society of Chemistry","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/",,"Aging induced changes in ice nucleation activity of combustion aerosol as determined by near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-05-15T08:02:48Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85084177629",,,"000546453900020","Environ Sci Process Impacts","4","Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts","22","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Observationally constrained CMIP6 warming is consistent with previous assessments based on CMIP5 models, and in an ambitious mitigation scenario, the likely range is consistent with reaching the Paris Agreement target.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000405698",,"2375-2548",,"10.1126/sciadv.aaz9549","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/405698","en","AAAS","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/",,"Past warming trend constrains future warming in CMIP6 models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-03-19T07:31:44Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"LC-CLA-08-2018 | RIA | Constraining uncertainty of multi decadal climate projections||European Climate Prediction System||Constraining dynamic and thermodynamic drivers of mid-term regional climate change projections for Northern mid-latitudes","820829||776613||174128||820829||776613||174128","10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100000780||10.13039/501100001711","EC||EC||SNF||EC||EC||SNF","H2020||H2020||H2020||H2020||Ambizione",,,,,,,"000521937000041","Sci Adv","12","Science Advances","6","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung||ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Under all-sky conditions, in spite of a somewhat patchy structure of global dimming and brightening (GDB), an overall dimming was found that is weaker in the Northern than in the Southern Hemisphere (−2.2 and −3.1 W m−2, respectively, over the 2001–2009 period). Dimming is observed over both land and ocean in the two hemispheres, but it is more remarkable over land areas of the Southern Hemisphere. The post-2000 dimming is found to have been primarily caused by clouds, and secondarily by aerosols, with total cloud cover contributing −1.4 W m−2 and aerosol optical thickness −0.7 W m−2 to the global average dimming of −2.65 W m−2. The evaluation of the model-computed GDB against BSRN and GEBA measurements indicates a good agreement, with the same trends for 65% and 64% of the examined stations, respectively. The obtained model results are in line with other studies for specific world regions and confirm the occurrence of an overall solar dimming over the globe during the first decade of 21st century. This post-2000 dimming has succeeded the global brightening observed in the 1990s and points to possible impacts on the ongoing global warming and climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000407126",,"2073-4433",,"10.3390/atmos11030308","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/407126","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","surface solar radiation||climate||dimming||brightening||model||stations||satellite data","Global Dimming and Brightening Features during the First Decade of the 21st Century",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-03-30T04:04:27Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85082175852",,,"000524490500051",,"3","Atmosphere","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Substantial progress made over the past 40 years in observing, understanding, and modeling these processes helped quantify the imbalance in the Earth's radiation budget caused by anthropogenic aerosols, called aerosol radiative forcing, but uncertainties remain large. This review provides a new range of aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial era based on multiple, traceable, and arguable lines of evidence, including modeling approaches, theoretical considerations, and observations. Improved understanding of aerosol absorption and the causes of trends in surface radiative fluxes constrain the forcing from aerosol‐radiation interactions. A robust theoretical foundation and convincing evidence constrain the forcing caused by aerosol‐driven increases in liquid cloud droplet number concentration. However, the influence of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud liquid water content and cloud fraction is less clear, and the influence on mixed‐phase and ice clouds remains poorly constrained. Observed changes in surface temperature and radiative fluxes provide additional constraints. These multiple lines of evidence lead to a 68% confidence interval for the total aerosol effective radiative forcing of ‐1.6 to ‐0.6 W m−2, or ‐2.0 to ‐0.4 W m−2 with a 90% likelihood. Those intervals are of similar width to the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment but shifted toward more negative values. The uncertainty will narrow in the future by continuing to critically combine multiple lines of evidence, especially those addressing industrial‐era changes in aerosol sources and aerosol effects on liquid cloud amount and on ice clouds.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000409274",,"8755-1209||0096-1043||1944-9208",,"10.1029/2019RG000660","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/409274","en","American Geophysical Union","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Bounding Global Aerosol Radiative Forcing of Climate Change",,"Review Article","Open access",,,,"2020-04-11T01:51:39Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach||Hierarchical carbon-fiber composites with tailored interphase obtained via electrophoretic deposition of magnetized and funtionalized carbon nanotubes||A new parameterization scheme for ice and snow in climate models","641816||200021_156011||160177","10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SBFI||SNF||SNF","H2020||Projektförderung in Mathematik, Natur- und Ingenieurwissenschaften (Abteilung II)||SNF: Sonstige",,,,"85082653974",,,"000522944200002","Rev.

In this paper, we present a newly developed measurement platform on a tethered balloon system (HoloBalloon) to measure in situ vertical profiles of microphysical and meteorological cloud properties up to 1 km above ground. The main component of the HoloBalloon platform is a holographic imager, which uses digital in-line holography to image an ensemble of cloud particles in the size range from small cloud droplets to precipitation-sized particles in a three-dimensional volume. Based on a set of two-dimensional images, information about the phase-resolved particle size distribution, shape and spatial distribution can be obtained. The velocity-independent sample volume makes holographic imagers particularly well suited for measurements on a balloon. The unique combination of holography and balloon-borne measurements allows for observations with high spatial resolution, covering cloud structures from the kilometer down to the millimeter scale.  The potential of the measurement technique in studying boundary layer clouds is demonstrated on the basis of a case study. We present observations of a supercooled low stratus cloud during a Bise situation over the Swiss Plateau in February 2018. In situ microphysical profiles up to 700 m altitude above the ground were performed at temperatures down to −8 ∘C and wind speeds up to 15 m s−1. We were able to capture unique microphysical signatures in stratus clouds, in the form of inhomogeneities in the cloud droplet number concentration and in cloud droplet size, from the kilometer down to the meter scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000404920",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-13-925-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/404920","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Using a holographic imager on a tethered balloon system for microphysical observations of boundary layer clouds",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-03-15T02:33:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85080960359",,,"000518148800001","Atmos. meas. tech.","2","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, extreme summers are identified at all grid points in the Northern Hemisphere in the upper tail of the June–July–August (JJA) seasonal mean 2 m temperature (T2m) distribution, separately in ERA-Interim (ERAI) re- analyses and in 700 simulated years with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) large ensemble for present-day climate conditions. A novel approach is introduced to characterise the substructure of extreme summers, i.e. to elucidate whether an extreme summer is mainly the result of the warmest days being anomalously hot, of the coldest days being anomalously mild or of a general shift towards warmer temperatures on all days of the season. Such a statistical characterisation can be obtained from considering so-called rank day anomalies for each extreme summer – that is, by sorting the 92 daily mean T2m values of an extreme summer and by calculating, for every rank, the deviation from the climatological mean rank value of T2m. Applying this method in the entire Northern Hemisphere reveals spatially strongly varying extreme-summer substructures, which agree remarkably well in the re-analysis and climate model data sets. For example, in eastern India the hottest 30 d of an extreme summer contribute more than 65 % to the total extreme-summer T2m anomaly, while the colder days are close to climatology. In the high Arctic, however, extreme summers occur when the coldest 30 d are substantially warmer than they are climatologically. Furthermore, in roughly half of the Northern Hemisphere land area, the coldest third of summer days contributes more to extreme summers than the hottest third, which highlights that milder-than-normal coldest summer days are a key ingredient of many extreme summers. In certain regions, e.g. over western Europe and western Russia, the substructure of different extreme summers shows large variability and no common characteristic substructure emerges. Furthermore, we show that the typical extreme-summer substructure in a certain region is directly related to the region’s overall T2m rank day variability pattern. This indicates that in regions where the warmest summer days vary particularly strongly from one year to the other, these warmest days are also particularly anomalous in extreme summers (and analogously for regions where variability is largest for the coldest days). Finally, for three selected regions, thermodynamic and dynamical causes of extreme-summer substructures are briefly discussed, indicating that, for instance, the onset of monsoons, physical boundaries like the sea ice edge or the frequency of occurrence of Rossby wave breaking strongly determines the substructure of extreme summers in certain regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000421993",,"2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-1-45-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/421993","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Meteorology||Climatology","The substructure of extremely hot summers in the Northern Hemisphere",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-23T14:44:37Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"An integrated weather-system perspective on the characteristics, dynamics and impacts of extreme seasons","787652","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,,,,,"Weather Clim.

In the first phase of LUCAS, nine RCMs are used to explore the biogeophysical impacts of re-/afforestation over Europe: two idealized experiments representing respectively a non-forested and a maximally forested Europe are compared in order to quantify spatial and temporal variations in the regional climate sensitivity to forestation. We find some robust features in the simulated response to forestation. In particular, all models indicate a year-round decrease in surface albedo, which is most pronounced in winter and spring at high latitudes. This results in a winter warming effect, with values ranging from +0.2 to +1 K on average over Scandinavia depending on models. However, there are also a number of strongly diverging responses. For instance, there is no agreement on the sign of temperature changes in summer with some RCMs predicting a widespread cooling from forestation (well below −2 K in most regions), a widespread warming (around +2 K or above in most regions) or a mixed response. A large part of the inter-model spread is attributed to the representation of land processes. In particular, differences in the partitioning of sensible and latent heat are identified as a key source of uncertainty in summer. Atmospheric processes, such as changes in incoming radiation due to cloud cover feedbacks, also influence the simulated response in most seasons. In conclusion, the multi-model approach we use here has the potential to deliver more robust and reliable information to stakeholders involved in land use planning, as compared to results based on single models. However, given the contradictory responses identified, our results also show that there are still fundamental uncertainties that need to be tackled to better anticipate the possible intended or unintended consequences of LUC on regional climates.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000402222",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-11-183-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/402222","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Biogeophysical impacts of forestation in Europe: first results from the LUCAS (Land Use and Climate Across Scales)  regional climate  model intercomparison",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-02-28T11:57:52Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"CLimate IMPacts of Utilizing Land in Switzerland and Europe (CLIMPULSE)","172715","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85081135489",,,"000516707200001",,"1","Earth System Dynamics","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Deposition from the atmosphere, especially through precipitation, is an important source of Se to soils. However, very little is known about the atmospheric cycling of Se. It has therefore been difficult to predict how far Se travels in the atmosphere and where it deposits. To answer these questions, we have built the first global atmospheric Se model by implementing Se chemistry in an aerosol–chemistry–climate model, SOCOL-AER (modeling tools for studies of SOlar Climate Ozone Links – aerosol). In the model, we include information from the literature about the emissions, speciation, and chemical transformation of atmospheric Se. Natural processes and anthropogenic activities emit volatile Se compounds, which oxidize quickly and partition to the particulate phase. Our model tracks the transport and deposition of Se in seven gas-phase species and 41 aerosol tracers. However, there are large uncertainties associated with many of the model's input parameters. In order to identify which model uncertainties are the most important for understanding the atmospheric Se cycle, we conducted a global sensitivity analysis with 34 input parameters related to Se chemistry, Se emissions, and the interaction of Se with aerosols. In the first bottom-up estimate of its kind, we have calculated a median global atmospheric lifetime of 4.4 d (days), ranging from 2.9 to 6.4 d (2nd–98th percentile range) given the uncertainties of the input parameters. The uncertainty in the Se lifetime is mainly driven by the uncertainty in the carbonyl selenide (OCSe) oxidation rate and the lack of tropospheric aerosol species other than sulfate aerosols in SOCOL-AER. In contrast to uncertainties in Se lifetime, the uncertainty in deposition flux maps are governed by Se emission factors, with all four Se sources (volcanic, marine biosphere, terrestrial biosphere, and anthropogenic emissions) contributing equally to the uncertainty in deposition over agricultural areas. We evaluated the simulated Se wet deposition fluxes from SOCOL-AER with a compiled database of rainwater Se measurements, since wet deposition contributes around 80 % of total Se deposition. Despite difficulties in comparing a global, coarse-resolution model with local measurements from a range of time periods, past Se wet deposition measurements are within the range of the model's 2nd–98th percentiles at 79 % of background sites. This agreement validates the application of the SOCOL-AER model to identifying regions which are at risk of low atmospheric Se inputs. In order to constrain the uncertainty in Se deposition fluxes over agricultural soils, we should prioritize field campaigns measuring Se emissions, rather than laboratory measurements of Se rate constants.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000401201",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-1363-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/401201","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Mapping the drivers of uncertainty in atmospheric selenium deposition with global sensitivity analysis",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-02-22T04:27:05Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85079430926",,,"000512999100003","Atmos. chem. phys.","3","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02115 - Dep.

The evolution of ozone in the past is important because of its dramatic influence on the biosphere and humans but has not been known for most of the time, except for some measurements of near-surface ozone since the end of the 19th century. This gap can be filled by either modeling or paleo reconstructions. Here, we address ozone layer evolution during the early 20th century. This period was very interesting due to a simultaneous increase in solar and anthropogenic activity, as well as an observed but not explained substantial global warming. For the study, we exploited the chemistry-climate model SOCOL-MPIOM driven by all known anthropogenic and natural forcing agents, as well as their combinations. We obtain a significant global scale increase in the total column ozone by up to 12 Dobson Units and an enhancement of about 20% of the near-surface ozone over the Northern Hemisphere. We conclude that the total column ozone changes during this period were mainly driven by enhanced solar ultra violet (UV) radiation, while near-surface ozone followed the evolution of anthropogenic ozone precursors. This finding can be used to constrain the solar forcing magnitude.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000405503",,"2073-4433",,"10.3390/atmos11020169","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/405503","en","MDPI","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","ozone layer evolution||modeling||climate change||solar forcing||ozone precursors","Ozone layer evolution in the early 20th century",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-03-18T02:43:55Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Future and Past Solar Influence on the Terrestrial Climate II","147659||147659","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","SNF: Sonstige||SNF: Sonstige",,,,"85081155754",,,,,"2","Atmosphere","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This study evaluates the ability of current operational S2S prediction systems to capture two important links between the stratosphere and troposphere: (1) changes in probabilistic prediction skill in the extratropical stratosphere by precursors in the tropics and the extratropical troposphere and (2) changes in surface predictability in the extratropics after stratospheric weak and strong vortex events. Probabilistic skill exists for stratospheric events when including extratropical tropospheric precursors over the North Pacific and Eurasia, though only a limited set of models captures the Eurasian precursors. Tropical teleconnections such as the Madden‐Julian Oscillation, the Quasi‐Biennial Oscillation, and El Niño–Southern Oscillation increase the probabilistic skill of the polar vortex strength, though these are only captured by a limited set of models. At the surface, predictability is increased over the United States, Russia, and the Middle East for weak vortex events, but not for Europe, and the change in predictability is smaller for strong vortex events for all prediction systems. Prediction systems with poorly resolved stratospheric processes represent this skill to a lesser degree. Altogether, the analyses indicate that correctly simulating stratospheric variability and stratosphere‐troposphere dynamical coupling are critical elements for skillful S2S wintertime predictions.",,,,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2019jd030923","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/379898","en","Wiley",,,"stratosphere||sub‐seasonal predictability||S2S database||sudden stratospheric warming||stratosphere ‐ troposphere coupling||North Atlantic Oscillation","The role of the stratosphere in subseasonal to seasonal prediction: 2.

Knowledge about S2S predictability within the stratosphere is however still limited. This study evaluates to what extent predictability in the extratropical stratosphere exists in hindcasts of operational prediction systems in the S2S database. The stratosphere is found to exhibit extended predictability as compared to the troposphere. Prediction systems with higher stratospheric skill tend to also exhibit higher skill in the troposphere. The analysis also includes an assessment of the predictability for stratospheric events, including early and midwinter sudden stratospheric warming events, strong vortex events, and extreme heat flux events for the Northern Hemisphere and final warming events for both hemispheres. Strong vortex events and final warming events exhibit higher levels of predictability as compared to sudden stratospheric warming events. In general, skill is limited to the deterministic range of 1 to 2 weeks. High‐top prediction systems overall exhibit higher stratospheric prediction skill as compared to their low‐top counterparts, pointing to the important role of stratospheric representation in S2S prediction models.",,,,"0148-0227||2169-897X",,"10.1029/2019jd030920","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/379897","en","Wiley",,,"stratosphere||sub‐seasonal predictability||S2S database||sudden stratospheric warming","The role of the stratosphere in subseasonal to seasonal prediction: 1.

Patterns of mesoscale organisation observed from space were subjectively defined and learned by 12 trained scientists. The ability of individuals to communicate, learn and replicate the classification was evaluated. Nine‐hundred satellite images spanning the area from 48°W to 58°W, 10°N to 20°N for the boreal winter months (December–February) over 10 years (2007/2008 to 2016/2017) were classified. Each scene was independently labelled by six scientists as being dominated by one of six patterns (one of which was “no‐pattern”). Four patterns of mesoscale organisation could be labelled in a reproducible manner, and were labelled Sugar, Gravel, Fish and Flowers. Sugar consists of small, low clouds of low reflectivity, Gravel clouds form along apparent gust fronts, Fish are skeletal networks (often fishbone‐like) of clouds, while Flowers are circular clumped features defined more by their stratiform cloud elements. Both Fish and Flowers are surrounded by large areas of clear air. These four named patterns were identified 40% of the time, with the most common pattern being Gravel. Sugar was identified the least and suggests that unorganised and very shallow convection is unlikely to dominate large areas of the downstream trade winds. Some of the patterns show signs of seasonal and interannual variability, and some degree of scale selectivity. Comparison of typical patterns with radar imagery suggests that even this subjective and qualitative visual inspection of imagery appears to capture several important physical differences between shallow cloud regimes, such as precipitation and radiative effects.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000394019",,"0035-9009||1477-870X",,"10.1002/qj.3662","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/394019","en","Wiley","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","cloud feedbacks||mesoscale organisation||shallow convection||trade clouds","Sugar, gravel, fish and flowers: Mesoscale cloud patterns in the trade winds",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-26T05:57:08Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85074279427",,,"000507167800001","Q.

Sect. 2.2, drawing from the substantial body of published literature, explores what ARs are, phenomenologically. Based on observations, what do the horizontal and vertical sections of ARs look like? Section 2.3 covers concepts related to ARs: warm conveyor belts and TMEs, including climatologies and their relevance—all helping delineate their differences and similarities to ARs, and thus helping to define what is—and is not—an AR. Section 2.4 focuses on the water transport in ARs, reviewing the different approaches to quantify moisture transport, and to identify moisture sources, all of which contribute to the current understanding of the moisture budget of ARs, and links phenomenology (Sect. 2.2) with dynamic understanding (Sect. 2.4). Section 2.5 combines the complex picture of ARs and their embedding in atmospheric dynamics, including aspects of how extratropical dynamics affect ARs, and their links to (a) upper-level dynamics (Rossby wave breaking and cutoff lows, (b) extratropical cyclones and alternative concepts, and (c) high-latitude dynamics.",,,"978-3-030-28905-8||978-3-030-28906-5",,,"10.1007/978-3-030-28906-5_2","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/456734","en","Springer",,,"Water vapor transport||AR structure||Warm conveyor belt||Tropical moisture export||Water budget||Mid-latitude cyclone","Structure, Process, and Mechanism",,"Book Chapter","Metadata only","Atmospheric Rivers",,,"2020-12-16T17:37:09Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

With the advent of multiple single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs), these assumptions can be scrutinized, as they allow a more robust separation between sources of uncertainty. Here, the framework from Hawkins and Sutton (2009) for uncertainty partitioning is revisited for temperature and precipitation projections using seven SMILEs and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project CMIP5 and CMIP6 archives. The original approach is shown to work well at global scales (potential method bias < 20 %), while at local to regional scales such as British Isles temperature or Sahel precipitation, there is a notable potential method bias (up to 50 %), and more accurate partitioning of uncertainty is achieved through the use of SMILEs. Whenever internal variability and forced changes therein are important, the need to evaluate and improve the representation of variability in models is evident. The available SMILEs are shown to be a good representation of the CMIP5 model diversity in many situations, making them a useful tool for interpreting CMIP5. CMIP6 often shows larger absolute and relative model uncertainty than CMIP5, although part of this difference can be reconciled with the higher average transient climate response in CMIP6. This study demonstrates the added value of a collection of SMILEs for quantifying and diagnosing uncertainty in climate projections.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000418969",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-11-491-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/418969","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Partitioning climate projection uncertainty with multiple large ensembles and CMIP5/6",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-09T04:54:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Constraining dynamic and thermodynamic drivers of mid-term regional climate change projections for Northern mid-latitudes","174128","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,"85085840775",,,"000537764100001",,"2","Earth System Dynamics","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The amount of water that reaches the ground surface is thereby considerably reduced. This paper investigates the synoptic conditions and the atmospheric transport pathways of moisture that lead to either virga – when precipitation is completely sublimated – or actual surface precipitation events over coastal Adélie Land, East Antarctica. For this purpose, the study combines ground-based lidar and radar measurements at Dumont d'Urville station (DDU), Lagrangian back trajectories, Eulerian diagnostics of extratropical cyclones and fronts, and moisture source estimations. It is found that precipitating systems at DDU are associated with warm fronts of cyclones that are located to the west of Adélie Land. Virga – corresponding to 36 % of the hours with precipitation above DDU – and surface precipitation cases are associated with the same precipitating system but they correspond to different phases of the event. Virga cases more often precede surface precipitation. They sometimes follow surface precipitation in the warm sector of the cyclone's frontal system, when the associated cyclone has moved to the east of Adélie Land and the precipitation intensity has weakened. On their way to DDU, the air parcels that ultimately precipitate above the station experience a large-scale lifting across the warm front. The lifting generally occurs earlier in time and farther from the station for virga than for precipitation. It is further shown that the water contained in the snow falling above DDU during pre-precipitation virga has an oceanic origin farther away (about 30∘ more to the west) from Adélie Land than the one contained in the snow that precipitates down to the ground surface.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000418970",,"1994-0416||1994-0424",,"10.5194/tc-14-1685-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/418970","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Synoptic conditions and atmospheric moisture pathways associated with virga and precipitation over coastal Adélie Land in Antarctica",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-06-09T04:54:18Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85085767960",,,"000537703600003",,"5","The Cryosphere","14","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

IAV is difficult to reliably quantify in single realizations of climate (observations and single-model realizations) as they are too short, and represent a combination of external forcing and IAV. Single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs) are powerful tools to overcome this problem, as they provide many realizations of past and future climate and thus a larger sample size to robustly evaluate and quantify changes in IAV. We use three SMILE-based regional climate models (CanESM-CRCM, ECEARTH-RACMO and CESM-CCLM) to investigate downscaled changes in IAV of summer and winter temperature and precipitation, the number of heat waves, and the maximum length of dry periods over Europe. An evaluation against the observational data set E-OBS reveals that all models reproduce observational IAV reasonably well, although both under- and overestimation of observational IAV occur in all models in a few cases. We further demonstrate that SMILEs are essential to robustly quantify changes in IAV since some individual realizations show significant IAV changes, whereas others do not. Thus, a large sample size, i.e., information from all members of SMILEs, is needed to robustly quantify the significance of IAV changes. Projected IAV changes in temperature over Europe are in line with existing literature: increasing variability in summer and stable to decreasing variability in winter. Here, we further show that summer and winter precipitation, as well as the two summer extreme indicators mostly also show these seasonal changes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000453629",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-11-1013-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/453629","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Comparing interannual variability in three regional single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs) over Europe",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-29T03:51:55Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85096479172",,,"000592855700001",,"4","Earth System Dynamics","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

During winter, most of the precipitation-forming clouds are mixed-phase clouds (MPCs), which consist of a mixture of supercooled cloud droplets and ice crystals. Although the coexistence of liquid and ice is thermodynamically unstable, persistent MPCs have frequently been observed in mountain regions, where the local topography produces sufficiently large updrafts to provide a continuous source of condensate. Despite significant advances in the fundamental understanding of MPCs and orographic precipitation over the past decades, large uncertainties remain regarding ice initiation, the partitioning between the liquid and ice phase and the glaciation time in MPCs. This limits the ability to obtain accurate forecasts of precipitation formation and amounts in complex terrain. Innovative measurement strategies are required to improve our understanding of the numerous microphysical and dynamical processes in orographic MPCs and their convoluted interactions, which govern orographic precipitation.  The aim of this thesis is to improve the process understanding of orographic MPCs and precipitation through a multi-instrumental approach by combining observations from an extensive set of in situ and remote sensing instrumentation. Since the ability of aircrafts to fly in cloudy conditions in complex terrain is limited (e.g., in winding and narrow valleys) and cloud observations at mountain-tops are influenced by surface processes, a new measurement platform on a tethered balloon system (HoloBalloon) was developed to study boundary layer clouds in complex terrain. The major component of the measurement platform is a newly developed HOLographic Imager for Microscopic Objects (HOLIMO 3B), which was designed for balloon-borne measurements. HOLIMO 3B uses digital in-line holography to image an ensemble of cloud particles in the size range from small cloud droplets to precipitation-sized particles in a three-dimensional sample volume. Based on two-dimensional images, information about the phase-resolved particle size distribution and particle shape can be obtained. The velocity-independent sample volume of HOLIMO 3B makes it particularly well suited for balloon-borne applications, which have to deal with fluctuations in wind speed and direction. Additionally, the measurement platform is equipped with an optical particle counter, a 3D ultrasonic anemometer, and a temperature, a humidity and a pressure sensor.  The HoloBalloon platform was successfully deployed in different environments and atmospheric conditions. In winter 2018, the HoloBalloon platform demonstrated its feasibility by obtaining vertical profiles of microphysical and meteorological cloud properties up to 700 m above the surface in low stratus clouds over the Swiss Plateau. In winter 2019, the HoloBalloon platform was deployed in orographic clouds within the framework of the Role of Aerosols and CLouds Enhanced by Topography on Snow (RACLETS) campaign, which took place in the Swiss Alps in the region around Davos.  A wide variety of orographic effects can enhance precipitation over complex terrain and influence its spatial distribution along the mountain barrier. In the present thesis, the complex interplay between orography, dynamics, microphysics and precipitation is explored on the basis of several case studies of the RACLETS campaign. The role of low-level blocking and shear-induced turbulence on the cloud microphysics and precipitation formation was investigated in an inner-Alpine valley. We suggest that aggregation, needle growth and secondary ice production occurred within the turbulent shear layer, which enhanced ice growth and precipitation formation. The amount of precipitation was determined by the strength of the cross-barrier flow and of the low-level blocking, as precipitation was only observed at the ground when the blocking was weakest and the altitude of the cloud base and shear layer were lowest. Additionally, a persistent low-level liquid cloud was observed by the HoloBalloon platform, when the low-level flow was forced to rise over a small-scale topographic feature in the mountain valley. This shallow low-level cloud did not generate significant precipitation by itself, but was found to ""feed"" on precipitation particles that formed at higher altitudes (i.e., in the seeder region of the cloud) and to produce conditions favorable for secondary ice production processes. Seeder regions were observed in connection with cloud top generating cells, within which enhanced ice formation and growth occurred. In the present thesis, we propose different mechanisms that potentially increase ice formation and growth within generating cells (convective overshooting, radiative cooling, droplet shattering) by considering the ground-based ice nucleating particle concentration and the ice crystal number concentration measured near cloud base. We found that increased ice formation and growth within the seeder region can induce the full glaciation of a MPC and suggest that secondary ice production may have been partly responsible for the elevated ice crystal number concentrations that have been previously observed in feeder clouds at mountain-top observatories.  The synergy of aerosol, cloud, dynamics and precipitation observations can improve our understanding of the microphysical pathways of precipitation formation in orographic MPC. These microphysical processes (e.g., secondary ice production, glaciation of MPC) and the dynamical response of the flow to the orography need to be represented accurately in atmospheric models in order to improve the reliability of precipitation forecasts in complex terrain.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000454131",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/454131","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Cloud microphysics||Orographic precipitation||Boundary layer clouds||In-situ measurements||Remote sensing||Holography","The microphysics and dynamics of mixed-phase clouds in the Swiss Alps: insights from balloon-borne and remote sensing observations",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2020-12-02T08:42:47Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"26793",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This paper presents a new data set of vertical column densities of H2O and HDO retrieved from short-wave infrared (2.3 µm) reflectance measurements by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. TROPOMI features daily global coverage with a spatial resolution of up to 7 km×7 km. The retrieval utilises a profile-scaling approach. The forward model neglects scattering, and strict cloud filtering is therefore necessary. For validation, recent ground-based water vapour isotopologue measurements by the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) are employed. A comparison of TCCON δD with ground-based measurements by the Multi-platform remote Sensing of Isotopologues for investigating the Cycle of Atmospheric water (MUSICA) project for data prior to 2014 (where MUSICA data are available) shows a bias in TCCON δD estimates. As TCCON HDO is currently not validated, an overall correction of recent TCCON HDO data is derived based on this finding. The agreement between the corrected TCCON measurements and co-located TROPOMI observations is good with an average bias of (−0.2±3)×1021 molec cm−2 ((1.1±7.2) %) in H2O and (−2±7)×1017 molec cm−2 ((−1.1±7.3) %) in HDO, which corresponds to a mean bias of (−14±17) ‰ in a posteriori δD. The bias is lower at low- and mid-latitude stations and higher at high-latitude stations. The use of the data set is demonstrated with a case study of a blocking anticyclone in northwestern Europe in July 2018 using single-overpass data.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000396018",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-13-85-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/396018","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"First data set of H2O/HDO columns from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-31T03:13:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85078229479",,,"000507313900001","Atmos. meas. tech.","1","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

In this study, concentrations, light-absorption properties and bioavailability of DOC from snow cover in Alaska were characterized. Results indicated that average concentrations of DOC in snow of Alaska (0.17 − 0.30 mg L−1) were lower than that found in Asian mountainous glaciers, but higher that found from polar regions snow. No significant trend of DOC was observed during April to May in 2017 due to the short term study; while the vertical variations generally showed a little higher values in the surface snow than that in the sub-surface snow. An obvious characteristic of DOC light-absorbance in snow between the wavelength of 300 and 700 nm indicated the mass absorption cross section of DOC at 365 nm (MACDOC365) was 0.32 ± 0.24 and 0.37 ± 0.32 m2 g−1 for the snow cover at Barrow site (Arctic Ocean coast) and the other Alaskan regions, respectively. The MACDOC365 values increased especially during snow melting, indicating the DOC with high MAC values were prone to retain in snow. The proportion of radiative forcing caused by DOC relative to that by black carbon in snow was approximately 2.3%, indicating that DOC in snow should be considered during the accelerated melt of snow cover. The bioavailability experiment of DOC in snow indicated that DOC may be an important bioavailable source for proglacial and coastal ecosystems in Alaskan Arctic regions. Using backward air mass trajectory analysis, we suggested that DOC deposited in snow at Barrow primarily originates from marine or terrestrial air mass, but the specific contribution of different sources cannot be quantified without data related to the DOC’s chemical composition and carbon isotopic signatures. This study highlighted the climatic implications of DOC in snow in the Arctic regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000426222",,"0280-6509||1600-0889",,"10.1080/16000889.2020.1778968","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/426222","en","Taylor & Francis","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","dissolved organic carbon||light-absorbing properties||snow cover||Arctic","Dissolved organic carbon in Alaskan Arctic snow: concentrations, light-absorption properties, and bioavailability",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-14T03:05:34Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85087568400",,,"000546239400001",,"1","Tellus B: Chemical and Physical Meteorology","72","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The dependence of uncertainty on ensemble composition is clear when single-model initial condition large ensembles (SMILEs) are included within a multi-model ensemble. SMILEs allow for the quantification of internal variability, a non-negligible component of uncertainty on regional scales, but may also serve to inappropriately narrow uncertainty by giving a single model many additional votes. In advance of the mixed multi-model, the SMILE Coupled Model Intercomparison version 6 (CMIP6) ensemble, we investigate weighting approaches to incorporate 50 members of the Community Earth System Model (CESM1.2.2-LE), 50 members of the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2-LE), and 100 members of the MPI Grand Ensemble (MPI-GE) into an 88-member Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble. The weights assigned are based on ability to reproduce observed climate (performance) and scaled by a measure of redundancy (dependence). Surface air temperature (SAT) and sea level pressure (SLP) predictors are used to determine the weights, and relationships between present and future predictor behavior are discussed. The estimated residual thermodynamic trend is proposed as an alternative predictor to replace 50-year regional SAT trends, which are more susceptible to internal variability.  Uncertainty in estimates of northern European winter and Mediterranean summer end-of-century warming is assessed in a CMIP5 and a combined SMILE–CMIP5 multi-model ensemble. Five different weighting strategies to account for the mix of initial condition (IC) ensemble members and individually represented models within the multi-model ensemble are considered. Allowing all multi-model ensemble members to receive either equal weight or solely a performance weight (based on the root mean square error (RMSE) between members and observations over nine predictors) is shown to lead to uncertainty estimates that are dominated by the presence of SMILEs. A more suitable approach includes a dependence assumption, scaling either by 1∕N, the number of constituents representing a “model”, or by the same RMSE distance metric used to define model performance. SMILE contributions to the weighted ensemble are smallest (<10 %) when a model is defined as an IC ensemble and increase slightly (<20 %) when the definition of a model expands to include members from the same institution and/or development stream. SMILE contributions increase further when dependence is defined by RMSE (over nine predictors) amongst members because RMSEs between SMILE members can be as large as RMSEs between SMILE members and other models. We find that an alternative RMSE distance metric, derived from global SAT and hemispheric SLP climatology, is able to better identify IC members in general and SMILE members in particular as members of the same model. Further, more subtle dependencies associated with resolution differences and component similarities are also identified by the global predictor set.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000443775",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-11-807-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/443775","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"An investigation of weighting schemes suitable for incorporating large",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-01T07:11:29Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach||European Climate Prediction System","641816||776613","10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100000780","SBFI||EC","H2020||H2020",,,,"85092771831",,,"000570237600001",,"3","Earth System Dynamics","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Recent publications of new observation-based datasets offer opportunities to investigate these biases and their impact on historical surface albedo changes in simulations from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Conducting such an assessment is, however, complicated by the non-availability of albedo values for specific land cover classes in CMIP and the limited number of simulations isolating the land use forcing. In this study, we demonstrate the suitability of a new methodology to extract the albedo of trees and crops–grasses in standard climate model simulations. We then apply it to historical runs from 17 CMIP5 models and compare the obtained results to satellite-derived reference data. This allows us to identify substantial biases in the representation of the albedo of trees and crops–grasses as well as the surface albedo change due to the transition between these two land cover classes in the analysed models. Additionally, we reconstruct the local surface albedo changes induced by historical conversions between trees and crops–grasses for 15 CMIP5 models. This allows us to derive estimates of the albedo-induced radiative forcing from land cover changes since pre-industrial times. We find a multi-model range from 0 to −0.17 W m−2, with a mean value of −0.07 W m−2. Constraining the surface albedo response to transitions between trees and crops–grasses from the models with satellite-derived data leads to a revised multi-model mean estimate of −0.09 W m−2 but an increase in the multi-model range. However, after excluding one model with unrealistic conversion rates from trees to crops–grasses the remaining individual model results vary between −0.03 and −0.11 W m−2. These numbers are at the lower end of the range provided by the IPCC AR5 (−0.15±0.10 W m−2). The approach described in this study can be applied to other model simulations, such as those from CMIP6, especially as the evaluation diagnostic described here has been included in the ESMValTool v2.0.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000458608",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-11-1209-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/458608","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Biases in the albedo sensitivity to deforestation in CMIP5 models and their impacts on the associated historical radiative forcing",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-27T06:03:23Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"CLimate IMPacts of Utilizing Land in Switzerland and Europe (CLIMPULSE)","172715||172715||172715","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85097942562",,,"000600176000001",,"4","Earth System Dynamics","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A specific extreme event is caused by the unique interplay of a number of different driving factors. The atmosphere, the ocean and the land surface are major drivers of climate variability and participate in feedback processes that may amplify or reduce the risk of an extreme event. As all of these natural drivers work together to create a specific extreme event, it is difficult to disentangle the individual contributions.   Furthermore, by burning fossil fuels and converting land, humans have started to affect the climate system. At present, this has led to a global warming of about 1°C above pre-industrial levels. This change in the background global climate is altering natural processes that can be relevant for extreme events. However, the impact of this climatic change is particularly difficult to detect for extreme events as they are rare. Nonetheless, given the devastating impacts of extreme events, it is essential to study them to provide a basis for mitigation and adaptation planning. Understanding the underlying processes and involved uncertainties helps to provide reliable short-term forecasts for extreme events and projections for the future.   This thesis focuses on heat waves and, in some cases, concurrent droughts. A main goal is to disentangle the role of the drivers involved. Global climate model simulations are conducted to separate the contributions from thermodynamic and dynamic processes by forcing parts of the climate system toward observations. Atmospheric circulation constitutes the dynamic part of the climate system and can be controlled by constraining its variability using atmospheric nudging. The thermodynamics can be controlled by constraining for example the land surface conditions, which is done here using soil moisture prescription.  In the first part of this thesis, an evaluation of climatological model biases is provided. Global climate models often show consistent biases in the surface climate, for example a hot and dry bias in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes during summer, which affects the representation of hot extremes. To identify the origin of such biases, atmospheric nudging is used to control the large-scale atmospheric circulation in a global climate model. The results show that biases related to the atmospheric circulation are often of minor relevance for many regions of the world. This highlights that a large part of the biases is not related to circulation, but originates from incomplete or erroneous representation of the thermodynamics.  The focus shifts to heat waves in the second part of the thesis. The driving processes that contributed to five heat waves occurring between 2010-2016 are studied individually. By nudging the atmosphere toward observed circulation and prescribing soil moisture, the role of three key physical drivers is quantified: (1) atmospheric circulation, (2) land surface conditions, and (3) sea surface temperatures. In addition, the role of recent climate change since the mid-1990s is evaluated. The contribution of the natural and anthropogenic drivers to daily maximum temperatures can be assessed quantitatively using conditional event attribution. The results show that the ocean conditions play a minor role for most of the investigated events, while the atmospheric circulation and land surface can each contribute up to 70% of the events' anomalies. Recent climate change amplified all of the investigated events. It played the largest role for the 2015 European heat wave, contributing about 40% to the temperature anomaly.  The third part of this thesis combines climate change scenario information with atmospheric nudging to create storylines for a recent heat wave. Storylines are a tool to create analogues of an event for alternative levels of global background warming. Here these analogues are created by nudging the large-scale atmospheric circulation toward the same observed circulation for each storyline. The method is applied to the 2018 Northern Hemisphere heat wave, which affected a large fraction of populated and agriculturally used land. In an alternative world without global warming, the impact of this event would have been strongly reduced. Looking into a possible future with a higher level of global warming the event puts an increasing fraction of land and population at risk: the area experiencing extreme temperatures increases from 9% in 2018 to 13% (34%) at 2°C (4°C) global warming.  This thesis contributes to the process understanding of heat waves in present-day and possible alternative future climates. The results demonstrate that thermodynamic processes related to the land surface can be as important as dynamic processes for driving heat waves. This highlights the value of assessing the separate contributions of these processes and points to the need for a joint effort in improving their representation in global climate models. The results further reveal an influence of recent climate change on aggravating heat waves and provide an outlook to future events. The presented scientific methods and concepts were proven useful in this thesis and will help to shed light on the role of thermodynamics and atmospheric dynamics in future studies on heat waves and other extreme events.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000437699",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/437699","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"On the sensitivity of heat waves to physical drivers and climate change",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2020-09-01T08:01:00Z","2021-09-01",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate","617518","10.13039/501100000780","EC","FP7","26669",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Since the stratospheric circulation evolves more slowly than that of the troposphere below, it can contribute to predictability at the surface. Our synthesis of studies on the coupling between the stratosphere and the troposphere reveals that the stratosphere also contributes substantially to a wide range of climate-related extreme events. These extreme events include cold air outbreaks and extreme heat, air pollution, wildfires, wind extremes, and storm clusters, as well as changes in tropical cyclones and sea ice cover, and they can have devastating consequences for human health, infrastructure, and ecosystems. A better understanding of the vertical coupling in the atmosphere, along with improved representation in numerical models, is therefore expected to help predict extreme events on timescales from weeks to decades in terms of the event type, magnitude, frequency, location, and timing. With a better understanding of stratosphere-troposphere coupling, it may be possible to link more tropospheric extremes to stratospheric forcing, which will be crucial for emergency planning and management.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000463766",,"2662-4435",,"10.1038/s43247-020-00060-z","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/463766","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Stratospheric drivers of extreme events at the Earth’s surface",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-19T14:00:11Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application","170523","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,,,,"000693647900001","Commun Earth Environ","1","Communications Earth & Environment","1","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, the relative role of SM and VPD in limiting ecosystem production remains debated and is difficult to disentangle, as SM and VPD are coupled through land-atmosphere interactions, hindering the ability to predict ecosystem responses to dryness. Here, we combine satellite observations of solar-induced fluorescence with estimates of SM and VPD and show that SM is the dominant driver of dryness stress on ecosystem production across more than 70% of vegetated land areas with valid data. Moreover, after accounting for SM-VPD coupling, VPD effects on ecosystem production are much smaller across large areas. We also find that SM stress is strongest in semi-arid ecosystems. Our results clarify a longstanding question and open new avenues for improving models to allow a better management of drought risk.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000444461",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-020-18631-1","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444461","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Soil moisture dominates dryness stress on ecosystem production globally",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-05T06:54:35Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85091716891",,,"000577262800003","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This Earth energy imbalance (EEI) is the most critical number defining the prospects for continued global warming and climate change. Understanding the heat gain of the Earth system – and particularly how much and where the heat is distributed – is fundamental to understanding how this affects warming ocean, atmosphere and land; rising surface temperature; sea level; and loss of grounded and floating ice, which are fundamental concerns for society. This study is a Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) concerted international effort to update the Earth heat inventory and presents an updated assessment of ocean warming estimates as well as new and updated estimates of heat gain in the atmosphere, cryosphere and land over the period 1960–2018. The study obtains a consistent long-term Earth system heat gain over the period 1971–2018, with a total heat gain of 358±37 ZJ, which is equivalent to a global heating rate of 0.47±0.1 W m−2. Over the period 1971–2018 (2010–2018), the majority of heat gain is reported for the global ocean with 89 % (90 %), with 52 % for both periods in the upper 700 m depth, 28 % (30 %) for the 700–2000 m depth layer and 9 % (8 %) below 2000 m depth. Heat gain over land amounts to 6 % (5 %) over these periods, 4 % (3 %) is available for the melting of grounded and floating ice, and 1 % (2 %) is available for atmospheric warming. Our results also show that EEI is not only continuing, but also increasing: the EEI amounts to 0.87±0.12 W m−2 during 2010–2018. Stabilization of climate, the goal of the universally agreed United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992 and the Paris Agreement in 2015, requires that EEI be reduced to approximately zero to achieve Earth's system quasi-equilibrium. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere would need to be reduced from 410 to 353 ppm to increase heat radiation to space by 0.87 W m−2, bringing Earth back towards energy balance. This simple number, EEI, is the most fundamental metric that the scientific community and public must be aware of as the measure of how well the world is doing in the task of bringing climate change under control, and we call for an implementation of the EEI into the global stocktake based on best available science. Continued quantification and reduced uncertainties in the Earth heat inventory can be best achieved through the maintenance of the current global climate observing system, its extension into areas of gaps in the sampling, and the establishment of an international framework for concerted multidisciplinary research of the Earth heat inventory as presented in this study.

PV cutoffs are usually identified as quasi-circular regions of stratospheric air isolated from the main stratospheric reservoir on an isentropic surface. Their genesis is the result of breaking synoptic-scale Rossby waves and their life cycle ends either via decay by diabatic processes or via advection back to the stratospheric reservoir (in this thesis referred to as  `reabsorption').  PV cutoffs have been in the focus of dynamical meteorologists for more than 70 years mainly because of two reasons: (i) They frequently result in high impact surface weather, in particular heavy precipitation, and (ii) their decay due to diabatic processes results in the transport of stratospheric air masses into the troposphere and thereby affects the concentration of trace gases (e.g. water vapour, ozone) in the atmosphere.   While many case studies of PV cutoffs exist and their climatological frequencies are well known, various climatological aspects of their life cycle and their surface impacts are still poorly understood. Also, a comprehensive global analysis of PV cutoffs is yet missing. However, this not only required in order to better assess their fundamental role for various aspects of the atmospheric circulation and chemistry (e.g. for cyclogenesis, the transport of moisture and aerosols, mixing of stratospheric ozone into the troposphere), but also to quantify their relevance for (high impact) surface weather in current and future climates.   Current understanding of the relevance of PV cutoffs for high impact weather implies that their accurate prediction by state-of-the-art operational forecasting systems is essential to avoid socio-economic harm. However, only few case studies have investigated forecast uncertainties related to PV cutoffs. In summary, these studies pointed at three key aspects: (i) the direct effect of uncertainties related to PV cutoffs for surface weather, (ii) the role of upstream processes for uncertainties in the formation of PV cutoffs downstream, such as the extratropical transition of tropical cyclones and warm conveyor belts (WCBs), and (iii) the role of PV cutoff reabsorption for downstream uncertainties in the wave guide. The relevance of these aspects have not yet been addressed systematically and only little is known about the dynamics governing the propagation of uncertainties in these situations.\\ This thesis consist of two parts. The first part addresses various climatological aspects of the life cycle of PV cutoffs as well as their contribution to (extreme) precipitation and the second part focuses on forecast uncertainties related to PV cutoffs.   To study the life cycle of PV cutoffs, a novel method is introduced to track PV cutoffs as three-dimensional objects. As this method is based on isentropic trajectories, cross-tropopause mass fluxes can also be quantified.  Its application to 39 years of the ECMWF reanalysis dataset leads to the first global climatology of PV cutoffs that is independent of the selection of a single vertical level. In addition to known geographical frequency maxima, large regions over subtropical ocean basins in the summer hemispheres and a circumpolar band around Antarctica are identified. The three-dimensional life cycles of more than 40'000 PV cutoffs are identified and analyzed in detail, including their link to surface cyclones. Remarkable regional differences are found which provide the basis for a new classification of PV cutoff life cycles into three types (Types I, II, and III). Type I PV cutoffs form mostly in summer over subtropical ocean basins as a result of anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking equatorward of the jet stream. They can be relatively stationary and long lived, can grow downward in their vertical extent, and are only rarely connected to surface cyclones. Their life cycle ends mostly with diabatic decay. Type II PV cutoffs form from anticyclonic followed by cyclonic Rossby wave breaking between the polar and the subtropical jets. Their formation often occurs simultaneously with surface cyclogenesis and strong diabatic activity results in rapid decay at lower isentropic levels. At the end of their life cycle, diabatic decay and reabsorption are equally likely. Finally, Type III PV cutoffs form poleward of the jet stream by cyclonic Rossby wave breaking in the storm track regions. Typically, they are associated to surface cyclones that formed a few days earlier and their evolution is often rather adiabatic, i.e. without frequent diabatic decay and vertical displacement. Their life cycle ends most frequently with reabsorption.   This dataset of PV cutoffs is used to attribute (extreme) precipitation to PV cutoffs and study the evolution of precipitation along their life cycle. It is found that Type I PV cutoffs often result in only little precipitation while Type II and III PV cutoffs are frequently accompanied by high precipitation volumes. Further, we find that enhanced meridional moisture transport is crucial for large precipitation amounts related to PV cutoffs. The first global quantification of the contribution of PV cutoffs to average and extreme precipitation reveals that PV cutoffs are particularly relevant in semi-arid subtropical regions (so-called Mediterranean climate regions), which are in fact the regions that are expected to experience the strongest changes in the hydrological cycle due to anthropogenic climate change.  The second part of the thesis contains two separate studies, which are both based on ECMWF operational ensemble forecasts and analyses. First, a detailed case study shows how forecast uncertainty can propagate from the North Atlantic along the wave guide into the Mediterranean and lead to an uncertain PV cutoff genesis position and, as a result, an uncertain development of an intense Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone (medicane). In particular, it is highlighted, that the uncertainties initially emerge from a North Atlantic jet streak and propagate and amplify into the Mediterranean during Rossby wave breaking. Further, it shows how uncertainties in the PV cutoff genesis position substantially affect the vertical thermal structure of the Mediterranean cyclone. These results contribute to improved understanding of the predictability of PV cutoffs and medicanes. The second study aims to investigate more systematically how PV cutoffs affect forecast uncertainties. It is shown that PV cutoff genesis over the Mediterranean is systematically accompanied by enhanced forecast uncertainty which is largest at genesis time. PV cutoff reabsorption, however, does not show a systematic signal in the region considered and with the method used. Further, a systematic link between strong North Atlantic WCBs and forecast uncertainty in both, the North Atlantic region and the Mediterranean is found. This link is particularly strong for the Mediterranean where the effect of strong North Atlantic WCBs is twofold: First, WCBs introduce (or amplify pre-existing) forecast uncertainties in the North Atlantic wave guide and second, they support the establishment of large-scale conditions that direct the North Atlantic jet stream towards the Mediterranean, which provides a corridor for the propagation of forecast uncertainties.   Overall, this thesis provides new perspectives on the life cycle of PV cutoffs. It proposes a new classification of PV cutoffs which stresses the regional variability of their genesis and lysis dynamics, their vertical evolution, and surface impacts. Furthermore, it points out the relevance of PV cutoffs for (extreme) precipitation, especially in Mediterranean climate regions.  On the other hand, this work offers new insight into the origin and dynamics of medium-range forecast uncertainty for the North Atlantic and Mediterranean regions in general, and, more specifically, for PV cutoffs. The thesis points out the relevance of strong North Atlantic WCBs for enhanced forecast uncertainty and demonstrates the tight link between forecast uncertainties over the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean under suitable conditions. The results imply that the uncertainties associated to PV cutoffs, e.g. in their position or intensity, often originate from upstream processes and are handed over to PV cutoffs during Rossby wave breaking. PV cutoffs subsequently transfer these uncertainties to (high impact) surface weather. Hence, with this work we underline that PV cutoffs are highly relevant flow features that contribute substantially to the complex dynamics of the extratropical circulation, to high impact weather and its predictability, as well as the hydrology of Mediterranean climate regions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000466735",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/466735","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","potential vorticity cutoffs||cutoff lows||cut-off lows||potential vorticity cut-offs||Mediterranean climate||medicane||forecast uncertainty||predictability||Rossby wave breaking||warm conveyor belts||atmospheric dynamics||meteorology||extreme precipitation||jet stream||potential vorticity||ensemble prediction||Rossby wave||diabatic processes","The life cycles of potential vorticity cutoffs: climatology, predictability and high impact weather",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2021-01-29T14:00:13Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"27081",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Large single-model initial-condition and multi-model ensembles are used to investigate the range of possible responses and serve as input to climate impact and integrated assessment models. Thereby, climate signal uncertainty is propagated along the uncertainty chain and its effect on interactions between humans and the Earth system can be quantified. However, generating both single-model initial-condition and multi-model ensembles is computationally expensive. In this study, we assess the feasibility of geographically explicit climate model emulation, i.e., of statistically producing large ensembles of land temperature field time series that closely resemble ESM runs at a negligible computational cost. For this purpose, we develop a modular emulation framework which consists of (i) a global mean temperature module, (ii) a local temperature response module, and (iii) a local residual temperature variability module. Based on this framework, MESMER, a Modular Earth System Model Emulator with spatially Resolved output, is built. We first show that to successfully mimic single-model initial-condition ensembles of yearly temperature from 1870 to 2100 on grid-point to regional scales with MESMER, it is sufficient to train on a single ESM run, but separate emulators need to be calibrated for individual ESMs given fundamental inter-model differences. We then emulate 40 climate models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to create a “superensemble”, i.e., a large ensemble which closely resembles a multi-model initial-condition ensemble. The thereby emerging ESM-specific emulator parameters provide essential insights on inter-model differences across a broad range of scales and characterize core properties of each ESM. Our results highlight that, for temperature at the spatiotemporal scales considered here, it is likely more advantageous to invest computational resources into generating multi-model ensembles rather than large single-model initial-condition ensembles. Such multi-model ensembles can be extended to superensembles with emulators like the one presented here.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000402039",,"2190-4987||2190-4979",,"10.5194/esd-11-139-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/402039","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Emulating Earth system model temperatures with MESMER: from global mean temperature trajectories to grid-point-level realizations on land",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-02-28T03:54:46Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Coordinated Research in Earth Systems and Climate: Experiments, kNowledge, Dissemination and Outreach||Land-Climate Interactions: Constraints for Droughts and Heatwaves in a Changing Climate","641816||617518","10.13039/501100007352||10.13039/501100000780","SBFI||EC","H2020||FP7",,,,"85079642765",,,"000515167200001",,"1","Earth System Dynamics","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This teleconnection is driven by the superposition and interaction of different influences, which are generally grouped into two main pathways, namely the tropospheric and stratospheric pathways. In this study, we focus on the tropospheric pathway through the North Pacific and across the North American continent. Due to the possible nonstationary behavior and the limited time period covered by reanalysis datasets, the potential nonlinearity of this pathway remains unclear. In order to address this question, we use a simplified physics atmospheric model forced with seasonally varying prescribed sea surface temperatures (SST) following the evolution of different ENSO phases with linearly varying strength at a fixed location. To isolate the tropospheric pathway the zonal mean stratospheric winds are nudged towards the model climatology. The model experiments indicate that the tropospheric pathway of ENSO to the North Atlantic exhibits significant nonlinearity with respect to the tropical SST forcing, both in terms of the location and amplitude of the impacts. For example, strong El Niño leads to a significantly stronger impact on the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) than a La Niña forcing of the same amplitude. For La Niña forcings, there is a saturation in the response, with no further increase in the NAO impact even when doubling the SST forcing, while this is not the case for El Niño. These findings may have important consequences for long-range prediction of the North Atlantic and Europe.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000413600",,"2698-4016||2698-4008",,"10.5194/wcd-1-225-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/413600","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Nonlinearity in the tropospheric pathway of ENSO to the North Atlantic",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-05-07T14:36:32Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Improving the Prediction of Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Weather and Climate – From Theory to Application","170523","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF-Förderungsprofessuren Stufe 2",,,,,,,,"Weather Clim.

It is a physically based method serving for the reconstruction of the historical evolution of AOD during the last century. In addition to sunshine duration data, it requires daily water vapor and ozone products as inputs taken from the ECMWF 20th century reanalysis ERA-20C, available at the global scale over the period 1900–2010. Surface synoptic cloud observations are used to identify cloud-free days. For 16 sites over Europe, the accuracy of the estimated daily AOD, and its seasonal variability, is similar to or better than those from two earlier methods when compared to AErosol RObotic NETwork measurements. In addition, it also improves the detection of the signal from massive aerosol events such as important volcanic eruptions (e.g., Arenal and Fernandina Island in 1968, El Chichón in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1992). Finally, the reconstructed AOD time series are in good agreement with the dimming/brightening phenomenon and also provide preliminary evidence of the early-brightening phenomenon.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000424419",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-13-3061-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424419","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A hybrid method for reconstructing the historical evolution of aerosol optical depth from sunshine duration measurements",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-05T09:09:07Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: temporal variation of solar radiation in the climate system||Towards an improved understanding of the Global Energy Balance: causes of decadal changes of solar radiation","159938||188601","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF","Projekte MINT||Projekte MINT",,,,"85090474826",,,"000541604300001","Atmos. meas. tech.","6","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Yet how these climatic effects compare to other anthropogenic forcings is largely unknown. Here we provide observational and model evidence that expanding irrigation has dampened historical anthropogenic warming during hot days, with particularly strong effects over South Asia. We show that irrigation expansion can explain the negative correlation between global observed changes in daytime summer temperatures and present-day irrigation extent. While global warming increases the likelihood of hot extremes almost globally, irrigation can regionally cancel or even reverse the effects of all other forcings combined. Around one billion people (0.79–1.29) currently benefit from this dampened increase in hot extremes because irrigation massively expanded throughout the 20th century. Our results therefore highlight that irrigation substantially reduced human exposure to warming of hot extremes but question whether this benefit will continue towards the future.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000390936",,"2041-1723",,"10.1038/s41467-019-14075-4","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/390936","en","Nature Publishing Group","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Warming of hot extremes alleviated by expanding irrigation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-16T07:56:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85077941542",,,"000512534300001","Nat Commun","1","Nature Communications","11","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, rapid quasi-vertical convective ascent can be embedded within the region of larger-scale WCB ascent. This WCB-embedded convection can be represented by online trajectories in high-resolution convection-resolving simulations of the atmospheric flow. The strong diabatic processes associated with WCB ascent and its embedded convection strongly modify the potential vorticity (PV) distribution. The animations show the evolution of detailed WCB ascent and the according upper-level PV distribution. The animations are based on a 2-km convection-resolving COSMO simulation of a WCB case study in September 2016 in the North Atlantic and cover the time period from 16 UTC 22 Sep to 12 UTC 24 Sep (with a temporal resolution of 15 minutes for the individual frames). The first animation shows the locations of WCB air parcel ascent (circles; colors indicate the centered 2-h pressure change (Δp2h) along all ascending WCB trajectories, in hPa), sea level pressure (grey contours, in hPa) and 2-PVU at 320 K (red line). Pressure changes exceeding 320 hPa in 2 h can be considered as convective WCB ascent (orange and red circles). The second animations shows the according upper-level PV field at 320 K and sea level pressure (grey contours, in hPa) for the WCB ascent presented in the first animation.

A popular example is the series of reference regions used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Adaptation (SREX). The SREX regions were slightly modified for the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC and used for reporting subcontinental observed and projected changes over a reduced number (33) of climatologically consistent regions encompassing a representative number of grid boxes. These regions are intended to allow analysis of atmospheric data over broad land or ocean regions and have been used as the basis for several popular spatially aggregated datasets, such as the Seasonal Mean Temperature and Precipitation in IPCC Regions for CMIP5 dataset.  We present an updated version of the reference regions for the analysis of new observed and simulated datasets (including CMIP6) which offer an opportunity for refinement due to the higher atmospheric model resolution. As a result, the number of land and ocean regions is increased to 46 and 15, respectively, better representing consistent regional climate features. The paper describes the rationale for the definition of the new regions and analyses their homogeneity. The regions are defined as polygons and are provided as coordinates and a shapefile together with companion R and Python notebooks to illustrate their use in practical problems (e.g. calculating regional averages). We also describe the generation of a new dataset with monthly temperature and precipitation, spatially aggregated in the new regions, currently for CMIP5 and CMIP6, to be extended to other datasets in the future (including observations). The use of these reference regions, dataset and code is illustrated through a worked example using scatter plots to offer guidance on the likely range of future climate change at the scale of the reference regions.

They therefore require multivariate perturbation of climate variables, close to what is observed in the field and projections for the future. Here, we present a new method for creating realistic climate forcing for manipulation experiments and apply it to the UHasselt Ecotron experiment. The new methodology uses data derived from the best available regional climate model projection and consists of generating climate forcing along a gradient representative of increasingly high global mean air temperature anomalies. We first identified the best-performing regional climate model simulation for the ecotron site from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment in the European domain (EURO-CORDEX) ensemble based on two criteria: (i) highest skill compared to observations from a nearby weather station and (ii) representativeness of the multi-model mean in future projections. The time window is subsequently selected from the model projection for each ecotron unit based on the global mean air temperature of the driving global climate model. The ecotron units are forced with 3-hourly output from the projections of the 5-year period in which the global mean air temperature crosses the predefined values. With the new approach, Ecotron facilities become able to assess ecosystem responses on changing climatic conditions, while accounting for the co-variation between climatic variables and their projection in variability, well representing possible compound events. The presented methodology can also be applied to other manipulation experiments, aiming at investigating ecosystem responses to realistic future climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429149",,"0020-7128||1432-1254",,"10.1007/s00484-020-01951-8","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429149","en","Springer","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Regional climate model||Climate forcing||Controlled environment experiment||Global warming||Ecosystem response","A novel method for assessing climate change impacts in ecotron experiments",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-30T07:13:33Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85087947496",,,"000548798800001","Int. j. biometeorol.",,"International Journal of Biometeorology","64","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To inform the public on the current avalanche situation, avalanche warning services regularly publish avalanche bulletins in winter. However, forecasting snow avalanches is very challenging. Currently, it is not possible to predict the exact timing, location or size of snow avalanches. Avalanche forecasters therefore estimate the degree of avalanche danger at the scale of a region, by linking point observations of the snowpack, consisting of observations of snow stratigraphy and snow instability, with past and future weather. While snowpack observations are very time consuming and thus rather scarce, numerical snow cover models can considerably increase the spatial and temporal resolution of such data, especially if they provide information on snow instability. In our current understanding of avalanche formation, avalanche release is a fracture mechanical problem and snow instability is best understood in terms of failure initiation and crack propagation. Detailed snow cover models exists which can simulate snow stratigraphy, but snow instability information is partly missing or inaccurate. In view of applying snow cover models for avalanche forecasting, the aim of this thesis was to model spatially distributed snow instability. The snow cover model SNOWPACK simulates criteria for failure initiation and crack propagation for each snow layer, namely the stability index and the critical crack length. While the stability index had been validated with field observations and was related to the probability of skier triggering, this was not the case for the critical crack length, which was parameterized based on layer properties including density, shear strength and the elastic modulus. In a first step, we therefore validated the evolution of snow layer properties and the critical crack length in SNOWPACK with novel field measurements. Daily measurements with the snow micro-penetrometer allowed for direct comparison with SNOWPACK. Our results showed that the evolution of layer density was fairly well captured by the model, especially the first two months after deposition. For the validation of the critical crack length, we used results from the propagation saw test performed on a weekly basis over three winter seasons. A comparison to SNOWPACK highlighted some discrepancies, and we thus refined the parameterization with a fit factor depending on weak layer density and grain size. With the refined parameterization, spatially distributed modeling of snow instability in terms of failure initiation and crack propagation became tangible. Spatially distributed snow cover simulations require interpolation and downscaling of meteorological data, which may introduce uncertainties. How these uncertainties impact modeled snow stability remained mostly unknown. For the first time, we therefore investigated the sensitivity of modeled snow instability to meteorological input uncertainty with a global sensitivity analysis. Early in the season, during the period of weak layer formation, modeled instability metrics were mostly sensitive to air temperature and precipitation. After weak layer burial, during the period of slab formation, modeled instability metrics were mostly sensitive to precipitation. These results highlighted that accurate spatial snow depth distributions are required to obtain realistic snow instability patterns. In a last step, we used the distributed snow cover model Alpine3D to simulate snow instability for the region of Davos, Switzerland. Meteorological data from automatic weather stations were interpolated to a grid with 100 m resolution. Precipitation was scaled with highly resolved snow depth measurements from airborne laser scanning to account for realistic snow depth patterns. Modeled snow instability patterns were plausible, e.g south-facing slopes stabilized faster in spring. However, instability metrics were lower for south-facing slopes during the winter months, which was not in line with the forecasted avalanche danger level. While spatial patterns of modeled snow instability still have to be validated, spatially distributed snow cover modeling can greatly improve numerical avalanche forecasting. However, given a lack of accurate input data, simple virtual slopes instead of highly resolved modeling approaches is probably enough at this point in time.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000473247",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/473247","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/","Snow||SNOW COVER MEASUREMENTS (GLACIOLOGY)||SNOW COVER, INCLUDING DEPTH, TEMPERATURE AND DENSITY (METEOROLOGY)||Snow stability||Snow stability evaluation||Avalanche formation||AVALANCHES (METEOROLOGY)||Avalanche forecasting||snow cover models||Natural hazards","Improving numerical avalanche forecasting with spatial snow cover modeling",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::530 - Physics||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences",,"2021-03-05T14:27:19Z","2022-03-05",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"k.A.","154205","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","SNF: Sonstige","26898",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

This advent of big data has led to commercial success stories, for example in recommender systems in online shops. However, scientific research in various disciplines including environmental and climate science will likely also benefit from increasing volumes of data, new sources for data, and the increasing use of algorithmic approaches to analyze these large datasets. This thesis uses tools from philosophy of science to conceptually address epistemological questions that arise in the analysis of these increasing volumes of data in environmental science with a special focus on data-driven modeling in climate research. Data-driven models, here, are defined as models of phenomena that are built with machine learning. While epistemological analyses of machine learning exist, these have mostly been conducted for fields characterized by a lack of hierarchies of theoretical background knowledge. Such knowledge is often available in environmental science and especially in physical climate science, and it is relevant for the construction, evaluation, and use of data-driven models. This thesis investigates predictions, uncertainty, and understanding from data-driven models in environmental and climate research and engages in in-depth discussions of case studies. These three topics are discussed in three topical chapters. The first chapter addresses the term “big data”, and rationales and conditions for the use of big-data elements for predictions. Namely, it uses a framework for classifying case studies from climate research and shows that “big data” can refer to a range of different activities. Based on this classification, it shows that most case studies lie in between classical domain science and pure big data. The chapter specifies necessary conditions for the use of big data and shows that in most scientific applications, background knowledge is essential to argue for the constancy of the identified relationships. This constancy assumption is relevant both for new forms of measurements and for data-driven models. Two rationales for the use of big-data elements are identified. Namely, big-data elements can help to overcome limitations in financial, computational, or time resources, which is referred to as the rationale of efficiency. Big-data elements can also help to build models when system understanding does not allow for a more theory-guided modeling approach, which is referred to as the epistemic rationale.  The second chapter addresses the question of predictive uncertainties of data-driven models. It highlights that existing frameworks for understanding and characterizing uncertainty focus on specific locations of uncertainty, which are not informative for the predictive uncertainty of data-driven models. Hence, new approaches are needed for this task. A framework is developed and presented that focuses on the justification of the fitness-for-purpose of the models for the specific kind of prediction at hand. This framework uses argument-based tools and distinguishes between first-order and second-order epistemic uncertainty. First-order uncertainty emerges when it cannot be conclusively justified that the model is maximally fit-for-purpose. Second-order uncertainty emerges when it is unclear to what extent the fitness-for-purpose assumption and the underlying assumptions are justified. The application of the framework is illustrated by discussing a case study of data-driven projections of the impact of climate change on global soil selenium concentrations. The chapter also touches upon how the information emerging from the framework can be used in decision-making.  The third chapter addresses the question of scientific understanding. A framework is developed for assessing the fitness of a model for providing understanding of a phenomenon. For this, the framework draws from the philosophical literature on scientific understanding and focuses on the representational accuracy, the representational depth, and the graspability of a model. Then, based on the framework, the fitness of data-driven and process-based climate models for providing understanding of phenomena is compared. It is concluded that data-driven models can, under some conditions, be fit to serve as vehicles for understanding to a satisfactory extent. This is specifically the case when sufficient background knowledge is available such that the coherence of the model with background knowledge provides good reasons for the representational accuracy of the data-driven model, which can be assessed e.g. through sensitivity analyses. This point is illustrated by discussing a case study from atmospheric physics in which data-driven models are used to better understand the drivers of a specific type of clouds. The work of this thesis highlights that while big data is no panacea for scientific research, data-driven modeling offers new tools to scientists that can be very useful for a variety of questions. All three studies emphasize the importance of background knowledge for the construction and evaluation of data-driven models as this helps to obtain models that are representationally accurate. The importance of domain-specific background knowledge and the technical challenges of implementing data-driven models for complex phenomena highlight the importance of interdisciplinary work. Previous philosophical work on machine learning has stressed that the problem framing makes models theory-laden. This thesis shows that in a field like climate research, the model evaluation is strongly guided by theoretical background knowledge, which is also important for the theory-ladenness of data-driven modeling. The results of the thesis are relevant for a range of methodological questions regarding data-driven modeling and for philosophical discussions of models that go beyond data-driven models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000399735",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/399735","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Epistemological Issues in Data-Driven Modeling in Climate Research",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::1 - Philosophy & psychology::100 - Philosophy||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::500 - Natural sciences",,"2020-02-15T19:25:15Z","2020-02-17",,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Combining theory with Big Data?

The role these particles play in the global radiative balance and in the climate system is still uncertain. To better quantify their radiative forcing due to aerosol-radiation interactions, we need to improve process level understanding of aging processes, which lead to either ‘browning’ or ‘bleaching’ of organic aerosols. Currently available laboratory techniques aim to simulate atmospheric aerosol aging and measure the evolving light absorption, but suffer from low sensitivity and precision. This study describes the use of electrodynamic balance photophoretic spectroscopy (EDB-PPS) for high sensitivity and high precision measurements of light absorption by a single particle. We demonstrate the retrieval of time-evolving imaginary part of the refractive index for a single levitated particle in the range of 10-4 to 10-5 with uncertainties of less than 25% and 60%, respectively. The experimental system is housed within an environmental chamber, in which aging processes can be simulated in realistic atmospheric conditions and lifetime of days to weeks. This high level of sensitivity enables future studies to explore the major processes responsible for formation and degradation of brown carbon aerosols.","text/csv","10.3929/ethz-b-000419840",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-2020-68","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/419840","en","ETH Zurich","Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",,"Photophoretic spectroscopy in atmospheric chemistry – high-sensitivity measurements of light absorption by a single particle",,"Dataset","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::530 - Physics",,"2020-06-11T14:50:18Z",,"indefinite","292278994-08-17T07:12:55Z",,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The selection of species analysed contained a range of geometric isomers and differing functionalities, allowing for the impacts of these factors on saturation vapour pressure (Psat) to be probed. Three subsets of nitroaromatics were investigated: nitrophenols, nitrobenzaldehydes and nitrobenzoic acids. The PsatS values were converted to subcooled liquid saturation vapour pressure (PsatL) values using experimental enthalpy of fusion and melting point values measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The PsatL values were compared to those estimated by predictive techniques and, with a few exceptions, were found to be up to 7 orders of magnitude lower. The large differences between the estimated PsatL and the experimental values can be attributed to the predictive techniques not containing parameters to adequately account for functional group positioning around an aromatic ring, or the interactions between said groups. When comparing the experimental PsatS of the measured compounds, the ability to hydrogen bond (H bond) and the strength of the H bond formed appear to have the strongest influence on the magnitude of the Psat, with steric effects and molecular weight also being major factors. Comparisons were made between the KEMS system and data from diffusion-controlled evaporation rates of single particles in an electrodynamic balance (EDB).

Although targeting near-term climate forcers (NTCFs), defined here as aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and precursor gases, should improve air quality, NTCF reductions will also impact climate. Prior assessments of the impact of NTCF mitigation on air quality and climate have been limited. This is related to the idealized nature of some prior studies, simplified treatment of aerosols and chemically reactive gases, as well as a lack of a sufficiently large number of models to quantify model diversity and robust responses. Here, we quantify the 2015–2055 climate and air quality effects of non-methane NTCFs using nine state-of-the-art chemistry–climate model simulations conducted for the Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP). Simulations are driven by two future scenarios featuring similar increases in greenhouse gases (GHGs) but with “weak” (SSP3-7.0) versus “strong” (SSP3-7.0-lowNTCF) levels of air quality control measures. As SSP3-7.0 lacks climate policy and has the highest levels of NTCFs, our results (e.g., surface warming) represent an upper bound. Unsurprisingly, we find significant improvements in air quality under NTCF mitigation (strong versus weak air quality controls). Surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) decrease by −2.2±0.32 µg m−3 and −4.6±0.88 ppb, respectively (changes quoted here are for the entire 2015–2055 time period; uncertainty represents the 95 % confidence interval), over global land surfaces, with larger reductions in some regions including south and southeast Asia. Non-methane NTCF mitigation, however, leads to additional climate change due to the removal of aerosol which causes a net warming effect, including global mean surface temperature and precipitation increases of 0.25±0.12 K and 0.03±0.012 mm d−1, respectively. Similarly, increases in extreme weather indices, including the hottest and wettest days, also occur. Regionally, the largest warming and wetting occurs over Asia, including central and north Asia (0.66±0.20 K and 0.03±0.02 mm d−1), south Asia (0.47±0.16 K and 0.17±0.09 mm d−1), and east Asia (0.46±0.20 K and 0.15±0.06 mm d−1). Relatively large warming and wetting of the Arctic also occur at 0.59±0.36 K and 0.04±0.02 mm d−1, respectively. Similar surface warming occurs in model simulations with aerosol-only mitigation, implying weak cooling due to ozone reductions. Our findings suggest that future policies that aggressively target non-methane NTCF reductions will improve air quality but will lead to additional surface warming, particularly in Asia and the Arctic. Policies that address other NTCFs including methane, as well as carbon dioxide emissions, must also be adopted to meet climate mitigation goals.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438713",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-9641-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438713","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Climate and air quality impacts due to mitigation of non-methane near-term climate forcers",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-07T04:46:48Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85090030564",,,"000562966500003","Atmos. chem. phys.","16","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Following the Montreal Protocol ban on long-lived ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), rapid depletion of total column ozone (TCO) ceased in the late 1990s, and ozone above 32 km is now clearly recovering. However, there is still no confirmation of TCO recovery, and evidence has emerged that ongoing quasi-global (60∘ S–60∘ N) lower stratospheric ozone decreases may be responsible, dominated by low latitudes (30∘ S–30∘ N). Chemistry–climate models (CCMs) used to project future changes predict that lower stratospheric ozone will decrease in the tropics by 2100 but not at mid-latitudes (30–60∘). Here, we show that CCMs display an ozone decline similar to that observed in the tropics over 1998–2016, likely driven by an increase in tropical upwelling. On the other hand, mid-latitude lower stratospheric ozone is observed to decrease, while CCMs that specify real-world historical meteorological fields instead show an increase up to present day. However, these cannot be used to simulate future changes; we demonstrate here that free-running CCMs used for projections also show increases. Despite opposing lower stratospheric ozone changes, which should induce opposite temperature trends, CCMs and observed temperature trends agree; we demonstrate that opposing model–observation stratospheric water vapour (SWV) trends, and their associated radiative effects, explain why temperature changes agree in spite of opposing ozone trends. We provide new evidence that the observed mid-latitude trends can be explained by enhanced mixing between the tropics and extratropics. We further show that the temperature trends are consistent with the observed mid-latitude ozone decrease. Together, our results suggest that large-scale circulation changes expected in the future from increased greenhouse gases (GHGs) may now already be underway but that most CCMs do not simulate mid-latitude ozone layer changes well. However, it is important to emphasise that the periods considered here are short, and internal variability that is both intrinsic to each CCM and different to observed historical variability is not well-characterised and can influence trend estimates. Nevertheless, the reason CCMs do not exhibit the observed changes needs to be identified to allow models to be improved in order to build confidence in future projections of the ozone layer.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000438711",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-9737-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/438711","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Inconsistencies between chemistry–climate models and observed lower stratospheric ozone trends since 1998",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-09-07T04:46:37Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The Overlooked Role of Stratospheric Ozone in forcing Northern Hemispheric climate (TORSO)","180043","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,"85090037670",,,"000563076900001","Atmos. chem. phys.","16","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

To investigate how the large-scale circulation influenced the microphysics of this intense precipitation event, we used radar measurements, snowflake photographs and radiosounding data from the International Collaborative Experiments for Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (ICE-POP 2018). The WCB was identified with trajectories computed with analysis wind fields from the Integrated Forecast System global atmospheric model. The WCB was collocated with a zone of enhanced wind speed of up to 45 m s−1 at 6500 m a.s.l., as measured by a radiosonde and a Doppler radar. Supercooled liquid water (SLW) with concentrations exceeding 0.2 g kg−1 was produced during the rapid ascent within the WCB. During the most intense precipitation period, vertical profiles of polarimetric radar variables show a peak and subsequent decrease in differential reflectivity as aggregation starts. Below the peak in differential reflectivity, the specific differential phase shift continues to increase, indicating early riming of oblate crystals and secondary ice generation. We hypothesise that the SLW produced in the WCB led to intense riming. Moreover, embedded updraughts in the WCB and turbulence at its lower boundary enhanced aggregation by increasing the probability of collisions between particles. This suggests that both aggregation and riming occurred prominently in this WCB. This case study shows how the large-scale atmospheric flow of a WCB provides ideal conditions for rapid precipitation growth involving SLW production, riming and aggregation. Future microphysical studies should also investigate the synoptic conditions to understand how observed processes in clouds are related to large-scale circulation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000428096",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-7373-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/428096","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Microphysics and dynamics of snowfall associated with a warm conveyor belt over Korea",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-23T05:42:57Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85087937887",,,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","12","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The role these particles play in the global radiative balance and in the climate system is still uncertain. To better quantify their radiative forcing due to aerosol–radiation interactions, we need to improve process-level understanding of aging processes, which lead to either “browning” or “bleaching” of organic aerosols. Currently available laboratory techniques aim to simulate atmospheric aerosol aging and measure the evolving light absorption, but they suffer from low sensitivity and precision. This study describes the use of electrodynamic balance photophoretic spectroscopy (EDB-PPS) for high-sensitivity and high-precision measurements of light absorption by a single particle. We demonstrate the retrieval of the time-evolving imaginary part of the refractive index for a single levitated particle in the range of 10−4 to 10−5 with uncertainties of less than 25 % and 60 %, respectively. The experimental system is housed within an environmental chamber, in which aging processes can be simulated in realistic atmospheric conditions and lifetimes of days to weeks. This high level of sensitivity enables future studies to explore the major processes responsible for formation and degradation of brown carbon aerosols.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000424358",,"1867-1381||1867-8548",,"10.5194/amt-13-3191-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/424358","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Photophoretic spectroscopy in atmospheric chemistry – high-sensitivity measurements of light absorption by a single particle",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-07-03T19:30:26Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Photophoretic spectroscopy in atmospheric chemistry – high sensitivity measurements of light absorption by a single particle","190477","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Spark",,,,"85086926457",,,"000542923100001","Atmos. meas. tech.","6","Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Understanding the mechanisms that control UTLS water vapor, as well as its long-term variation, is important for reliable projections of the evolution of the global climate system. However, these insights are currently limited by the lack of accurate, frequent, and comparable water vapor measurements in the UTLS. In this project, an open-path direct laser absorption spectrometer is developed, sufficiently small and lightweight to be deployed aboard of meteorological balloons. Its low weight (3.9 kg) and compactness (30 x 23 x 11 cm3) inherently reduces sources of contamination and allows flexible and frequent soundings. The instrument incorporates a quantum cascade laser as a rapidly tunable narrowband light source in the mid-infrared spectral region, where H2O exhibits strong absorption lines. To achieve enhanced robustness, while satisfying the stringent mass limitation, the optical and electronic concept is completely reconsidered with respect to laboratory-based spectrometers. This comprises the elaboration of a lightweight and compact multipass cell concept, called the segmented circular multipass cell (SC-MPC), which enables the reduction of the optical setup to its basic components only, i.e., the laser, the MPC, and the detector. Furthermore, the instrument incorporates custom-developed electronics for fast and power-saving laser driving, data-acquisition hardware based on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), dedicated software for controlling and monitoring, and a thermal stabilization system that suppresses the external temperature variation by almost four orders of magnitude. The spectrometer is a fully integrated, standalone system, operating autonomously for the duration of a balloon flight. The H2O concentration is retrieved by calibration-free evaluation of the spectral data, i.e., only relying on SI-traceable measurements and absorption line parameters provided by spectral databases. Laboratory-based characterization experiments demonstrate an agreement within 2% to a reference. In a first balloon-borne test campaign, the instrument was successfully deployed up to the UTLS in two consecutive flights. The comparison to CFH shows a mean deviation of 3%  in the troposphere. At higher altitude, accumulated humidity within the enclosure of the instrument currently leads to interference with the atmospheric absorption signal. Despite this restriction, the tests demonstrate the feasibility of spectroscopic water vapor measurements in the UTLS at an effective temporal resolution of 1 Hz during ascent and descent.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000429788",,,,,"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/429788","en","ETH Zurich","In Copyright - Non-Commercial Use Permitted","http://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-NC/1.0/",,"Balloon-borne Atmospheric Water Vapor Measurement by Laser Absorption Spectroscopy",,"Doctoral Thesis","Open access",,"DDC - DDC::5 - Science::550 - Earth sciences||DDC - DDC::5 - Science::530 - Physics",,"2020-08-03T13:27:55Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,"26662",,,,,,,,,,,"ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

It is the first time that an assessment of regional climate information using ensembles of both GCMs and RCMs at similar horizontal resolutions has been possible. The focus of the evaluation is on the distribution of daily precipitation at a 50 km scale under current climate conditions. Both the GCM and RCM ensembles are evaluated against high-quality gridded observations in terms of spatial resolution and station density. We show that both ensembles outperform GCMs from the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), which cannot capture the regional-scale precipitation distribution properly because of their coarse resolutions. PRIMAVERA GCMs generally simulate precipitation distributions within the range of EURO-CORDEX RCMs. Both ensembles perform better in summer and autumn in most European regions but tend to overestimate precipitation in winter and spring. PRIMAVERA shows improvements in the latter by reducing moderate-precipitation rate biases over central and western Europe. The spatial distribution of mean precipitation is also improved in PRIMAVERA. Finally, heavy precipitation simulated by PRIMAVERA agrees better with observations in most regions and seasons, while CORDEX overestimates precipitation extremes. However, uncertainty exists in the observations due to a potential undercatch error, especially during heavy-precipitation events.  The analyses also confirm previous findings that, although the spatial representation of precipitation is improved, the effect of increasing resolution from 50 to 12 km horizontal grid spacing in EURO-CORDEX daily precipitation distributions is, in comparison, small in most regions and seasons outside mountainous regions and coastal regions. Our results show that both high-resolution GCMs and CORDEX RCMs provide adequate information to end users at a 50 km scale.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000452646",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-13-5485-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/452646","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"European daily precipitation according to EURO-CORDEX regional climate models (RCMs) and high-resolution global climate models (GCMs) from the High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP)",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-11-24T07:22:01Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85096207217",,,"000592421000001","Geosci. model dev.","11","Geoscientific Model Development","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

We contrast two simulations from the interactive and specified chemistry (and thus ozone) versions of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, which is designed to isolate the impact of interactive ozone on polar vortex variability. In particular, we analyze the response with and without interactive chemistry to midwinter SSWs, March SSWs, and strong polar vortex events (SPVs). With interactive chemistry, the stratospheric polar vortex is stronger and more SPVs occur, but we find little effect on the frequency of midwinter SSWs. At the surface, interactive chemistry results in a pattern resembling a more negative North Atlantic Oscillation following midwinter SSWs but with little impact on the surface signatures of late winter SSWs and SPVs. These results suggest that including interactive ozone chemistry is important for representing North Atlantic and European winter climate variability.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000444929",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-10531-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/444929","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"The effect of interactive ozone chemistry on weak and strong stratospheric polar vortex events",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-10-07T14:15:23Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"The Overlooked Role of Stratospheric Ozone in forcing Northern Hemispheric climate (TORSO)","180043","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,"85091888839",,,"000571461600002","Atmos. chem. phys.","17","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Precipitation in simulations is systematically different from that in observations and reanalysis. Increasing horizontal resolution and including air–sea coupling improve simulated precipitation but cannot eliminate bias. Moisture sources of East Asian precipitation are identified using the Water Accounting Model (WAM-2layers) – a moisture tracking model that traces moisture source using collective information of evaporation, atmospheric moisture and circulation. Similar to precipitation, moisture sources in simulations are systematically different from that of ERA-Interim. Major differences in moisture sources include underestimated moisture contribution from tropical Indian Ocean and overestimate contribution from Eurasian continent. By increasing horizontal resolution, precipitation bias over the Tibetan Plateau is improved. From the moisture source point of view, this is achieved by reducing contribution from remote moisture source and enhancing local contribution over its eastern part. Although including air–sea coupling does not necessarily change East Asian precipitation, moisture sources show differences between coupled and atmosphere-only simulations. These differences in moisture sources indicate different types of models biases caused by surface flux or/and atmospheric circulation on different locations.

Specifically, the ice phase remains difficult to predict in mixed-phase clouds, where liquid water and ice co-exist. The formation of ice in these clouds originates from heterogeneous ice nucleation processes, of which immersion freezing is a dominant pathway. Among atmospheric surfaces capable of forming a template for ice, mineral dust, biological material and more recently organic matter are known to initiate freezing. To further our understanding of the role of organic matter in ice nucleation, we chose to investigate the ice nucleation (IN) ability of a specific subcomponent of atmospheric organic matter, the biopolymer lignin. Ice nucleation experiments were conducted in our custom-built freezing ice nuclei counter (FINC) to measure freezing temperatures in the immersion freezing mode. We find that lignin acts as an ice-active macromolecule at temperatures relevant for mixed-phase cloud processes (e.g. 50 % activated fraction up to −18.8 ∘C at 200 mg C L−1). Within a dilution series of lignin solutions, we observed a non-linear effect in freezing temperatures; the number of IN sites per milligram of carbon increased with decreasing lignin concentration. We attribute this change to a concentration-dependant aggregation of lignin in solution. We further investigated the effect of physicochemical treatments on lignin's IN activity, including experiments with sonication, heating and reaction with hydrogen peroxide. Only harsh conditions such as heating to 260 ∘C and addition of a mixture with a ratio of 1 : 750 of grams of lignin to millilitres of hydrogen peroxide were able to decrease lignin's IN activity to the instrument's background level. Next, photochemical and ozone bubbling experiments were conducted to test the effect of atmospheric processing on lignin's IN activity. We showed that this activity was not susceptible to changes under atmospherically relevant conditions, despite chemical changes observed by UV–Vis absorbance. Our results present lignin as a recalcitrant IN-active subcomponent of organic matter within, for example, biomass burning aerosols and brown carbon. They further contribute to the understanding of how soluble organic material in the atmosphere can nucleate ice.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000461830",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-14509-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/461830","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Lignin's ability to nucleate ice via immersion freezing and its stability towards physicochemical treatments and atmospheric processing",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2021-01-13T06:01:15Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Organic aerosols’ impact on aerosol-cloud interactions in mixed-phase clouds","179703","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Ambizione",,,,"85097410274",,,"000595071800002","Atmos. chem. phys.","23","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

INPs have often been collected at the Jungfraujoch research station (at 3500 m a.s.l.) in central Switzerland; yet spatially diverse data on INP occurrence in the Swiss Alps are scarce and remain uncharacterized. We address this scarcity through our Swiss alpine snow sample study which took place during the winter of 2018. We collected a total of 88 fallen snow samples across the Alps at 17 different locations and investigated the impact of altitude, terrain, time since last snowfall and depth on freezing temperatures. The INP concentrations were measured using the homebuilt DRoplet Ice Nuclei Counter Zurich (DRINCZ) and were then compared to spatial, temporal and physiochemical parameters. Boxplots of the freezing temperatures showed large variability in INP occurrence, even for samples collected 10 m apart on a plain and 1 m apart in depth. Furthermore, undiluted samples had cumulative INP concentrations ranging between 1 and 200 INP mL-1 of snowmelt over a temperature range of -5 to -19 oC. From this field-collected dataset, we parameterized the cumulative INP concentrations per m-3 of air as a function of temperature with the following equation c_air^* (T)=e^(-0.7T-7.05), comparing well with previously reported precipitation data presented in Petters and Wright, 2015.  When assuming (1) a snow precipitation origin of the INPs, (2) a cloud water content of 0.4 g m-3 and (3) a critical INP concentration for glaciation of 10 m-3, the majority of the snow precipitated from clouds with glaciation temperatures between -5 and -20 °C. Based on the observed variability in INP concentrations, we conclude that studies conducted at the high-altitude research station Jungfraujoch are representative for INP measurements in the Swiss Alps. Furthermore, the INP concentration estimates in precipitation allow us to extrapolate the concentrations to a frozen cloud fraction. Indeed, this approach for estimating the liquid water to ice ratio in mixed phase clouds compares well with aircraft measurements, ground-based lidar and satellite retrievals of frozen cloud fractions. In all, the generated parameterization for INP concentrations in snowmelt could help estimate cloud glaciation temperatures.","application/pdf||application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","10.3929/ethz-b-000387058",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-163-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/387058","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","Atmospheric chemistry||Ice nucleation||Mixed-phase cloud","Spatial and temporal variability in the ice-nucleating ability of alpine snowmelt and extension to cloud frozen fraction",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2019-12-22T21:35:43Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Organic aerosols’ impact on aerosol-cloud interactions in mixed-phase clouds||Elucidating Ice Nucleation Mechanisms Relevant to the Atmosphere: Is deposition nucleation really immersion freezing in pores?","179703||179703||179703||156581","10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711||10.13039/501100001711","SNF||SNF||SNF||SNF","Ambizione||Projekte MINT",,,,"85077907587",,,"000505679400001","Atmos. chem. phys.","1","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

While the ice-nucleation (IN) ability of some bacteria can be related to membrane-bound proteins with epitaxial fit to ice, little is known about the IN-active entities present in biological material in general. To elucidate the potential of proteins and viruses to contribute to the IN activity of biological material, we performed bulk freezing experiments with the newly developed drop freezing assay DRoplet Ice Nuclei Counter Zurich (DRINCZ), which allows the simultaneous cooling of 96 sample aliquots in a chilled ethanol bath. We performed a screening of common proteins, namely the iron storage protein ferritin and its iron-free counterpart apoferritin, the milk protein casein, the egg protein ovalbumin, two hydrophobins, and a yeast ice-binding protein, all of which revealed IN activity with active site densities > 0.1 mg−1 at −10 ∘C. The tobacco mosaic virus, a plant virus based on helically assembled proteins, also proved to be IN active with active site densities increasing from 100 mg−1 at −14 ∘C to 10 000 mg−1 at −20 ∘C. Among the screened proteins, the IN activity of horse spleen ferritin and apoferritin, which form cages of 24 co-assembled protein subunits, proved to be outstanding with active site densities > 10 mg−1 at −5 ∘C. Investigation of the pH dependence and heat resistance of the apoferritin sample confirmed the proteinaceous nature of its IN-active entities but excluded the correctly folded cage monomer as the IN-active species. A dilution series of apoferritin in water revealed two distinct freezing ranges, an upper one from −4 to −11 ∘C and a lower one from −11 to −21 ∘C. Dynamic light scattering measurements related the upper freezing range to ice-nucleating sites residing on aggregates and the lower freezing range to sites located on misfolded cage monomers or oligomers. The sites proved to persist during several freeze–thaw cycles performed with the same sample aliquots. Based on these results, IN activity seems to be a common feature of diverse proteins, irrespective of their function, but arising only rarely, most probably through defective folding or aggregation to structures that are IN active.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000408093",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-3291-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/408093","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Protein aggregates nucleate ice: The example of apoferritin",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-04-03T01:31:17Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"Elucidating Ice Nucleation Mechanisms Relevant to the Atmosphere: Is deposition nucleation really immersion freezing in pores?","156581","10.13039/501100001711","SNF","Projekte MINT",,,,"85082410025",,,"000521593900001","Atmos. chem. phys.","6","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, growing evidence suggests that NWL – and particularly nocturnal transpiration – represents a considerable fraction of the daily values. Here we provide a global overview of the characteristics of NWL based on latent heat flux estimates from the FLUXNET2015 dataset, as well as from simulations of global climate models. Eddy-covariance measurements at 99 sites indicate that NWL represents 6.3 % of total evapotranspiration on average. There are six sites where NWL is higher than 15 %; these sites comprise mountain forests with considerable NWL during winter that is related to snowy and windy conditions. Higher temperature, vapor pressure deficit, wind speed, soil moisture, and downward longwave radiation are related to higher NWL, although this is not consistent across all of the sites. On the other hand, the global multi-model mean of terrestrial NWL is 7.9 % of the total evapotranspiration. The spread of the model ensemble, however, is greater than 15.8 % over half of the land grid cells. Finally, NWL is projected to increase everywhere with an average of 1.8 %, although with a substantial inter-model spread. Changes in NWL contribute substantially to projected changes in total evapotranspiration. Overall, this study highlights the relevance of water loss during the night and opens avenues to explore its influence on the water cycle and the climate system under present and future conditions.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000404443",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-24-793-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/404443","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Terrestrial water loss at night: global relevance from observations and climate models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-03-12T02:22:04Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85080888411",,,"000516714800001","Hydrol.

In addition, the air pollutants ozone (O3) and particulate matter less than 2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5) are also radiatively active in the atmosphere and can influence Earth's climate. It is important to understand the effect of air quality and climate mitigation measures over the historical period and in different future scenarios to ascertain any impacts from air pollutants on both climate and human health. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) presents an opportunity to analyse the change in air pollutants simulated by the current generation of climate and Earth system models that include a representation of chemistry and aerosols (particulate matter). The shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) used within CMIP6 encompass a wide range of trajectories in precursor emissions and climate change, allowing for an improved analysis of future changes to air pollutants. Firstly, we conduct an evaluation of the available CMIP6 models against surface observations of O3 and PM2.5. CMIP6 models consistently overestimate observed surface O3 concentrations across most regions and in most seasons by up to 16 ppb, with a large diversity in simulated values over Northern Hemisphere continental regions. Conversely, observed surface PM2.5 concentrations are consistently underestimated in CMIP6 models by up to 10 µg m−3, particularly for the Northern Hemisphere winter months, with the largest model diversity near natural emission source regions. The biases in CMIP6 models when compared to observations of O3 and PM2.5 are similar to those found in previous studies. Over the historical period (1850–2014) large increases in both surface O3 and PM2.5 are simulated by the CMIP6 models across all regions, particularly over the mid to late 20th century, when anthropogenic emissions increase markedly. Large regional historical changes are simulated for both pollutants across East and South Asia with an annual mean increase of up to 40 ppb for O3 and 12 µg m−3 for PM2.5. In future scenarios containing strong air quality and climate mitigation measures (ssp126), annual mean concentrations of air pollutants are substantially reduced across all regions by up to 15 ppb for O3 and 12 µg m−3 for PM2.5. However, for scenarios that encompass weak action on mitigating climate and reducing air pollutant emissions (ssp370), annual mean increases in both surface O3 (up 10 ppb) and PM2.5 (up to 8 µg m−3) are simulated across most regions, although, for regions like North America and Europe small reductions in PM2.5 are simulated due to the regional reduction in precursor emissions in this scenario. A comparison of simulated regional changes in both surface O3 and PM2.5 from individual CMIP6 models highlights important regional differences due to the simulated interaction of aerosols, chemistry, climate and natural emission sources within models. The projection of regional air pollutant concentrations from the latest climate and Earth system models used within CMIP6 shows that the particular future trajectory of climate and air quality mitigation measures could have important consequences for regional air quality, human health and near-term climate. Differences between individual models emphasise the importance of understanding how future Earth system feedbacks influence natural emission sources, e.g. response of biogenic emissions under climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000457324",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-14547-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/457324","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Historical and future changes in air pollutants from CMIP6 models",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-12-20T03:39:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85097405431",,,"000595071800004","Atmos. chem. phys.","23","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

A prominent example is the doubling of the stratospheric ozone component at the Zugspitze summit station (2962 m a.s.l., Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany) between the mid-seventies and 2005, roughly from 11 to 23 ppb (43 %). Systematic efforts for identifying and quantifying this influence have been made since the late 1990s. Meanwhile, routine lidar measurements of ozone and water vapour carried out at Garmisch-Partenkirchen (German Alps) since 2007, combined with in situ and radiosonde data and trajectory calculations, have revealed that stratospheric intrusion layers are present on 84 % of the yearly measurement days. At Alpine summit stations the frequency of intrusions exhibits a seasonal cycle with a pronounced summer minimum that is reproduced by the lidar measurements. The summer minimum disappears if one looks at the free troposphere as a whole. The mid- and upper-tropospheric intrusion layers seem to be dominated by very long descent on up to hemispheric scale in an altitude range starting at about 4.5 km a.s.l. Without interfering air flows, these layers remain very dry, typically with RH ≤5 % at the centre of the intrusion. Pronounced ozone maxima observed above Garmisch-Partenkirchen have been mostly related to a stratospheric origin rather than to long-range transport from remote boundary layers. Our findings and results for other latitudes seem to support the idea of a rather high contribution of ozone import from the stratosphere to tropospheric ozone.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000391666",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-243-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/391666","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Very high stratospheric influence observed in the free troposphere over the northern Alps - just a local phenomenon?",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-18T03:12:50Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85077881375",,,"000505953600004","Atmos. chem. phys.","1","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

However, observed TOA fluxes are hard to estimate as they exhibit considerable variability in space and time that depend on the distributions of clouds, ozone (O3), water vapor (H2O), air temperature (Ta), and surface temperature (Ts). Benchmarking present-day fluxes and quantifying the relative influence of their drivers is the first step for estimating climate feedbacks from ozone radiative forcing and predicting radiative forcing evolution.  To that end, we constructed observational instantaneous radiative kernels (IRKs) under clear-sky conditions, representing the sensitivities of the TOA flux in the 9.6 µm ozone band to the vertical distribution of geophysical variables, including O3, H2O, Ta, and Ts based upon the Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) measurements. Applying these kernels to present-day simulations from the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI) project as compared to a 2006 reanalysis assimilating satellite observations, we show that the models have large differences in TOA flux, attributable to different geophysical variables. In particular, model simulations continue to diverge from observations in the tropics, as reported in previous studies of the Atmospheric Chemistry Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP) simulations. The principal culprits are tropical middle and upper tropospheric ozone followed by tropical lower tropospheric H2O. Five models out of the eight studied here have TOA flux biases exceeding 100 mW m−2 attributable to tropospheric ozone bias. Another set of five models have flux biases over 50 mW m−2 due to H2O. On the other hand, Ta radiative bias is negligible in all models (no more than 30 mW m−2). We found that the atmospheric component (AM3) of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) general circulation model and Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM) have the lowest TOA flux biases globally but are a result of cancellation of opposite biases due to different processes. Overall, the multi-model ensemble mean bias is −133±98  mW m−2, indicating that they are too atmospherically opaque due to trapping too much radiation in the atmosphere by overestimated tropical tropospheric O3 and H2O. Having too much O3 and H2O in the troposphere would have different impacts on the sensitivity of TOA flux to O3 and these competing effects add more uncertainties on the ozone radiative forcing. We find that the inter-model TOA outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) difference is well anti-correlated with their ozone band flux bias. This suggests that there is significant radiative compensation in the calculation of model outgoing longwave radiation.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000391765",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-281-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/391765","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Attribution of Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI) ozone radiative flux bias from satellites",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-19T22:18:23Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85077736672",,,"000506326400001","Atmos. chem. phys.","1","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCs) are derived identically from MODIS-COSP-simulated and MODIS-retrieved values of cloud optical depth and effective radius. For CDNC, the models capture the observed spatial distribution of higher values typically found near the coasts, downwind of the major continents, and lower values over the remote ocean and land areas. However, the COSP-simulated CDNC values are higher than those observed, whilst the direct model CDNC output is significantly lower than the MODIS-COSP diagnostics. NorESM produces large spatial biases for ice cloud properties and thick clouds over land. Despite having identical cloud modules, ECHAM-HAM and ECHAM-HAM-SALSA diverge in their representation of spatial and vertical distributions of clouds. From the spatial distributions of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol index (AI), we find that NorESM shows large biases for AOD over bright land surfaces, while discrepancies between ECHAM-HAM and ECHAM-HAM-SALSA can be observed mainly over oceans. Overall, the AIs from the different models are in good agreement globally, with higher negative biases in the Northern Hemisphere. We evaluate the aerosol–cloud interactions by computing the sensitivity parameter ACICDNC=dln(CDNC)/dln(AI) on a global scale. However, 1 year of data may be considered not enough to assess the similarity or dissimilarities of the models due to large temporal variability in cloud properties. This study shows how simulators facilitate the evaluation of cloud properties and expose model deficiencies, which are necessary steps to further improve the parameterisation in climate models.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000401199",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-1607-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/401199","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Evaluation of aerosol and cloud properties in three climate models using MODIS observations and its corresponding COSP simulator, as well as their application in aerosol-cloud interactions",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-02-22T04:27:05Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85079389644",,,"000514114700001","Atmos. chem. phys.","3","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

As a result, the reasons for variations in OH and the resulting methane lifetime (τCH4), both between models and in time, are difficult to diagnose. We apply a neural network (NN) approach to address this issue within a group of models that participated in the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI). Analysis of the historical specified dynamics simulations performed for CCMI indicates that the primary drivers of τCH4 differences among 10 models are the flux of UV light to the troposphere (indicated by the photolysis frequency JO1D), the mixing ratio of tropospheric ozone (O3), the abundance of nitrogen oxides (NOx≡NO+NO2), and details of the various chemical mechanisms that drive OH. Water vapour, carbon monoxide (CO), the ratio of NO:NOx, and formaldehyde (HCHO) explain moderate differences in τCH4, while isoprene, methane, the photolysis frequency of NO2 by visible light (JNO2), overhead ozone column, and temperature account for little to no model variation in τCH4. We also apply the NNs to analysis of temporal trends in OH from 1980 to 2015. All models that participated in the specified dynamics historical simulation for CCMI demonstrate a decline in τCH4 during the analysed timeframe. The significant contributors to this trend, in order of importance, are tropospheric O3, JO1D, NOx, and H2O, with CO also causing substantial interannual variability in OH burden. Finally, the identified trends in τCH4 are compared to calculated trends in the tropospheric mean OH concentration from previous work, based on analysis of observations. The comparison reveals a robust result for the effect of rising water vapour on OH and τCH4, imparting an increasing and decreasing trend of about 0.5 % decade−1, respectively. The responses due to NOx, ozone column, and temperature are also in reasonably good agreement between the two studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000399683",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-1341-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/399683","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"A machine learning examination of hydroxyl radical differences among model simulations for CCMI-1",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-02-15T09:24:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85079029570",,,,"Atmos. chem. phys.","3","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

Observation-based studies have typically found a smaller aerosol effective radiative forcing than in model simulations and were given preferential weighting in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). With their own sources of uncertainty, it is not clear that observation-based estimates are more reliable. Understanding the source of the model and observational differences is thus vital to reduce uncertainty in the impact of aerosols on the climate.  These reported discrepancies arise from the different methods of separating the components of aerosol forcing used in model and observational studies. Applying the observational decomposition to global climate model (GCM) output, the two different lines of evidence are surprisingly similar, with a much better agreement on the magnitude of aerosol impacts on cloud properties. Cloud adjustments remain a significant source of uncertainty, particularly for ice clouds. However, they are consistent with the uncertainty from observation-based methods, with the liquid water path adjustment usually enhancing the Twomey effect by less than 50 %. Depending on different sets of assumptions, this work suggests that model and observation-based estimates could be more equally weighted in future synthesis studies.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000396020",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-613-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/396020","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Surprising similarities in model and observational aerosol radiative forcing estimates",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-01-31T03:13:16Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85078317065",,,"000508190000005","Atmos. chem. phys.","1","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

They provide a framework to analyse moist processes on a range of timescales from large-scale moisture transport to cloud formation, precipitation and small-scale turbulent mixing. Laser spectrometric measurements on research vessels produce high-resolution time series of the variability of the water vapour isotopic composition in the marine boundary layer. In this study, we present a 5-month continuous time series of such ship-based measurements of δ2H and δ18O from the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) in the Atlantic and the Southern Ocean in the time period from November 2016 to April 2017. We analyse the drivers of meridional SWI variations in the marine boundary layer across diverse climate zones in the Atlantic and Southern Ocean using Lagrangian moisture source diagnostics and relate vertical SWI differences to near-surface wind speed and ocean surface state. The median values of δ18O, δ2H and deuterium excess during ACE decrease continuously from low to high latitudes. These meridional SWI distributions reflect climatic conditions at the measurement and moisture source locations, such as air temperature, specific humidity and relative humidity with respect to sea surface temperature. The SWI variability at a given latitude is highest in the extratropics and polar regions with decreasing values equatorwards. This meridional distribution of SWI variability is explained by the variability in moisture source locations and its associated environmental conditions as well as transport processes. The westward-located moisture sources of water vapour in the extratropics are highly variable in extent and latitude due to the frequent passage of cyclones and thus widen the range of encountered SWI values in the marine boundary layer. Moisture loss during transport further contributes to the high SWI variability in the extratropics. In the subtropics and tropics, persistent anticyclones lead to well-confined narrow easterly moisture source regions, which is reflected in the weak SWI variability in these regions. Thus, the expected range of SWI signals at a given latitude strongly depends on the large-scale circulation. Furthermore, the ACE SWI time series recorded at 8.0 and 13.5 m above the ocean surface provide estimates of vertical SWI gradients in the lowermost marine boundary layer. On average, the vertical gradients with height found during ACE are −0.1‰m−1 for δ18O, −0.5‰m−1 for δ2H and 0.3 ‰ m−1 for deuterium excess. Careful calibration and post-processing of the SWI data and a detailed uncertainty analysis provide a solid basis for the presented gradients. Using sea spray concentrations and sea state conditions, we show that the vertical SWI gradients are particularly large during high wind speed conditions with increased contribution of sea spray evaporation or during low wind speed conditions due to weak vertical turbulent mixing. Although further SWI measurements at a higher vertical resolution are required to validate these findings, the simultaneous SWI measurements at several heights during ACE show the potential of SWIs as tracers for vertical mixing and sea spray evaporation in the lowermost marine boundary layer.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000417466",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-5811-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/417466","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Meridional and vertical variations of the water vapour isotopic composition in the marine boundary layer over the Atlantic and Southern Ocean",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-05-30T03:15:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85085094617",,,"000535264700001","Atmos. chem. phys.","9","Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The models' capacity to characterise trends in annual maxima of 7 d streamflow at the continental and global scale is evaluated across 3666 river gauge locations over the period from 1971 to 2005, focusing on four aspects of trends: (i) mean, (ii) standard deviation, (iii) percentage of locations showing significant trends and (iv) spatial pattern. Compared to observed trends, simulated trends driven by observed climate forcing generally have a higher mean, lower spread and a similar percentage of locations showing significant trends. Models show a low to moderate capacity to simulate spatial patterns of historical trends, with approximately only from 12 % to 25 % of the spatial variance of observed trends across all gauge stations accounted for by the simulations. Interestingly, there are statistically significant differences between trends simulated by global hydrological models (GHMs) forced with observational climate and by those forced by bias-corrected climate model output during the historical period, suggesting the important role of the stochastic natural (decadal, inter-annual) climate variability. Significant differences were found in simulated flood trends when averaged only at gauged locations compared to those averaged across all simulated grid cells, highlighting the potential for bias toward well-observed regions in our understanding of changes in floods. Future climate projections (simulated under the RCP2.6 and RCP6.0 greenhouse gas concentration scenarios) suggest a potentially high level of change in individual regions, with up to 35 % of cells showing a statistically significant trend (increase or decrease; at 10 % significance level) and greater changes indicated for the higher concentration pathway. Importantly, the observed streamflow database under-samples the percentage of locations consistently projected with increased flood hazards under the RCP6.0 greenhouse gas concentration scenario by more than an order of magnitude (0.9 % compared to 11.7 %). This finding indicates a highly uncertain future for both flood-prone communities and decision makers in the context of climate change.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000410283",,"1027-5606||1607-7938",,"10.5194/hess-24-1543-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/410283","en","Copernicus","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Historical and future changes in global flood magnitude – evidence from a model-observation investigation",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-04-17T09:41:49Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,"European Climate Prediction System","776613","10.13039/501100000780","EC","H2020",,,,"85083031716",,,"000522844000002","Hydrol.

In part due to sparse observation data, the local mechanisms that lead to fog occurrence in the Namib are not yet fully understood, and to date, potential synoptic-scale controls have not been investigated. In this study, a recently established 14-year data set of satellite observations of fog and low clouds in the central Namib is analyzed in conjunction with reanalysis data in order to identify synoptic-scale patterns associated with fog and low-cloud variability in the central Namib during two seasons with different spatial fog occurrence patterns. It is found that during both seasons, mean sea level pressure and geopotential height at 500 hPa differ markedly between fog/low-cloud and clear days, with patterns indicating the presence of synoptic-scale disturbances on fog and low-cloud days. These regularly occurring disturbances increase the probability of fog and low-cloud occurrence in the central Namib in two main ways: (1) an anomalously dry free troposphere in the coastal region of the Namib leads to stronger longwave cooling of the marine boundary layer, increasing low-cloud cover, especially over the ocean where the anomaly is strongest; (2) local wind systems are modulated, leading to an onshore anomaly of marine boundary-layer air masses. This is consistent with air mass back trajectories and a principal component analysis of spatial wind patterns that point to advected marine boundary-layer air masses on fog and low-cloud days, whereas subsiding continental air masses dominate on clear days. Large-scale free-tropospheric moisture transport into southern Africa seems to be a key factor modulating the onshore advection of marine boundary-layer air masses during April, May, and June, as the associated increase in greenhouse gas warming and thus surface heating are observed to contribute to a continental heat low anomaly. A statistical model is trained to discriminate between fog/low-cloud and clear days based on information on large-scale dynamics. The model accurately predicts fog and low-cloud days, illustrating the importance of large-scale pressure modulation and advective processes. It can be concluded that regional fog in the Namib is predominantly of an advective nature and that fog and low-cloud cover is effectively maintained by increased cloud-top radiative cooling. Seasonally different manifestations of synoptic-scale disturbances act to modify its day-to-day variability and the balance of mechanisms leading to its formation and maintenance. The results are the basis for a new conceptual model of the synoptic-scale mechanisms that control fog and low-cloud variability in the Namib Desert and will guide future studies of coastal fog regimes.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000409224",,"1680-7375||1680-7367",,"10.5194/acp-20-3415-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/409224","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Synoptic-scale controls of fog and low-cloud variability in the Namib Desert",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-04-10T01:32:36Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85082573609",,,"000521942400001","Atmos. chem. phys.",,"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","20","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.

The new scheme is able to consistently simulate three regimes of stratiform clouds – liquid, mixed-, and ice-phase (cirrus) clouds – considering the activation of aerosol particles to form cloud droplets and the nucleation of ice crystals. In the cirrus regime, it allows for the competition between homogeneous and heterogeneous freezing for the available supersaturated water vapor, taking into account different types of ice-nucleating particles, whose specific ice-nucleating properties can be flexibly varied in the model setup. The new model configuration is tuned to find the optimal set of parameters that minimizes the model deviations with respect to observations. A detailed evaluation is also performed comparing the model results for standard cloud and radiation variables with a comprehensive set of observations from satellite retrievals and in situ measurements. The performance of EMAC-MADE3 in this new coupled configuration is in line with similar global coupled models and with other global aerosol models featuring ice cloud parameterizations. Some remaining discrepancies, namely a high positive bias in liquid water path in the Northern Hemisphere and overestimated (underestimated) cloud droplet number concentrations over the tropical oceans (in the extratropical regions), which are both a common problem in these kinds of models, need to be taken into account in future applications of the model. To further demonstrate the readiness of the new model system for application studies, an estimate of the anthropogenic aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) is provided, showing that EMAC-MADE3 simulates a relatively strong aerosol-induced cooling but within the range reported in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments.","application/pdf","10.3929/ethz-b-000410306",,"1991-9603||1991-959X",,"10.5194/gmd-13-1635-2020","http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11850/410306","en","Copernicus Publications","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",,"Coupling aerosols to (cirrus) clouds in the global EMAC-MADE3 aerosol–climate model",,"Journal Article","Open access",,,,"2020-04-17T09:55:31Z",,,,,,"yes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"85083012355",,,"000593770700001","Geosci. model dev.","3","Geoscientific Model Development","13","ETH Zürich::00002 - ETH Zürich::00012 - Lehre und Forschung::00007 - Departemente::02350 - Dep.
